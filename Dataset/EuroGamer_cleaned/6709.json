This Is Football 2003 is a big            step forward for Sony's London studio, ramping up the realism and            tweaking the gameplay, but does it have the legs to outpace and            challenge relentless attacks from Konami, EA and others?        With the exception of                 Championship Manager and its ilk, TIF 2003 is probably the                 most comprehensive football game on the market. The names of                 more than 14,000 real players line the backs of shirts in                 dressing rooms across the game world, and many players have                 been accurately modelled for close-ups. This authenticity is                 thanks to the FIFPro license, which leaves only the stubborn                 Dutch with made-up names. Nearly 700 teams are present,                 including every major national side and a handful of lower                 division clubs from England, Spain and Italy. So even if                 you're a Pompey supporter, you'll find your boys brushing                 shoulders with the Arsenals, Liverpools and Manchester Uniteds                 of the world.                    There are several modes of play; full seasons, cup competitions,            custom leagues and career, where you get to take the reigns of a            schoolboy team through pint-sized competitions and upwards towards            semi and full professional seasons. Of these, season modes are            probably the most involving - you can take control of any team you            like, then buy and sell players using an initial kitty of one            million quid, building a team and benefiting from larger gate            receipts and other perks as they improve their standing.                    TIF even lets you create your own team, although this will            undoubtedly prove too long-winded for some. Still, those with a bit            of creative flair can assemble a legion of crack troops under a            custom name and custom manager, and endow them with customised            stats, even altering physical and facial attributes to fit the            vision.                    In fact, TIF's only off-pitch flaw is that transfers are never            knocked back - Zidane would play for Wolves if the price was right,            which isn't too realistic. However, my list of positives is            significantly larger - the aforementioned LMA-esque transfer engine            is otherwise superb, the menu interface is easy to use and suitably            explanative, you can fiddle with just about any pre-game setting,            from the strictness of the referee to the time of day, and once            you're good enough, you can opt for ~challenge~ mode, which rates            your performance over 90 minutes (or rather, between 4 and 10) and            gives you a password to enter into the official world rankings            website. Even the menu music is funky, foot-tapping stuff. So far,            so good.        On the pitch, many will look upon This Is Football 2003 as            Sony's attempted retort to Konami's masterful Pro Evolution Soccer,            but really it's an unjust comparison. The two games are            immeasurably different - TIF cherishes instant accessibility and            glorious finishing, whilst Pro Evo places an emphasis on tactics,            attention to detail and careful build-up play. Finding a scoring            opportunity in Pro Evo is 90 percent of the game, whereas TIF hands            you opening after opening on a grassy platter, and lets you write            your own ticket from thereon.                    Previous TIFs were rightly criticized for their reliance on            end-to-end gameplay, with no real middle ground. TIF 2003 though is            a marked improvement, with its traditionally accessible and arcadey            gameplay integrating a fast-paced and relatively smooth passing            game this time around amongst other things.                    From the first kick to the last throw-in, TIF 2003 is a very            good-looking game. Player animations are extremely detailed, and            facial detail is at an all-time high, even if the hair doesn't flap            around in the wind. Significant players like David Beckham are            unmistakable, although some, like Michael Owen, look as though            their faces have been mapped to the wrong skull. It's nice little            graphical touches which give TIF its glossiness though, like the            way you can see the players' breath on the air during a wintry            encounter.        Other improvements include the little cut scenes which                 follow nasty tackles, and these are refreshingly quick to get                 to the point (or rather, the colour of the card) when compared                 to Pro Evo's. Camerawork is on the whole okay, although the                 perspective on the optimal view sometimes makes it difficult                 to get a handle on players on the far touchline. Give it a                 goal though and the multi-angle replays show off the TV-level                 presentation. Perhaps in TIF 2004 though we can control them                 ourselves? Pretty please?                    The presentation is capped off by some superb commentary by Peter            Drury. Well, perhaps his lines aren't the best, and his tendency to            yell player names whenever they move within batting distance of the            sticks is irritating, but his output almost always matches the            gameplay and Sony has managed to give him more than enough lines to            keep a match going without too much repetition.                    The controls are effectively those of Pro Evo with shoot and long            pass reversed, although as with previous TIFs, you can make your            players perform deliberate and highly dangerous fouls in moments of            madness, and even dive over an opposing defender's outstretched leg            to the tune of a free kick if you can time it right.        Unfortunately though, the gameplay is a touch too simplistic.            It lacks the intricacy of Pro Evo, and takes too much of the            football into its own hands. The various individual aspects don't            really gel together into a fluid whole, either. You can use L1 and            L2 to perform shimmies, but passing is too rigid, and if you resort            to one-touch football the pitch starts to resemble a pinball table.            And although you can bring the keeper rushing out to intercept the            ball, CPU keepers have a tendency to turn around and peg it if they            can't get to you first, or simply hug their line to the very last,            resulting in some quite boring one-on-one encounters which result            in a shot five yards from the goal, which either goes in or            doesn't.                    That's probably TIF's chief flaw on the pitch - scoring is more            about luck than skill. The ball sticks to the feet of the attacker            until he hammers the circle button, unleashing a fearsome shot from            whatever position or angle he happens to be in, and it almost            uniformly bends through the air in the direction of a corner. The            keeper either taps it wide, or he doesn't. Scoring in any given            game can be high or low on account of this, even if the weight of            chances suggests a monumental result.                    Fortunately, the AI puts up a reasonable fight, even on the default            difficulty level. It's very easy to carve your way through the            opposing defence and craft a chance, but the AI is equally capable            of scything through your midfield, splitting the defence asunder            and giving you some serious competition. Indeed, it's the AI more            than the goalscoring which injects excitement into an encounter -            however artificial, having to pull yourself back from a goal down            three times in a simulated 90 minutes is very engaging and, if you            pull it off, rewarding. Should the whole thing go to penalties, the            system for taking those is as good as any other, too. Hold the shot            button down until the cursor lands on the optimum power bar            position, then point the stick and fire.                    This Is Football 2003 is never going to frighten Pro Evolution            Soccer in its current guise, but as its own game of arcade            football, it's accessible and absorbing albeit rather forced            entertainment. It's a game for people who want to play football,            score magnificent goals and undertake historical comebacks without            having to tear their hair out over getting the ball past the            halfway line, and on that basis, it comes highly recommended."}
