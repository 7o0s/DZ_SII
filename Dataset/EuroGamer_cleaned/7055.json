Made on a budget of just $15,000, using the team's friends            and families as its stars, it went on to become the most successful            Belgian film ever made. And with good reason...                    Man Bites Dog is a dark comedy following a group of Belgian film            students (strangely enough) who are making a documentary about a            local serial killer, played by co-director Benoit Poelvoorde. The            three man film crew follows the amiable one man crime wave around            everywhere, and the entire movie is seen through their camera. But            their role isn't just to passively record events, and although at            first they are merely disembodied voices, as the movie goes on they            emerge from behind the camera to become more and more a part of the            action themselves.                    Gradually they are sucked into Benoit's savage acts of violence,            helping to dispose of bodies in the local reservoir, chasing a            child through the woods, and sharing the loot after robbing an old            lady's apartment. ~There's plenty for all~, Benoit says, handing a            wad of cash to producer Remy. ~I know you're filming on a            shoestring budget.~                    At times things get downright disturbing, and the brutal and            uncompromising violence is sure to offend many. And yet between the            gruesome murders it's a strangely charming and at times hilarious            movie, which parodies our growing obsession with ~fly on the wall~            documentaries and real life drama.                    When he's not busy explaining the finer points of how to ballast            corpses so that they don't float to the surface when they            decompose, Benoit gives his opinions on urban renewal projects,            spouts poetry, plays classical music on the piano, and introduces            the camera crew to his family and friends. For him killing and            robbing is just another career, one which he takes great pride in,            and he is perfectly at ease describing his methods and explaining            his actions to the camera as if he were talking about a regular            nine-to-five job. On the surface he seems almost normal, and it is            easy to forget that he's a homicidal maniac.                    And that's the movie's genius. Like the camera crew you get sucked            into Ben's strange world, and come to accept the muggings,            robberies and murders as part of it. The mundane way in which the            crimes are presented can be both surreal and funny, and the            interludes of normality only serve to heighten this sense of            unreality. Although it is shocking at first, you soon become numbed            to the almost constant violence, and it's only as the camera crew            become involved in Benoit's crimes and the violence gets ever more            brutal that you are shaken out of the trance and the tension starts            to mount.                    Like any self-respecting European art-house flick, Man Bites Dog is            shot entirely in grainy black and white. It's certainly a very            stylish movie, and manages to capture the documentary feel            perfectly, from the long moody shots, muffled voices and shaky            camera work to the deadpan manner in which Benoit talks about his            crimes.                    The use of the camera crew as characters in their own right is used            to great effect in many of the scenes as well. At one point they            become seperated in an abandoned factory, and Benoit's voice echoes            in the distance as he stands right in front of the camera, shouting            at the top of his voice to the sound man, who is holding the boom            on the stairs far below. Pure genius. In another scene Benoit            replays footage of a failed attempt to mug a postman (~I usually            start the month with a postman~), jogging the film backward and            forward in slow motion as he analyses what went wrong.                    Man Bites Dog is not for everyone, and certainly if you're easily            offended you should avoid this one like the plague. The violence is            both frequent and graphic, although the overall tone of the movie            is somewhat tongue in cheek. But like ~Natural Born Killers~,            focusing on the killer is missing the point - the film is really            about the camera crew and their growing involvement in his crimes.            Man Bites Dog manages to be thought provoking, disturbing and            incredibly funny all at once, and is highly recommended for those            with a strong stomach.                    First impressions of the DVD itself weren't good. For some reason            it wouldn't play correctly in my Pioneer DVD-Rom drive, grinding to            a halt after playing the copyright warning and Tartan Video            animation without managing to load the menu. In the end I managed            to get to the menu by using the keypad to skip to the appropriate            part of the disc.                    Otherwise the disc was faultless though, and the picture and sound            quality were as good as could be expected from a low budget black            and white movie. The movie is presented in the original 1 : 1.66            aspect ratio, and the dialog is French, with English subtitles for            the rest of us. Although it's the uncut European version, this is a            Region 0 disc which should work on any DVD player regardless of            where you live.                    A stills gallery and scene selection menu are included as extras,            as well as a scrolling text ~film review~, which gives some            background on the movie and its creation, as well as its reception            at the Cannes Film Festival (where it won three awards). There's            even a short film by the same team called ~Pas de C4 Pour Daniel            Daniel~, which is an amusing and utterly surreal piece done in the            style of an extended movie trailer.                    All in all a solid if unremarkable DVD. Well worth getting,            especially if you don't have the film on video already.
