Far more than the transient glare I thought it            was when I first played it, it took some weeks before I removed the            CD from the drive tray and played something else.                         Yet for some reason I find myself looking upon its sequel            disparagingly. After all, the concept of racing around a city with            so-called ~absolute freedom~ is now nothing to get particularly            excited about. Far from providing denouement, Midtown 2 is            dispassionate on the whole, but momentarily fulfilling.                         Is it a worthy sequel to Midtown Madness? And moreover, is it            worthy of you \u00a330? On balance I'd say yes, you should buy this            game. After so many serious driving titles in the offing and on our            plates already this year, a bit of town-hopping furore is precisely            what's needed!                         Unfortunately Midtown 2 isn't going to light your fire quite like            its predecessor did. In terms of sheer excitement and intensity it            will; every bump and turn is enough to get your juices flowing, but            sadly there was never going to be anything that could be done to            equal the impact of Midtown, so instead of reinventing the wheel,            Microsoft and Angel Studios have chosen to reinvigorate it, with            two new locations and a whole host of new challenges. But            thankfully, by retaining its feel and composure, this sequel does            enough to keep even the most diehard fan happy.                    This time around you've got two gigantic cities instead of just the            one. Both San Francisco and London are included, complete with all            the familiar landmarks. Of course the gameplay is recognizable to            anyone who has ever played Midtown (and if you haven't.. well you            do own a PC, right?), but in the unlikely instance that you're a            newcomer, the Cruise Mode is there for your kind and indeed            old-hands alike who feel the need to brush up on the game's            Hollywood physics.                         As you start taking on the Checkpoint, Circuit and Blitz races,            and a new addition to the series, Crash Course challenges, there's            a continual progression and of course appropriate rewards for your            efforts, with new vehicles and challenges. Some of the cars that            are locked at the beginning are incredible fun and well worth            aspiring to reveal.                         The cars at your disposal from the off can be grouped by            performance. Some are sluggish but indestructible whilst others are            nippy medium runners. There are a few that move swiftly but            practically fall apart when so much as the wing mirror is clipped,            and later on you come across a few that are good all rounders.            Sadly though, because most all you need to win at Midtown is a bit            of daredevil attitude and some caution, the middle class cars are            the only option, leaving the others in relative obscurity.                         The aforementioned Crash Courses are new to the game. They are            tough, feverish challenges which while short-lived stack up and            provide infuriatingly addictive gameplay. The winding back streets            of London and the number of parked cars within them makes for some            intense action at high speeds, and the never-say-die cops with            their high performance vehicles in San Francisco tearing around            after you do likewise.                    The engine enhancements consist of a longer view into the distance            and nicer textures on the other vehicles, but to use an old adage,            if it ain't broke.. don't fix it! Sadly the multiplayer problems            are also still inherent, with lag occurring even over a local area            network, so playing on the Internet is still a joke. As has been            shown in the past by games like GTA, enormous real-time worlds like            this can be hard to sustain without enormous amounts of data            passing between the computers involved, but there has to be a way            of making this work somehow.                         Often computer cars and player cars appear in the wrong place, and            there are other little inconsistencies between where things seem to            be on one machine and where they are on another. Unfortunately            there's little to be done about this, and I dare say it will make            multiplayer intolerable for people used to a steady, smooth gaming            experience.                         The engine isn't the only area that could use some work; the audio            accompaniment is downright unpleasant at times as well. The sound            effects are as they were before, but unlike our crazy Chicago            commentator from the original, Midtown 2's clich\u00e9d group of            wannabes are ambiguous to say the least. Stateside you get a hippy            and a gangster and Londoners can look forward to a Scot and a            thug.. there's a lot more in-game commentary than before, but I            would have thought local radio personalities would have made better            choices. What we have are just loose associations.                    Fundamentally, one of Midtown Madness 2's biggest faults is that it            lacks a coherent structure. There's nothing to tie it all together.            You race therefore you are? Had we seen a properly structured            single player game instead of unrelated tasks held together under            the banner of ~separate~ modes, it might have been easier to            recommend this to owners of the original.                         The London Cabbie Academy might have been a good idea (if a rather            despairing one), but it's not even put to any real use. On the            whole you play Midtown Madness 2 and you always have something new            and varied to do, but eventually you grow tired of the pick-a-door            tasks and lose interest. Don't get me wrong; it's an enjoyable,            exciting and occasionally emotional piece of software (evidence: my            cracked keyboard), but it could have done with something to meld it            all together into a whole.                         That said, there's nothing quite as entertaining as smashing            headlong into police car and watching it roll over and over before            ploughing into something else. The challenge, variety and intensity            is there, and that's what most people will remember.                    It looks good, feels good, plays good and has enough to keep you            occupied for a good long while. Midtown Madness 2 is one of those            games that needs to be played. It's not without its gripes - it            locked up on me several times during our brief relationship, and            I'm not a big fan of its commentary, but once it has you in its            grip it won't let you go until you've utterly exhausted it, and            vice versa, and that should be enough for anyone."}
