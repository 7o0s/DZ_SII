For a year or so, it was to be a beautiful union, but that's another story.Emerging at a time when the horizontal scrolling shooter was the hottest genre in gaming, Sanxion had a look and feel not dissimilar to many games of the era trailing in the wake of the wondrous Uridium. So, bass relief effects? Check. Waves after wave of spinning enemy ships to blast to bits? Check. Incredible loading screen music by Rob Hubbard? Check. Really bloody tough unless you play it repeatedly and memorise enemy attack patterns? Double check.What was perhaps noteworthy about Sanxion revisiting it all these years later is the way it splits the screen horizontally into two, with an overhead view occupying the top 20 per cent, and the rest given over to the usual side-on viewpoint. Although it looked a bit pointless (and restricted the main play area), it did allow Fasoulas to throw in a few neat tricks, such as  showing you attack formations as well as advance warning on the sneaky rear-side attacks.Although Sanxion doesn't stand up nearly as well as Uridium does these days, it was still a real highlight of the C64's growing love-affair with shooters. If you're a twitch shooter junkie, this is a game you have to play at some stage."}
