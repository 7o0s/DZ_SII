Who would have imagined that barely            two months later that situation could be reversed?                    Jet Riders is a perky little handheld jet ski racing game, with            just as much emphasis on technique, stunts and lap times as making            it round the tracks in one piece. The main focus of the game is the            Jet Masters mode, which gives you the choice of three characters -            the sexy pink lycra-clad Kayla Devlin, the muscular Elvis Montana            and the shadowy Brad Danziger - and splits the world map into three            main locations.                         The player starts off in ~Bondi Breeze~ on the southern coast of            Australia, with a close-up map of the region revealing just one            flagged Training area. After picking a jet ski from those on offer            (six will be available to unlock in total), the player has to            complete three challenges, which introduce the throttle, moving            left and right without turning by using the shoulder buttons, and            combining this with steering and simple barrel roll tricks.                         Steering is handled by the directional pad and the A button is            your accelerator, but the shoulder buttons control several vital            functions. Apart from leaning (or strafing) left and right, players            can jump off ramps and perform the aforementioned barrel rolls            using one or other of the shoulder buttons, and your jet ski            accrues boost as it passes red and blue buoys on the correct side,            which can be tapped by holding both shoulder buttons together to            increase your speed and often propel you to the front of the pack.            Going too fast though can mean losing vital seconds getting your            craft into shape as you hit a corner.                    Each successfully completed challenge rewards the player with a            star, and the more stars you win, the more areas become available,            with flags waving on the main map screen to highlight new            challenges. Stunt areas test your ability to roll and rotate your            craft in mid-air (without wiping out and losing vital seconds, of            course), and also introduce you to the peculiar grinding technique,            which sees riders leaping off a ramp onto what looks like a giant            log and holding A to grind like the Birdman Tony Hawk\u2026                         Time trial challenges, race circuits and stunt challenges pop up            as you gain more stars, and eventually the player unlocks the next            section of the game, which heralds yet more challenges in new            environments. There are said to be 21 tracks included in the full            game, and no doubt a greater variety of tricks than those we            uncovered with our preview code. Finally, Bits have included a            four-player linkup mode which can be played using one cart -            probably the easiest way to our hearts.                         Graphically, Jet Riders resembles the speedboat levels of classic            16-bit overhead racer Micro Machines 2, but there's a generous            amount of detail hidden beneath the surface. Boats rotate in            mid-air and turn smoothly, and the scrolling is extremely nice as            well. The overhead view is about the right distance from the craft            to let you see the track ahead, while still letting you take in the            picture of bubbling and frothing water, the animated shoreline with            water lapping at sandy beaches, and buoys bobbing up and down as            you speed past them. In fact, you can practically submerge them as            you turn at speed and kick up enormous waves.                    Bits Studios seems to have delivered a pretty decent jet ski game            under the most absurd of constraints, with detailed visuals, plenty            to do and a multiplayer mode to boot, all of which bodes well for            Jet Riders' eventual release. The game is due out in time for the            summer, and we're informed that a publisher will be announced            shortly. But in the meantime, it's a game of wake-and-sea. Sorry,            wait-and-see. Water on the brain and all that. [You're fired - Ed]"}
