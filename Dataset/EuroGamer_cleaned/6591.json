Between Monkey Ball            Junior and Sonic Advance 2, we don't want for too much else. So            it's going to take some effort to squeeze another game in - unless            it lives up to the exceedingly high quality of the developer's            other recent releases. Over to you, Sega\u2026        Oops, Sega Rally            looks absolutely dire by modern standards. We're making this clear            from the outset because it's the most obvious thing about the game,            and we're not going to harp on encouragingly about the good bits            before slaying the game at the last turn. Not on account of the            visuals, anyway. This is because Sega Rosso deserves more than a            bit of sympathy - the Japanese developer has made a brave attempt            to squash the physical feel of Sega Rally into a GBA cart, and has            vaguely managed it, but at the expense of a reasonable level of            graphical detail. Put next to InfogramesNotAtari's V-Rally 3, the            game engine is a low-res, pixellated and frequently glitchy pile of            nonsense. It looks like a low-end NES port of Outrun, and as ever            the directional pad seems to rotate the scenery rather than the            car, which squirms around on the spot in the bottom-middle of the            screen.                    Head to the options screen and turn on the first-person view though            and things are infinitely better. The game moves at roughly the            same speed (and in all honesty looks largely identical from this            'alternate' viewpoint, but without the wriggly car model the            overall effect is much better). Sure, the scenery looks like Duplo            bricks (not even Lego is this chunky, folks), the track texturing            is very weak (in the desert levels, the track and the sidelines are            almost too difficult to pick apart, especially on a standard GBA),            and the overabundance of ever-smiling sprites can be unpleasant            (everything from spectators, trees and buildings to the other            cars), but it whizzes past at a nice speed, has the good old psycho            pace notes-reading co-driver, and from the first person view you            pick up more of the feel that Sega Rosso has worked into            play.        The actual driving            is split into three distinct modes; Championship, Time Trial and            Multiplayer, but instead of unlocking tracks sequentially like            Every Other Rally Game Ever, Sega Rally has you fighting to earn            the game's currency, Rally Points, which you can then spend on            unlocking pretty much whatever you like - the next championship            mode, better vehicles, time trial tracks, some bizarre mini-games            (coin-collecting?) and even artwork. Which we still don't see the            attraction of - just why would you waste vital RP on static            pictures to look at once and then put out of your mind for the rest            of eternity? No, we really want to know. Why do developers keep            doing this on the GBA?                    Still, there are several championships to unlock, each comprising            four tracks, and a multiple-cart multiplayer mode. We weren't able            to test this on account of a lack of spare carts, but we can            imagine it's quite good fun. Then again, it should be            single-cartridge, because Sega Rally isn't the sort of triple-A            title which everyone is going to own. And it will have known that            when it was making it. However, the Time Trial mode is made all the            more interesting thanks to the addition of an Internet Ranking            mode. You can't plug the GBA into your mobile phone or anything,            but thanks to a clever password/email system set up on the            Sega Rally            website, you can see your best times on the web and strive for            the top of the chart. We're embarrassingly low on there, which is            why we're not going to tell you the alias we used. Ha.                    Sega Rally is obviously well put together in terms of the number of            challenges it offers you, and it does play rather like its Saturn            predecessor when you throw it into first-person mode - with every            bump, gyration and wheelspin accentuated aurally and visually - but            we were rather taken aback by how easy it is. We're not quite sure            what we were doing wrong (or especially right), but despite            bouncing off walls regularly (which is an occupational hazard if            you can't pick the road out from the scenery), we quickly unlocked            most of the tracks and cars, and polished off the various            championships. Indeed, we breezed through most of them first time            round, but unlike V-Rally 3, which was also very easy for the most            part, we didn't enjoy it too much. V-Rally 3 may have glitches and            the same Outrun-style engine mechanics, but it's more fun            than Sega Rally, and that's a shame, because otherwise this has all            the trappings of an excellent rally game.
