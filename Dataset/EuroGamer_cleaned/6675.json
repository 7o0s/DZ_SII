It was something about hell, the moon, possibly a            couple of moons... and a marine who went in and killed everything.            The end. They just don't make them like that any more. These days            we all seem to want the digital War & Peace with production            values to frighten James Cameron, and even DOOM III is starting to            look like a bad night round Stephen King's campfire.        Serious Sam is a return to            traditional values. There is a plot, but it's nothing but window            dressing. The only evidence of it is a few lines in the manual and            an opening cinematic, which sees aliens stomping all over an urban            cityscape as Sam takes them on, before, outnumbered, he bolts            through time to Ancient Egypt to sabotage the invaders' society in            its infancy. Although you're questing towards various amulets,            elements and so on, the ultimate goal is just to destroy            everything, navigate simple tombs and deserts - lapping up            power-ups and increased firepower on the way - and kill            increasingly enormous boss enemies. The two PC Serious Sam titles            encompassed 36 levels of virtually non-stop blasting, and all of            that has been squashed onto one Xbox DVD. And then some.                    For the Xbox release, developer Croteam has once again resorted to            traditional values; this time embracing a simple lives structure,            high scores and regular save points to make console owners feel            more at home. What's more, each level has been split up and            reweighted to keep the load times down, and the addition of            split-screen multiplayer allows you to continue co-oping and            deathmatching to your heart's content.                    We had expected a few changes to the formula of course, but the            extent of Croteam's efforts on this humble ~Xbox port~ is quite            surprising. To begin with, the menus have been given a reworking.            Sam now stands swaying proudly on the title screen, occasionally            tapping the inside of the screen as if to say ~get on with it~, as            you input your name, choose a player model for multiplay and elect            to invert the Y axis, etc. From thenceforth it's obvious that            Serious Sam Xbox is a labour of love - a compendium of Croteam's            efforts over the last few years - and as a mindless shooter it's a            spectacular success.        Because Sam on the PC was built on a pretty simple FPS template            - non-stop action, constant quick saving and lots of level            restarting - Croteam has opted to change the way those aspects work            in order to better fit the console market. Instead of quick saving            every few paces, players must now conserve their health and ammo            and work their way between save points, which take the shape of red            telephone boxes which vanish into the ground once used. Phone boxes            are spaced out nicely and you rarely feel the challenge between one            and the next is too hefty.                    What's more, Croteam has introduced a points system. Throughout the            game you gain points for topping your enemies or collecting hidden            cash bags, and you can further increase your score by taking out            several enemies with one shot. So when faced with a pair of leaping            skeleton death rider nasties, it sometimes pays to let them gang up            on you, squeezing the right trigger at the last minute to pop their            clogs together. Fortunately, this is about as intellectual as Sam            gets. A high score is important, because at the end of each level            your points are totted up and extra lives are awarded, but apart            from uncovering hidden power-ups, blasting the living (and            unliving) crap out of your enemies and doing it in a timely manner,            there isn't much to think about.                    That's not to say Sam isn't engaging - quite the opposite, in fact.            It's a well-paced first person shooter with only one thing on its            mind. There's no need to worry about missing doorways, clues or            solving puzzles, the only thing you need concern yourself with is            killing everything in sight. Level design varies from tight,            claustrophobic environments (where every shadow is menacing and            enemies pour from the walls) to the more frequent outside areas            which have you racing across the desert (pursued by screaming            suicide bombers, enormous, horned ~werebulls~ and 20-foot            mechanical turkeys) and through courtyards, the lens flare            occasionally obscuring your view of the prey.        Despite            its simplicity, Sam makes expert use of both graphics and sound.            It's sort of like a cross between Unreal Championship and a cartoon            - it's nowhere near as beautiful as UC, but it's neatly detailed            and solid looking, despite the vividly coloured, rolling desert            vistas and sand script-covered ancient ruins. The use of lighting            won't worry Splinter Cell, but the lens flare is pretty and the            shadowy tombs - whether real-time or not - are filled with lurking            horrors.                    Enemies aren't terribly detailed - in fact, many are just            man-shaped with different T-shirts and projectiles - but the            behaviour of the rushing werebull, which will scare the crap out of            you the first time you see it charging your way, the leaping frogs            which appear in their hundreds and have you on a manic,            shotgun-toting backpedal, and the green blob-spitting four-armed            minotaurs, amongst many, many other memorable adversaries will            certainly keep you occupied. It would be easy to highlight the            repetition in enemy behaviour and level design, but even an ardent            cynic like us quickly forgets all about them. As we charged through            endless tombs, collecting elements and battling minigun-packing            giant scorpions, the words ~bit of repetition there, ho hum~ were            gleefully absent from our lips...                    And though we do continue to applaud Sam's carefree blasting, it            would be nothing without the directional sound. DD 5.1 is            incredibly important here, because although the chief aural            elements - the battle music, which kicks in whenever a threat is            close by, and the constant low growls of enemies - are a good            indicator of trouble, you really need to hear which direction the            headless, screaming bombermen are coming from. I've tried playing            the game without 5.1 but hearing the sound of a suicide bomber get            closer as you stare in disbelief at an almost empty health bar,            whilst simultaneously having no clue whatsoever as to where the            enemy is, is one of the most frightening things we've experienced            since the fiend first appeared on E1M2 of Quake.                    Speaking of Quake, its one great adversary was Duke Nukem, and some            of Sam's one-liners are gold dust the likes of which only Duke (and            of course Bruce Campbell) can rival.        Perhaps the best thing about Serious Sam though is just how            pristine it is. It's a very, very polished game. Everything,            from the customisable, Halo-ish control system (two sticks in            conjunction to move, face buttons switch weapons, left trigger            jump, right trigger fire, yadda yadda) and the new scoring/lives            system to the way the Netricsa data assistant has been included to            update you on new enemies and level information, has been lovingly            installed.                    No, actually, sod that, the best thing about Serious Sam has to be            the multiplayer options. Although it's painfully sad to see a lack            of Xbox Live support during the service's infancy, multiplayer,            split-screen deathmatch is hectic fun - much like Halo, except            virtually every gun could wipe out a planet - and the addition of            co-operative mode is an inspired choice. Almost as inspired as the            System Link option, which allows four players to co-operate, two on            each Xbox.        Seriously though, our only qualms here are a lack of            widescreen and Live support, and the fact that after 36 levels of            very much the same thing, you might just find yourself tiring.            Presentation, conversion, graphics, sound, gameplay, longevity - it            gets everything else right. It's the best Xbox port to date and the            sort of game you can pick up for an hour from any point in the            game, whenever you want, and still enjoy it. PC owners with both            games under their belt won't find much to interest them, and short            of a personality transplant nothing is going to endear this to the            anti-FPS brigade, but then this was never about them - instead,            what we have is a serious argument for the sequel appearing            on Xbox exclusively, marked down only slightly for its repetition            and lack of Live support.                    Seriously worth considering [arf, do you see what he did there? -            Ed].
