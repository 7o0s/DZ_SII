{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-morrowind", "date": "8 Jun 2002", "game_name": "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind", "text": "The wait is finally over. Morrowind, probably the most eagerly            anticipated PC role-playing game this side of Baldur's Gate II, has            arrived in Europe. And although it has its flaws, it's still an            entertaining, addictive and time consuming game.                        As Morrowind begins, all you know is that you are a criminal,            released by Imperial decree for reasons unknown and sent to serve            an agent on the island of Vvardenfell. Getting off the boat that            has carried you there serves as a quick in-game tutorial, showing            you how to move and look around, and interact with objects and            people. Even more ingenious is the way in which your character is            created by answering an Imperial census official's questions once            you reach land, sidestepping the usual dice rolling that most            role-playing games thrive on. Depending on your tastes you can            choose from a range of player races, appearances and preset            character classes, or you can create your own custom class by            selecting the skills you want to focus on. You can even let the            computer determine what kind of character you want to play based on            your responses to a series of Voigt-Kampff style questions (~you            chance upon a strange animal, its leg trapped in a hunter's            clawsnare~).                        Whatever your initial choices, you can still develop any of your            skills by using them repeatedly or by paying a trainer. Your            speciality skills rise more rapidly as you practice them, and also            contribute to your overall experience level, but there's nothing to            stop you improving your other skills if you decide part way through            the game that your barbarian warrior really needs to be able to            speak in coherent sentences to get a better reaction from people.            More leeway is given by the levelling system, which allows you to            increase any three of your eight primary stats every time you go up            a level. So if you decide that your manners and personal hygiene            aren't all they could be, you can gradually improve your            personality score as your character advances.                    Although Morrowind has a central storyline to follow, with core            missions and objectives to complete, there are countless side            quests along the way. Stray characters can be found wandering            around in the wilderness in need of help, and several factions are            represented in the towns you visit, from noble houses and the            Imperial Legion to guilds for mages, thieves, fighters and even            assassins. Once again the game offers you complete freedom to do            what you want; there's nothing to stop you from joining several            factions, as long as you meet their membership requirements.                        Once you've signed up, each faction will be able to give you dozens            of jobs to carry out, ranging from simply delivering a parcel to            someone on the other side of town to killing rivals, collecting            overdue fees and acquiring valuable objects. All of these tasks,            along with important clues and snippets of conversations, are            dumped into your journal. This should be the perfect way to keep            track of what you're doing at any given time, but there's no real            search system and no way to mark off the jobs you've already            completed. By the time you finish the game your journal will sprawl            across at least a couple of hundred pages, making it almost            impossible to find the details of a specific job unless you keep a            list the old fashioned way, with pen and paper.                        As you develop the appropriate skills and complete tasks for a            faction your rank and reputation with them will increase, and the            more a character likes you, the cheaper they will offer their goods            and services. If you want to shortcut this, you can also bribe,            flatter, taunt and intimidate people to achieve your ends. This            system isn't without it's faults though, the most obvious of which            is the criminal system. Get spotted stealing something or launching            an unprovoked attack and your crime will be reported, causing the            city guard to chase you around. When you get caught you have a            choice of paying a fine (equal to the value of the goods stolen, or            around 1000 gold for murders), resisting arrest (utterly futile and            liable to get you killed) or doing hard labour (which can sharply            reduce your skills). Bizarrely though, if you get caught and pay            your fine your reputation won't be damaged, but if you talk to a            character while you're a wanted man your standing with them will            drop sharply. Nobody seems to care if you killed a man or stole the            entire contents of a shop, as long as you paid a couple of thousand            gold pieces to get the guards off your back. Which is perhaps            lucky, because occasionally the barter system breaks down and the            computer decides that you've stolen back one of the items you just            sold, leading to a small fine and a slap on the wrists.                    When you're not fighting the law, there's a wide array of weird and            wonderful monsters to kill. Morrowind is home to the usual humans,            elves and orcs, but there are also more outlandish creatures such            as giant flying jellyfish-like animals that dangle stingers beneath            them, and the main mode of transport on Vvardenfell is a giant            insect-like beast called a silt strider. Pay the rider the            appropriate fee and he will take you to a distant town, saving you            the hassle of running all the way on foot.                        Combat itself is fairly clumsy and repetitive. All you have to do            is hold down the mouse button to power up your attack and then            release it to take a swipe at whatever you're facing. Sometimes the            computer gets confused and hits a different target though, which            can lead to friendly fire incidents and failed missions if you're            fighting alongside another character. You do get a choice of            slashing, swinging or stabbing your foe, moving the mouse forwards            to stab or sideways to slash, but this is utterly pointless in            practice. There's an optimum way to use each weapon, and it's the            same for every monster, regardless of size and armour. Your best            bet is just to enable the ~always use best attack~ option in the            menu and leave it at that.                        The AI can cause problems as well, with creatures sometimes getting            stuck on trees, steep terrain and sharp corners. When this happens            they have an unnerving tendency to twitch wildly and make sudden            unexpected turns, which looks stupid and makes ranged combat a lot            less effective than it perhaps should be. In confined areas the            opposite is true, as sometimes a creature will get completely            stuck, leaving you free to rain arrows on them from a safe distance            for a minute or two before they get free. Luckily combat is usually            fairly fast and furious, so fighting is more of a distraction than            a major part of the game.                    It's not just the creatures of Vvardenfell that look strange and            alien, the landscape itself is beautiful and bizarre in equal            measures. Huge mountains tower above you, trees grow alongside            giant mushrooms and sharp rocks rise out of the ground. Towns vary            from your stereotypical half-timbered medieval village to a cluster            of tents in the desert or buildings made out of giant insect            shells.                        The graphics are amongst the best we've seen in a role-playing game            to date, but all of this visual splendour has a price. Playing the            game on a 32Mb graphics card (the minimum system requirement) is a            painful and fog-shrouded experience, and even on a top of the range            system with the draw distance set to maximum there is a worrying            amount of scenery pop-up on the horizon. On misty days this isn't a            big issue, but the sight of an entire building or mountain            appearing out of a clear blue sky is disconcerting, and brings back            memories of the Ultima Ascension fiasco. And as you look around,            objects on the horizon fade in and out of view, because apparently            the part of the world which the game draws isn't a perfect sphere            centered on your character's head.                        The game also suffers from a few bugs, the most annoying of which            is the fact that the longer you play Morrowind, the longer it takes            to exit the game and return to Windows. The first time this            happened I thought the game had locked up, but if you leave it for            a few minutes it does eventually manage to shut itself down and            return you to the desktop. A rather more sudden return to Windows            occurs when the game crashes, which thankfully has only happened a            handful of times in a week of solid play. It's a pain when it does            happen, but as long as you save frequently it shouldn't be a big            problem. Other bugs are less obvious, such as a problem with the            auto-mapping system which sometimes causes the game to forget to            fill in areas you've visited on the local map. Overall though the            game is relatively stable and bug-free, and certainly a big            improvement on previous entries in the Elder Scrolls series.                    Despite its flaws - over-ambitious graphics, dull combat and a            poorly thought out journal - Morrowind is still well worth a look            if you have the hardware to handle it. Having spent countless hours            on the game in the last week, large sections of the island remain            unexplored and many of the optional side quests and faction jobs            have yet to be unlocked. Even when you have finished the game,            there's still plenty of scope to go back and try again with a            radically different character, to join a different set of factions,            or to explore every nook and cranny of the ancient ruins that are            scattered across the island.                        Morrowind is role-playing on a truly epic scale, with an involving            if mostly predictable storyline, hundreds of characters to talk to,            dozens of tasks to carry out and several square miles of terrain to            explore. If you want to lose yourself for a few months, Vvardenfell            could be your holiday destination of choice."}
