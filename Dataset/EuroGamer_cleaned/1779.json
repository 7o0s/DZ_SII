{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/shadowcompany", "date": "4 Dec 2012", "game_name": "Shadow Company", "text": "Following in the footsteps of hits like Rainbow 6 and                 Delta Force, Shadow Company is the latest of what I'm sure                 will be a long line of real-time military strategy/action                 games, now that it is ~cool~ to play cooperatively.                    You take control of a small team of mercenaries and covertly crawl            around various hot-spots around the world with one mission - blow            lots of stuff up!                    The amazing graphics are without a doubt the first thing that            stands out - the rolling hills, choppy seas and burning camp fires            represent some of the best graphics seen to date in a game of this            type.                    Add to this the highly detailed characters and excellent animations            and you know that this game has the goods in the visual department.                    And then you rotate it. And zoom in, and tilt your view point, all            in one smooth sweeping move. Sweeeeet. No longer do your soldiers            disappear behind trees or buildings only to emerge on the other            side looking like swiss cheese. You simply spin around and follow            their every movement.         There are nine missions,                 exploring the darker side of places like Angola, Ecuador, Peru                 and Russia.                    Nine missions might not sound like much, but they are rather            difficult and can take several hours each (and then only thanks to            the Quick Save). It might have been better to have a few more            missions and a slightly flatter learning curve...                    A typical mission involves killing off the guards, infiltrating an            enemy facility, blowing something up, and getting out in one piece.            Missions are varied by changing the time of day, rescuing a            hostage, or recovering a weapons stash.                    One thing you notice early on is just how true to life this game            is. Almost anything that you would want to do in Real Life works a            treat in Shadow Company.                    Hide in a ditch to avoid detection - sure. Create a diversion and            attack from behind - no problem.                    It's the little things that put the icing on the cake - changing            into civilian clothing to walk undetected through an occupied town,            or using wirecutters to breach perimeter fences and gain            unchallenged entry into an enemy facility.                    If you find yourself running low on ammo you can search dead            soldiers for weapons, ammo and tools. This really adds to the            atmosphere, as you progress from a humble knife to an Uzi to a            whopping great AK-47.         This is all well and good, but                 as it stands the game code is far from perfect. There are                 bugs, and lots of them.                    And we're not talking small bugs here. Blokes get stuck in walls            and are unable to continue the mission, and the AI is also very hit            and miss. You can shoot an enemy guard, and his mate standing right            next to him doesn't even move.                    The annoying thing is that it isn't anything that couldn't have            been fixed if the game had been kept in beta testing for a few more            weeks. And I'm sure there will be a patch that should resolve (most            of) these bugs, but that's not the point.                    Why couldn't they have got it right the first time?         There are a number of fantastic features in Shadow                 Company though that make it worth playing despite the bugs.                    The array of weapons at your disposal is phenomenal - 24 guns from            the humble Beretta 9mm handgun, through an array of German            sub-machine guns and Israeli assault rifles, to rocket and grenade            launchers. There are even two different types of sniper rifle.                    Fashion accessories are also plentiful - night vision goggles,            camouflage, spy cameras, grenades, Kevlar armour, and C4            explosives... Everything a budding Rambo would want.                    You even have the ability to commandeer nearby vehicles, allowing            you to cover long distances quickly, drive your team to safety,            cross bridges, or enjoy some Carmageddon-style action if you are            low on ammo.                    Choose from boats, trucks, tanks, snow mobiles, and even an old            school bus...                         Multiplayer action is as enjoyable as other games in this                 genre - each human player can control a single soldier as part                 of a crack team, or they can each lead a small group of                 mercenaries for a simultaneous attack.                    The only trap is that your funding is limited (at least until you            complete a few missions), and each player gets an even share to            spend on squad members and equipment alike. Spend wisely.                    Also worth a special mention is the audio. Developers are finally            realising that eye-candy alone is not enough, and that top-notch            audio can really immerse the player in the game environment.                    The ambient sounds in Shadow Company are excellent, ranging from            the crashing of waves or the insects buzzing in the long grass.                    Highlights include the chatter from your own squad mates, with            classics like ~It it bleeds, we can kill it!~ And enemies react to            any sounds you make, shouting ~Who's there?~                    It all adds to the atmosphere, and these small touches throughout            the game show that the developers Sinister have tried to make            Shadow Company as realistic as they can.                    Shadow Company is a great game with genre-breaking graphics, loads            of atmosphere, and topnotch multiplayer action.                    The sound is excellent, and non-linear missions and large maps make            for long-lasting gameplay and should keep both strategists and            action-hungry players satisfied.                    Unfortunately it is dogged by some rudimentary bugs, and iffy AI.            Release Date - available now        1. Alone in the Angolan wilderness, your team of three            mercenaries have a mission to accomplish. The first objective is to            secure the base perimeter. Use a knife for a silent kill so you            don't attract the attention of the other guards.        2. A few well-place 9mm rounds secures the base, so your            next task is to eliminate the Northern Patrols. Use the            line-of-sight to hide ready for an ambush! There are usually a            number of ways to complete an objective - Land Mine, Grenade, or            full frontal AK-47 assault.        3. Scrounge whatever weaponry you can get from the dead            patrolmen and move on to the Outpost. Again, use line-of-sight to            hide your men behind the slope. Lob in a grenade then move in to            clear up the mess.        4. The final objective in Level 1 is to take out the SAM            sites to allow the Evac chopper to land safely. A direct assault is            out of the question, as your team is out numbered 2 to 1. Stealth            is paramount, as the enemy are holding high-ground and have good            visibility.                    My favourite is to crawl in under their noses and blow the SAMs            with a grenade. The blast will kill most of the guards, but may            harm you too, so GET YOUR MAN OUT!        5. Pick up as much ammo and weapons as you can carry,            because you can use them in the next mission, or sell them for            cash.
