It was an intriguing idea, a racing            game on hoverboards, but it turned out to be a pretty uninspiring            and soulless affair (and took about an hour to finish -Ed).            Now, some two-and-a-bit years later, Criterion have taken the idea            that could easily have been inspired by Back to the Future Part II            and fused it with their lucrative middleware engine, Renderware, to            bring us something far more interesting.                         The focus of Airblade's single-player game is placed on the story            mode. Our hero, Ethan, has come into possession of a hoverboard            prototype that was being worked on by one of his shady cohorts.            Attempting to get their grubby mitts on this prototype is the GCP            Corporation, and having taken Ethan and his partner in crime Kat's            best mate hostage, the kids set out on a quest to thwart their evil            megaglobal domination-type plans and well and truly .. ahem ..            ~stick it to the man~.                         What follows is a floaty jaunt around six sprawling levels,            attempting to achieve objectives provided by Kat via intercom. The            objectives range from taking out GCP guards by hurtling towards            them and performing a trick on their face, to flinging your hapless            boarder impressively into the air to break searchlights. Why he            couldn't just use a rock or something is beyond me...                    Controlling Ethan is at first more tricky than you would            anticipate. Having cut my teeth on games that utilise forms of            transport that are affected by friction, such as that of our old            pal Tony Hawk, Ethan's floating plank felt strange and slippery to            me at first. The initial training mode helps overcome this however,            and before long the control system feels remarkably intuitive, and            it's possible to produce some impressive moves despite its            simplicity, including the daring feat of swinging from poles and            somersaulting into the air by grabbing onto horizontal bars.                         You don't have to charge up your ollies to jump higher, which            takes some getting used to. Instead, performing tricks will fill up            a ~boost meter~ in the corner of the screen, and you can use this            boost via R2 to jump higher and glide further. This can also be            utilised to hurtle across the ground at an amazing speed, which is            especially handy as the time limit on some of the levels can be            overly strict.                         The gameplay is a significant nod towards the playing style of Jet            Set Radio, and to a lesser extent the Tony Hawk's series. As            objectives are given to you, an arrow at the top of the screen            points you in the general direction of your target, but it's up to            you to decide how you're going to get there. This can often end up            as an exercise in frustration, as the level designers rarely offer            decent visual clues as to where you might need to be going. For            example, on the first city street level the final objective is to            gain access to the roof of a building by grinding along the broken            pylon, and the only information you get is ~Use the broken pylon to            get up there~ and an arrow pointing up. Handy.                    Encouraging the player to explore the levels and find the best            routes wouldn't be so bad if failure wasn't such a huge setback. I            can deal with falling from a rooftop a few times in an attempt to            make a grind, but falling from a rooftop a few times until your            time runs out and then having to perform all the previous            objectives all over again is an unwelcome chore, and arguably the            reason that Jet Set Radio lost its charm so quickly.                         It's because of this linearity that Airblade shoots itself in the            foot. You are mostly forced to perform tasks in a specific order,            and this rids the story mode of the freedom that makes Tony Hawk so            engaging. This hits home as quite a shame, because Criterion have            produced a game with a lot of potential and to trip up on such a            trivial matter seems a stupid mistake to make.                         Elsewhere, the game is peppered with the usual extras we've come            to expect from this kind of title. There are freestyle and score            attack modes, which offer a limited diversion from the main            storyline, and there's also a fairly good split screen multiplayer            mode. Of particular note is the Ribbon Tag game, where players            chase each other about the environments trying to grab the            gradually lengthening police tape being dragged along behind the            player like the puppy in the Andrex advert.                    Presentation-wise, there really aren't many complaints. The engine            is perfectly capable of delivering nicely detailed and convincing            areas to leap about in, and the textures and spot effects are good,            if unremarkable. Character animation is also good, and Ethan            flinging his board about and performing all kinds of            gravity-defying acrobatics is pleasantly convincing.                         The sound is less satisfying than the visuals, though. Voice            acting both in-game and throughout the cut-scenes between levels is            just annoying. Ethan careers about screeching ~You wanna piece of            me?!~ with Keanu Reeves' irritating nasal whine, and the cast of            security guards and villains leaves a fair amount to be desired,            even for a game that's obviously not taking itself too seriously.                         In all, Airblade is a promising concept ruined by some lazy level            design and infuriating linearity. It may be worth Criterion giving            the franchise another chance should they take note of the game's            shortcomings, as it could have been a brilliant diversion from the            glut of skating titles we're forced to put up with. It makes a nice            demonstration of Renderware's capabilities, but as a game, well,            better luck next time?"}
