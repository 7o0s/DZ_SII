But            then came a string of duds and disappointments, second rate            spin-offs released to cash in on the over-hyped new movie The            Phantom Menace. And so today the arrival of a new Star Wars game is            met with a mixture of dread and morbid curiosity.                    The latest such release is Star Wars : Battle For Naboo. A            fast-paced arcade-style shooter featuring seven vehicles to pilot,            ranging from land speeders to star fighters, this is a Rogue            Squadron for the Phantom Menace generation. As Lieutenant Gavyn            Sykes of the Royal Naboo Security Forces you must battle your way            through fifteen missions, freeing prisoners, escorting vehicles,            defending Naboo farms from Trade Federation raiders and generally            mopping up the mess left behind after Queen Amidala buggered off to            Coruscant to plead for help from the Senate.                    There's nothing particularly complex or subtle about the game. The            controls are simple once you get used to them, particularly if you            have a gamepad or joystick to hand, and most of the missions simply            boil down to blasting the hell out of every red dot that pops up on            your radar scope. There's even a handy orange triangle that shows            you which direction your next objective is in, although in a couple            of missions the developers seem to have forgotten to use this.                    Alarm bells began to ring though when I realised this is            essentially the same Battle For Naboo that was released on the N64            late last year. The menu system is designed for use with a gamepad,            right down to the arcade-style wheel for selecting your three            letter name, and sadly the rest of the game shows about as much            effort in adapting it for the PC.                    Battle for Naboo pushed Nintendo's antique console to the limits in            terms of graphics, but compared to most modern PC games it is still            unattractive. The terrain is expansive but not particularly            detailed, and invisible barriers are used to keep you within the            playing area in some missions. The vehicle models are reasonably            good, but people and droids look more like cardboard cut-outs than            characters - your pilot is made out of two flat sprites arranged at            right angles to give an illusion of depth. Surface vehicles don't            explode so much as gradually sink into the ground, and special            effects in general are disappointing.                    The only concession to the vastly increased horsepower which is            available in our beige boxes seems to be an increase in the draw            distance compared to the N64 version, although enemies frequently            appear out of thin air and there is still scenery pop-up evident on            a few of the larger levels. There isn't even any fogging to mask            this problem - mountains simply appear on the horizon as you move            towards them. On a five year old console this might be considered            acceptable, but on a high spec PC it just looks plain silly. Add to            this the hideous MIDI renditions of John Williams' orchestral score            and poor voice acting, and you have a package which looks and            sounds dated.                    But the biggest problem that Battle For Naboo suffers from is that            it is just too short. There are fifteen missions, but they only            take five or ten minutes each to complete, and only a few offer any            real challenge. I had reached the final mission within three hours,            and the hardest part was actually hitting anything - you have to            score a direct hit for a shot to register, and with everyone            zipping around you at high speed this is trickier than it sounds,            especially as your laser shots move rather slowly.                    It's fun while it lasts, but sadly that isn't very long, and with a            \u00a330 price tag, no multiplayer support and little reason to go            back and play through the campaign a second time, Battle For Naboo            is terrible value for money. For the same price you can pick up the            entire Star Wars trilogy on video - it lasts twice as long as this            game and is more likely to get played again..."}
