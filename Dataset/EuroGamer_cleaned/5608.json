Nakith, God                 of Nights, broke a cardinal rule of the pact by spawning                 another God .. Ska, God of Darkness. Nakith pleaded his case                 to the council, but they voted against him.                    The vote was a narrow one, with Nakith having many friends amongst            the members of the council. As a result the council split into two            factions, and proceeded to rage war upon one-another. [ Um .. are            you sure you're not talking about the Labour Party's election for            their candidate for London mayor here? - Ed. ]                    The war eventually broke out from the heavens and on to the once            peaceful world of Ur. Very soon factions among the inhabitants            formed as they pledged allegiance to different Gods, and as a last            callous act souls were cast into Anserak, the God K'Varr's version            of hell. Chained, with fire licking around them, the souls were            destined to remain until he decided they could pass on to paradise.                    One such soul, Locke D'Averam, looks up through fire singed eyes to            see a robed figure walking towards him. A human with arms raised. A            blinding light.                    So the adventure begins...         Revenant is an RPG and an                 adventure game rolled into one. Your task is to guide Locke                 through the massive world of Ahkuilon, in which you have been                 resurrected, starting the game with nothing but your bare                 fists and a loincloth to protect your modesty!                    Tendrik, the ruler of Ahkuilon, has instructed his mystic advisor            Sardok to bring forth the Revenant to perform a small quest for            him. Locke is to locate and rescue Tendrik's daughter, exacting            great vengeance upon her captors at the same time. You are given a            sword and three spell runes to set you on your way.                    You will soon discover that you will need more than a loin cloth            and a butter knife to survive in the violent and lonely world of            the Revenant though...         As you progress                 through the intricate story unfolding around you, you will                 find additional runes, potions and scrolls.                    The scrolls will either hold useful information or spell lists. The            spell list will tell you what level you need to be to have the            ability to cast a given spell, as well as what combination of runes            you need to be able to memorise it.                    The number of spells and their diversity is very impressive, and            quite overwhelming. Equally mind boggling is the sheer volume of            weapons, armour and other items you can pick up throughout the            game.                    Tell me you're not impressed when you finally get to cast            Armageddon at level 8! Awesome!         Yes, Revenant is a                 sight to behold. Right from the opening FMV your eyes feast                 upon wonderfully textured graphics and atmospheric                 illuminations. Some of the scenes, the caves in particular,                 are really quite inspired in their presentation.                    Spell effects are given the full treatment - there are some truly            amazing effects, such as blue whirlwinds lashing their way towards            your enemy and golden maelstroms destroying everything in it's            vicinity.                    Character animation is of pretty average quality though, and really            could have been improved upon. However, the actual detail of the            character models for Locke and company is very good.                    The sounds accompanying each swing of a weapon, and the sounds of            battle, are all superbly done as well, and all complemented nicely            by non-intrusive and appropriate music. Where the sound department            is let down though is in the absolutely atrocious accents used in            the dialogue, and just generally bad voice acting. To be honest,            I'd have preferred it if Cinematix had left it text only...         Of course, no RPG                 would be complete without it's bestiary, and Revenant                 certainly doesn't skimp in this department either.                    Things start off harmlessly enough, with small spiders and bigger            ones that will poison you. Locke's way of dealing with the small            Arakna is to stamp on them in the most vile fashion!                    Druhg also plague the perimeters of the town of Misthaven where you            begin. These are little imp-like creatures that are very agile, but            easy to kill. Further into the game things get more difficult            though, with the incredibly tough Dragons, Ninjas (ahem, yes!),            Monks, Priests, and a whole plethora of foes to deal with.                    My biggest gripe with Revenant though is the random creature            spawning. I prefer to play a game where once something is dead ..            it stays dead! Too often you can be low on health having just slain            a dragon, only to back track and find another one waiting for you.                         Revenant is good, but could have been a whole heap better. It                 is purely let down by a few things you simply can't ignore.                    Firstly you cannot change the video resolution, stuck with a measly            640x480 for the entire duration. Graphics as rich as those present            in Revenant really deserve to be viewed at the optimum resolution            your machine can muster.                    Secondly, and my main criticism of the game, are the extremely bad            voice-overs. On screen you get what is being said in text, but you            also have it read out to you too. Locke himself sounds like he's            got haemorrhoid problems, and some of the other voices would sound            more at home in a Monty Python sketch!                    Ther are other niggles too - the random spawns of the enemy get            very wearing after a while, and there are far too many times when a            piece of scenery looks accessible but isn't.                    All in all though it's an entertaining game that is sure to have            you playing for many hours, as it is truly massive! But for those            few irritating points this could well have been a corker. Instead            it's a good-to-look-at stopgap until the next big RPG comes along.
