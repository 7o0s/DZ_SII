Your characters (for there are six of them) are            members of an elite group set to bring about the downfall of the            evil General Viggo. Having done this once already the great General            took the added precaution this time of kidnapping the our furry            heroes' families, and obviously your job in FF is to rescue them            from his clutches and prevent him taking over the world. Simple!                         As if controlling a furry special forces team weren't surreal            enough, the world you wander around is occupied with lots of other            talking animals, and they seem to catch a stray bullet with            startling frequency. At one point I was awaiting a young enemy            fellow as he emerged from a port-a-loo and one of my bullets            whistled past his head and impacted on the skull of a hopping bunny            that just so happened to be coming on-screen at the time. Ah well,            you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs.                         Despite the fact that in a Machiavellian, subconscious way you're            taking out your frustrations with the shape of childrens'            television on these poor animals, you do actually find yourself            trying to avoid doing it after a while. Perhaps there ought to be            more games than encourage humanity rather than destruction..            (Get out of my sight -Ed)             But anyway, off you run into the big bright world outside to            rescue your chums and kin.                    The gameplay takes the shape of a puzzle and shooty action in equal            segments, or at least it would if the game didn't spoil the puzzles            for you at every turn. The problem is that you are being guided by            a chap called General Bristol. Well, I say ~guided~, but actually            his role is rather perplexing. He's expected to explain the story            to you at junctures and show slightly confused players how to            finish up puzzles, but rather annoyingly, whenever you go near him            he spouts off with one or the other.                         As such if you come across a puzzle - even a fairly simple one            you'll be able to solve - and accidentally bump into the General,            the chances are he won't so much offer you a clue as actually tell            you the solution. The game gives you mixed signals like this all            the time; the humour is decidedly adult, yet the game's insistence            on ~guiding~ you makes it a walkover.                         You don't have to talk to Bristol, but you ought to if you            want the storyline. The other annoying thing is that you can't skip            what he's saying either, so you either have to work out he's            offering you a solution to the puzzle and take your eye off the            screen for about five seconds or you have to grin and bear it.            Neither is terribly attractive.                    Fur Fighters' visuals are very impressive throughout - the            characters do look furry thanks to the superb textures, and that's            an effect even Hollywood has trouble pulling off. It's viewed            through a third person perspective, something that's worked quite a            few times in the past on the Dreamcast (MDK2 is a good example),            but sadly FF developers Bizarre haven't caught onto how best to            present it. I've lost count of the amount of times when I've made a            simple jump and fallen to the ground hopelessly due to the position            of the camera.                         Although the camera is rather awful, the presentation is otherwise            sublime. For example the switching between characters is almost            seamless, which has to be a plus. The animation is quite            remarkable, even on non-player characters. Fur Fighters captures            the feel of a cartoon world surprisingly well, which helps to            accentuate the humorous aspects.                         With lots of humour, action and puzzles, FF will take some twenty            of so hours to complete the first time through, and thanks to the            multitude of different characters at your behest, there's plenty of            longevity. In fact, although fairly linear on the whole, the wealth            of different weapons and characters to suit each situation means            that quite often you can approach one position from many angles and            still come through unscathed!                    Although the single player is unquestionably where most of the            creative seed has been sewn, Fur Fighters is an action game and no            action game would be complete without some form of multiplayer            mode. ~Fluffmatch~ isn't as deep as the multiplayer modes seen in            Nintendo's Goldeneye-but-a-bit-better Perfect Dark or Unreal            Tournament, but it's decently complementary to the single player            action.                         While not exemplary, Fur Fighters' level design both here and in            the single player game is very strong throughout. The layout varies            drastically from map to map and consistently high framerate helps..            there's even the option of a first person perspective for this            mode, which really puts the cat amongst the pigeons. Although the            first person mode is entertaining and important for the twitch-kill            style of play in multiplayer (after all the weapons can be            devastating), you kind of wonder if it would have been fun to make            it an option in the single player. The Dreamcast has scant few            options for FPS fans as it is, and this would have added another            selling point to an already impressive game, and reduced the            problem with the camera. Alas.                         Unfortunately due to time constraints or something similar there's            nothing more for the communal player. Options like Capture the Flag            and Teamplay would no doubt have added to the already strong            multiplayer but it was not to be. Perhaps for the sequel, then,            should Bizarre choose the produce one.                    Ultimately Fur Fighters is a fast and furious action game that            suffers at times due to its own interest in speeding up. General            Bristol's ~helpful~ tips dumb down the puzzle aspect of the            adventure and take some of the fun out of the hands of the player,            and coupled with the stodginess of the storyline make the General            into little more than excess baggage.. It must be said however that            there's a lot of style and finesse involved in FF, but with a            little more time, tweaking of the camera and perhaps some more            multiplayer options it could have been something even more            revolutionary."}
