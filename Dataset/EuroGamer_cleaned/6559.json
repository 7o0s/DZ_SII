But World War II role-playing games? Now there's something you don't see every day. We give you, Another War.            Inspired by everything from Allo Allo to Indiana Jones, and            sporting references to the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Casablanca            along the way, Another War is a game which doesn't always take            itself entirely seriously. Humorous dialogue, sarcastic asides from            your own hero, and some characters who only seem to be there to act            as comic relief all give a welcome break from what could have been            a decidely depressing affair.                        As the game begins you roll into a small village in occupied France            to meet with your friend, an antiques dealer who has become            suspicious of the origins of some of the objects he's being asked            to appraise for a Nazi client. Before long there's talk of a            mysterious map showing the way to some undefined object which            nobody should find, a conversation which is rudely interrupted by            the arrival of the German secret police. The next thing you know            you're sitting in a jail cell with a skeleton, a rat and a crate            full of potatoes.                        And so begins your quest to discover the secret that your friend            was willing to die to protect, an adventure which will take you            from France and Germany to Yugoslavia and Russia. Although the            setting is a welcome change from your run of the mill hack and            slash fantasy epic, and magic spells are replaced by Lugers and            shotguns, the underlying gameplay should be familiar to fans of            Baldur's Gate and Diablo. Your hero is soon joined by a party of            other characters, and as you make your way through the game they            gain experience and improve their abilities, building up an array            of weapons, special skills and equipment.                    At the start of the game there's a choice of three basic            characters. You can be the strongman, a burly brainless type who            uses his head, but only for ramming things. Hand to hand combat and            brute force are his specialities. Then there's a thief who's a dab            hand with knives, and an intellectual, the brains of the operation.                        Your options throughout the game depend on which of these you chose            to play as. For example, the game's first real task is to escape            from the cell the Gestapo have thrown you into after your meeting            with the antiques dealer. As the strongman you can simply barge the            door down by repeatedly charging at it, but if you prefer something            a little more subtle a thief character can use a bent nail as a            lockpick, while the intellectual can fool the guard into opening            the door.                        Unfortunately, once the door is open you don't really have any            choice except to kill the German guards and get out. Which brings            us to the game's one major failing at this stage - combat. Not only            is it clumsy and difficult to control, but it's also horribly            unbalanced. While you start out as a weakling with nothing but your            bare fists or (if you're lucky) a knife, the guards are all            stronger than you and have rifles and pistols that can rob you of            half your hitpoints if they manage to get off an accurate shot            before you can close on them. Needless to say this makes the            opening section of the game next to impossible, and the only way to            complete it is to save after every fight and frequently stock up on            cheese to replenish your health. It doesn't help that actually            hitting anything is almost impossible unless you use the ~lazy            mode~, which allows you to simply press enter and leave the            computer to automatically attack the nearest enemy. The bad news is            that the AI is a bit of a mess at the moment, frequently lapsing            into Benny Hill territory as you and your assailants run round and            round in circles chasing each other until somebody stops and            everyone else piles into the back of him, resulting in an            undignified gaggle of people waving knives and rifle butts at each            other.                    Another War does have potential, but at the moment it takes a lot            of patience to find it behind the lethal combat. If Mirage and            Cenega can fix this problem before the game is released over here,            they could be on to a winner though. The plot is intriguing, the            dialogue well written and quite funny in places, the graphics            attractive if low tech, and the jazzy soundtrack and decent voice            acting easy on the ears. It just needs a bit more polish. [You're            fired - Ed]"}
