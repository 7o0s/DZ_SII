Ah, the glamorouslife of a career criminal. If the likes of Guy Ritchie and QuentinTarantino are to be believed we law-abiding folk are the real mugsand our lives would be so much more interesting (albeit possiblyshorter) if only we'd pick up the odd shootah or steel some hotwheels.Well thanks to Driv3r you now have a chance to sample the goodlife as a villain, albeit all in a good cause. Playing anundercover cop posing as a getaway driver, you get to tear up thetarmac in a variety of sporty four- and two-wheeled numbers beforespending the evening socialising in the more fashionable parts ofMiami, Istanbul and Nice. Well that's the theory, at least, becauseGlu Mobile's adaptation of the similarly named console game doesn'tactually manage to convey too much of this.Driv3r does try hard to make you feel like you're playing a partin some dark cop thriller, with a sinuous storyline that nicelystitches together the short episodes of action. But in action,there's little difference between any of the missions that you'retasked with. Falling into three broad categories (driving somewhereagainst the clock, driving someone else off the road, escorting acolleague's car), it's not a game that stands up to extendedperiods of play. Better suited to brief five-minute bursts, it'smildly entertaining at best.Perhaps the most fun is to be had with the car-jacking option,something that's straight out of another famous video game GrandTheft Auto. Damage your car too much and you can simply hop out andcommandeer anything else you see on the road, ranging from policecruisers and trucks to motorcycles and high-performance V8s. Eachvehicle has its own particular handling characteristics andalthough a slightly clumsy steering system does its best to makethem feel the same, you can detect some variation.Considering that driving is the core element of Driv3r, thoughthis isn't quite good enough and the handling is certainly notaccomplished enough to compete with the more serious racing gamepack. Hence, if you can do without the action-flick storyline, pickup Colin McRae 2004 instead, a game that features the same top-downview but offers a more enjyoable ride. Then again, if you're lessbothered about heavy-handling and would rather play at beinglight-fingered there's probably just about enough here to make itworth your while."}
