But it does have vivid colours and more than enough graphical            prowess to drive a beautifully drawn and animated 2D side-scrolling            platformer. Luckily, Core have done a superb job of carrying the            feel (as it were) of Lara Croft on other platforms, to Nintendo's            handheld pocket rocket. You may recall that we were very impressed            a couple of months ago with Ubisoft's Rayman for GBC. Well, a            similar level of detail, care and attention can be found in Tomb            Raider.             You will guide Lara through 14                 levels to gather the five panel pieces, which can be used to                 gain access to the Nightmare Stone (cue dramatic music). Each                 level is faithful to the original Tomb Raider titles on other                 platforms, where you have to find keys and flick switches to                 open doors, avoid or dispose of baddies, and generally keep                 your wits about you in order to make progress. If you've ever                 played Prince of Persia (2D), you'll get the gist.                         In addition to the obligatory pistol, which Lara can use to shoot            baddies, you will pick up various goodies on your travels. These            can be as mundane as a small medical kit to heal your wounds, or as            interesting as a stick of dynamite which can be used to blow up            walls! Your inventory is accessed using the Start button, where it            is all presented in a similar vein to the other console Tomb Raider            releases.         If this sounds a bit simple to                 you, just open the Tomb Raider manual. There are FOUR (count                 'em) pages detailing the ~In-Game Controls~! Lara can roll,                 jump, climb ladders, use monkey bars, swim and dive. The                 amazing thing is that you will actually need to become                 proficient with them if you want to succeed. Tomb Raider is                 not a run-around-and-blast-the-baddies sort of game. As with                 the PC and console Tomb Raider series, it is very much more a                 case of sitting back, solving the puzzles and getting the                 timing right. The downside of this is that it can become                 frustrating if you plummet to your death, impailed on a nasty                 wooden spike, only metres from the next save point. On the                 other hand, we end up with a game which is perfectly suited to                 the GBC because it doesn't try to do too much.                         We are fortunate, therefore, that Core have coded in support for a            battery backed save game feature. Every so often in your travels,            you will come across a spinning silver diamond. This can be used to            save your progress to the cartridge. To resume where you left off,            it's just a case of selecting ~continue~ from the main menu.            Simple, neat and very very useful.                         Core have paid a lot of attention to Tomb Raider's user interface,            but not half as much as has been given to the game's graphics and            character animation. If you buy one game this year to impress you            non-GBC-owning mates, it has to be Tomb Raider. Not only does Lara            herself have more frames of animation than we've ever seen before,            but the entire game design, from the fantastic digitised storyboard            cut sceens to the beautifully coloured in-game backdrops, just            oozes quality. Despite the graphical complexity of the character            animation, the game never seemed to slow down throughout our play            testing. All of Lara's jumps, rolls and dives were silky smooth,            which is very impressive given the hardware base on which Core were            working.             Strangely, the developers have                 adopted a minimalist approach to the sound and music used in                 Tomb Raider. There is the obligatory tune for the main menu,                 and when the game is first started, some promising music                 emerges. But then it goes quiet. Now don't get me wrong,                 personally, I think this is much preferable than having the                 same monotonous tune ringing out throughout the game, which                 you end up turning off in anger. However, there are those out                 there who would prefer to have the option of some in-game                 melodies to compliment the effects. I think that this is going                 to be a point of much debate in Tomb Raider for GBC reviews.                 Personally, I think the developers have taken the right                 approach here, but I'm sure that many others will disagree. As                 for the rest of the sound, there are gunshots, scuffling                 noises and all the things you'd expect from a 2D platform                 jump-around.                    In summary, Tomb Raider is a top notch Gameboy Color title. If            anyone asked which platform game to buy, it would be this one            without a moment's hesitation. Rayman would be highly recommended,            but you have to take into account things like save game features.            Tomb Raider has a great battery backed option, whereas Rayman takes            a trip to nasty-codesville. Give me Tomb Raider any day. However, I            can see that the controls may be a bit fiddly for some less            experienced gamers, but they could still get a lot of enjoyment out            of this title by just using a subset and slowly learning the rest.            Similarly, while Tomb Raider is an action platform title, I            wouldn't call it ~action packed~. It is a thinking person's            platformer, and for that reason will keep you coming back for a            long long time.                        - Out Now"}
