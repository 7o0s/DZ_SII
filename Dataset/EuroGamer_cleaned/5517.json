Whilst the puzzler appearssimple enough at first glance, presenting you with a grid of mystictotems and asking you to swap adjacent symbols in order to makelines of three or more, what happens when you actually start to play isfar more bewildering.Making suitable matches is easy enough, the grid is packed fullof prospective lines and there's even a hint function which kicksin if you take too long to make a move. Likewise, the controls areincredibly simple using the joypad or buttons to select a squareand then selecting the direction of the tile you wish to swap with.Even the basic concept of turning all the squares on the grid goldisn't that tough to grasp, you make a line of 3, the iconsdisappear and the squares turn gold.What really does make your head hurt though is what happensnext. As the icons on the tiles above the completed line move downto fill the space, invariably you'll find a whole host of new linesbeing formed, which in turn disappear and the ones above move downagain, forming a chain reaction that's virtually impossible topredict. The whole thing thus becomes roughly comparable to one ofthose fiendish traps in the Indiana Jones movies, where themovement of one piece triggers a series of mechanical whirringsleading up to a poison-tipped darts firing from the walls or amassive ball rumbling down a tunnel.Indeed, take the ball away and this isn't a random metaphor. Thegame wears it's tomb-raiding credentials on it's sleeve right to analmost copyright challenging point from the central concept ofsolving puzzles to discover lost artefacts right down to theIndy-style action font. What's more the combination of these chainreactions and the constantly ticking clock ensures there's a morepanic-ridden, action-orientated challenge on offer here than inother puzzle games.Admittedly the initial sense of panic does calm down a littlewhen you start to get the feel for what's likely to happen andwhilst you never quite feel completely in control, you can adopt aprogressively more strategic approach. Just as well too as the gamegrids soon get more taxing offering more complex shapes with hardto reach corner squares. You'll undoubtedly lose a few of your 5allotted lives (don't worry - you can accrue more by hitting scoretargets) in trying to solve these squares but chances are you'llkeep coming back in an attempt to complete the level and revealmore of the current artefact you're hunting.Indeed by this point the sense of terror is less about 'what'shappening next?' and more about 'how can I stop playing long enoughto eat/sleep/work?' For, as several million internet players havealready discovered, this is without doubt one of the more addictivepuzzle titles currently available. We wouldn't want to be locked ina dusty old crypt with anything else!"}
