Picking up            where the original Disciples left off, the sequel is a role-playing            strategy game along the lines of Heroes Of Might & Magic,            putting you in control of the destiny of one of four factions - the            human Empire, the dwarven Mountain Clans, the Undead Hordes and the            Legion of the Damned. Each faction has its own campaign (or            ~saga~), and we'll give you one guess as to which of these is the            most entertaining...                    Although at first sight Disciples II looks a lot like its            turn-based strategy brethren, it offers a slightly different take            on the genre, doing away with many of the more tedious elements            usually found in this kind of game. Instead of rushing around the            map hoovering up resources and capturing mines, your heroes are            left to get on with the important business of fighting monsters and            capturing enemy towns, as every town you own exerts an influence on            the terrain surrounding it. Each turn the terrain under your            control will expand a little, and once a mine or mana source is in            your territory you automatically gain resources from it. If a river            gets in the way of your progress or you need to spread your control            more rapidly, one class of hero unit on each side is capable (for a            price) of planting magical rods which gradually change the land            around them.                        As well as helping you to control the land around them, towns also            act as supply bases where you can buy new units and heal wounded            soldiers. But whereas in Heroes you need to build up each town            separately, in Disciples you simply expand your central citadel and            the facilities you have there extend their influence to the rest of            your realm. For example, once you've built a temple in your citadel            you can heal and resurrect units in any of your towns, assuming you            have enough cash. Which buildings you place in your citadel also            determines the upgrade path of your units, all of which gain            experience from any battle they survive. By focusing on smaller            battles (each army contains a maximum of six units) and allowing            soldiers as well as heroes to improve their abilities over the            course of a mission, Disciples makes the individual soldiers more            than mere cannon fodder.                          Sadly you can only carry heroes over from one mission to the next,            not the men they lead, but because the upgraded versions of units            are often much more powerful than the base unit they started out            as, keeping your grunts alive can land you with a devastating army            by the end of a mission. And as long as at least one unit emerges            from the battle alive, you can always hobble back to the nearest            town afterwards and resurrect any troops you've lost, even if your            leader is amongst the dead. This makes battles less of an            interruption than in other similar games, and means you don't have            to worry so much about losing a hero in battle. In a break from            genre tradition, you can even grind down a more powerful enemy by            throwing multiple armies at them - any damage that you cause            carries over, and units only heal very gradually unless they have            potions or spells to aid them.                    Even after many hours playing Disciples II, I've still only            scratched the surface. The game offers lengthy campaigns for all            four sides, as well as a selection of stand-alone quests which can            be played from more than one perspective, and the inclusion of both            online and ~hot seat~ multiplayer options further adds to the            replay value. If you're only going to buy one turn-based            role-playing strategy game this year and you fancy something            slightly different, this could be just the ticket."}
