Jedi                 Power Battles is no less of a mistake than the Phantom Menace                 games of last summer, despite some genuinely innovative ideas.                         There's just no clear intent on the part of Lucasarts any more to            really achieve. Star Wars is now just a money-spinning device for            the big-wigs in America.                         Jedi Power Battles places you in the shoes of one of five Jedi            masters seen in The Phantom Menace last year. You can take on the            role of Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, Plo Koon, or Adi            Gallia. Having been cast in one of these roles, you pick up your            lightsaber and fight through different stages based on locations in            the movie.                         There's little adventuring to be had in Jedi Power Battles.            Fundamentally it has more in common with Final Fight than, say,            Final Fantasy. The action really only consists of battling druids            and such. There's a lot of platform-jumping, too, for you and one            possible companion, as you fight off the threat of the greedy Trade            Federation.                         It seems a little silly for such an action-packed and previously            popular concept to flounder and fall flat on itself. The controls            have a large part to play in this failure. For example, there's the            ~Lock on~ feature, activated by R1. By activating this, you            literally lock onto one of the enemies and duel them in a            free-roaming 3D environment. The problem is, this only works            sporadically, with the player sometimes locking onto the thin air            next to your enemy, allowing a free shot. If you're trying to fight            off a group of Droids, this can be most depressing.                         The controls aren't the only thing that screws up Jedi Power            Battles for the player. There's also the somewhat irksome            animations, which do little for the overall experience. The fast            action of lightsaber battling requires precision and accuracy, not            only in the control system, but also in the animation of the main            characters. While good-looking on their own, the animation            sequences really show themselves up in battle, because they're long            and drawn out, and can't be            interrupted. Jumping is another important                 portion of the gameplay in Jedi Power Battles, but thanks to                 the depressingly imprecise collision detection at work, you                 rarely learn the distances that your character is able to                 safely leap. Throughout the 10 large levels that make up Jedi                 Power Battles, there are an awful lot of jumps to make, and                 despite this, it's hard to guess whether the jump is actually                 safe distance. Yet even if it is, the collision detection is                 so off that you end up dying for the most part anyway.                         Each Jedi is endowed with his own combination moves, but these            moves are too hard to pull off to make them viable options in            combat. If you don't use them, you'll get by, but unless you do,            you'll probably find the game to be rather too repetitive. Still,            should you manage it, it'll rip apart your enemies nicely! There            are some pretty cool power-ups in the mix as well, including the            one that doubles the length of your lightsaber for a limited            period.                         The background is moderately interactive, but not overly so. Some            areas can be smacked about a bit to give you points, whilst others            just encourage mindless mayhem with a big glowing laser            sword\u2026         Graphically Jedi Power Battles                 does about as much as you can expect from the Playstation,                 despite problems (including the aforementioned and depressing                 collision detection). The polygons do overlap a fair amount,                 but at least that eliminates the tearing effect sometimes                 experienced in other games. The problems are worsened by the                 introduction of the second player. Because players can walk in                 opposite directions beyond the edge of the screen, there are                 times when there's nothing there at all!                         The graphics are good relatively speaking though, with some            excellent special effects and lightsaber actions. Like the special            effects, the sounds are probably one area that Lucasarts can always            be expected to deliver in. The musical soundtrack is lifted            directly from the movie, which really isn't a bad thing, and in            spite of the overly repetitive and loud lightsaber sound effect,            the game's audio lives up to its billing.                    Although it's built on a solid formula, Jedi Power Battles is            another missed opportunity for Lucasarts to climb out of the hole            they've dug themselves in the past few years. While home to a few            redeeming features, it falls flat on its face with bad collision            detection, overly elaborate character animations and rather poor            execution on the whole.                        - Out Now"}
