Those three words still manage to affect people            in this industry. If you were at ECTS for its last visit to            Olympia, you probably remember the twenty-foot Konami video screen            and Europe's first glimpse of Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty.            It was about the only thing during those three hot, muggy days of            trade show endurance that brought the huddled masses to a            standstill. For the five or so minutes it lasted, you could have            heard a pin drop. Well, if it weren't for the sound of Russian            ID-modified rifles spitting venom all over the place and our gruff,            righteous hero pursued by an avalanche of water and debris...                         In any event, a lot has happened since ECTS 2000. The PlayStation            2 launched to critical acc.. well, just criticism actually. With a            high price tag and a lack of truly great games, in a lot of cases            it was the promise of games like Metal Gear Solid 2 that sold the            console during those early months. Indeed, one of the criticisms            levelled at Konami during the development of MGS2 was that the hype            machine could be responsible for a backlash if the game failed to            live up to the expectations of deprived PS2 owners when it was            eventually released. As the trickle of quality games for the PS2            became a full-on torrent this became less of a problem, but with            MGS still occupying a special place in many gamers' hearts it was            always going to be difficult if Konami failed to deliver on 110% of            their promises.                        Of course, as you may have guessed, they have done just that. Metal            Gear Solid 2 is not the best PS2 game out there, and if            you're really strapped for cash this month you might want to set it            aside for a rainy day and get stuck into the likes of platform            favourite Jak & Daxter or his vaguely devilish chum Maximo.            Having said that though, this game is a prime example of why the            PS2 stands to remain the world's most important videogame platform            and beat off its second generation of competition. Take the finest            elements of animation, design, music, voice acting and artificial            intelligence and use them to present an engaging adventure starring            the hero of Shadow Moses and you have MGS2 pretty much wrapped up.                    Sons Of Liberty begins with the finest video game introduction            ever. Scored by Harry Gregson-Williams, the British composer behind            the soundtracks of movies such as Shrek, Replacement Killers and            Armageddon, MGS2 is also a very fine sounding game, especially            during these opening moments. As the strains of Gregson-Williams'            rousing score resonate, it's not terribly clear what's going on at            first. In the accompanying documentary (provided along with some            other extras on the game's second DVD), Hideo Kojima explains that            the DNA motif used to present the credits, interspersed with            cutscene and game footage as a sort of montage, is meant to echo            Solid Snake's plight as he deals with the other Snakes in his life,            and as the music ebbs and flows throughout this grandiose            introduction, it brings us closer to our once cherished hero and            offers some of the most emotive musical direction I've ever seen.                         As the game proper begins though, you are faced with a choice.            Instead of hurling you into the ether with a mere stun gun to            assist you, the European version of the game asks, how much do you            know about the Metal Gear Solid legend? Of the five answers, the            top one is the 'right' response, which confirms that yes, I did            complete the first game and, yes, I was suitably good at it.            Selecting this gives you a choice of Normal and Hard skill setting            options and then whisks you away to the start of the now-familiar            section from last year's demo, with Otacon talking on the Codec            (the communication device of choice for FOXHOUND operatives) and            offering you advice on your controls and movements, padding out            another few minutes with his musings on life, love and any other            material he has handy.                        The other four options yield different 'versions' of the same game.            Not finished Metal Gear Solid yet? Then you can choose not to have            the ending spoilt for you, and the game will sidestep the Snake /            tanker sections and a whole host of other bits completely. Honestly            though, MGS2 in its entirety takes roughly ten hours to complete,            and this 'questions' idea seems a bit superfluous. Sure, you can            save yourself from spoilers, but you'll also miss out on a lot of            the game. The skill settings on the other hand are rather more            useful, adjusting the challenges you face rather than simply            changing the number of enemies you encounter. For example, one of            the demo levels involves reaching the bridge of the ship, and on            higher skill settings the stairway going up from just inside the            first doorway is barred, forcing you to take the long way round.            Clever, eh?                    As you would expect, stealth is encouraged in MGS2 and yes, you can            still hide in cardboard boxes. If you're seen, or if one of your            victims manages to scamper away and call for backup, you'll have to            find somewhere quiet to hide while the bad guys conduct their            search and things calm down. And as in the original Metal Gear            Solid, your radar is jammed during this time and high alert is            assumed with multiple enemies on hand. Get caught out and            reinforcements will quickly arrive.                        But if you absolutely cannot get past an unsuspecting guard without            his physical removal, your M9 tranquilliser gun comes in handy.            Which brings me neatly to one of the game's finest achievements;            the control system. Aiming a weapon in MGS2 is simple. Although the            game is viewed from the third person perspective, allowing you to            judge Snake's movements from above and behind, holding R1 switches            you to a first person view, giving you the chance to aim with your            analogue stick or d-pad. Assuming you've equipped your M9, USP or            whatever else you've happened across, you can then hold down square            whilst you find your target. This raises your gun and lets you aim            using the sights, and a quick release of the button will then fire            a shot, while a gentle release can be used if you reconsider.                         Snake's movement code is very impressive as well, allowing him to            tip-toe, walk, run, stand, crouch, crawl, hide behind objects, lean            against and sneak along walls, snoop round corners and fire there            if he needs to. Snake can jump over and on top of objects, and he            can hang onto railings so as not to be detected by guards            patrolling walkways and the like. He can punch, kick and            flying-kick his enemies into temporary submission, and then lug the            ones he's knocked out into some quiet corner for safe keeping. Or            bundle them into a locker. The real bombshell though, when it comes            to MGS2, is that anything Snake can do, Raiden can also do.                    Raiden is the character with whom players will spend most of            Snake's adventure. Well, it's a sort of joint ownership thing, if            you like. In an attempt to give players a better impression of            Snake - in other words, a third person out of body experience -            Kojima-san and his team have opted to hand control over to Raiden,            a wet-behind-the-ears newbie at FOXHOUND whose handlers are an            ambitious Pentagon type and his hint-of-girlfriend Rose, who            persists in calling him Jack. Giving players control of Raiden,            after taking Snake's incursion of the tanker to its natural            conclusion and bringing on the bad guys, allows Kojima-san and his            team to build up Snake's mythos. This is done through an explosive            story of betrayal, confusion and Hollywood-style mayhem, with the            constant introduction along the way of additional characters,            including a couple of my favourites; the charismatic almost-retired            bomb disposal expert and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 gone bad, Fatman.                         Although this all adds to the cinematic atmosphere of the game,            the pacing is rather uneven. I was consistently annoyed by rambling            and often frankly unimportant conversations over the codec. When            Kojima-san claimed the codec was merely ~a tool~ in a recent            interview, he was in fact glossing over what is arguably the main            delivery mechanism for storyline elements, and where the player            will spend most of their time during the course of the game. The            fact that every codec conversation - and every conversation in the            entire game - is voice acted, admittedly very well, is little            consolation for the persistent use of this archaic device to            advance the story and add to the game's extensive play time.            Players can spend hours hearing Rose and Otacon's offerings on            Chinese proverbs amongst other things, just for trying to save the            game. Thank goodness there's a button to skip them.                         Realistically though, most of the game's important moments are            witnessed in these professionally-shot scenes, which can take the            game all over the world .. and take every twist and turn out of the            player's hands. You see, although MGS2 is an experience unrivalled            in terms of its scope, and although it works beautifully as an            ensemble, when you consider how little actual stealth action the            game includes and, conversely, how much of your time is spent            watching cutscenes and listening to the codec, you have to ask            yourself, is this really the pinnacle of gaming that some critics            have claimed it to be? Is it to become legendary as the best            example of the convergence of movies and interactive media? No. But            it's a damned fine effort. From the rain beating down on Snake as            he races across George Washington Bridge in New York to the little            caskets blowing off steam in the interior of the ship during the            introductory section, every little thing in Metal Gear Solid 2 has            been drawn, programmed and realised spectacularly. The authenticity            is unmatched and the animation is gobsmackingly good. Anybody could            be forgiven for losing themselves to MGS2's alternate reality with            such sharp visuals and stunning in-game cutscenes. The 3D world            created by Konami here is utterly believable, and even though some            of it is anime-style fantasy pap, it's believable pap. Tangible            pap.                    Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty is the most highly anticipated            PS2 game ever. Although it seems to be fairly popular to write it            off in places for its fairly low gameplay quotient and            over-reliance on cutscenes and the codec conversations (without            which it is a fairly unexciting game), the overall effect is still            as stunning and enjoyable as ever. You may feel foolish gripping            the controller throughout a 40-minute cut scene, but MGS2 is            something which must be experienced. It doesn't represent the            pinnacle of gaming, but it does offer something truly unique and            consistently innovative, whether it's padded out with interminable            dross or not. Buy it. There won't be another one of this calibre            for several years.                        -        Hideo Kojima and Harry                    Gregson-Williams interviewHideo Kojima and Harry                    Gregson-Williams interview"}
