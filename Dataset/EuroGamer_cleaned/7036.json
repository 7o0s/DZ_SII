But            the first of his many movies which I saw was ~Subway~, a surreal            trip through the Paris Metro starring Christophe Lambert, later to            make his name (with an extra ~r~ for American audiences) in cult            classic ~Highlander~.                    Lambert stars as Fred, a loveable blond quiffed rogue who falls for            a girl, and then blows her husband's safe when she invites him to            her birthday party. ~I hate safes~, he explains later. With the            husband's goon squad on his tail trying to recover the file he            stole from the safe, Fred crashes his car into the gates of a            subway station and goes to ground in the Paris Metro.                    There he discovers a strange world of tunnels and service ducts            which is home to a cast of typically bizarre Besson characters,            including a rollerskating purse snatcher, a bodybuilder, a florist,            and a pair of bungling policemen nicknamed Batman and Robin. Even            Besson's favourite actor Jean Reno (~Leon~, ~Ronin~) gets a look            in, appearing as the Drummer, who spends most of the film wandering            the subway tunnels tapping his drumsticks against walls and tables.                    The film's plot is as labyrinthine as the corridors of the Metro            station, and almost as confusing at first glance. In fact it's            something of a triumph of style over substance, and the real star            of the movie is the Metro itself, from the sterile station to the            grimy underworld that lurks beneath it and the colourful characters            that inhabit it.                    Before long it becomes obvious that Besson cares even less about            the stolen files than Fred, who seems to be more interested in            forming a band with his new found friends and winning over the girl            Helena than in blackmailing her rich husband. Helena herself is            trying to escape from her husband as well, stifled by her marriage            and bored by his asinine friends.                    The middle section of the movie is rather chaotic at times, with            Batman and Robin chasing the Skater, Fred gathering musicians for            his band, and Helena getting dragged into the world of the subway            as she becomes more and more involved with Fred. Somehow it all            hangs together though, and Besson pulls in the various plot threads            for a neat if somewhat downbeat ending which foreshadows his            masterpiece L\u00e9on.                    The whole thing is beautifully shot, with the same attention to            detail and sense of the absurd that makes Besson's later films such            classics, from the long winding shot of a column of policemen            marching down a narrow staircase in perfect time, through to the            finale as Fred's band hijacks a classical music festival, Jean Reno            laying into his drumkit like a man possessed.                    Another long time Besson collaborator getting in on the action is            composer Eric Serra (~Fifth Element~, ~Goldeneye~), who not only            provides the movie with a funky (if rather dated) electro-jazz            soundtrack that sets the tone almost perfectly, but also puts in a            rather camera-shy performance as the band's bass player.                    While it lacks some of the focus and punch of Besson's later work,            Subway is an entertaining and visually stunning film which is            certainly well worth a look. Just don't expect another all-action            blockbuster - apart from the car chase at the beginning of the            movie there is precious little action of any kind, and only one            person gets killed. Surely some kind of record for Besson?                    The best place to get Subway at the moment is from its native            France, as the American DVD of the movie suffers from a terrible            full-screen transfer, and only features the sub-standard English            dubbed version of the soundtrack.                    By comparison the French DVD is rather good. The picture and sound            quality is spot on, it's presented in the original 2.35:1 aspect            ratio, and you even get a choice of French, English or German            sound, with subtitles also available in French, English and            Spanish. While the English subtitles don't always provide a literal            translation of what is being said, they are usually fairly close.                    The disc also features some nice (if slightly long-winded) animated            menus which make highly effective use of footage from the film            itself, and allow you to select sound and subtitle languages. It            also gives you access to an excellent chapter selection menu, which            features little thumbnails of the first 30 seconds or so of each            chapter looping until you make your mind up and select one.                    Apart from that the only extra feature is a collection of trailers            for several of Luc Besson's other movies, but as far as it goes            it's a great little disc. Highly recommended if you're a fan of            Besson or looking for something a little out of the ordinary...
