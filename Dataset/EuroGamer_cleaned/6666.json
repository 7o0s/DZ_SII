No sooner had EA bagged the rights to the            movie, Vivendi Universal Games thought it'd be a really good idea            to get the rights to the books, and so gamers are faced with having            to choose from two titles based on the phenomenally popular J.R.R            Tolkien story.                    But whereas EA's slick effort concentrated strictly on events in            the movie (including the second in the series, The Two Towers),            developer WXP has had a more free reign to create a game to do the            actual story justice, as opposed to one that has more in common            with hack and slash Golden Axe-style gaming than anything as            trivial as story line.        Ok,            this has been out for a few weeks now, but our review copy            slithered its way onto our desk better late than never. No doubt            the postman got savaged by black clad horsemen, otherwise known as            the gaming patrol - a bunch of shady vigilantes hell bent on            stopping bad gaming experiences from breaking through and scarring            our consciousness. But the posties round here are tough little            fellas, and by creeping slowly past the gang of Goths, they evaded            their attentions. So here we are, duty bound to deliver the news,            good or bad.                    The omens haven't been good for FOTR; save for one good 'world            exclusive' PC review; this has been attracting almost universal bad            press from a press under siege from a deluge of top-notch games.            Put simply, if it wasn't for the attractive license, we'd have            probably filed this game under ~don't bother even looking at~, but            seeing as it has sold in significant numbers (sitting pretty at            No.12 in this week's All Formats chart) we thought it would be wise            to deliver our considered verdict on whether its worth spending            your hard earned beans on.                    If such things matter to you, the storyline is faithful to the            novel, so you get to ~relive the experiences of Frodo, Aragorn and            Gandalf as they journey from the peaceful lands of the Shire            through the darkness of Moria to the River Anduin~.        What this            translates to as a gaming experience is a third person action            adventure where you wander around talking to characters in an            attempt to move the story on. As you move through the various            characters, you get given sub quests that usually involve fetching            an object and bringing it back to them. Some are compulsory, while            some are purely there to make you feel better about being a Hobbit            - and also to increase your purity rating.                    The initial quests take place in a non threatening environment, and            as such feel like an over long training mission - without too much            of the training, so you inevitably end up wandering around for ages            like an idiot trying to find something locked away in a chest            somewhere before you can actually get to the real meat of the game.                    But what is obvious from the get go is the visuals are lacklustre,            with an environment closely resembling the fluffy Herdy Gerdy game            engine. The PR spiel talks of full scene anti-aliasing, vertex            shader effects, and an advanced particle system, but frankly we            don't see any evidence of that. The depiction of a medieval village            is just totally fluffy and unconvincing, and anyone hoping for a            bit of eye candy to get them into the proceedings will be utterly            nonplussed by the bland texturing and half-hearted recreation of            the Tolkien world, with a succession of uninspiring levels that            seem to make do, rather than ever innovate.                    The character models hardly help matters, either, lacking any sort            of convincing animation or the attention to detail that you would            expect for a modern game released on powerful systems, and next to            its rival product, EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and            general slickness. In general, the whole package looks and feel            years out of date - and that's before you're even allowed to get            into the main part of the proceedings.        Even the camera system and controls are consistently annoying.            Employing the now familiar system of movement with the left stick            and camera with the right, you're expected to give your character            the best view all by yourself - which is fine when it works, but            given that you can't even reverse the camera controls to the            industry standard setting, you're in trouble from the beginning.            Luckily an inverse look option at least cures one of the two            'reversed controls' issues, but even so, the whole thing feels            unnatural, and constantly trips up on scenery - and fairly ugly            scenery at that.                    The controls never feel intuitive either - thanks to an awkward            inventory system that insists the player calls up the object in            question with either the D pad or the triggers, and then selecting            the item with the little used 'black button'. Even something as            fundamental as lock-picking takes a ridiculous amount of time to            get the hang of, while the combat system of first pulling out your            weapon with B, locking on with left trigger and striking with the A            button, while simultaneously having to wrestle with the movement            and camera controls feels like we you're constantly fighting            against the interface, rather than the fictional monsters presented            to you. Even when you get the hang of combat, it never feels like            fun - you just spend your time stabbing the same button and            repositioning yourself to wherever your target has moved to. Beat            'em up fans will want to kill themselves, never mind the baddies            after a few hours in the company of this game.        But it's not all a glorified            point-and-click adventure with some ill-conceived combat elements.            There's stealth in them thar hills too, and ~full use~ of the            analog stick means you can - and have to - tip toe past your            numerous assailants, with a detection meter showing you how            stealthy you're being; green for ok, yellow for ~aware of you, but            haven't seen you, to red, meaning get the hell out of there! In            most cases the AI is laughably bad, with guards standing right next            to you, yet somehow unable to see you. It's a step back to the line            of sight school of AI, and the light and sound tricks in Splinter            Cell seem a world away in comparison.                    There is, as with the EA title, the opportunity to play as three            different characters at various points in the game (Frodo, Aragorn            and Gandalf), but this does nothing to mask the flaws already            mentioned. It's more of an obligation to Tolkien Enterprises than            anything genuinely creative.                    If you can live with all the problems, irritations and lack of            inspiring gameplay, there's actually a reasonably big game locked            away. Real, hardcore Tolkien nuts, who live and breath the man's            work, may get something out of this, but for everyone else, this            has ~licensed toss~ written all over it, and yet another reason why            licensed games are inherently evil in the wrong hands - rather like            the ring Frodo and co. are trying so hard to get rid of. The goal            was ~to create the most authentic 'Lord of the Rings' game            experience possible~. Quite honestly, Melbourne House's 1985 text            adventure had more going for it.
