Let's face it, there is not much flying to be done            in a B-17 beyond taking off, holding her steady for hundreds of            miles, and then landing. The B-17 is a heavy bomber and is            therefore unsuitable for the aerobatics that attract gamers to the            classier fighter aircraft; no B-17 pilot sim was going to do very            well.                    Wayward have therefore decided to make the game a B-17 crew            simulator - a game where the player can act as pilot, bombardier,            navigator, radio operator or gunner in addition to being the            aircraft commander, with a total of eleven positions in the            aircraft for the ten man crew to take. Anyone who has seen the film            ~Memphis Belle~ will feel immediately at home, watching crew            members move about the aircraft, unjam guns and tend to the            wounded. When the player is not actively manning a station, it will            be manned competently by the AI crewmembers, who gain in experience            as the campaigns progress. The main let-down tends to be            inexperienced navigators - it's embarrassing when they can't even            find Bremen!                    In addition to the bomber itself, B-17 allows you to fly three            escort fighters (P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt, P-51 Mustang)            and three German interceptors (Messerschmidt Bf-109, Focke            Wulf-190, Messerschmidt-262 Jet), although none of these aircraft            offer the features one would expect in a pure fighter sim. You            start in the air and your world revolves around the bombers in the            neighbourhood. This game is therefore a complex mix of flight            simulator, crew management simulator and role playing game; at its            highest level the game even allows you to manage a whole twelve            aircraft squadron of the Eighth Air Force, with all the resource            and personnel management issues involved, such as deciding when to            give your crews a break or whether to replace a battle-fatigued but            competent tailgunner with a fresh rookie. Inevitably Wayward have            had to make compromises to fit this ambitious package into a            workable game. Have they succeeded?                    The B-17 is modelled well - from the shiny metallic skin to the            tiny catwalk through the bomb bay. Looking from outside you can see            the pilots sitting in the cockpit and the waist gunners peering            from their positions, while inside the crew move about the cramped            interior convincingly. There are six compartments - nose, cockpit,            bomb bay, radio room, waist and tail - and you will spend a lot of            time in them watching the crew go through their tasks, while adding            some of your own. Damaged by flak after the bomb run? Order the            bombardier to man the chin turret, while the left waist gunner            manually cranks the jammed bomb bay doors and the ball gunner gives            first aid to the radio operator.                    There are two other main views inside the bomber - the action view            and the instrument view. For the pilot/co-pilot these are clear -            the action view looks out the windscreen while the various            instrument views check the panel. The gunners' action view is their            gunsight, while their instrument view is merely a check of how much            ammunition they have. The two most complicated views are those of            the navigator and bombardier. The navigator has to keep the            aircraft on course over hundreds of miles of enemy territory, and            unless you have navigation set to flawless or have a very            experienced navigator you will spend a lot of time in this view            comparing the map with landmarks you can see on the ground and            updating your position. Given that you can start the campaign in            December 1943 and experience nine-tenths cloud cover this is quite            a task.                    The bombardier has to aim using the Norden bombsight, by far the            best part of the game. As you approach the target you will get a            met report from the radio operator and will have to decide if the            target can be hit. Then you must acquire the target through the            cloud and stabilise the gyroscopic bombsight on the target, with            allowances for altitude and wind drift. This is not as complicated            as it seems, though it gets harder when flak bursts fill your            bombsight, the nose compartment is filling with smoke, and the            navigator just three feet away has a fragment of iron sticking out            of his chest and needs urgent attention.                    As you will have gathered, this game is more of a combat simulation            than a flight simulation. The pilot seat is perhaps the            least-occupied seat of the game, partly because of the restricted            view and the inability to see out of the window and see the panel            at once, and partly because the flight model is not great. There            seems to be no appreciable difference between a fully-loaded B-17            and an empty one, though damage to the plane is well reflected in            increased handling difficulties. Those looking to fly the B-17 full            time will have to look elsewhere.                    If flying the B-17 is unsatisfying, flying the fighters is best            described merely as an entertaining diversion. The flight models            are amateur and the fighters are limited to tiny flights rather            than mass attacks. This is strange, given the amount of work that            has clearly gone into making the cockpits as realistic as possible.            It's almost as though fighters were originally to have played a            bigger part in this game but have been hastily finished.                    Another aspect of the game where time ran out is multiplayer, which            was cut from the game entirely. This was originally to have been            the central theme of the game, and what fun that would have been!            Given the problems this game has running smoothly on even the best            machines though, it is hard to see how multiplayer could have            worked. The game seems stable (I have not experienced a single            crash) but there are problems - the sound is erratic, especially in            the gun positions where it is most important, and the terrain            scenery needs to be set as low as possible in order for views to            pan quickly enough to track an incoming fighter.                    The core of the game lies in the campaigns, where you can name your            aircraft and crew and track them from mission to mission. In one            campaign my aircraft ~Little Susie~ was crewed by friends from            work, with myself as bombardier. During the first mission I was            wounded, along with the navigator and co-pilot. While we recovered            in hospital, Little Susie was tasked with hitting oil refineries in            Hamburg and flew through a shredder of flak and enemy fighters,            hitting the target but losing lift on the return leg over            Bremerhaven. All the crew were injured and spent the rest of the            war behind wire, which certainly made those of us in hospital in            England feel lucky. This game really brings home to you the cost of            combat.                    In addition to the Historical Campaign, which allows you to manage            a single aircraft, the Squadron Campaign allows you to manage            twelve aircraft and their crews. In fact, by a strange system of            ghost aircraft in the formation, you actually get to fly with            double this number. Unfortunately 120 aircrew are more than I could            track or get attached to, so most people will probably concentrate            on the lead aircraft and let the others just tag along. The main            advantage of the squadron campaign is the ability to pick routes            and targets, letting your crews hit easier targets and avoid flak            concentrations while you build up their confidence and experience.            The German industrial heartland is no place for rookies, especially            given the density and power of the very impressive flak.                    The downside to both campaigns is that the B-17 is an aircraft with            a single purpose - bombing. Once you have fought off fighters a            couple of times and sweated out your first runs through the flak it            is easy to lose interest, the more so as there isn't too much you            can do about either flak or fighters. Ultimately this lack of            replayability must count as the game's biggest drawback.                    If you are looking for a flight simulator you will be disappointed.            If you are looking for a bomber commander simulation though, B-17            fits the bill very nicely. However there is no reason why it could            not have been both, nor why some of the glaring technical problems            reported by so many users should have been allowed to remain. At            its best though, B-17 is an immersive combat game that will have            you on the edge of your seat, if only for the first few flights."}
