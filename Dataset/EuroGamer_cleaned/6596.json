Neither is the            promise of six prestigious global rallies, 33 stages, 25 licensed            vehicles in five classes, and four game modes including            split-screen multi-player. If you didn't know I was talking about            Rally Championship from Warthog and SCi, you might just as soon            imagine I was talking about WRC2 (Sony), Colin McRae 3 (Codies),            Rally Fusion (Activision), Pro Rally (Ubi Soft), V-Rally 3            (Infogrames) or Sega Rally 3. Even if I throw in realistic car            damage systems, real car physics, advanced weather effects and            actual rallying techniques, I could still be talking about pretty            much any of them. And you know that's just marketing guff anyway.                    But those are Rally Champs' vital stats according to the            back of the box, and as you can probably tell from my tone, it            doesn't get any more exciting. In fact, it barely lives up to them            at all.        The main            problem is just how indifferent the player feels to the on-screen            action. Oh sure it's pretty fast, it's very close to good looking            (albeit in a toony, GameCube sort of way, with chunky cars, solid            walls of green wheat with a worrying opacity to them, dust kicked            up behind your car leaving a hazy mist over the track in your            rear-view, truck, tractor, house, barn and village prefabs, and so            on), and simulation fans will probably lighten up at the sight of a            progressive career mode, where you compete for money to buy new            cars in the soggy British rallies, then journey abroad to more            exotic locations in Africa and elsewhere. Throw in arcade/time            trial modes, split-screen for up to four players (at the usual            expense of detail/frame rate), and there you have it.                    But however nicely you paint the picture, you can't escape the            multitude of faults, which leap into your path like a drunken            spectator on a foggy race day. The framework is good, but it's been            filled out by office juniors.                    Take the handling and physics models. For a sim-based rally game,            would you seriously expect to flip your vehicle if you clip            virtually anything? Would you expect to be able to donut your car            about 17 times by holding the gas when you spin off? Would you            expect to move in a dead straight line for the most part despite            wiggling all over the track 'realistically'? Would you expect to            write your car off after a 100mph collision with a solid wall of            barley, or would you expect the headlights to pop before you            started off again?        Actually, it's a touch ironic, but the most fun we had with            Rally Championship - the most excitement - was on nighttime rallies            where our apathetic driving stance would lose our headlights about            half way through, forcing us to scrape away at the other bloke's            lead in almost total darkness.                    Back to reality though, and it's a good thing that we don't            generally bother to twiddle with car options, because anybody doing            so would quickly realise that for all your options - gear ratios,            suspension, ride height, brake bias, brake power, tyre type, tyre            tread and tyre compound - there's virtually no way to notice any            changes because the handling's too inconsistent.                    It isn't the only thing though. We mentioned the dust kicking up            earlier. Well, the dust does, but the mud doesn't bother. The car            has several distinct handling styles allegedly determined by the            terrain, but in practise you won't find any difference between            skating across mud and dust - snow is about the only thing which            really throws a spanner into the works. Half the time you can get            round only braking for hairpins. What's more, sometimes the            controls are incredibly responsive, and you feel like you're            blitzing a race, finding the perfect line on every turn and firing            on all cylinders, only to crash out repeatedly in the next race            because the car seems to take on a mind of its own.                    Of course the real reason the car goes haywire may simply be your            faceless character leaning over to jam the pace notes down his            co-driver's throat, because although ~long right, don't cut~ can be            a handy tip, it isn't so much if the bloody turn goes left! It's            just another example of the inconsistency at work here.                    Now, we hesitate to condemn Rally Champs completely for a couple of            reasons. 1) There is nothing else for rally fans on the Cube. 2) It            really isn't a bad game to play - it's just a normal, unexciting,            unrelenting procession of averageness. It's the Citroen Saxo of            rally titles - small, well rounded and not horrible to look at, but            it is pretty horrible to drive, it sounds like a chainsaw            dragged over sand paper and the sales guy is going to have his work            cut out selling it. If you absolutely require a rally title on the            Cube, (heavy sigh), then this will probably do the trick, but there            are infinitely better ways for Cube owners to blow 40 quid.
