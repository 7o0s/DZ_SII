That's not to say            we've got da Funk, because we clearly haven't, but that doesn't            stop us shaking our booty every time a bit of down and dirty groin            music pumps out (you should see Rauper's moves). But according to            the alien trio of ToeJam, Earl, and 'hot new homegirl' Latisha, the            Earthlings just haven't got the groove. How patronising.                    The 12 sacred albums of funk (and that's vinyl albums, kids, and if            you don't know what they are, then you really haven't got            the groove) have apparently, for reasons not fully explained, been            stolen by us insolent Earthlings. And guess who's got to journey to            the green planet to retrieve them? That'll be you, then,            controlling one of the three wacky alien characters, who think            they're just the bomb, and like to show off their rapping 5KillZ            before and during the game, given half a chance.                    So, here is yet another Xbox exclusive from Sega - a platform it            seems to have an increasing aptitude and fondness for - and again            it has gone back to its dim and distant 'glory days' to revive            another of its successful franchises. Naturally, the transition of            the 2D platform gameplay to 3D has been a smooth one, and is one of            the most eye-catching titles we've ever seen in the genre.        But as some of you            will wearily note, it's about the 13th run, jump and collect title            to be released in the last three months or so (and this author has            played every single one of them, much to Tom's annoyance). With the            exception of perhaps Ratchet & Clank, Sly Raccoon, and, at a            push, Rayman 3, none of them have been that inspiring. What chance            TJ&E3, a game that has been out in the US of A for over four            months, and wasn't especially well received?                    In common with so many of its peers, TJ&E 3 centres on object            collection. On a basic level you'll have to round up a set number            of keys in order to unlock each level contained within each world.            To start with, you'll be able to enter levels with as few as five            keys, but as you progress more levels will become 'unlocked'.            You're also tasked with tracking down other objects, such as one of            the lost albums, or one of the vast number of 'presents' that            litter the levels. And it's the presents that allow TJ&E 3 to            stand out from the various other generic platformers, giving you a            varied and extensive power-up system that gives even Ratchet &            Clank a run for its gadget money - but one that's not without its            problems, which we'll discuss later.                    As well as numerous objects to collect, you've also got tons of            Earthlings to worry about, which can be anything from a demented            chicken to a frisky cheerleader. But rather than kill them, in the            manner of every platform game ever, you have to teach these uncool            beings the ways of the Funk, using your mastery of Funk-Fu. This            essentially involves firing a few pink blasts at them by hitting X,            which, for the early batch of enemies results in them becoming            groovy, and thanking you for showing them the light, smiling and            waving cheerily as a result. How sweet. Makes a change from blood            and death.        As you            progress, you'll find that some Earthlings are so uncool that even            your Funk-Fu doesn't permeate their senses (at least not until            you're more experienced at it), and you'll be forced to adopt one            the game's other means of showing them the Funk. Dotted around            every level are floating musical notes, which once collected can be            fired at the Earthlings by repeatedly tapping Y until they succumb.            Luckily, if you miss your intended target the notes will come back            to you (unless you run away before they get a chance to return - in            which case you'll lose them). Some of these unfunky beings resist            even this method of attack, in which case you're forced to resort            to using one of your presents, some of which can take out any Earth            creature in range like a smart bomb, but you have to use them            wisely, as there are not many of these lying around.                    In return for being made funky, points and cash explode from their            grateful bodies, with the former used as part of an RPG-style            upgrade system, while the latter acts as currency to buy more            presents of your choice from the various vendors you encounter. The            upgrade system is fairly basic, and sets a points target for you to            achieve in order to move up the next belt ranking. But once you get            there, you're rewarded with enhanced abilities (i.e. higher jumps,            etc) that aid you in dispatching the increasingly tough enemies.            And they do get quite tough, quite quickly. This is not a game            you'll be romping through unchallenged, and the less determined            among you will suffer a fair bit of frustration along the way to            success - but nowhere near as much as, say, Blinx. TJ&E III            just requires you to have your wits about you a little more than            the average platformer.                    The constant array of new toys to play with as you move through the            game keeps it compelling, in the way that Ratchet & Clank            achieved so well. But one of the oft-repeated moans in TJ&E III            is about a little shit that runs up to you and 'randomises' all            your presents in your inventory, meaning you no longer know what            they are any more. This happens about 30 per cent into the game,            and is just plain evil. Granted, you learn to spot them coming and            deal with them, but sometimes they come out of nowhere, and it can            stuff your chances of progress on that level as it renders all your            special powers redundant until you rediscover what they are again.            Why Sega, why? Why spoil a perfectly good game with something so            overwhelmingly evil that it renders the game virtually unplayable            afterwards?        If you can live with that obscene aspect of the game, then            there's much to admire. First of all, the mini-games are a pleasant            diversion - pushing 30 bunnies off a cliff in less than 35 seconds            was definitely one of the highlights [my sort of game - Evil Tom],            and we always looked forward to these distractions when they            arrived. Meanwhile, the novel presence of a random level generator            and the two-player mode doesn't hurt and adds some value, as will            the chance to download extras over Xbox Live - available to            Europeans from March 14th, of course.                    The controls and camera are as good as we've seen in a game of this            type. Regular readers will know how much a dodgy in-game camera            winds us up, and TJ&E 3 deals with this issue masterfully. If            there is any scenery potentially obscuring your view, it becomes            transparent, and as a result you're never put in an awkward            position. It's a neat system and hopefully will become the adopted            standard before long.                    As briefly touched upon earlier, the visuals have that sheen that            could only be pulled off on Xbox. Even basic things like the grass            texturing on the very first game hub are a world away from the            blurry standard we're normally fed (on the PS2, it's fair to say),            and the scenery is generally up to the same standard throughout.            The character models you'll either love or hate; for hardened            veterans of the scene they're not perhaps the most endearing game            characters ever, despite being detailed and well animated, thanks            to their constant quips and cocksure chatter in a spectacularly            annoying American accent. The enemy models, meanwhile, don't seem            to have the same level of detail lavished upon them, wandering            around in their small locales like any number of drones you've seen            a thousand times before. It certainly won't win any awards for            imagination, but all round the game has that safe cartoon            cheeriness that'll make it popular with mums looking for a cute            game to buy for their young kid.                    For a game that's so heavily music-based, it is odd to note how            many non funk musical genres creep in, with Gospel, Hip Hop and Rap            not really tallying with our rather more traditional opinion of            what constitutes Funk. It's like the developers took the rather            patronising view that Black = funky, and just poured any number of            musical styles whether it actually worked or not. With a bit more            emphasis on real Funk, and maybe some licensed Funkadelic in            there, it would have been essential, but as it is we're left with a            few forgettable basslines to keep us going during the kleptomania.                    If you're an Xbox owner with a passion for roaming collectathons,            then this game is arguably the best this platform has to offer            currently - at least until Rayman 3 comes out next week. But in the            broader sense of the genre, it simply can't compete with the genius            of its many competitors, particularly the Sony first party efforts            of late. ToeJam & Earl III raises a few smiles now and then,            but you'll be grimacing in anguish just as often, which in the            final analysis is just not good enough to warrant spending            \u00a340.
