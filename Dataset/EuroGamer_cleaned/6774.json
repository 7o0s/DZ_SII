The subtitle, ~Millennium Fight 2000~            perhaps best highlights how long it's been waiting to make its            mark, and potential buyers should bear in mind that this is not the            decidedly superior Capcom Vs. SNK 2, but an enhanced port of the            Dreamcast release of the 'original' game.                         Capcom Vs. SNK Pro is, like many of the developer's creations, a            game of surprising depth. When you've been producing 2D beat 'em            ups for as long as they have, you learn a thing or two about how to            make a compelling one. As a blend of Capcom and SNK, the game            offers far more than just a handful of different characters, with            two distinctive combat dynamics and a total of 30 characters from            the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. It will take you            months to explore the intricacies of each and every one, even            though all the moves and such are laid bare in the game's manual.            Apart from learning how best to block, counter, combo and perform            special moves, the game boasts two fighting ~Grooves~ to master -            one for Capcom, and one for SNK. Both have you building up a gauge            as you attack, but the Capcom gauge grows with every blow, whilst            the SNK gauge pays attention only to heavy punches and kicks. When            the gauge is full, Capcom Groovers can unleash three levels of            spectacular Super Combos, but SNK Groovers are given only a few            seconds to perform Super Moves.                         Technically speaking, the game sits between good and bad - the            control system works beautifully on the PlayStation pad, which            features arguably the best directional pad of any console on the            market, but it can take an age to load even the character select            screen. The graphics offer nothing new, although the backgrounds            and fighters are sufficiently detailed, and while there are            multiple game modes, the only ones of substance are the basic            arcade, versus and pair (tag team) match modes - the others all            fall into the filler category, with options to unlock game art and            change your character's appearance amongst them.                    There's a tremendous amount of depth of gameplay hiding behind the            game's unassuming cover, but it's only really worth buying if you            don't own, can't afford, or don't want a PlayStation 2, or you            don't have a Dreamcast, or even a Saturn with a memory boosting            card. Becoming a truly great fighter will take you time, but you            may find that the game's single player mode holds little water once            you've become proficient, and finding suitably skilled opponents is            a bit of a lottery. After all, most of them will be off playing            Capcom Vs. SNK 2 on other systems\u2026"}
