{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/pocket-350", "date": "14 Sep 2006", "game_name": "Miami Vice", "text": "Welcome to 1980's Miami. Huge hair, giant sunglasses and girlssprawled over shiny red Lamborghinis. The streets are littered withdrug dealers and gun-toting thugs who can only be stopped by thecoolest vice squad in TV history. With such an iconic setting,you'll naturally be expecting a glitzy, attitude-packed game.And you won't be disappointed, at least not straight away. Theopening shot of Crocket & Tubbs posing on their Ferrari (backedby an interesting 'reworking' of the theme tune) sets a suitablyslick tone for the presentation which carries into the game proper.Although the top-down view makes the urban sprawl appear ant-sized,the various cars and citizens that wander around the builtenvironment are nonetheless well crafted, boasting numerous neatlittle animations and smart touches (like the exhaust fumes on carsor the chalk outline left when you run over a perp/innocentbystander).The character list, including the typically cheesy Italiangangsters, is good fun, too, and even the open-plan game structureis undeniably engaging, albeit somewhat familiar to anyone who'splayed Driv3r or the original Grand Theft Auto.Cast as Crockett, you have to high-tail it around Miami on footor in your sports car (or indeed anyone else's car), tracking downevidence and engaging in shoot-outs whilst trying to keep your carin good nick and generally stay alive. The missions themselves arepretty varied (from timed runs between check-points to chasing downgang vehicles) and follow a well-balanced curve, but cruciallyaren't vital to entertainment - you can chose to ignore thepolice work and goof around, causing traffic chaos or mowing downpedestrians if you prefer (although do be aware that you'll forfeithard cash for the latter).So far, so good-looking then. Unfortunately, after severalminutes of actual play it becomes apparent that the glamour herereally is about as deep as an average Miami Vice plot line and theexperience is riddled with annoying flaws. Flaws like theridiculously slow walking pace of your character, the lack of soundin-game, the excessively finicky driving controls and the annoyingyellow mission indication arrow which is only really of any usefrom a distance and becomes an annoyance as you home in on thevillains.What makes these flaws even more annoying is that the previouslymentioned games, which Miami Vice shamelessly borrows from, havemanaged to deal with all these issues so much better - ifyou're going to copy something at least get it right! Whilst noneof these is enough to ruin the game completely their own,collectively they make the game much easier to put down and thusrender it unlikely that many players will see the game through tothe later more engaging missions.Miami Vice is worth investigating for nostalgic purposes(although arguably more as a homage to Grand Theft Auto than the TVshow), but it's unlikely to arrest your attention for too long."}
