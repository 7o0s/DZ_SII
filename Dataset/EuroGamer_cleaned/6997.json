The first thing I should do as a fan of the Nocturne engine is            distance this game as far as possible from either Nocturne itself            or Rustin Parr, TRI's other title, which for me marked the high            point of the series, comparable to such trilogic openers as Die            Hard. I would compare it to The Legend of Coffin Rock, which lacked            flair, but even that doesn't really sinkt his low.                         The third Blair Witch title, entitled ~The Elly Kedward Tale~,            pretty much abandons any real relevance to the facts and figures            movie fans will care about, and casts you as Jonathan Prye, a            witch-hunter from the 18th Century, who has gone and lost his faith            in the Lord above. In order to overcome this droopy disposition, he            travels to Blair, only to discover that it has been abandoned, with            only a priest, constable and prisoners remaining, including a            charismatic witch. It pretty soon becomes your job to investigate            what became of Elly Kedward, who was banished from the town for            witchcraft and who, rumour has it, is responsible for the sudden            disappearance of the town's children. Of course, this is the least            of the town's worries. Cue buckets of atmosphere. Now where are            those dang buckets?                    The plot is fairly standard ~spooky~ guff, and you no longer feel            as though your actions are really helping to shape the story, more            that you're following a trail of breadcrumbs. Ritual aren't really            noted for their success with evolving storylines, but nonetheless            the material pretty much sells itself; I'd expected something            better.                         Random encounters make up the bulk of the game's action, and there            is also the odd boss or two, (complete with console-style health            bars) whom when dispatched offer some vital clue or turning point            in the story. Pretty old hat now. The ~random~ encounters are bit            too faked as well, with zombies appearing willy nilly and lumbering            toward you, until they get stuck on some fairly inconspicuous bit            of scenery, of course.                         Controlling Prye from a third person perspective, these vicious            encounters are as simple as could be, with some pretty intuitive            (and of course fully mappable) keyboard functions to keep you in            check. You can use the mouse in conjunction with the keyboard and            such as well.                         I never felt particularly restrained by the control system, but            I'll admit that there were definitely times when I felt it could            have been done a bit better. Anyone who has played Rune or a            similar third person action game will agree with me when I say that            this sort of control system can be done more or less            flawlessly these days. ~The Elly Kedward Tale~ isn't as good an            example as might have been expected.                    The Nocturne engine itself is also guilty of frustrating me ever so            slightly. The camera misbehaves quite a bit, with its            claustrophobic close-ups and the way it remains still irrespective            of your movement. Seeing off your enemies would be quite easy if            they had just backed the camera off a bit further. As it is            sometimes the display is a bit close, which can be maddening.                         I suppose one of the other reasons one might take issue with the            Nocturne technology is that unlike the other games, the action            is vaguely fast-paced, with lots of item retrieval, weapon            pick-ups, spells, quests and random encounters. This style, fairly            typical of Ritual's games, doesn't necessarily lend itself all that            well to Nocturne's plodding engine. If you run around a lot all the            camera switching can make things quite confusing.                         I grew tired quite quickly of pacing around the woods looking for            a rumble, even though I did have the likes of a blunderbuss at my            fingertips. The process of dealing with zombie after skeleton after            zombie after skeleton gradually became more and more laborious            until it outweighed my desire to find out what happened next. Quite            devastating for a plot-driven game, eh?                    Truth be told though, we can't blame Ritual's inability to produce            vaguely playable games alone for Elly Kedward's failings, a lot of            it comes down to bugs in the Nocturne code as well. Of course, as            if the presence of bugs wasn't maddening in itself, this is fairly            fundamental stuff. For instance, the ~use~ interface seems to            randomly break. No I don't know why. But if you have to unlock a            door or hit a switch, sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. The            workaround seems to be to switch to the point-and-click control            system briefly and use that.                         Another elementary problem is dead-ends. Dead-ends? That's right,            you can actually do things in Elly Kedward that require you to quit            and reload the game to get out of. You can lock yourself into rooms            that have no exits. You can get stuck in the scenery from time to            time, oh, and another dead-end is the way the game sometimes            crashes when you defeat certain bosses. Not a dead-end in the            classic sense, but one I have yet to find a workaround for.                         As for replay value? Forget it, once you've hacked to death a few            zombies there isn't much to tempt you back. There aren't any forks            in the plot, the execution is frustrating (rather like another of            Ritual's games, Sin, but lets not linger on that), and what with            the absence of multiplayer, this is one that will warm the shelf            more than the inner workings of your computer.                    If you have played through the first two Blair Witch titles and            desperately want another dosage, this just about sells itself. In            fact, if you fall into that category I doubt you've read this            review. However just about everyone else needn't apply - Elly            Kedward is a dreary, badly made game which offers no real closure            to the series and bears no relevance to either Blair Witch film. A            waste of your pennies, despite the reasonable price tag."}
