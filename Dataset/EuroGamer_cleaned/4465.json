On the day that it became widely            known that Sega is porting the three year old Sonic Adventure to            the GameCube, never more has it been so apparent that the balance            of power has shifted from Japan to the US for kleptomaniac thrills.                    Wisely, Sony elected to hold Sly Raccoon back, given that its going            for the same audience as Ratchet & Clank - and in this barren            desert also known as January, it more or less has the whole month            to itself. But is it really worth investing another \u00a340, when            you're probably still a few weeks away from paying off your festive            debts?        Featuring a lead character somewhat cooler than anyone in '80s            cartoon The Raccoons, Sly Cooper is the latest in the long line of            master thieves going back several family generations. Unfortunately            for the 18 year old, a gang of five thieves has nicked the family's            guide to sneakery, the legendary Thievius Raccoonus, and            annoyingly decided to hide bits of it all over the world - meaning            you've got to go and find them, in true utterly predictable            platform game style.                    Drawing inspiration from all the best platformers, and chucking in            a welcome element of stealth, Sly Raccoon does a good job of            attempting something a little different from the tired, generic            fare that is normally attached to this genre.                    Firstly on a visual level, it's nothing short of a revelation -            using a colourful cel shading technique that Sucker Punch has            described as ~Toon Shaded~, it comes closest to delivering a            cartoon gameworld of any title we've ever seen. Not only is every            level varied and well illustrated in an exaggerated 'Day Of The            Tentacle' sense, the way the scenery yields to Sly's movement gives            a very convincing impression of weight and often makes you react in            a similar fashion as platforms lurch forward under after a heavy            impact.        Similarly, the character designs are top drawer, featuring a            level of cute, yet grumpy cartoon menace rarely seen in a            videogame. Even the silly nonsensical noises they utter as they            prowl around adds to the experience, making it far less of a chore            to clear up each level. The understated humour runs throughout, and            saves the whole affair from degenerating into wacky irritation that            recent fodder like Ty did with crushing regularity.                    Sly Raccoon's chief innovation is its use of stealth within what is            otherwise a fairly straightforward collect 'em up. Tiny blue trails            give visual clues to areas that you can sneak around in, and            holding the circle button while in these areas gives Sly the            ability to tip toe upon narrow ledges, aiding him in his quest to            find coins, bottles, and eventually keys.                    But you're not punished too severely for slackness; often the game            will give you a second chance when hit, or picking up a horseshoe            will give you another chance to clobber an enemy or avoid the            numerous traps that proliferate each level. To begin with you'll            find dozens of ways to die - and it can be quite irritating to find            that a something as trivial as a bush can kill you outright, but in            other senses it forces you to pay attention to the attack patterns            of each enemy or trap. Mid level check points offer some respite            once you're past key sections - but if you lose all your lives,            it's back to the start.        Walking up to the            enemy unprepared is a fairly fraught and dangerous thing to do, but            don't expect some crude attempt at Splinter Cell. Most baddies            patrol small areas, and avoidance is normally a case of evading            their torch beams or line of sight. Some of the time you can sneak            past them undetected, but at other times attracting their attention            is unavoidable, and unless you go for the kill immediately, you'll            most likely be dead yourself as some of their projectiles are            lethal. Unfortunately, Sly's stick doesn't have much of a reach, so            it's a fairly straightforward case of waiting for them to unleash            their attack, hop out of the way and then bop them with your cane.                    Fortunately, it's not all about defeating drones. Peppered            throughout the levels are other deadly tricks and traps, normally            consisting of fire, or beams which set off alarms if you happen to            walk into them. Creeping past these beams is definitely            recommended, as otherwise they turn into flesh frying lasers of            death, causing Sly much pain and suffering if he touches them            again.                    To begin with, Sly's a bit crap, but as an ingenious reward for            persistence, you can potentially unlock a new move in every level.            Around each level are between 20 and 40 bottles - often hidden            inside scenery items or obscure locations. Each bottle hides a            clue, and once you have all of them, you have to high tail it back            to the level's safe to crack its combination. It's not always            essential to pick up every one in each level, but you'll be            grateful for having the ability to slow down time, or initiate a            fast roll attack. In plenty of situations, Sly's versatile ability            to grab hooks, perform Ninja jumps on tightropes and even grind            rails Tony Hawk style makes for a fun, fast paced experience.        As Sucker Punch will have no doubt learned from Jak &            Daxter, breaking up the platform kleptomania with sub games and            boss monsters is a formula worth replicating. Occasionally you'll            get to take part in mini-games, either as Sly or occasionally the            gormless, but loveable Murray the pink Hippo - meaning you get to            take a break from run and jump action and instead experience some            simple but welcome diversions (shooting, and racing, for example)            in order to progress. Likewise, each boss encounter throws up some            interesting ideas, and while never especially hard or            groundbreaking, they never outstay their welcome - unlike so many            ill judged games before them, even mixing in a pinch of rhythm            action in one memorable encounter!                    Fortunately, Sucker Punch has also learned that a decent camera            system is essential, and at virtually no stage have we come across            a situation where we couldn't see what was going on. The control            system mirrors that of Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank,            with the left stick handling movement, while right directs the            camera left and right - although you'll find yourself using it far            less than usual thanks to the game's superb way of almost always            giving the gamer the best view. And some clever level design often            shows off the visual splendour to maximum effect, with odd, but            pleasing camera angles.                    Taking into account the superbly judged playability, classy            visuals, variety, welcome element of stealth and replayability,            Sucker Punch has managed to ensure that Sly Raccoon is elevated            from being Just Another Platform Game\ufffd. There's not really            much you can knock Sly Raccoon for, apart from being maybe too easy            for some gamers (for the early part at least) and not especially            original. If you're not a platform game fan, then this probably            won't change your mind, but for everyone else, all you need to know            is it's the first game worth buying of the year."}
