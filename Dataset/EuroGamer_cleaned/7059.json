Games like Monster Truck Madness look to the American monster truck            passion for their inspiration, whilst 4x4 Evolution is more focused            on how much damage you can do on uneven terrain with a Land            Cruiser, yet both fall under the same generic umbrella.                         In deference to MTM, it has its fans, but on the whole, the best            way to impress your clientele is to give them jaw-dropping graphics            from every angle, and that means throwing them off cliffs, into the            ocean and over precipices until their knuckles ache from wrenching            the vehicle back and forth.                         And that's just what Terminal Reality have done with 4x4            Evolution. It's offroad action at its slickest, giving you one            objective, to get through checkpoints, and telling you and your            computer controlled opponents to do this in any way you see fit.            Thanks to the vivacity that TRI have injected into the locations            and the differing characteristics of the cars, finding the most            efficient way to get to your objective can be quite difficult, but            the rewards are great thanks to the World Rankings system, which            allows you to put yourself up against the world's finest by            uploading your lap times and high scores.                    The 3D engine Terminal Reality have developed was originally            intended for the Dreamcast, but with the PC now being given equal            status we're getting a vastly souped up interpretation, with highly            detailed, rolling polygonal landscapes and about 5,000 polygons per            vehicle. Everything is modelled realistically, right down to the            driver's heads turning left and right to follow the roadside            action.                         The lighting is very impressive also, and utterly dynamic,            following everything you do. If you knock over a barrel sitting on            the roadside, the shadows screw up and contort to reflect its            changing position, and even so the framerate remains constant. The            overall quality of presentation, and of graphical execution is            consistent. Real care has been afforded to every little detail, and            if you've ever seen one of the plethora of racers in real life, you            would be hard-pressed to spot any imperfections in the replication.            The multitude of camera angles explored by the post-race flyby            creates a spectacular visual event, one well worth watching through            once per track. It may even help you usurp paths through the ruckus            that you hadn't considered previously.                         As if the graphical excellence wasn't enough, aurally things are            suitably noisy also. The engines roar and the grit that flies up            from under your tyres scrabbles with onomatopoeic authenticity. The            audio/visual experience is second only to real-life.                    So we know that 4x4 looks great and sound fabulous, but just how            does it play? The answer is wonderfully. After a quick and            eventless installation process, I immediately jumped into the fray            by way of the Quick Race mode and drove around an oilfield-style            track offering with huge pilons all over the place and oil drums to            circumnavigate. Unlike other racers the checkpoints take the form            of converted scenery, so in this case I was trying to steer between            painted rocks, and although these can be a little difficult to            order numerically in your mind at times, there's a little green            arrow in the centre of the screen shows you the way to your next            'point, so you don't lose out as a result.                         Also on offer are Training, One-off Racing, Time Challenge and            Career Modes, which allow you to race for money in order to upgrade            your vehicle in between racers (or just buy a new vehicle            entirely). Between the various modes you will explore all 16            tracks, but hidden away on the CD is also a track editor, which            enables you to create your own and extend the life of the game            further than its sell-by date. I forsee these tracks becoming quite            popular on the Internet, and that can't help but increase the            popularity and longevity of the game even further.                    One of the things Terminal Reality were really striving for when            they were developing 4x4 was realism, and although the steering on            the vehicles is a touch heavy, it is an otherwise idyllic            elucidation of the offroad sport, with a perfectly fitting physics            engine and more than 50 licensed brands and makes for the various            cars, including those from Nissan, Toyota and others.                         Unfortunately this comes at a price, since the car manufacturers            don't like having their vehicles destroyed, so most of the            contracts will read that TRI have full rights to use the cars, but            they may not crash them, because the cars don't crash. Regardless            of how realistic an impression of the medium that is, it does mean            that if you throw your Land Cruiser into a wall the side-panelling            won't just shear off as you would expect. However, this is probably            a good thing considering the hoops you are expected to throw the            cars through on a track to track basis. It was either this or            limping home in a roll cage on stilts I should think.                         Another thing to hold against TRI is the computer AI. For a game            which focuses on cutthroat offroad racing, your opposition is            somewhat lacking. You can literally fall a few checkpoints behind            due to a dodgy shortcut and recover yourself. I had hoped to be            cursing with frustration over the insurmountable opposition, but            apparently it was not to be. In one instance, I fell into the            water, ran into a tree and missed two checkpoints and was forced to            backtrack, yet still managed to come second.                    As I've hinted at all along, 4x4 Evolution takes hold of the            offroad genre and gives it a frontrunner, something to aspire to.            Some people are bound to still have issues with it, but at the end            of the day it has jaw-dropping graphics, gripping gameplay and if            it weren't for the stodgy AI and lack of damage skins on vehicles,            the game would be untouchable. As it is it's the best of what's            available."}
