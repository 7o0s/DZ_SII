Ignoring the tried and trusted            conventions of, well, rules, Soccer Slam sees two teams of four            players (three 'characters' and an automated robot goalie) duking            it out on various tiny footy arenas worldwide, winning the ball            with no small amount of brutality and scoring with similar aplomb.                    What Black Box Games have done is match the speed, excitement and            feel of real football with an almost Speedball-esque air of            relentless violence. The control system has the traditional shot            (X), pass (A) and sprint (R) buttons, with the rest given over to            protecting the ball (Y), stealing/slide tackling (B) and powering            up (L). With the right timing, you can ~deke~ (Yank hockey-speak            for shimmy) past opponents and charge up your shots, or you can            slide or smack them silly on the defensive and regain possession.                    Turnover is often frantic - venture further forward than the            halfway line and you'll have to either pass or show your skills in            keeping away from aggressive defenders, otherwise you'll find            yourself on the ground in a heap, with frisky opposing forwards            racing towards the goal. If you can keep the ball and fancy a shot,            you can just tap X and watch the ball sail goalward, roughly in the            direction you indicated with the analogue stick, or for a better            chance of scoring you can charge a shot the whole way and your            player will flick the ball up and perform some acrobatic insanity,            volleying or heading the ball with significant pace. If you combine            this technique with a power-up, you're almost guaranteed a goal.                    Powering up is a good thing, because it speeds your player up (with            requisite graphical effect) and allows you to score with greater            ease, but building up your power-up bar right to the top is often a            better idea than blowing it in small quantities. After smashing            your way through the opposition, literally pummelling defenders and            deking your way in and out of midfield, you'll find yourself with a            full, beeping power bar and a cryptic message about ~Killer Kicks~.            From here you can send an aerial pass zooming into the sky, and            position an attacker below to batter-ram the ball home in slow            motion. From most positions, a Killer Kick can be slammed past the            keeper to add a goal to your tally.        It sounds unfair to have guaranteed scoring routes aplenty,            doesn't it? Well, if you keep possession long enough, you'll even            be able to bring about a Killer Kick scenario on your own as a            spotlight appears in the centre of the pitch. A shot in the            spotlight does much the same as a Killer Kick.                    The thing is, Sega Soccer Slam isn't meant to be a balanced, often            exciting but ultimately low-scoring game of football, wisely            leaving that territory to sims such as Pro Evolution Soccer. It's            an arcade hybrid - scores are high, tackles are fearsome, players            are characters with amusing back stories and wacky goal            celebrations, the commentator is a cockney impressionist with            one-liners by the dozen and the graphics are halfway between            cartoon and reality. Games are set in fantastical environments,            from rooftop pitches to arenas built out of bamboo in the shadow of            volcanoes, and the whole game drips of imagination and creativity.            Football this is not, as Graham Taylor might put it.                    But that doesn't mean it's not fun for fans of football - far from            it. In fact, given a couple of real players on each side (eminently            doable with the Xbox and Cube), you're in for a real treat. As you            might expect, you can control the whole team (switching players by            tapping A) or you can take direct control of individuals, and            playing this way cooperatively is one of the most enjoyable            experiences Sega has brought us in years. Perhaps even better than            the recent Beach Spikers and Virtua Tennis.        Unlike Beach Spikers though, Soccer Slam is a great deal of fun            even on your lonesome. You can of course take part in exhibition            games, and there are some neat mini-games on offer too (Hot Potato            has you trying to keep possession and 'banking' time on the ball by            passing it about, and Brawl is quite simply a beat 'em up), but the            meat of the game is in Quest mode. Here you take up one of the six            starting teams (with three more to unlock) and take part in a            worldwide season of football. At its most basic this mode is a            league table of the six teams, and you'll fight each of the others            at various international arenas on the way to beating Quest mode,            but there's actually more to it than that.                    See, winning games earns you money, as does taking part in the            little scoring events which pepper the single player game. With            this money, you can purchase upgrades for your players, like shark            jaw shinpads, metallic arm augmentations and so on - each item            affects one of your player's attributes, improving him or her for            the next game. Each team can buy different upgrades, and you can            actually see them in action. The fat Hawaiian bloke on the Tsunami            team gets the toothy shin guards, and the bouncy-chested lass gets            the bionic arms, for instance.                    Admittedly, quest mode will probably take you only a handful of            hours to complete, but beating it with each team (and thus            unlocking new stadia, players and other perks) is quite a            challenge. And you'll soon seize upon the opportunity to do so            cooperatively with one or two other players - where Soccer Slam is            absolutely at its best.        Looking at it objectively, by and large the only problem with            Soccer Slam is that you'll soon burn out. Since the game's American            release, we've absolutely drained it in single and multiplayer            modes, and it doesn't really get much of a look in these days.            Though we love it dearly, there isn't a great deal of subtlety at            the high end - you can up the speed and difficulty level, but this            only makes it harder to do what you'd normally do - and although            graphically very crisp and well defined, this betrays the way the            ball sticks to the player's feet. A very FIFA-esque trait, and one            that's unwelcome even in this arcade setting.                    Still, you'll have a lot of fun with it when you first get your            hands on it, and even those of you who just blew \u00a340 on Pro            Evolution Soccer 2 will find a home for its unique blend of footy            and fighting. Better than Midway's RedCard, and more violent than            the average ice hockey game, Sega Soccer Slam is pure arcade fun,            albeit not very long-lived."}
