Henceforth he'll            know not to bother you. A man that leaps around his own            living room brandishing a couple of pistols and taking out the            scourge of humanity with a wry grin and a schedule to keep isn't to            be messed about. Your boss knows that.                         Time Crisis 2 is one of my all-time favourite arcade games. The            pedal and gun system for ducking in and out of cover is the stuff            of gaming legends, and Namco have successfully recreated the Time            Crisis experience on PlayStation 2. The PS2 version has nicer            visuals, more things to do and plays just as well as the arcade            version. What more could a fan want? It also ships with the            light gun - GunCon 2 - for \u00a349.99. GunCon 2 is quite            ingenious. It plugs into one of the PlayStation 2's USB slots            (located just below the first controller port) and has a two-way            cable bridge. You plug the composite video cable into one side and            plug the other side into your TV. As a result the GunCon 2 is            extremely accurate, right down to the pixel. You get a decent            length of cable with it, and if you buy another GunCon 2 (or have            an old GunCon from the original PSX) you can hook it up and play            with a mate. Or, even better, play two-handed. You want the board's            respect, right?                         First of all we should address the graphics. Namco always does a            good job of arcade to console ports, and Time Crisis 2 is no            exception. Granted, it isn't a patch on the likes of Gran Turismo,            but it does still look pretty damn good and you can see where Namco            have made an effort and spruced things up a bit. Additions include            improved textures, higher polygon counts for the characters,            backgrounds and such, and clouds of dust that I swear I didn't see            in the arcade version.                    The point of Time Crisis 2 though is action, and less-complicated            graphics make it easier to pick out your target. At the start of            the game you and your partner (who can be controlled by the AI or            by another player via I-Link or split-screen) are plunged into a            world of crime. It seems to be a prerequisite in this genre that            your storyline be complete pants, and Time Crisis 2 knows not to            mess with tradition. The story is played out through unremarkable            cutscenes with bad voice-acting and unlikely scenarios, and            concerns somebody's attempts to take over the world. You and your            partner progress through the game capping bad guys with your            GunCons, and with each new situation you pick a protected spot. You            crouch behind this until you depress the button on the butt of the            GunCon 2, at which point you pop up and let rip. If they start to            shoot back or you run out of ammo, let go and you duck back down            and reload. Simple, really.                         Purists will want the real arcade experience though, which is            difficult to do. Apart from requiring a 38~ flatscreen TV, you also            need to think about the pedal. Fortunately, you can put your            disused Dual Shock 2 controller on the floor and tap the buttons on            and off like the pedal to the same effect. Quite novel, although            you want to be gentle with it, because bare-footed you will learn            to respect it as much as your son's strategically positioned Duplo            bricks, and otherwise you run the risk of using too much force and            stamping the poor thing into oblivion.                         Nonetheless, the GunCon 2 cover system works really well, and as            if marshalling that wasn't difficult enough, you often find            yourself in situations where popping up also has you moving slowly            forward, moving in and out of cover. This adds a dynamic element            missing from games like those of the lethargic Virtua Cop series.            Your partner also gets in the way now and then, or takes up a            ridiculous position more or less facing you. Making sure you don't            wound him is another clenched fist of excitement. Those Continues            don't last forever...                    One of the things it's hard not to find fault with though is the            game's length. Going the distance takes less than an hour if you            don't run out of Continues. There are three stages, each with its            own big boss, and there are a few heavily armoured cars and such to            overcome along the way as well, but it's not really enough. Even            those out of practice with the lightgun will triumph in a matter of            hours.                        Thankfully there's plenty beyond the Story Mode, starting with the            added incentive of the Best Times leaderboard. The faster and the            more accurately you complete a stage, the better placed you are on            the leaderboard. Among Time Crisis fans this is likely to add a lot            of replay value. Other game modes include One-Mission Select, which            lets you practice any mission from Story Mode that you have already            accessed, and four sub-games; Agent Trainer, Quick & Crash,            Shoot Away 2 and Crisis Mission. These range from standard target            practice and timed shoots with recorded accuracy to missions            specifically about avoiding civilian contact and beating the clock.                         The thing that really does it for me though is the two-player            mode. You can hook up two consoles using I-Link or you can just            plug in two guns and go at it on the same screen. This is great            because Time Crisis 2 also allows for people who like to play            two-handed. So if you fancy a bit of John Woo action, you're in            luck! This added several more hours of mindless blasting to the            action for me. It's just a shame you can't buy an authentic Time            Crisis pedal; maybe I can rig something that cut into my foot...                    Ultimately, Time Crisis 2 is a reasonably-priced fast-paced            lightgun game that pits your accuracy with a pistol and the speed            of your reactions against the clock. I bought it for a perfectly            acceptable \u00a349.99, including the GunCon 2, which commands            respect. It's an arcade-perfect conversion, with added bonuses            including new game modes and improved graphics, and it's all fully            customisable through the various options menus. It's all over far            too soon though, and before long it's not going to command your            attention for more than half an hour at a time. It may look okay,            but it's not an exceptionally detailed game, and it certainly could            have been. It's not a 60Hz game, either. Bring me the head of the            man responsible.                        Those things said, people will still find reasons to buy Time            Crisis 2. There is still nothing quite like the feeling of diving            out of cover with two guns at the ready, and everyone has at least            a few double-handed shootout fantasies to fulfil. The bottom line            is that this is the best lightgun game on any system at the            moment, it's just that lightgun games are pretty darned shallow. If            you want something with a prolonged narrative and want to take a            new experience away from every sitting, this isn't for you. But if            you like lightgun games and \u00a350 isn't too much for a game you            may only dip into for the odd hour here and there, you could do a            lot worse. It will certainly impress your mates."}
