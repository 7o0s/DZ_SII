In fact as soon as you load up the            game, there is a distinct arcade look and feel to the menus which            is both good and bad, but more on that later\u2026                         Sadly I think Capcom have skimped a little with this title, and            they have leant far more heavily on the Marvel side. As a result            many of the 20 characters available in the game are the Marvel            superheroes, and there are only a few of the classic Street            Fighter's left. Old favourites like Ryu, Chun Li and M. Bison are            in the game, but other than that it's a rather poor turnout for the            Street Fighter crew.             While this is a shame, it does                 make way for the more well known superheroes and quite a few                 which I had never heard of. Classic characters like SpiderMan,                 Venom, The Hulk, War Machine and Wolverine make up some of the                 more well known characters while Captain Commando, Jin and                 Morri make up some of the more unknown champions of peace.                         One thing that the game does bring to the mould is a tag team            style of play. Instead of selecting just one character, you get to            pick two. This brings with it some merits but it can make the game            a little more tactical (and possibly more difficult) to play. While            it can be a little confusing knowing who to pair with who in order            to create an unstoppable duo, it is certainly a great deal of fun            pairing some of the guys together. For example who would have            thought of SpiderMan fighting with his arch nemesis Venom as his            partner? Of course there is no limit (well almost no limit) to the            combinations and putting the diminutive Mega Man with the            dominating Hulk does tend to yield some interesting confrontations!                         Switching between the two characters is fairly easy, and can be            done at any time during a fight. It's probably not too surprising            to know that changing characters mid match can actually help you            get the win, which is probably why the computer does it every now            and again. Admittedly it does turn the game into a bit of a WWF            fest, but that's not necessarily a bad            thing. While there are 20 main                 characters to pick, there are a whole heap of other which take                 the form of 'support characters'. After you've picked your                 fighters the computer will randomly choose your 'celebrity'                 support. Once again these are drawn from another pool of                 superheroes, most of which are b-list Marvel stars. There are                 a few notable support characters like Cyclops and Iceman, and                 it is a shame that two such awesome fighters have been                 relegated to a support role. Oh well\u2026                         The game has a few play options, ranging from the classic arcade            style to the must have 'versus' mode, where you get to actually            play against your mates - should you have any that want to play            against you! One worthwhile inclusion is the training mode. This            allows you to check out all of the players against any other            computer controlled duo. There is no time limit to this and there            is no real health restriction as after any damage is sustained the            health bars of both the player and computer are restored to full.            You can also change characters mid fight, which allows you to            experiment with which characters do better against the others.                         On the graphical front I felt more than a little let down by            Marvel Vs. Capcom. I said earlier that the menu's had a very arcade            feel. Unfortunately they look rather dated and would certainly not            look uncommon on a SNES cart. Also the whole game looks distinctly            low res and certainly isn't pushing the DreamCast to its limits. It            is a shame, as in the face of the new breed of 3d style beat 'em            ups Marvel Vs. Capcom looks extremely old due to its graphics.            While it is very colourful it is a little grainy and some of the            textures could have done with a little more work.             On the sound front you can expect                 a cacophony of arcade style audio. With some classic samples                 of the characters such as Ryu's 'hado-yu-ken' adding a nice                 touch to the game. The rest of the samples are also very good,                 and as always can add a much needed bit of comic relief -                 especially when a character explodes into one of their awesome                 special moves. Music wise you can expect to be drowned in a                 sea of electronic music that harks of classic Japanese arcade                 classics, and after a while the 'tunes' can get extremely                 annoying, but that is hardly a rare occurrence with console                 games.                    Ultimately Marvel Vs. Capcom is eminently playable and thoroughly            good fun. I often find myself playing it if I'm going out and just            want something to occupy me for a short while before I go. It's            also good against your mates, and in that respect it owes a lot to            its ancestors which always managed to make playing against your            friends extremely entertaining.                         I have criticised the game, and I will stand by those criticisms.            It is fun, it is good but with a poor turnout from the Street            Fighter gang and graphics that no-one would call cutting edge it            has its flaws. After all is said and done Marvel Vs. Capcom will            undeniably find many fans amongst both hard core fight-fans and            console beat 'em up newbies.                        - Out Now"}
