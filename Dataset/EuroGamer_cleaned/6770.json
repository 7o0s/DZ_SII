In any other game, I might say that I'm            alone, but the world of Enclave is far from barren. Ahead of me are            some steps leading up to a wooden double-door, flanked on both            sides by marble pillars, with the partially-shredded standard of            some otherworldly tribe draped across the top of it. I think I can            see life on the battlements far above, but I can't be sure. To my            right, the familiar sight of barrels creeps into view, but above it            the wooden framework of a building juts out from the beautifully            detailed masonry, and beyond that sits a withered tree, the            incandescent light from several torches illuminating its contours            and the crumbled pavement just in front of it. The whole scene is            bathed in the eerie blue of nightfall, with shadows growing            steadily darker the further up the stony walls they creep.                         The world of Enclave certainly makes an impression.                         Enclave is a game I've been waiting for impatiently, and            staggeringly detailed visuals are just one part of its delectable            makeup. This highly anticipated third person fantasy adventure game            is easily the best of its ilk on Xbox, although admittedly that's            not saying much when its competition is Azurik and            Nightcaster\u2026 Nevertheless, it is very good, and unlike Halo's            paint-by-numbers approach to photorealistic texturing, with grass            breaking disjointedly into rockfaces, Enclave's world is virtually            seamless - even the clashing of sword and shield, and the swooping            of arrows is believable - and beyond its intricately detailed menu            systems and in-game cinematics, its high definition texturing,            abundant foliage and complex geometry, lurks a game marred only by            a few significant problems, most of which can be overlooked to some            extent.                    Once upon a fantasy yarn, the forces of evil rose up and attacked            the forces of good, and in order to end the machinations of the            outlanders, a wizard leapt up and opened a rift between the two            civilisations, segregating benevolence into its own little enclave,            which then grew to thrive. Unfortunately, the outlanders were            always jealous of those living in peace and serenity; as their            enemies flourished, their numbers also grew, and before long the            rift started to grow together once again, increasing the likelihood            of an invasion.                        Charitably speaking, it's a nice fantasy adventure with an obvious            trail to tread. If we're honest though, we weren't exactly bowled            over by the story. What makes the difference though, is that this            world is so vividly imagined that it's a joy to step into, and once            you've vanquished evil, Enclave turns the tale on its head and lets            you play from the perspective of the bad guys. The two quests see            you take on the roles of a lumbering swordsman, a dashing female            archer and others, before swapping robes with the enemy and            becoming a rampaging berserker, a dribbling orc, or some other            equally unpleasant character. Models for both good and bad are            equally impressive, and enemies you won't get to play as, not to            mention numerous NPCs, all fit their detailed environment with            smooth animations and heavyset expressions.                    As you play through the game's 25-odd levels, you take up the            mantle of several characters, depending on your preference, and            between missions you are given the opportunity to equip them with            numerous costly items. You can wander through levels quite quickly            after a few goes, but fleeing the obvious path often yields more            gold and health potions.                        Gold is vitally important, because you won't be much use if you            turn up to the final confrontation with only a puny dagger. Luckily            the nature of the game allows you to head back into levels you've            already completed in an attempt to rack up more gold, and if you            try to avoid tussles and play the straight and narrow, you may have            to do just this. Health potions are also worth watching out for,            because the lack of save points during levels can mean a lot of            repetition. Potions will help stave this off, but the inability to            save mid-level is the game's first major error.                        The two-stick control system with its logical left trigger shield,            right trigger sword method won't take too much getting used to, but            combat is simplistic and quite agonizing at times. Melee weapons            force you to move in and out, quickly dodging blows and landing            your own; trying to shield yourself from everything is only            conducive to getting swamped, and as the camera locks behind you            when you do this, you often have to trade off shield protection and            simply being able to see what you're doing. Similarly, ranged            weapons force you to back away endlessly or, if you're facing            archers, to duck in and out of cover. As such, the process of            fighting is an often laborious one and, in another blow, enemy and            character animations fail to highlight contact - the entire system            of registering hits is based on little hit point numbers which pop            up when contact is made. This smacks of laziness on the part of the            developer; by all means include it, but don't rely on it\u2026                    Level design is generally quite simple, but there is plenty of            variety in locations, even within single missions. For instance,            during the fifth level, the Divided City, you can slog your way            through the streets and cross the rift into the outlands, or if you            explore a bit more and rescue a wayward lass from the clutches of a            nasty orc, she'll open a gate for you so that you can cut out half            of your encounters and pick up a couple of potions before rejoining            the normal route half way across town. Some levels involve            escorting NPCs through ambushes and so forth, and these are pretty            tense encounters. Sadly though, there is rarely any change in pace,            and some of the objectives are needlessly repetitive - having to go            into a place, dispatch everybody and then head back out of it            through rooms freshly stocked with enemies is poor design,            especially when replaying missions due to a lack of save points is            a principle fixture of the gameplay.                         It wouldn't be so annoying if the difficulty level wasn't just the            wrong side of acceptable either, and the aforementioned fifth level            is a good example. You will use two or three potions by the time            you reach a heavily armoured berserker who takes an absolute age to            bump off, and all the while you're being pelted with explosives by            a group of Snotlings above you. Dispatching this vast menace and            then dying at the hands of an explosion you had no chance of            avoiding, and then having to replay the entire level, is a            recipe for pure frustration. I threw my pad away on several            occasions during both campaigns, and there was no need for that.            Enclave is a perfectly lengthy game without having to do everything            fourteen times.                         While we're on the subject of shortcomings, the shiny water effect            is perhaps a bit out of place here - amusingly, it looks too smooth            to fit into Enclave's rugged environments - and there's the odd            touch of slowdown when you're fighting multiple adversaries in an            area of complex geometry, but I didn't feel that it interfered too            often. In a sense, I'm clutching at straws. Deep down, I really            like Enclave. If you can overlook the repetition to a certain            extent, and fancy the prospect of delving into a richly detailed            fantasy world, nothing should stop you doing so, least of all a            half-baked water effect.                    It's a shame that Starbreeze made the errors it did with Enclave,            because the game is so very close to offering just the right            balance. If you enjoy the odd fantasy adventure now and then, you            should definitely give this a look. It's one of those games which            will happily fill a morning or an afternoon, and the beautiful,            seamless world set before you is enough to capture your attention            for hours, even if you do end up playing the same sections            repeatedly."}
