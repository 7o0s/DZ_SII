Instead the game has its            own storyline which is a montage of Bond stereotypes, and fans of            the books and films will find d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu on the lips of            every new character and in the objectives of every mission. Far            from annoying, it's what makes the game such an achievement. EA            have finally produced a Bond game worth its salt, after three            abortive attempts on the PlayStation.                         Agent Under Fire's tacky story leaves you with no doubt of its            ancestry. With the last few movies, simple motives like love and            revenge have driven our hero, and EA, not eager to take any chances            with a confusing thinking man's plot, have gone with a            standard-issue secret agent story. Bond's job is to undo the work            of a nefarious worldwide organisation with key genetic data on            world leaders. Their plan is to replace each leader with a cloned            sympathiser, with the overall aim of world domination. This will            not stand.                         So Agent Under Fire is a first person shooter first and foremost,            and beyond that it features classic Bond sections such as car            chases. Boasting a high framerate and a surprising lack of aliasing            or flickering, it makes a strong impression in the visuals            department within seconds of being fired up. The levels are            enormous, often filling the picture with polygons and intricately            detailed textures, and Bond's surroundings are also well lit.            Explosions are fairly common, and when they happen they flood the            screen with colour and have a tendency to startle. Bond himself is            The Matrix's residual self-image equivalent of several actors,            looking like every stereotypical secret agent in the world. As            always, he's sharply dressed thanks to some excellent cloth            animation, and along with the key players in the game his shape and            profile are in perfect harmony.                    The story is told through the use of in-game cutscenes, where the            extensive facial detail afforded to our hero becomes obvious. Each            character can show off a variety of emotions simply through facial            and body language, and of particular interest are the eye            movements. Zoe Nightshade has a particular way of looking seductive            using her eyes, and the Bond girls are all harshly curved and amply            endowed.                         Complementing the mostly excellent graphics is some fairly decent            voice acting. Unfortunately, although you may have seen John Cleese            on the TV advert bemoaning 007's ability to keep precious toys in            good condition, he along with Judy Dench and Pierce Brosnan all            escape the rigors of the recording booth, replaced instead by some            of half-rate clones. That said, they did do a good job, and unlike            in Confidential Mission, Time Crisis and a hundred other secret            agent 'em ups, there's no meaningless drone from the leading part.                         The music is somewhat less impressive though. You will already            have heard the classic Bond tune on the Agent Under Fire TV advert,            and if you plan to buy the game you will soon get used to it. EA            has clearly paid a premium for the music, and at every twist in the            plot and on-screen discovery, your ears are blown to smithereens by            another vibrant bombardment of Bond music. Apart from this niggle            though, Bond's adventures on the PlayStation 2 are good-looking and            sounding - just like the man himself in fact - but the real            question is how they play.                    Bond's orders come directly from M, either via intercom or in-game,            and each level has a definite objective, with a distinct lack of            distractions along the way. There are 'only' twelve levels in the            game, although each of them is huge and offers a varying challenge            depending on the skill level. As such it takes about ten hours to            complete the game, but the experience is nowhere near as involved            or continuously rewarding as in recent PS2 successes Half-Life and            Red Faction.                        Even the vaguest hint of stealth and the game becomes a pale shadow            to the great Metal Gear Solid, and the action sections, while            exciting, barely make up for this. The various gadgets and weapons            don't really compensate you either, with each verbal explanation            from Q branch a patronizing rant through the intercom. Bond does            make more than a fleeting appearance in other modes of            transportation, with some refreshing driving sections that really            show off the EA team's daring, but if you were in search of a            single point of failure to dwell on, it's the game's inability to            surprise the player. That's what made Half-Life, Red Faction, Metal            Gear Solid 2 and all those other action-adventure games exciting,            and EA's effort is strictly by the numbers. The best example is the            level design - it's not so much boring as built around what the            player might expect to do. It's as though the developers said, as a            Bond fan, what would you do with item X? For every single point.                        For example, in one section Bond and Nightshade are captured and            left in jail cells on a ship. This is a very typical Bond situation            and it's obvious that either magnetic-watch-swiping-keys,            flex-from-lightbulb-to-strangle-guard or playing possum will get            our heroes out of it, but none of that matters. Because a few            minutes ago you were told in nauseating detail about the Q-laser on            your watch. It's about the only new toy you have, and inevitably            getting out of the jail cell involves Q-lasering the lock, then            stealing the guard's gun from outside. To make matters worse, the            guard will completely ignore your actions, even if he is facing the            jail cell door. Ultimately, the single player campaign offers an            above average Bond adventure, but it lacks measure. Just like the            jail cell, every level is brimming with an obvious application for            your new Q-toys and weapons. And herein lies the problem, the game            is far too predictable, because your inventory is practically an            itinerary of the troubles in your path.                    Agent Under Fire does have its redeeming features though. For            starters, Bond's obvious arsenal of Q-gadgets is startlingly            complete. Amongst Bond's toys are a Wolfram P2K (that's your            Walther equivalent), The Golden Gun, Koffler & Stock KS7 (an            H&K equivalent), various grenades, a rocket launcher and a host            of other weapons, along with Q-decryptor, Q-claw, Q-specs, Q-card,            Q-jet, Q-laser and several others. There is plenty of mileage in            the practical arts of killing and spying, and you won't see it all            for a good few hours.                         Bond's control system is also remarkably simple, although there is            no keyboard and mouse support. You can customize the hell out of            the controls of course, but it's nicely responsive for a start, and            just as good as the Half-Life system I was praising not a week ago.                         Finally, there is the multiplayer mode. In strongest GoldenEye            tradition, Agent Under Fire is an absolute hoot in multiplayer,            with up to four Bonds at a time and plenty of multiplayer-specific            power-ups dotted around. Although it sacrifices a bit of detail, it            gets one up on its N64 forerunner by maintaining a perfectly            acceptable 30 frames per second. It also features an enormous level            of customisation. Of the various pre-designated modes, the            deathmatch equivalent 'Combat Training' is the best bet, with            Protect the Flag, Golden Gun (one shot kills), Anti-Terrorist            Training and Top Agent also on offer. You can lose a lot of time to            the multiplayer game, and it's worth it.                    Can Bond really save himself with a last minute reprieve? Well,            yes. Agent Under Fire is a good looking and sounding Bond adventure            with a splendid multiplayer side to it. The single player game is            well worth playing through once, even if you find yourself a mite            unimpressed from time to time by the events unfolding on-screen.            Repetitive? Okay. Predictable? Sure, but it's still a Bond            adventure, and thanks to the multiplayer mode there's some real            longevity here. If the last Bond game you played was GoldenEye,            it's time to freshen up.                        -                            Agent Under Fire screenshots                    Agent Under Fire screenshots"}
