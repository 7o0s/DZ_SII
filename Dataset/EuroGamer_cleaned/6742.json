Nevertheless, those of you as-yet uninitiated need            remember only two things: this is the sequel to those rightly            revered TOCA games on the PlayStation, and this time it's found a            plot.                             But before I get onto that, let's peg down the game's 'vital            stats' as it were. We're looking at 42 licensed touring and race            cars, from manufacturers like Peugeot, Ford, MG, Mercedes and so            on, scaling ever upward in terms of horsepower and aesthetic            beauty. You get to race them on 38 real-life courses, from shady            country retreats like Brands Hatch to major Grand Prix circuits            like Silverstone and all across the globe as far afield as            Hockenheim, Vancouver and various circuits in the United States. As            you might expect, the licensing doesn't end there, and fans will            recognise drivers like Jason Plato, James Thompson and Yvan Muller            just as readily as their cars.                             Continuing down the path of the expected, you'll find mostly            realistic physics (albeit at times quirky and more arcade-oriented            than its contemporaries), an advanced damage engine to highlight            those discarded bonnets, shattered windscreen and crumpled chassis,            and the ability to customise your car setup, either as you like or            according to your mechanic's detailed advice.                    Yet despite all this conventionality, Codemasters are, if you'll            excuse the pun, attempting to drive the genre forward this time            around. The big new feature is the plot. The game begins with old,            garbled footage of a speedway race, led by a magnificent and            unstoppable driver called McKane, who finishes first much to the            pleasure of the American ~announcers~. As he rockets past the            chequered flag though, he finds himself sideswiped by a            particularly antisocial competitor, and he spins off and perishes            in a ball of flames. In the stands, young Donnie and Ryan McKane            watch in horror, and twenty years later you step into the shoes of            Ryan as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his father and            older brother. So you join a team and get your first season in TOCA            off to a start at Brands Hatch, and having first met the players            (your English mechanic and porky American backer) you race.                             Sadly, the plot is rather forgettable stuff, borrowing from plenty            of driving films. It doesn't help that Ryan is a petulant yank with            little respect or time for others, nor that your arch nemesis is a            ferocious and eminently more likeable Brit with a gruff voice.            Furthermore, the game's love interest, the luscious Melanie,            happens to walk like a demented penguin and appears to sport a            moustache - she does a fine line in comebacks though, but that just            serves to make Ryan look like even more of an arse.                             Still, the way the Codies have built the game around the plot is            quite intelligent. Your office serves as the game's main menu, and            from here you can go for a ride, play some multiplayer, admire your            trophy collection and examine the world map. Or, you can plug into            your computer and embark upon a season's racing, by responding            affirmatively to emails from interested teams. Your garage is            another menu, and you can tweak your car here, test drive it or            just head out for the race.                    Your first season is TOCA, and serves as a nice way to get used to            the controls, car handling and AI behaviour. Tracks are lifted from            real-life, and you start on Brands - one of the simplest and most            enjoyable courses there is - but diving into the first corner is            still a bit too much like trotting up to the five-metre board            during your first swimming lesson. Nevertheless, as you gradually            improve you'll finish the season and find yourself inundated with            offers from other teams, and invitations to take part in pre-season            exhibition races for fame and fortune. Before long you'll have            fought enough seasons and picked up enough points to advance to the            next tier of competition, where the cars are faster, the AI is            tougher and the tracks are further abroad. Your ultimate goal is to            win enough races to reach the Lola world circuit and become World            Champion.                             In the process, the plot will ebb and flow accordingly. Cutscenes            are interspersed between races depending on what you did on the            track and where you are in the narrative, and although we'd have            preferred slightly fewer moaning yanks, the cutscenes are all            conducted in their own little engine and very well animated, not to            mention surprisingly well voice-acted. Facial detail on every            character is as fine as we've seen on any system, and body language            (apart from the aforementioned waddling love interest) is decidedly            realistic.                             The problem with the plot though is that Ryan is a disagreeable            young scamp. He's a person I would be unlikely to want to speak to,            let alone emulate, and throughout the game I never really felt            emotionally attached. Dealing with the loss of a father is tough,            but showing a bit of common bleedin' courtesy and possessing            emotional depth beyond teenage tantrums is not.                    All of which leaves me with what happens on the track, and            unfortunately it's a jumble of almost goodness and significant            disappointment. The racing does not match the presentation for a            start. The graphics look like high-end PSone, and it's clear that            all the screenshots we've so admired came from the replays, which            cram more detail into the picture but at the expense of a smooth            framerate. On the track, textures are simple and invariable and            cars are blocky until you get up-close. Roaring down the home            straight at Brands or Donnington, you could be forgiven for            wondering where all the polygons went.                             TOCA plays quite well, but it isn't as realistic as Gran Turismo            thanks to the heavily emphasized arcade sentiment, which            paradoxically introduces a steep learning curve, and this will            probably throw casual racers before it gets exciting. This is            mainly because of some abnormal car behaviour - brake late into a            sharp bend for example, and avoiding a trip to the gravel is a case            of hitting the gas hard and finding some inexplicably convenient            oversteer. However, the AI is nicely balanced, and you can pull            ahead of it if you drive really well, although at times you wonder            if it isn't a bit too limp to deal with you. Grid spaces are            allotted seemingly at random to keep the game flowing, so most of            the ~action~ is artificial. Had you qualified yourself to the front            of the grid, you would probably never have seen those on your tail.                             One thing that does stand true about TOCA though is that all this            plot injection, grid generation, vendetta clutching and other            hyperbole does help to create and cultivate a genuinely            unconventional racing game. Whether or not it hits the spot is            debateable, but there is a definite market for this, and we can            imagine the sequel learning from its various mistakes and            delivering a great deal more.                    TOCA Race Driver is a nice step forward for the series, but            simulation fans will find the car handling and behaviour            off-putting. Compared to GT Concept the visuals are like a trip            back in time, and of course there's no shortage of superior racing            games available on PlayStation 2 already. On the other hand, we            certainly enjoyed the game at times, and if you're sick of choosing            between ~championship mode~ and ~time trial~ to quench your thirst            for speed, you could do a lot worse than give TOCA a look."}
