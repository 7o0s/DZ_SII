As of late though it would                 appear a lot more care and attention is being paid to the                 games based around it.                    The Fallen is centered around a five horse race to find three lost            red orbs of the Pah-wraiths, orbs that when collected together give            their owner the power to destroy the universe. It is down to            Captain Sisko and his crew to get to the three orbs first, and to            avert the potential catastrophe from getting past the starting            blocks. Along the way you will be up against the Cardassians, the            Dominion, a rogue Bajoran sect, and an unknown race of            bio-analogous aliens known as the Grigari. Taking the role of            Captain Benjamin Sisko, Major Kira Nerys or Lt Commander Worf you            effectively have three completely separate single player games            rolled into one, but all centred around the exact same storyline.                    The whole thing uses the excellent Unreal Tournament engine to            great effect. Setting foot on the worlds of The Fallen for the            first time as Sisko is an impressive experience, with the ship you            have boarded left in almost total darkness, creating a brilliant            sense of foreboding. Any light that there is reflects beautifully            off your white spacesuit, and with faulty machinery sending out            sparks and arcs of blue electricity, it makes for a pretty gloomy            and atmospheric opening to the game.                         Indeed this is the way the game plays throughout, with a large                 focus on giving you the heebie-jeebies wherever you go. It is                 very hard to convey just how much the game gets into your                 bloodstream and really grabs a hold, having you genuinely                 scared and creeping around everywhere like some sort of wussy!                    Gameplay is the usual ~locked door needs a button pushed somewhere            to open it~ type of deal, with the puzzling element in general            never really taxing the brain to any extent. In all honesty though            it is not the main focus of the game, with the bulk of the game            enjoyment stemming from the rock solid storyline and the combat            during its unfolding. Not only do you get to play through three            individual adventures, but the variety of missions and their            locations is exceptionally good, with you fighting Cardassians on            DS9 one minute, and scaring yourself silly in the highly            atmospheric temple level the next!                    It is only when you have played through the game as one character            and begun to play through the game again as another that you can            fully appreciate just how cleverly the game has been designed to            intertwine the main story into three unique adventures.            Communicator conversations that you heard the first time round will            be heard again, but this time you will become directly involved            with another part of the process. You will also find that            situations which did not make too much sense before now become            crystal clear.         Weaponry is of course a vital part of the game, but oddly                 enough you will almost certainly find yourself using the                 phaser for the most part, although I think this is mostly                 thanks to the scant amount of ammo available to you for the                 other weapons. As the Klingon Worf you do of course get to                 slice enemies up with the razor edged Bat'leth, which I have                 to admit is extremely entertaining. I may need to seek                 professional help I guess...                    Fighting the Grigari is slightly more complex, as you will need to            use a combination of your phaser and Tri-corder to penetrate their            shields. The Tri-corder is a brilliant feature of the game,            enabling you to scan the immediate vicinity for any lifeform            movement, hidden switches and other goodies, but perhaps its most            important role is the ability to isolate a force field frequency.            Once this figure has been registered your phaser will automatically            adjust itself to that frequency to enable you to break through the            field.                    The enemy AI is generally very good, with the Cardassians in            particular being extremely sharp shooters, and those with personal            cloaking devices making your life even harder, while the Grigari            are tough to take down and will track you mercilessly with their            thin laser sensor - I eventually started to dread coming across            these. Occasionally the AI does go haywire though, for example when            Cardassian security guards are supposed to be shooting you on sight            but instead carry on as if nothing had happened .. which is nice of            them considering that I had just wiped out most of their comrades!         Not                 enough can be said about the atmosphere of the game, with its                 dark levels really giving you the feeling that you just want                 to get out of there. The ability to wander through the main                 bridge of Deep Space Nine and the bar on the lower decks is                 just one of the neat graphical treats you are in for, although                 the framerate does take a noticeable dip on these sections.                    Character detail is very good, and all of the main characters are            instantly recognisable, while the alien lifeforms look excellent            too. I was thinking that it would be a hard job to recreate the            pimpled squared features of the Cardassians, but the artists and            designers have done a brilliant job. The cutscenes all use the game            engine and serve to help the story along nicely, handling large            renders like the space station itself extremely well.                    Meanwhile all of the character voices are provided by the real            stars of the television series, and as such the acting is generally            of a very high quality, though sometimes the conversations can flow            a little unevenly. But most impressive of all has to be the            soundtrack, which really does compliment the eerie atmosphere of            the game perfectly. Even though there is not a wide variety of            music, what there is seems to fit each particular scene perfectly.         Playing through the                 game once is a pleasure in itself, but having the added bonus                 of two more characters to complete the game with gives                 astounding value for money. A solid storyline backed by                 hauntingly good graphics and sound, with entertaining combat                 and weaponry make this a hard game to put down.                    The only disappointment is the lack of a multiplayer option, but to            be quite honest single player is so darned good it does not really            pose a problem, as you will probably be playing it for weeks. Deep            Space Nine : The Fallen is an excellent romp that will have you on            the edge of your seat and wanting more .. the difference being that            you do get more - you get three times the fun. Set            co-ordinates for your local software retailer .. make it so!"}
