You play the role of one Dave Cooper, an investigative journalist            (and seemingly part-time vigilante and ghost-hunter) who works for            the eponymous television show, ~The Devil Inside~. Hosted by one            Jack T. Ripper, this is a glitzy, glamorous show that delves deep            into the disgusting dungeons to bring the viewers in, with a camera            man following Dave as he blasts his way through zombies and other            undesirables.                    However, Jack is a rather renegade fellow, and from the comfort of            his studio he has no qualms with forcing Dave into increasingly            dangerous situations to boost the show's ratings and please the            live studio audience, whose cheers can be heard at times during the            game.                         It's not always Dave that Jack is dealing with either - Dave                 can morph into his alter ego, Deva, a female demon who                 possesses magical abilities that improve as the game                 progresses, including the ability to fly. A cast of secondary                 characters is also featured, not least , a scientist devoted                 to the mystery of the undead and unexplained.                    In fact the whole storyline is rather original - the implications            of entertainment over human safety are well displayed in the course            of the game, making the player feel like both a brain dead TV            addict vying for more cheap thrills, and an entertainer in search            of fame. Throw in a bit of gunplay and zombies, and you've got the            Devil Inside.                    The game's atmosphere though is derived from the Alone In The Dark            series. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - it's not as if it is            shamelessly ripped off, but instead it is endorsed and worked on by            the man himself. And from the first glimpse of the haunted mansion            where the majority of the game is set, you can tell you are really            playing an Alone In The Dark for the 21st Century.                    Other settings include an old mine and a series of graveyards, all            reeking of atmosphere and rotting flesh, and full of icky, sticky,            gooey zombies. The default control method, which is rather unusual            for a third person game, is using the keys to run and crouch, and            the mouse to aim and shoot. After a few minutes getting used to            this though I was blasting away pieces of undead mayhem with the            best of them.         The enemies I was shooting also suffer no lack of imagination            - from the run-of-the-mill generic zombies to flying ghouls and            demons composed of electric wires (with a plug for a hat), the            imagination possessed by the Cryo team is admirable.                    Localised damage is another plus - blasting the legs off of zombies            and then watching the paraplegic parasites crawling towards you            isn't an image that you will forget in a hurry. Even the abdomen            and head can be blown off, severed or torched, and you can punch            big holes in their chests with the shotgun. This, far from being            simply eye candy, is a thoughtful and enjoyable addition to the            game.                    Further proof of the designers' acumen is the array of weapons, my            personal favourite being a disc saw used to rip apart the nasties.            Meanwhile Dave's alter ego Deva is needed to fly through a few            parts of the game, and possesses huge balls of magick propelled            from her hands. Playing with a different set of skills all adds to            the challenge, and it's touches like this that set it apart from            games like Resident Evil and Tomb Raider.         One aspect that                 came very close to ruining the game for me though was the                 puzzles. Many of them are excellent additions to the game, and                 without them it would be a whole lot worse, but many were                 poorly thought out.                    For example, to breach the first gate in the game, you have to            scour the gardens for a key. This would be fine if it was placed            logically, for example at the feet of a tough enemy, or hidden in a            shed, but instead it is at the far boundary near a hedge.                    This happens more than once, and even some of the more entertaining            puzzles (such as finding your way through a poorly lit attic) smack            of laziness and poor foresight. It's a reasonably major complaint,            but fortunately Cryo have done enough to ensure that most gamers            will overlook this.         If you are a fan of                 Alone In The Dark, and are longing for some more                 French-influenced zombie fun, you will probably want to snap                 this up right away. You will need a decent computer to make                 the most of it though - if you play this on anything less than                 a Pentium II 400 with a decent 3D accelerator card you will be                 sorry.                    But if you have the hardware, go get the software."}
