And if we'd never played it, we'd be            wondering the same thing. But we have, and our lives have never            been quite the same since. How on earth could Sega hope to cram in            all that instant playability and bottomless depth into a handheld            version?                    Happily, this is not one of those loveless ports. Contained within            are all the modes that fans of the full game could wish for,            including a selection of training mini-games. The game is split up            into the traditional Tournament, Exhibition and World Tour modes,            with four levels of skill, 12 CPU opponents (six men, six women,            with presumably a couple of super-skilful opponents once you've            defeated World Tour), three types of surface (Clay, Grass, Hard),            and various options to vary the number of games/tie break.        Tournament and            Exhibition are the staple diet of the proceedings, and barely need            an explanation. Simply decide whether you want to play singles or            doubles, set the number of games (up to six), the difficulty level,            select your opponent, the type of court, and off you go. The game            is almost ridiculously simple. Just you, a racket, two buttons (A            for top spin, B for Lob shot, L and R for calling out doubles            commands, and the D-pad for movement) and a mindful of evil shots            that you will inflict mercilessly upon your hapless opponent. Well,            that's the plan, at any rate, but the CPU opponents are pretty            good. Sadly, the licensing of known players hasn't extended to this            version, with the exception of the Williams sisters, who are            featured on the box art, natch. Each player has its own set of            skills, and you're advised of their strengths, such as 'Powerful            Strokes', 'Hard Hitter', 'Big Server' and so on, and you'll soon            discover which ones are cannon fodder, and which are the tricky            ones.                    For the committed among you, World Tour is where the real            one-player action is. Starting as a relative rookie with no skills            to speak of, ranked 300th in the world, the ultimate aim is to worm            your way up the ladder, as either a man or a woman. The world map            tells you of the current singles and doubles tournaments you can            enter, and then it's up to you to either plump for those to earn            some cash and increase your ranking, or enter the training games.            Once you've amassed a booty of cash, you can then go off to the            shop and spend your winnings on improving your equipment, which in            turn helps boost the stats of your player, and thus your chances of            climbing the ladder further.                    Another way of improving the many capabilities of your player(s) is            to indulge yourself in one of the ten slightly oddball mini-games.            Each is designed to improve certain aspects of your game, including            footwork, speed, control, stamina, technique and jumping. Sounds            reasonable, but once you enter into them, they're all as quirky and            amusing as you'll remember from previous versions of the game, such            as Tank Attack, which has you running around returning a ball back            to a moving tank to 'destroy' it within a preset time limit, Egg            Crasher, which has you serving as accurately as possible to smash            one of three giant eggs, or how about Burger Chef? Serve onto a            chequered board in order to select the ingredients for the perfect            burger. Hmmmm. All superb, irreverent fun, and the kind of            lightweight distractions that are perfect for handheld gaming.                    The actual Tennis is also a surprisingly good approximation of the            old versions of VT, with the exact same serve mechanic (tap A to            throw the ball up, tap again to set the power and point it in the            direction required) and much the same playability. Due to the            relative lack of animation the fluidity isn't quite there, but the            same instinctive play seems possible, although our rookie            absolutely sucked during the early part of Word Tour, constantly            spooning the ball up in the air, and utterly lacking any power,            speed or conviction, but that's up to you to work on.                    Multi-player will be down to you and bunch of your mates all going            out and buying it en masse; a scenario we're not sure is likely            given the prohibitively high cost. But if you've all got the            required funds, then we can foresee that this could conceivably be            one of the all time best link-up games on the GBA. Certainly,            four-player sessions on the original are still a regular staple of            our gaming diet, and we can imagine this would be almost too much            fun. But as you'll have guessed, we've not got four copies and four            GBAs to test it out, so allow us to speculate on its greatness.                    For all its features, there are a few issues that'll make            you question your need to own this game. Visually it could never            even hope to compete with its grown up brother, but although Altron            has done a fair job of making the players move convincingly, the            inherent lack of animation compromises your player's freedom. For            example, on the original, if you hit the shot button anywhere near            the ball, the game would always try to reach a shot, even if it            meant performing skin shredding dives to do so. However, in the GBA            version the capabilities of your player are much more restricted;            while they'll reach a little bit, there's none of the diving and            lunging dramatics that you're used to. While we appreciate there            are always going to be compromises in a handheld version of a game            with so much animation in it, when it's such an integral part of            what made the original so slick, playable and intuitive, you're            still justified in feeling a pang of disappointment.                    Having said that, taken in isolation, it's easily the best handheld            Tennis game, and once you get over the inevitable (and possibly            unfair) comparisons you're left with a game that's going to            brighten up a lot of dull journeys for a long time to come,            especially if you've got a mate who's up for some link-up action.
