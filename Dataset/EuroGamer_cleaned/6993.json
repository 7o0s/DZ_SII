Of course, owners of Sega's Saturn were utterly distraught by the            release. In Japan, the game had been released on the Saturn quite            early on, along with other monumentally popular RPGs like Shining            Force III and the Saturn's version of Phantasy Star (the online            sequel to which Sega are in the process of launching right now),            which have never seen translation in any territory outside of            Japan.                         Despite this, the game was still played by many who struggled with            shoddily translated texts distributed on the Internet and other            guides. It's very hard to play an RPG with quite as much devotion            though when every so often you have to hit the next button on            Internet Explorer to load up the next page of dialogue. Training            yourself not to skip ahead is a challenge unto itself.                         It's fair to say then, that Dreamcast owners deserve a brilliant            sequel to Grandia II, and in our opinion, this is it. However, it            is not without flaws, and the flaws are going to make it very            difficult for fans of the series that have been lusting after this            game for so long to enjoy it.                         For starters, Grandia II hasn't sold well in Japan. That sets the            warning klaxons firing in itself, but upon closer inspection (and            certainly for the entire first afternoon of playing it), we had no            idea why this could be. The game seemed to precisely what we had            hoped for: it features a loveable lead character; it quickly            introduces an obvious romantic interest; the dialogue is pretty            well founded and occasionally very witty, and the voiceovers while            occasionally suffering from incorrect-tone syndrome, are on the            whole exceptional.                         Nonetheless, it dawned on us at about the three-hour mark just why            the Japanese hadn't lapped it up.                    This seemed rather improbable, because, when faced with an absolute            sure-fire hit from coast-to-coast, one does not employ writers from            the old school. That's right, despite years of preparation; Grandia            II employs the classic 'collect lots of items until you face the            final battle' methodology, and it makes the developers look out of            touch with the RPG scene. It's as predictable as this evening's            dinner, which I have already purchased.                         Basically, you control a young GeoHound called Ryudo, and his            trusty winged sidekick Skye. A GeoHound is like a modern-day            mercenary, who performs murderous tasks for money and shows no            remorse. The occupants of the Grandia world generally respect them            for fear of the consequences of not doing so, if you catch my            drift. Anyway, Ryudo and Skye arrive back at home camp after a few            weeks of perilous money-grabbing, and chance upon an interesting            proposition from a Priest of the Church of Granas. Granas left            several marks on the planet before slinking back into Godly            anonymity, most obviously the enormous trench that his mighty wrath            dug like an equator when he rid the world of the evil God Valmar.            His religious followers pride themselves on goodliness, hence            Ryudo's surprise at the remarkable invitation.                         In the process of performing his duties, he meets a delightful            young maiden called Elena, who is promptly swept from his grasp by            the evil forces of Valmar, during the ceremony he was paid to            escort her to and from. Before long he is caught up in a struggle            to free her, and the world's ancient religious origins come back to            haunt him.                         Fanatical Grandia lovers may be disappointed with the story, which            is a touch corny and rather obvious, and God only knows what they            will make about the linearity. There are a lot of places to go and            things to see in Grandia II, but steering off the obvious path is            not one of your options.                         As we said, the translation from Japanese to English is top            quality, with some inspirational scripting at times. There aren't            many belly-laughs, but there is some mind-bending philosophy to            mull over, particularly from Mareg. The Americanised voiceovers one            can take or leave, but I found it rather unsatisfactory that only            some of the lines were voiced over. Why weren't they all?            Why are players forced to scroll through pages of text and only            receive voiceovers every once in a while? There's sure as hell a            lot of text in the game, but others have managed it\u2026                    Hardcore fans of the series will have rightfully expected something            more from the game, but we would defy even them to take issue with            the game's refined battle system.                         First off, random encounters have no place here. If you can avoid            the monsters you see crawling and walking around, you can avoid            confrontations entirely. Ironically though, thanks to the strength            of this area of the game, Grandia II becomes one of the first RPGs            I've played in a long time where I wouldn't have objected to random            battles. The enemies can be clearly seen moping around the            landscape, and with a little camera management can be avoided            easily. Of course, there's the odd scripted section where enemies            ambush you, but on the whole if you spot one and wait for it to            turn away, you can either dash by, or surprise it enough to get the            first blow in.                         The battle system itself switches to the turn-based view, and upon            doing so, the player is forced to take several things into account.            Firstly, the IP meter, which shows how you, the other members of            your party and your enemies are powering up. Once you or they reach            the action point, you can select your attack. At this stage,            the second and third important factors in each battle come into            consideration. How far away is the enemy, and which move would be            best, based on the established distance.                         You see, if you select a Combo move, for example, you will dash up            to your enemy and pound him with whichever weapon you happen to            have handy, but if you don't get to them before they reach their            action stage, the chances are they could quite easily counter your            manoeuvre, nullifying it and smacking you about the place a bit in            the process. The move they will have employed, incidentally, is            known as a Critical. When your enemy selects an action, spell or            whatever, if you reach the action phase before they have had time            to execute it, you can use a Critical to render their attack            useless, providing you can intercept them in time. Doing this can            actually lead to you taking no damage at all from certain            encounters.                    The real fun starts when you have multiple party members and            multiple assailants. Launching a perfect offensive in conjunction            with your colleagues is about as close to utopia as I've been. It's            devastatingly effective, and will get your levels up quicker than            anything.                         Other benefits of regular confrontations are the actual rewards.            Obviously you gain experience points, something that becomes            incredibly important later on in the game, but aside from that, you            also collect things like mana eggs, magic and skill coins and skill            books. As with Grandia the original, you equip mana eggs to learn            magic, but magic coins supplement this by improving the efficiency            of your spells and such. Skill coins work in a similar manner,            improving character-specific special attacks. Skill books            can teach character secondary moves and enhance endurance.                         In this sense, after a time every battle is an entirely unique            experience. The level of customisation you can effect on your party            is immeasurable, and so in spite of the linear plotline and            disappointing story, replay value is rife. I've played the game            pretty much the whole way through twice now, and on both occasions            I was able to use different approaches to each situation.                         Graphically, Grandia II improves where the first left off, too.            Originally, Grandia used lush 3D backgrounds with some charming 2D            visuals in the foreground, but the sequel is a truly            three-dimensional experience, as demonstrated by the way you            control the camera with the shoulder buttons. Sidling around towns            and other areas is simply breathtaking - not only are your            characters' movements fluidic and beautifully animated, but the            surrounding ebb and flow with your every move. Although it's a            pretty predictable universe, it's a tremendously elegant one.                         We would put it on a par with some of the Final Fantasy games, and            it has a soundtrack to match, too. Perhaps it will even give some            people cause to show a little jealousy. Namely PlayStation fans who            stuck their noses up at the DC thanks to its poor showing of            Western RPGs.                    At the moment, Grandia II is the best RPG available on the            Dreamcast in Europe, and we strongly recommend you play it. Yet for            all its strengths, we can't shake the conviction that the fact that            every quality lies behind a twisted, yet predictable storyline will            make the game inaccessible to most RPG-heads. Grandia II is an            incredibly tough game to call - we hope it prospers enough for Game            Arts to see their way through to a sequel, but if it flops in the            West, it will be obvious why."}
