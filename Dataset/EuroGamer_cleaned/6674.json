The relentless killathons of            old, like Gremlin's long forgotten Loaded and the thousands of 2D            shooters of the 8 and 16-bit era are but fond memories of the days            before RSI crippled ageing gamers everywhere.                    But Gungrave unashamedly dusts off the template of 'kill everything            in sight', dresses it up in Trigun creator Yasuhiro Nightow's            supremely stylish Manga clothes, and asks the player to create as            much carnage as possible across ~six intense stages fighting waves            of gun-toting thugs~.                    The story makes little sense, but graphic novel fans will no doubt            buy into it: you're an undead assassin by the name of Grave, sent            to destroy a shady criminal organisation. Each level is            interspersed with various cut scenes that are top quality, but            subtitled - sparing us the hell of dreadful English voiceovers at            least.                    In between levels you get to engage in fairly pointless            conversations, but they fail to offer any insight - it's simply            there to deliver more background information and take up a bit more            of your time.        So what of the game? It's hardly what you'd describe as            complex. After a week playing the intricate Splinter Cell, this is            almost the polar opposite. Essentially the guide to playing            Gungrave is as follows: move around the coffin carrying Grave with            the left stick, shoot at the numerous oncoming enemies with your            dual pistols by pressing square rapidly, and target them            individually with L1. You can fire a limited number of special            weapons to dispense with particularly stubborn baddies (or big            groups of them). If you get crowded out by enemies, then you can            swing your coffin by tapping R1, or alternatively hit circle and            run away if you're taking a bit of a pounding.                    The health system has a little in common with Halo's; with a            rechargeable shield giving you initial protection. Allowing your            shields to recharge fully allows you to plough through most            situations unscathed, although rocket firing baddies and the            increasingly tough boss monsters at the end of each level will test            you to the limit.                    The thing that strikes you immediately about Gungrave is its superb            graphics. The FMV sequences set the scene beautifully - especially            if you're a fan of Nightow's work, and thoughtfully they never go            on in the way that so many Japanese games believe is mandatory. The            in game visuals make a pleasant change too, and the stylised, well            animated, Manga look gives the game a character more in keeping            with graphic novels than videogames. Being a balls out shooter,            just about everything can be destroyed, so stationary scenery such            as barrels and vehicles all blow up spectacularly if you feel the            need to wage some destruction. It often helps to just blow the crap            out of everything, as enemies tend to use scenery as cover, and it            adds a level of satisfaction to the gratuitous carnage, and to top            it all you get rewarded at the end of the level for clearing -            resulting in weapons power-ups.        But the            initial impressive feelings of exciting relentless action give way            to sterile boredom once the repetitive - and on rails - nature of            the gameplay becomes apparent. Given that there are only six            levels, to find ourselves on level five on our first go wasn't an            especially promising sign - after less than three hours. Ok, there            are harder difficulty levels, but the overriding issue is that            there's just not enough to keep you interested for any great length            of time. Each level is one long winding path, and there's no need            to worry about locked doors or anything even remotely resembling            puzzle solving. It's just a case of blamblam blam blam blam,            blammablamblam, until you either finish the level or you're too            bored to notice those rocket wielding enemies behind you. If you            die, you're given unlimited continues to keep ploughing through,            but it was level four by the time we experienced one death - and            that was on the boss.                    Admittedly, the latter bosses are quite entertaining, and well            realised in the top notch visuals department, but the attack            patterns are hardly groundbreaking. It's all been seen and done            before in dozens of better games over the decades.                    At times Gungrave feels as ho-hum and pointless as that disgrace to            software State Of Emergency, but with an attacking onslaught,            rather than fleeing innocents. It also has that on rails feel of            gun games like Time Crisis, except that you have control over your            direction. But maybe this sounds appealing to you - if you want a            mindless, good looking blast that you can dive straight into, then            by all means give it a crack, but stood next to any of the better            games of the year, Gungrave feels like a depressingly hollow            experience designed to showcase some nifty graphics. You might get            an hour's entertainment from it, but for forty quid, that's a hefty            price to pay for something you'll probably never want to come back            to once you've given it a run through. Maybe Gungrave is worth a            rental if you're a fan of the art style and instant action            gameplay, but at the full price you'd be mad to consider parting            with hard earned cash for this.
