With Tiger Woods 2003, EA            hopes to strengthen his position, but this Christmas there's a new            challenger on the circuit. Ace Golf aims to make its mark through            the use of charmingly cute visuals and simple controls - but can            Telenet's upstart leave Tiger's suave presentation in the rough? Or            is EA's resolve stronger than a cement bunker? All will be            revealed.                    Despite approaching the problem from the opposite ends of realism            and fun, Ace Golf and Tiger Woods 03 have a surprising amount in            common. Well, perhaps that isn't too surprising - they're both golf            games with stick-based control systems - but it makes picking a            favourite all the more difficult. Fortunately, after some weeks            we've done that, but... clearly we're not going to spoil it all the            way up here now, are we?                    Dealing with the similarities first, while Tiger and Ace are both            simple games to learn, thanks to highly intuitive control systems,            they are also tricky to master, thanks to a reasonable amount of            depth in the aforementioned control department.                    Presentation-wise, both are nice, but Tiger is all very EA-standard            and uninspired, and the new GUI is an aesthetic mess compared to            the old one, particularly with the added jaggies on the PS2 and            fuzziness on the Cube. Fortunately, Ace was designed exclusively            for the Cube, so it's easy to navigate, well-explained and            illustrated and good-looking in a cutesy Japanese way.                    And finally, both games have entertaining multiplayer modes for one            to four players, either via the time-honoured and time-consuming            'hot seat' method or in Tiger's case, there's also a split-screen            ~Speed Golf~ mode for the impatient, which can be tremendous fun as            both players tear along the course in a bizarrely inimitable ~first            to the hole~ challenge.        It's not all one big graphically separated mesh of the same            systems though - while there are plenty of similarities throughout,            there are subtle individual quirks which conspire to make a lot of            difference. The control method is a good example.                    In both Ace and Tiger, players use the analogue stick to gauge            power and accuracy, but pulling back and pushing forward to            simulate backswing. In Ace's case, there's a little yellow icon in            the bottom right showing the path your thumb takes over the C-stick            and a power bar along the bottom, but your efforts end with the            striking of the ball. In Tiger's case, you can add further pace to            the backswing by tapping L1 (or the corresponding Cube or Xbox            shoulder button) and add mid-air spin to the ball by tapping L2            plus an analogue direction in flight.                    In Ace, you can augment your power and judgement by earning new            accessories, new caddies and new clubs along with a host of other            unlockables. In Tiger, you spend the money you earn on improving            your stats, in categories ranging from power and accuracy to spin            and luck. If only Mr. Blair could pay for the latter, eh?                    Both games allow you to go for a shorter, mid-range shot by pulling            back only a certain distance, but Ace makes this process easier, as            it's seemingly more sensitive to your dragging. Ironically though,            the Xbox and PS2 pads have bigger thumbsticks and are much easier            to judge, and with Ace unavailable on those it's a bit of a dead            heat.                    Not so on the greens though, where EA's ~hit and hope~ mentality is            poorly implemented. All you do is pick a direction, choose a point            to aim for and let rip - you cannot miss-swing the putter. Oddly            though, there are no lines overlaid on the image to give you an            idea of the green, and you have to rely on your caddy to offer tips            on where to play - ~six feet long, two feet right~ for example. The            problem is that it's incredibly difficult to judge the distance            on-screen because the camera keeps zooming in and out, and            invariably (unless one of the axis requires no intervention, or            your ball is within rolling distance of the hole), it's a matter of            pot luck and nothing else.                    Ace, on the other hand, gives you a picture of the green from up            and behind the player, and lets you angle the ball and choose the            power. Daunting though it may seem, it's surprisingly forgiving and            after a few hours potting birdies was far easier than Tiger after            as much as 40 hours (which is a conservative estimate, thanks to            the popularity of the multiplayer).        Outwardly            at least, Tiger 03 has definitely been tailored to appear huge, and            even our renowned cynicism when it comes to PR trumpeting was            apparently misplaced here, because in terms of longevity Tiger has            the upper hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder. In a kid glove and            frilly golfing sweater.                    Ace fights gallantly, with six delightfully designed, clean, crisp            courses, and a collection of entertaining and self-explanatory            mini-games (e.g. ~Nearest the Pin~), but Tiger has twice as many            courses, several of them fictional and several of them real, and            apart from a host of thoughtful play modes including tournament,            stroke and match play, offers a hugely refined single player ~Tiger            Challenge~ mode and overhauled ~Skill Zone~ mini-games for target            practice. Not to mention a pretty helpful (and mandatory) opening            tutorial section.                    Changes to Tiger Challenge are vast and comprehensive. Last time            out, the objective was to topple 18 increasingly gifted golfers on            a variety of real and fictional courses, culminating in a trip            round ~Tiger's Dream 18~. The final goal is still to beat Tiger at            his own, frosty fantasy game, but this time along the way players            will fight nine and eighteen holes against several adversaries,            take part in skins matches (with a certain prize pot per hole),            enter various mini tournaments and compete in The Open            Championship. Amazingly, the inclusion of The Open was the only            other thing we wanted adding to Tiger 2002, so we're understandably            happy about clubbing our way around St. Andrews.                    Speaking of St. Andrews, the noble seaside course is the most            pertinent reminder of EA's amazing in-game visuals, and these too            have been touched up for Tiger 2003. New characters join the            already bustling roster, and each character model is now very well            endowed with polygons in all the right places and some wonderful            clothing textures. Animation is very expressive, too, with Tiger            reaching for his head, a frown breaking on his face in the            aftermath of a bad shot, and more animated characters like a former            sumo wrestler potting two-inch putts with a prone snooker stroke.                    Courses are elegantly realised and in the case of the real ones, EA            has cleverly opted for familiar camera angles. We almost felt            goosebumps as we teed off on the 13th at St. Andrews, having            watched Tiger himself do the same thing only a couple of months            prior. Ace Golf's cute, low-poly Japanesey characters and            occasional weather effects just can't compete with EA's stellar            production values - and when faced with Tiger's swaying grass and            the logo turning endlessly over on the face of the tiny, textured            ball, Ace Golf looks like a Saturday morning cartoon.        Ace doesn't take the opportunity to capitalise in too many            other areas, either. Despite Tiger's appallingly US-centric rock            shite soundtrack, Ace offers only a token resistance with            forgettable tunes, and the irritating, repetitive caddy voices are            a far cry from the insightful, entertaining quips and advice from            Tiger's commentary team - one of whom sounds worryingly like            Eurogamer's own Rob Fahey.                    Furthermore, camera problems in Tiger (like the ~poster shot~ cuts            to the player's face during flight, which interfere with the            action, the constant, deliberate slowdown effects and the camera's            obstructive misbehaviour in general) are easily ignored, especially            as Ace's free-roaming camera feels awkwardly untethered as you zoom            over the courses. Tiger's stuck-on-the-player approach may be            slightly more restrictive, but it feels a lot fairer than getting            to examine every flaw in every blade of virtual grass...                    As keen golfing fans, both virtual and otherwise, we were pretty            excited about the prospect of two key and reasonably individual            golfing titles this Christmas, but it's clear after several hours            of play that Tiger Woods is a much broader, much more engaging            beast with a lot more going for it.                    Both games strike a reasonable balance between playability and            realism, but Ace Golf is simply too basic, whereas Tiger is second            only to Links in the detail and realism stakes. Given the huge            number of activities in Tiger Woods 2003 and the elegance in almost            every department, a few camera quirks and presentation            eccentricities are easily overlooked, whereas Ace's obsession with            accessibility and lack of depth is cripplingly restrictive by            comparison.                    Unless you can't stand Woods or buy Japanese exclusively, our            advice would be to take a Tiger home this Christmas.
