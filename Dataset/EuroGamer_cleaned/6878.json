Thankfully, after            such a long period of time without an update and nothing but a few            fanciful screenshots and artist's impressions to go by, most people            have forgotten about Floigan Brothers, or simply given up on it.            Better late than never then, Visual Concepts have delivered the            finished article, and we're surprised it took them this long\u2026                         Floigan Brothers is a funny game. Not Sam & Max funny, but            perhaps Monkey Island funny. The main characters find themselves in            ridiculous situations and the on-screen antics and dialogue live up            to the billing. It's a fairly American sense of humour, but it had            me chuckling quietly on several occasions. What else does Floigan            Brothers have to offer though?                         The premise is that you are Hoigle, the smaller of the two Floigan            Brothers. Your partner in crime, Moigle, is working on a secret            project and needs some help finding the seven missing parts to get            it going. You have to help Moigle find these parts of the puzzle by            pointing and guiding him to various areas of the screen, hugging            him to make him feel better, punching him in the stomach to annoy            him, or feeding him, which puts him in the mood to take in new            information. Another integral part of the control system is the            Speak button, which brings up a small menu with various things            Hoigle can say, with topics ranging from games to insults, all of            which have a different effect on Moigle.                    Hoigle can also count his points, which are collected throughout            the game. Moigle will often remind you that he has more of them            than you, but they can be used to bribe the big oaf so that he's            receptive to lessons. In this state Moigle can be taught how to            play games and do various other things, and it's Moigle's job to be            generally unhelpful, something which he does well.                         The Floigans sometimes have to fight off the cat troops of Baron            Malodorous, who wants rid of the pair of you so that he can have            the junkyard to himself. These combat sections are fairly good fun            and stick to several key cartoon rules; cats have nine lives and            bullets can be diverted or stopped altogether. The cats also have            bunkers in the rubble from the safety of which they can chuck bombs            at the Floigans.                         Visually the game is a pretty standard cartoon adventure, but            there is occasionally enough detail to slow the game a little, with            the hill sections in particular dragging down the framerate.            Otherwise the animation is extremely nice, with plenty of quirky            gimmicks. Hoigle can literally be flattened by Moigle as he bumbles            about, and the colourful Moigle himself can often be seen getting            distracted by a butterfly as Hoigle painstakingly tries to explain            something. The voice acting is pretty good too, fitting the            characters in a Banjo Kazooie kind of way.                    There are a couple of problems with the game though. For starters,            there are camera issues from the start. The camera strays into            other objects in confined spaces, obstructing your view of the            brothers and making it hard to deal with oncoming threats. You can            move the camera around using the L and R buttons and in open spaces            you can actually rotate a full 360 degrees, but it's still an            annoyance.                         The biggest problem the game faces though is how ridiculously            short it is. Clearly aimed at younger gamers, Floigan takes little            over an hour to complete. That's shorter than most movies, which            makes Floigan Brothers a decent rental if you can find it, but            otherwise worth missing. It costs less than most games, but you            would expect that for something released on the Dreamcast in this            day and age. There is online support to swap different skills and            costumes, and there is the promise of continued downloads from Sega            to consider, but the game has very little longevity to start with,            and unless Sega intends to offer new adventures every month, we            can't see this helping a great deal.                         Pick it up in a bargain bin when it costs a fiver, or buy it for a            younger relative, but don't expect another Mario. Laugh out loud            funny though Floigan Brothers can be at times, it's far too short            to be taken seriously."}
