But instead of scoffing            at the very idea of handing over forty quid to direct a            slack-bladdered, nonsense-warbling virtual household, first            consider your current gaming diet. If you're a PS2 owner, you've            got a healthy selection of platform, sports, mission based driving            and the ubiquitous third person action titles to your name. This is            all very well, but don't you ever yearn to do something less, well,            gamey? What you need is a supplement.        It may sound like heresy, but The Sims offers a very compelling            argument for a place in your collection. It's like a Stone Age            version of those virtual reality machines and 'holodecks' all the            big sci-fi franchises rely on. Your job is to play the part of a            particular householder whilst exploiting your relationships to get            the maximum benefit/comedy/suffering out of everyone. In some cases            it's like holding a magnet to a compass, but in others it's more of            a piss on the floor, watch porn and sleep all day situation.                    And on PS2 there's much more structure than ever, with the basic            story (or ~Get A Life~) mode allowing you to first create and then            direct your Sim through various scenarios, starting off in a cosy            one-bed bungalow with your dear old mother. Principle objectives            are to borrow 800 Simolians, fix the TV and learn to cook. If you            can do all that you'll earn various new bits of furniture (like a            jukebox), which can then be optionally purchased and installed to            keep your little fella or fellarette happy. As you complete            scenarios, your task list grows and you find yourself organising            parties, getting hitched and even retiring to the country to live a            grand old life of luxury.                    The game is made all the more accessible thanks to a wonderful            control system built with the express purpose of guiding The Sims            to PS2. Using the right stick to zoom and pirouette on cue, and the            left stick to select things using a cursor (highlighted by a shaft            of light running from its spot on the floor to the top of the            screen), you quickly find yourself moving your Sims through the            rigours of daily life without so much as a ~no I meant to select            that~.        Meanwhile, various pop-up menus are mapped to the D-pad, and            allow you to keep your Sims' various comforts in check. Each Sim is            blessed with a need to fulfil certain criteria, and it comes down            to you to make sure that they are always well fed, sanitised,            social, comfortable, happy and raring to go. There are eight            individual things to keep under control, and if any of them lapses            into the red you'll need to take action - a red bladder for            instance needs immediate attention, or else the poor mite will            suffer the embarrassment of a puddle, before having to finish the            job in the right place, clean it up, take a bath and watch some TV            to cheer himself up before bed. If you don't keep an eye on the            various gauges, sooner or later there won't be enough hours in the            day to go about your various tasks.                    Sadly, as we thought of the original, it's a bit of a chore having            to keep these comforts under control, and when you're worrying            about multiple Sims it can be very much non-stop. Fortunately the            game can queue up various tasks - so you can set Harold Monkington            (or, um, whatever you opt for) off tidying up dinner, cleaning the            toilet, reading a cookbook and watching TV and then go off and            worry about something else. There's even a way to cancel queued            commands, and on the whole the system works well.        But,            as keen observers will by now have realised, the developer's            attempts to spice up proceedings with a task-oriented single player            game are merely ways to cover up the repetitive tediousness of            life. And since this is a game, there's rarely any variety in what            you see, either. The first time you watch your little Sim            electrocute himself on a busted TV for instance, it's funny. You            might even laugh. The third or fourth time he takes a jolt from            something, it's a bit trying, and watching him read a book is like,            well, watching someone read a book.                    That's not to unduly criticise the visuals, because they look more            or less the same as their PC counterparts, albeit in slightly lower            resolution. Your Sims are animated with sufficient emotion, your            environment is brightly textured, well lit and fully rotatable, and            the cartoon look is complemented by speech bubbles, TV static to            obscure naughtiness and other comic ideas. No, the visuals are good            - it's just that there's only so much variation in completing the            one, mundane task.                    Fortunately, Get A Life mode compensates by changing scenery,            characters and objectives and the tedium of the daily grind            is easily ignored for the most part. And by the time you're            actually very bored, the game lets you off the hook and opens up            Play The Sims mode - the start-from-scratch equivalent of the            original PC game. Not only that, but you open up the curious            novelty of a two-player mode, which has you competing with a friend            to attract the most visitors to your museum, or to chat the most            girls up at a party (whilst simultaneously spreading gossip about            your opponent) amongst other things.        This wealth of variety and reward structure is carefully            considered, but ultimately it won't help the final outcome - you're            either going to love The Sims, or you're going to hate it. If            you've never played it, you owe it to yourself to give it a go -            and the PS2 version is probably more accessible than the PC release            - because there's so much to do here that a simple review couldn't            hope to touch on everything. Almost anything you can do in real            life is available, be it redecorating the house, chatting up girls,            getting a job, getting married, getting a pet, building a pool,            having a BBQ - you name it and you can probably do it.                    On the other hand, some people will hate it for the exact same            reasons. It is just a simulation of someone's fairly boring life,            it is very repetitive and it doesn't even have a real ending to            speak of. It's a mindless plaything, which will grow old and stale            within hours.                    Which category do we fall into? Still the first. For us, The Sims            is a pleasant change from the monotony of running, jumping and            shooting at increasingly ugly aggressors, questing to retrieve some            arbitrary item from the something of somewhere and getting excited            about Nazi-esque criminal activities in gothic palaces. We get a            lot more of that than we do The Sims, and in our view, to holiday            in someone else's lifestyle for a bit is a thrill worth pursuing."}
