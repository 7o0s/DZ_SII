SNK 2 : Mark of the Millennium for the PlayStation 2 is            virtually the same game that was released on the Dreamcast            recently. It features a crossover of Capcom and SNK-bred            characters, and for all intents and purposes it's Street Fighter            with optional knobs. As far as graphics, sound, storyline and            longevity go, there is very little new here, and as far as gameplay            modes and the feature set go the only changes are tweaks, along            with some extra characters and gameplay mechanics lifted from older            iterations of Street Fighter.                         That makes it a very difficult game to review because, firstly,            there is so little to discuss, and secondly, the kind of subtle            advances found in Capcom Vs. SNK 2 : Mark of the Millennium            compared to its predecessor are the sort of minutiae that only a            determined, lifelong fan of the 2D beat 'em up genre could            identify. Frames of animation removed from certain moves perhaps,            or increased speed at a particular point of a popular combo, or            whether a new background is derived from a competitor's product and            is actually a complimentary gesture from one development team to            another.                    Whether you can get over the fact that it's a controversial point            release for propeller heads is entirely the point, of            course. Everybody should own a decent 2D beat 'em up, and Capcom            Vs. SNK 2 is certainly that, but being at the pinnacle of a genre            so utterly dominated by a single franchise means that it need not            justify its release with startling changes, it can get away with            being 110% of last year's release. And as the treasury likes to            tell us, percentages can come from anywhere, but they rarely mean            anything to anyone.                        If there's a point to all this, then it's this: if you own a 2D            beat 'em up released from about 1999 onwards then you should not            buy Capcom Vs. SNK 2, unless you also own every other 2D            beat 'em up released during that time. Unless you know you will            appreciate the adjusted suspension and thicker tyres, don't buy            them. This game is for veterans of the genre, fuelling an addiction            rather than appealing to the mainstream. This is hardcore.                         That doesn't mean we can't find a few things to pick up on though.            For instance, the game's most noticeable new feature is the            addition of several new characters to the fray, bringing the total            to 40 and reintroducing British stick fighter Eagle (from the            original Street Fighter no less), Ryuhaku Todo (Art of Fighting),            Haohmaru (Samurai Shodown), Rock Howard (son of Geese Howard from            Fatal Fury : Mark of the Wolves), Yun (Street Fighter III) and Maki            (derived from Mai Shiranui, Final Fight II). Arousing though that            may be for some, it doesn't really change much, and the majority of            the fighters share common characteristics.                    A more appreciable change in gameplay mechanics is the merging of            Capcom Vs. SNK's EX characters with their original versions. EX            characters were sort of evil parallel universe fighters with a            different selection of moves in their repertoire. Unlocking these            improved the tenure of the game immensely, but for the sequel            characters can do both sets of moves without restriction, making            battles more varied and potentially more strategic. Another            alteration comes to the control system, which has moved back to the            familiar six-button Street Fighter system instead of the pithy            four-button system which was mistakenly put to use in the original            Capcom Vs. SNK.                        The final big change is definitely for the better, with the            inclusion of six different fighting styles lifted from previous            Street Fighter games, as opposed to the scandalously inadequate two            seen in its predecessor. The list includes the ~P~ groove            (featuring a Street Fighter III-derived parry system), the ~K~            groove (featuring the enragement gauge lifted from Samurai Shodown,            which responds to your own anguish by increasing your strength),            while the other new grooves are tiny control alterations that are            unlikely to be noticed by any but the most hardcore fans.                    Visually and aurally the game is perfectly acceptable, although the            punch and kick sound effects deserved to be a bit beefier. A few            new backgrounds join the list of things that weren't in Capcom Vs.            SNK and tweaked character costumes, interface screens and so on            hide in their shadow. This is probably the best-looking 2D beat 'em            up I've ever seen, but that may just be because it's the only one            I've played in a while.                        So, a very contrived genetic make-up, unsurprisingly. Moreover, 2D            beat 'em ups are nothing if not packed to the gills with hidden            extras, so it was an understanding nod rather than a            gosh-darn-whizz that followed my discovery of the create your own            groove option, probably the finest of the secrets. Mixing and            matching different gameplay elements from previous games is a            dangerous move for Capcom though - after all, that's generally how            they justify sequels these days.                         Childish digs aside though, there's little mistaking Capcom's            domination of the 2D beat 'em up market. Capcom Vs. SNK 2 : Mark of            the Millennium is the peak of the genre, and will probably remain            so for a month or so while Capcom readies a competitor from another            of its Street Fighter lines. This is one to fuel the addiction            then, not to complement that other beat 'em up you play from time            to time. On the other hand, if you don't already own a recent 2D            beat 'em up, you would be very wise to pick this up. It's            especially useful when friends come over as the lowest common            denominator sort of entertainment. Now remember, mash the buttons            and if you win, refuse ever to play the man again on the basis that            he'll cheat. Amen.                        -        Capcom                    Vs. SNK Dreamcast reviewCapcom                    Vs. SNK Dreamcast review"}
