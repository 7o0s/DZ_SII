Without a decent surface for your            rodent to roam over your accuracy will be impaired, and the            unfortunate mouse will find itself gathering up dirt and grime.                    In recent years the mouse mat industry has seen something of a            boom, no doubt largely thanks to the advent of first person            shooters and competitive gaming. Serious action gamers want to make            the most of their skills, and are willing to spend however much it            takes to nurture them. Having dropped anything up to \u00a3100 on a            specialist mouse, it seems stingy not to give that rodent the best            possible surface to play on.                    Amongst the forerunners at the moment are Everglide, who make a            whole range of tough, durable mouse pads which won't break your            bank. All of them share the same basic design - a hard plastic            surface about 5mm thick, with little plastic feet on the underside            which hold the pad firmly to your desk, even under attack from the            most violent of mouse users.                    The upper surface is textured to give your rodent's ball (if it has            one) the best possible grip as you move it around the pad. Optical            mice also work fine on most of the pads, although the plain white            ones obviously don't give much for the sensors to work with, and            are best avoided if you have an optical mouse.         For the last few weeks I            have been using one of Everglide's ~Large Attack Pads~ which,            despite the name, is actually one of their smaller surfaces, giving            a welcome boost in clear space on my somewhat cluttered desk.                    With a smooth curvaceous design that looks like it escaped from the            set of a Batman movie, it is certainly stylish, as well as            functional. The rounded dent in the near edge of the pad nicely            accommodates your hand, and if you hold your wrist still the mouse            sweeps nicely around the curved ~wings~ as you move it from side to            side.                    There's not much room for moving the mouse up and down on the pad            though, and it seems to be designed for twitch killers who have            their mouse sensitivity settings very high. Luckily that includes            me, and the pad also makes an ideal partner for my highly accurate            (and bloody expensive!) Razer Boomslang 2000 gaming mouse.                    If you prefer to play with a very low mouse sensitivity, rolling            your mouse violently backwards and forwards as you play your games,            you would probably be better off going for one of Everglide's aptly            named ~Giganta~ mouse pads. Those are more rectangular and give you            more surface to play with, although they don't cost any more. At            the end of the day it comes down to whichever suits your playing            style best.         The mousing surface itself is            excellent, offering low friction to the under-side of your mouse            but still giving good grip for the all-important ball. The result            is a joy to use, with your rodent gliding smoothly across the pad.                    While it might not turn you into the next Fatality or Thresh, this            certainly should improve your mouse movement's accuracy and            smoothness, particularly in action games. It can also come in handy            for precision pixel pushing for those of you with an artistic            streak.                    Using the pad, even for long periods of time, is generally very            comfortable. The only real problem I have had with it is that the            fairly narrow raised surface left my wrist sitting on the hard            surface of my desk, which could get quite painful after a while.            The solution came, strangely enough, in the form of a cloth beer            mat. Folding it up and putting it under the pad gave me a soft            surface to rest my wrist on, and I haven't had any problems since.                    If you have the same problem and want a slightly more high tech            solution, Everglide also sell a lycra wrist rest filled with            polyurethane gel, which you can buy for \u00a38.         Of course, plain black might not            appeal to everyone. For those of you who are fanatical about your            favourite games, Everglide also offer Large Attack Pads with logos            printed on to them.                    Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 Arena and Half-Life attack pads are            currently all available, and only cost \u00a31 more than the plain            versions. The paint doesn't have any obvious effect on your            movement when you move a mouse across it, and it successfully            resisted all of my attempts to scratch it off.                    If you want something a little more individual, you can also order            customised pads from Everglide with your own choice of logo on            them. You have to buy at least 25, but if you want a funky mouse            pad for your clan or company it's a good choice. A basic run of 25            black pads with monochrome logo will set you back \u00a3342.50            (\u00a313.70 each), and the more colours you use the more expensive            it becomes - a four colour logo would cost you around \u00a3450 for            25 (\u00a318 each), but the more that you buy, the cheaper they            become. Check this            page for more details.         Buying a precision surface for your rodent            is something of a no-brainer if you are a hardcore gamer - it will            certainly improve your accuracy, and will probably reduce the            amount of grime that your mouse picks up during use.                    The Everglide mats are also easy to wash and almost impossible to            wear out or destroy, so regardless of whether you play action games            or not, if you spend a lot of time in front of your computer it            might be better to splash out on an Everglide mat rather than keep            buying new ~cheap~ mats every few months.                    If you have your mouse sensitivity set high, then the Everglide            Large Attack Pad is the perfect choice - it's small, compact and            stylish. If you prefer to use low sensitivity settings and move            your mouse around a lot, the bulkier Giganta might prove to a            better choice. Either way, for just \u00a315 you can't really go            wrong...                    -        Ratpad vs                    Giganta comparisonRatpad vs                    Giganta comparisonRazer                    Boomslang 2000 gaming mouse reviewRazer                    Boomslang 2000 gaming mouse review"}
