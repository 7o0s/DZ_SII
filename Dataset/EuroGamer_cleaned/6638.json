But no            dead horse has been flogged quite so mercilessly as Pac-Man, which            has gone from 'surreal dot munching maze game' to 'side on            platformer' to 'isometric dot muncher' to 'Tetris clone' before            finally settling on '3D dot munching platformer' over the past 23            years. But unlike so many companies that have gone to the wall in            that period, the original creator Namco is still going strong, and            occasionally capable of releasing genre defining classics            that keep us interested despite our advancing years.                    With the likes of the criminally under-rated Klonoa out there, we            know Namco is more than capable of producing a decent platformer,            and we were quietly confident that the Japanese veterans could make            up for the years of misuse of the Pac-Man brand. I mean, the            prospect of ~retro gaming chic combined with cutting-edge action~            sounded promising. It was billed as ~bigger, brighter and more            addictive than ever~. Even EA signed up the GameCube and Xbox            versions. What could possibly go wrong?        But first let's explain what            the ageing Pac is up to these days. The evil Spooky, the leader of            the ghosts, has been freed from his prison beneath the tree in Pac            Village. The wee ghosts (apparently still called Blinky, Pinky,            Inky and Clyde, which we liked) have been ordered to hide the five            pieces of golden fruit around Pac-Land and thus our hero Pac-Man            has to save the Pac-People by collecting said golden fruit from the            18 levels, eventually meeting the evil Spooky in a ~grand            showdown~.                    Each level is a simple case of guiding Pac-Man to the exit, via            various tricks, traps, and objects, mainly consisting of spiky            plants, bottomless pits, switches, pills, power pills, fruit and            tokens. It's up to you whether you can be bothered to collect            everything, but there are some interesting and tempting rewards if            you do.                    Collecting tokens, rather cunningly, allows you to unlock various            ancient Pac-Man titles from a bygone era, including the original            Pac-Man arcade game, the sublime Ms Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, the Tetris            clone Pac-Attack, but mystifyingly absent is the wonderful            Pac-Land. The tight fisted gits. These are all playable in the            games 'arcade', which is housed on the very first level and            accessible via the game's hub whenever you feel like a trip down            memory lane. Sadly, the graphical representation of these pieces of            gaming history are hideously ugly, somehow making them look            blockier and jerkier than the real thing, and to compound the            misery even the audio seems to have been reproduced badly. We're            not sure what emulation system Namco chose to use, but it doesn't            appear to be the one that worked so well on its Museum            compilations, and gives the player no way of changing settings,            such as difficulty or the number of lives you can have. Somehow a            good idea has been badly implemented, and throws away a decent            opportunity to give long term fans something to cherish.                    Continuing this retro trickery is the game's Museum, which, like            the Arcade, will require the player to collect scores of tokens            before it will become unlocked. This one, however, will only be of            real interest to those who find old poster artwork and the like            interesting.        But enough of the            past; what of the here and now? In tune with every other 3D            platformer, Pac-Man World 2 is a bright and cheery collect 'em up,            populated with baddies that can be dispatched by jumping on their            heads, while the ghosts can be killed off by munching a glowing            power pill. Using his butt attack (double tap X) can also activate            switches, which send our yellow headed hero soaring through the air            on a Pac-Dot suck chain pill munching frenzy. All rather bizarre,            but it allows the game engine to corkscrew through the level,            giving hitherto unseen, rollercoaster style views of the            proceedings.                    Pac also has the usual jump capabilities by tapping X, while            holding down square sends him into a 'rev roll' dash, which enables            you to traverse yawning gaps. However, to prevent Pac from            overshooting, you can tap X to stop him mid flight. Meanwhile,            tapping circle while jumping activates our hero's spin attack,            enabling the yellow one to rid the world of baddies mid flight.            It's a simple enough system, but one not aided by an unwieldy            camera that steadfastly refuses to allow for more than a few            degrees of movement if you attempt to adjust your viewpoint            manually (with the right stick).                    The game also allows Pac to engage in a spot of swimming, but to be            able to walk under water; Pac must collect some steel boots, which            give our hero some ballast to be able to collect the items hidden            in the boxes on the water's floor. Later on, we get to collect            objects that allow the jaundiced one to ice-skate, in-line skate            and even drive a submarine, but it's hardly up there with Naughty            Dog's and Insomniac's efforts for variety - or fun for that matter.                    Occasionally, you'll also be tasked with completing mazes, which            are merely isometric 'Pac-Mania' style efforts. Slightly updated            graphically, but featuring the sound effects we know and love from            the past. They're fairly welcome interludes, but seem to have very            little to do with the main game. And for those who love the chomp            endless pills, you can even replay them down at the arcade, and try            and beat your high score, if that kind of thing still sounds like            your idea of gaming heaven.        On a            visual level, Pac-Man World 2 barely even tries to compete on the            same level as its many rivals. It may well be ~bright and cheery~            as the PR blurb claims, but having been recently treated to the            sublime delights of Sly Raccoon and Ratchet & Clank, you have            to check the disk to make sure it's not a PSone version. In all            honesty, within minutes the almost total absence of texturing, the            unimaginative characters, and - worse still - the presence of            texture seams has you convinced you must be playing a PSone            game. The dodgy camera work just compounds the issue, and regularly            forces the player to make leaps of faith - that age old bugbear of            3D platformers of a certain 'vintage'                    One thing in its favour was the gorgeously rendered fruit, that            look so realistic and juicy that we swear we were salivating during            our time with the game - but that's about as good as it gets. The            game's by no means awful. In fact compulsive platform freaks won't            be totally disgusted with what's on offer here, but it's so lacking            in technical merit, and lacking anything even remotely approaching            a new idea that it just reeks of contractual obligation. A by the            numbers, inoffensive collect 'em up that neither inspires rage nor            the compulsion to play for any length of time. For the asking            price, it seems a hefty wedge to pay for an average game, with a            few badly implemented retro classics tucked away inside it. For the            real Pac-Man heads among us, we guess we're going to have to wait            another few years before Namco can properly revive this flagging            franchise.
