From Championship Manager and Sim City to            the likes of Master of Orion or Galactic Civilisations, they all            share common traits - like a heavy reliance on statistics, an            extremely in-depth gameplay model, and the derision of those who            don't ~get~ the genre as being nothing more than a glorified            spreadsheet.                    Master of Orion is one of the original flag bearers for this genre,            an epic management title which puts you in charge of an advanced            race on the galactic stage and lets you handle everything from            exploration and colonisation through to the economy and, of course,            the military. This latest iteration of the series has been a very,            very long time coming, having slipped for well over a year before            finally arriving on shelves - but fans of the series may find            themselves asking whether it was worth the wait.        Two things are                 immediately apparent when you first start playing MOO3 -                 firstly, that it's incredibly detailed, and secondly, that                 it's incredibly ugly. The game boasts screen after screen of                 in-depth information about the state of your empire, with                 literally hundreds of statistics ranging from economic and                 demographic information to the state of your research efforts,                 geological surveys of planets and your relationships with                 other races in the game. It's an impressive and indeed                 overwhelming amount of information to digest.                    Unfortunately, it's not exactly presented in a particularly            attractive manner. While the information screens themselves are            fairly functional, any parts of the game that try to represent            anything graphically are downright hideous. The back of the box            claims that the space battles in the game are a thing of beauty;            well, eye of the beholder or not, we're pretty sure that nobody is            going to consider the pixellated mess of voxels and crappy ship            designs ~beautiful~ in any way. The same goes for the main game            map, which illustrates the extent of your empire and the            surrounding star systems in low-resolution, messy 3D. To top it all            off, the game is stuck in 800x600 - a travesty in a modern title            that tries to pack so much information on screen, and anyone with a            monitor 19~ or larger will certainly object to the fact that the            individual on-screen pixels are larger than the human head.        Graphics, of course, aren't                 the really important thing about a game like Master of Orion                 3, so with that criticism out of the way, what about the game                 itself? As previously mentioned, there's a vast amount of                 information on offer - so much so that at first it seems                 impossible to absorb or act upon that amount of detail. You                 quickly realise, however, that the game doesn't actually                 expect you to keep track of all that information - quite the                 opposite, in fact.                    Master of Orion 3, you see, has introduced a number of fascinating            new concepts in management sim design, the main one being that you            don't actually have to play the game at all. Each aspect of your            empire has an appointed viceroy who is perfectly capable of running            affairs without your intervention - and while that would be a great            idea if it just meant that you could delegate dull micro-management            to these chaps, it's a bit more of a problem when they continually            contradict or countermand your orders and intentions.                    In fact, as soon as your empire grows to any decent size, you'll            find that conflict with other races isn't the biggest problem you            face - it's constant, frustrating conflict with your own viceroys            that will take up most of your time, and each turn of the game can            descend into a tedious matter of going around each planet and            resetting the build queues or fleet orders which your viceroys have            changed without your consent.        If only                 your enemies displayed the same kind of intelligence, the game                 might be a lot more interesting - but in fact, the enemy AI in                 MOO3 is terrible, far worse than in the previous game in the                 series. Even on the hardest difficulty level, enemies seem                 incapable of mounting any kind of sensible offensive against                 you, resorting instead to sending tiny fleets crashing against                 your defences and making some of the most appalling and                 wasteful strategic decisions we've ever seen an enemy AI in a                 videogame make.                    We really can't fathom why Master of Orion 3 took so long to finish            - there's an incredible amount of detail in there, but behind the            vast lists of figures and statistics, the game itself is actually            very simple and quite painfully flawed. The effort that went into            the creation of such a detailed empire model, and even into writing            the hugely complex back story for the game, is to be applauded; but            in the light of the piss-poor gameplay, it's hard not to wish that            Quicksilver had spent a little more time on the game and a little            less time on the window dressing.                    It's a terrible shame to see the Master of Orion series take such a            huge step backwards in terms of playability. We can only hope that            those longing for a decent space empire simulation won't be            disappointed by the other big hope for the genre, namely Stardock's            Galactic Civilisations, which looks very promising indeed and could            make up for the disappointment that is Master of Orion 3.
