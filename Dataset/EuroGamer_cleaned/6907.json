Flash forwards ten years and Stronghold has brought            this wonderful concept up to date with a dose of real-time strategy            and sim elements.                        Your castle is constructed by placing walls and prefab parts such            as towers and gatehouses on the map, with optional extras such as            moats, pitch ditches and spike traps also available. It's all very            simple point-and-click stuff, and unlike in Castles your defences            appear as soon as you place them, rather than having to wait for a            peasant to come along and start shifting the stones. The game's            isometric viewpoint can make accurate placing of objects awkward at            times but luckily any trees, buildings and hills can be flattened            by pressing the space bar, allowing you to get a clearer view of            the ground plan of your fortification and see what's hidden behind            your walls.                        You will also need plenty of peasants to support your castle            building antics. Farms, hunters' posts, mills and bakeries will            feed your growing population, woodcutters' huts, quarries and mines            provide the raw materials you need, and various kinds of armourer            and weaponsmith will provide equipment so that you can start hiring            troops to defend your castle. You can also add churches, inns,            gardens and maypoles to keep your people happy, and gallows, stocks            and dungeons to keep them working hard. At first sight there's a            lot to keep you occupied, and it's hard to see how the game could            fail. But fail it does.                    The heart of the game seems to be the military campaign, with 21            missions to battle your way through as you seek to defeat four            renegade lords and reunite your country. Missions range from            breaking sieges and capturing enemy castles to raising gold and            holding off enemy attacks, but all of them have two major flaws.                        The first problem is that combat is a mess. Disappointingly            infantry can hack their way through huge stone walls, so if you            were looking forward to epic sieges with well-balanced armies you            can forget it. Usually your enemy just swarms up to your castle            walls and stands there bashing away until a section collapses and            they can get inside. Any survivors then make a bee-line for your            keep to kill your lord, at which point the game ends. Sometimes            your enemy will bring a few catapults with them, but often you can            pick these off with archers or send out a group of infantry to            destroy them, while the rest of the enemy army sits by and watches.            This doesn't leave much room for tactics, and you can win many            missions simply by getting as many archers as you can afford and            sticking them all on top of the wall nearest the enemy.                        The other problems is that you always know which wall this will be,            because the enemy comes from the same direction every time,            helpfully marked by a big signpost at the edge of the map. As you            know exactly where your enemy will strike there is often little            incentive to build a real castle. Instead you can sling up a wall            blocking off the enemy's approach, throw in a couple of gatehouses            and towers for good measure, and then line up your archers on the            battlements. If you build too close to the enemy's arrival point            your walls will crumble as soon as their troops show up though, and            annoyingly there is no indication as to how close you are allowed            to get. Often the collapses seem almost random, and on the smallest            maps you can build what seems to be a perfectly reasonable            fortification only to see it fall apart for no obvious good reason.            If you're lucky you may be allowed to dig a moat as well, which the            enemy will need to fill in before they can start hacking at your            walls, and as the AI doesn't show much initiative you can hold off            vast numbers of troops fairly easily.                    There is also a shorter economic campaign, with missions revolving            around gathering resources and/or building weapons within a time            limit. These are entertaining enough, but the only threat comes            from wolves, bears and the occasional bandit attack, which means            that your time is usually spent building up a village rather than a            castle.                        At this point you realise that Stronghold lacks the strategic depth            of a real city management sim. Peasants will flood into your castle            as fast as you can build hovels to house them in as long as you            keep your people happy, and all you need to do to accomplish this            is to make sure they have enough food. Produce a surplus and you            can make them even happier by giving them extra or double rations,            and at this point you can start taking taxes from them without            worrying about your popularity waning. This isn't particularly            challenging, although you do at least have to worry about gathering            other resources fast enough to meet your targets before the time            limit runs out in the economic campaign and stand-alone missions.                        Something which does make the game harder is the fact that your            peasants aren't exactly the sharpest tools in the shed, quite            happily wandering through a pack of wolves on their way to work and            ending up as dog food. Even more entertaining is watching your            castle catch fire. If a building goes up in flames the workers will            walk straight into the inferno as if nothing is wrong, then emerge            seconds later screaming and writhing as they are reduced to            charcoal briquettes. It doesn't stop there either; the game notices            that the building doesn't have a worker anymore and converts one of            your spare peasants to fill the vacancy, and he promptly walks into            the fire and dies as well. This cycle of death continues until the            fire goes out or the body count becomes so high that your            popularity falls enough to stop more peasants coming to the castle            to replace their suicidal predecessors. Not very impressive.                    Which brings us to free build mode. This should have been the jewel            in the game's crown, leaving you to get on with building the castle            of your dreams, but instead it's just a watered down version of the            economic campaign. You have no targets to meet, no time limit to            play against, and at the end of the day the whole thing is rather            pointless because you know that nobody is ever going to attack your            beautiful castle. As such it's quite fun for a while, but            ultimately unrewarding.                        At the other end of the scale is siege mode, which is all combat            and no economics. This features a choice of nine historical castles            to fight over, ranging from Leeds and Windsor to Heidelberg and            Monteriggioni. This can be quite fun as either attacker or            defender, but the dubious wall-bashing tactics make it less            involving than it perhaps should have been, and battles are fairly            short. The answer to this is invasion mode, which gives you time to            build up your defences and raise an army before the enemy attacks.            Sadly though, of the scant six maps on offer for this mode only            half of them are very well designed, and one is a horrendous maze            of swampy valleys which really doesn't belong here at all. Which is            a shame, because this is potentially the most enjoyable part of the            whole game.                        The good news then is that Stronghold comes with a built-in map            editor which is incredibly easy to use and allows you to knock out            new siege, invasion, economic and military missions in a matter of            minutes. How popular this will be remains to be seen, but failing            all else you can always run off a few castles by yourself and see            how you fare against the AI. Multiplayer could also have helped to            salvage Stronghold, but every time I've checked the in-game server            browser so far it hasn't found anybody for me to play against.                    Stronghold had a lot of potential, but the reality is sadly            disappointing. AI flaws make the game irritating at times, while            battles are mostly a case of firing arrows and pouring boiling oil            as infantry march up to your walls and proceed to tear them to            pieces with toothpicks. Artillery plays a remarkably small role in            the proceedings, although amusingly you can lob dead cows into your            enemy's fortress to spread the plague. Little moments of genius do            shine through, like the sadistic pleasure to be gained from setting            fire to a pitch ditch as a group of enemy soldiers marches            obliviously across it, but these are too few and far between."}
