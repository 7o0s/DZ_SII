Having established PlayStation as the clubber's companion and laced            the games with contemporary soundtracks though, Sony discovered            that Wipeout was able to fend off all-comers, including superior            games such as Nintendo's F-Zero X, without actually improving upon            the ageing formula at its heart.                         Ironically, while Wipeout Fusion's advertising campaign hints at a            vastly improved game with an incomparable approach to futuristic            racing involving mapping it around known landmarks, Sony's            development studios apparently lack the innovation borne of their            marketing allies, because no such remodelled London track exists            within the game. Instead players are faced with another Wipeout            game, cast from the same mould with none of the groundbreaking            aspects of its predecessors. Anti-gravity racing is, as per usual,            the focus of the game, and although Sony has elected not to turn            the game into a futuristic NASCAR simulation a la Extreme G3, the            game does bolt along at a commendable pace, and thanks to some            tweaked physics it feels better than ever. That said, coming at the            game after a week in Wipeout boot camp to get my trembling fingers            up to speed, I was stunned by the initial difficulty of placing in            any of the races.                         One of Fusion's biggest flaws is the overemphasized combat            element, which hands racers the ability to take down their            soon-to-be-erstwhile competition within metres of the chequered            flag. In fact, I placed sixth in both of my opening races and            failed to finish the third at all after receiving a rocket to the            proverbial crypt. Switch off the weapons though and you can            steadily acclimatize yourself. The handling takes a bit of getting            used to, with your back end sliding out through even the slightest            of turns and often connecting with the unforgiving barriers at the            side of each course. One or two unfriendly clashes and a spin could            leave you out of the race, confirming Fusion as the Monaco Grand            Prix of Wipeout games, with half the field limping home or not            making it to the end at all.                    As you progress, the importance of airbrakes becomes clear and the            tightly designed courses feel a lot more homely. In fact, after a            few hours' teething I was thoroughly enjoying myself, wielding my            Dual Shock one-handed along straights and singing boisterously.            Which is a good thing, because the soundtrack feels like a            practical joke. Gone are the ruthless baritones of Firestarter,            replaced with more traditional techno vibes, none of which floated            my anti-grav Auricom. With the music set to mute and The Fat of the            Land reverberating around my room though, I found myself adjusting            to the unpleasantness of being shot repeatedly within inches of            victory, and dealt out a number of equally nasty fates.                         With these stop-start beginnings long forgotten, Fusion becomes a            fairly serious undertaking. Settling down with the game involves            picking from a number of fairly self-explanatory modes, with            arcade, league, elimination, time trial, endurance and 'zone'            options available. My skills now adequately honed, I was in it for            the long haul, and that's what I got. Across these various            activities there are a total of 32 ships to unlock with 16            different pilots and 45 tracks, which steadily improve as the game            wears on and are all available in a mirror image configuration as            well. The two-player mode is so accessible as to be fiercely            competitive, and perfectly capable of driving a wedge through any            relationship.                         In terms of AI behaviour, Fusion's weapon-clad enemies are            uncompromisingly harsh, perfectly happy to ruin several laps of            hard work with one well-placed, totally unavoidable rocket.            Route-finding AI seems to be up to scratch, with racers picking            logical routes through open areas and around obstacles, and the            faster fliers finding a path through the field with inimitable            success. Unfortunately, this means less spectacular clustered            crashes to mop the highway with, and more racers succumbing to            weapons fire and the practically magnetic race barriers than            anything else.                    All things considered, races never fail to excite. The problem is            that Fusion offers little to fans of the series beyond its improved            graphics engine (admittedly with spangly particle effects) and            unforgiving race dynamic, and we're not in the business of            rewarding people who put in the bare minimum. Wipeout Fusion feels            like a glitzy 2097 with floaty physics, and the track design,            however sumptuously detailed with transparency effects, dust            kicking up, sprawling highly-detailed vistas and a smooth            framerate, is ultimately nothing more than a seasonal update. Play            the game in two-player mode and you sacrifice quite a bit of that            extravagant detail, and it's easier to see the game for what it            really is: the staggered transition of a popular franchise onto a            system already dominated by superior derivatives. Wipeout virgins            should definitely apply, but for the rest of us, it's time to dig            out Wipeout 2097, I think."}
