Genma is little more            than a solid revamp of the original PS2 version, which was an            impressive but critically ineffectual action game. As the story            begins we find sword-wielding Samanosuke determined to cut his way            through the ogres and demons of mystical Feudal Japan in search of            the kidnapped Princess Yuki. In the process he meets up with a            bounteous ninjaress by the name of Kaede, and the quest continues            with her pitching in to a certain extent.                        When it first came out it was noteworthy more because of its            expensive and elaborate use of CG videos than for the actual            gameplay, and although Genma Onimusha's cinematics are impressive,            nine months on we're more than used to this kind of thing, with            Metal Gear Solid 2 and a number of other big titles more than            matching Capcom's prowess with the camera. Onimusha is also            starting to show its age outside of those video sequences. The game            is played from the usual horror survival style fixed cameras, with            characters moving around pre-rendered areas. These environments,            beautifully drawn and painstakingly brought to life, effectively            drive Samanosuke and Kaede down a straight and often narrow path            through swarms of demons and cutscenes. The swordplay along the way            grows progressively more exciting, thanks to frequent upgrades and            powerful attacks, but the game is marred by the two areas I always            find myself criticizing when it comes to Capcom action games:            controls and camera.                         Like Resident Evil, Dino Crisis and the original Onimusha, Genma's            control system fights the player at every turn. The analogue stick            isn't often my first choice for this type of game, but Genma's            total lack of analogue support left me stuck with my least            favourite aspect of the Xbox controller, the d-pad. It sat there,            grinning at me. The painful experience of having to use the            derisive d-pad was only accentuated by the characters' slow turning            speed, and having a 180 degree spin bound to black, the least            accessible of all the buttons, didn't help matters much. Getting            Samanosuke facing in the right direction to deflect blows is hard            enough, but action sequences are often made unnecessarily difficult            due to the game switching between camera views, leaving you            struggling to readjust. Luckily Samanosuke's blows make easy            contact from the slightest of angles, and most demons hit the deck            before the end of his three-thrust action. But to say that the            result of nine months' conversion process is a disappointment would            be an understatement.                    Despite the lack of any obvious update to Onimusha's basics,            players of the original will pick up on the one main difference            immediately. As before, Samanosuke's abilities gradually increase            as the game wears on, and this is because his arm is bound in an            ogre gauntlet capable of harvesting the souls of slaughtered            enemies. These improve Samanosuke's stamina, power and other vital            attributes, so in the aftermath of a mighty blow or fatal stabbing,            players must pound the A button to drag the departing souls to his            side and reap the benefits.                        Apart from leaving you vulnerable though, this action can now go            badly wrong. In Genma Onimusha, demons have the ability to fight            you for the souls in a tug of war, leaving you with the choice of            letting the bad guy absorb the soul and go berserk, or being mashed            by closing enemies. This adds a new degree of difficulty to an            already troublesome game. You might finish it in a day if you            really put the hours in, but it will mean repeating a lot of            sections, fighting to reach the next magic mirror to save your            position and augment your weapon's capabilities at the expense of            your own.                        Genma Onimusha is packed with enemies, who spring up from nowhere            and rather annoyingly repopulate areas you have already cleared            while your back is turned. Avoiding them might buy you some time,            but failing to get your regular dosage of souls will leave you ill            equipped to fight the bigger baddies later on. So the game consists            of slicing and dicing, tugging and dying in equal measure, and            although it's fun for a while, it loses its charm quite quickly and            becomes largely tedious. The cutscenes become an excuse to rest            your blistered thumbs, and the mythology and imagination employed            to great effect in the telling of the story are wasted on a bored            gamer. Bonus points must be awarded for giving you the choice of            Japanese and English soundtracks, however.                    Onimusha is a decent enough action game in its own right, with            spectacular graphics and epicurean encounters with savage,            monstrous enemies, particularly the boss characters. But it's            already showing its age and is hindered by a control and camera            system we had hoped to have seen the last of. Any fans of Feudal            Japan and sword fighting not prepared to fork out full whack for            the Xbox version of the game might do well to wait for the recently            announced Platinum re-release of Onimusha for the PlayStation 2, as            ultimately this game is no longer worth \u00a340 of your hard            earned cash.                        -                            Genma Onimusha screenshots                    Genma Onimusha screenshotsOnimusha                    PlayStation 2 reviewOnimusha                    PlayStation 2 review"}
