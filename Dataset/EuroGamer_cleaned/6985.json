Despite its title, Serious Sam is a first person shooter which            doesn't take itself too seriously, replacing the intricate            storylines, elaborate scripted sequences, realistic weaponry and            advanced artificial intelligence which we have all become used to            in the last few years with its own unique brand of high octane            action and oddball humour. Sam himself seems to have been part of a            bizarre cloning experiment involving the DNA of Duke Nukem (locked            away in cryogenic deep freeze since his last excursion back in the            mid 1990s), and is always ready with an amusing one liner, equally            at home laying down the smack on his enemies and whistling the            Indiana Jones theme as giant boulders roll past him.                    The plot (as far as it goes, which isn't any great distance) is            something of a mixture of Stargate and Terminator, with you playing            the role of ~Serious~ Sam Stone, a futuristic special forces            operative sent back in time to battle aliens in ancient Egypt, with            the goal of assassinating one of their leaders before he can            destroy the human race. Really it's less of a story and more of an            excuse for you to battle hordes of bizarre monsters with overkill            weapons whilst admiring some truly spectacular scenery. Which is no            bad thing.                    The focus is very much on action, with a Doom-like intensity which            makes even last year's KISS : Psycho Circus look tame in            comparison. One of the most chaotic maps features more monsters            than appeared in the whole of Quake, although thankfully there is            usually a plentiful supply of ammunition on hand to deal with them.                    In fact Serious Sam owes more to the classic side-scrolling            shooters of yore than it does to modern games like Half-Life, with            hordes of enemies charging towards you in waves, just waiting to be            blasted to smithereens. Stunning set piece battles lock you into            huge arenas and then throw literally hundreds of monsters at you.            You will find yourself trying to pick off screaming suicide bombers            (while Sam screams back at them - ~I can shout too!~), blasting            away at a hundred foot tall lava golem which splits up            Asteroids-style into ever smaller lumps as you damage it, and            facing a seemingly never-ending stampede of giant tusked animals in            a narrow road, like something from the running of the bulls in            Spain, the ground literally shaking (or maybe that was just me) as            they thunder towards you.                    This is one of the wildest, most scary games I've played in a long            time, with monsters hiding around almost every corner waiting to            leap out of the shadows and maul you. Many of your enemies like to            get up close and personal, making for some real in-your-face action            as you fight off their unwelcome advances. At times you will            physically jump in surprise, while some of the most hectic boss            encounters will have your heart pumping pure adrenaline through            burning veins as you struggle to take down entire armies of            monsters single-handed. AI is not a strongpoint of the game, but            what your enemies lack in brains they more than make up for in            numbers and sheer persistence.                    If the action is heart attack inducing, the scenery is rather more            relaxing but equally impressive, from rolling sand dunes to            spectacular temples and entire cities. Emerging from the desert to            see Memphis for the first time is an experience you won't easily            forget, with the sparkling white walls of the ancient city            stretching off for hundreds of meters on either side of you, and            painted towers and pyramids stretching high into the sky beyond.                    The textures are incredibly detailed, and the grandiose            architecture and intricate wall paintings of ancient Egypt are a            perfect showcase for them. Although Serious Sam has its fair share            of torch lit tunnels and dingy crypts to explore, much of the game            takes place above ground beneath a blazing African sun, and this            bright and colourful world is a welcome change from the traditional            miserable looking gothic castles and rusty futuristic military            bases of most first person shooters.                    The levels themselves are often fairly linear, guiding you from one            encounter to the next with little time to wander off and explore            your surroundings, but you will be too busy pumping your shotgun to            let this worry you unduly. There are also few puzzles beyond the            usual button pressing and lever pulling, and moving on to the next            area is more likely to be brought about by mowing down waves of            monsters than through any kind of mental exertion. This makes            levels seem even bigger than they are (which is pretty huge to            start with), and you can find yourself constantly advancing and            retreating across the same area as you trigger the appearance of            another horde of enemies, fall back with guns blazing, and then            cautiously advance again to meet the next group.                    If the gameplay can seem a little repetitive at times, the wide            range of weapons and monsters on offer helps to compensate. Sam            starts out with a combat knife (which is best left for carving up            your Sunday roast) and a pistol, but soon picks up shotguns, an Al            Capone style tommy gun, the ubiquitous rocket and grenade            launchers, and even what looks suspiciously like a cannon towards            the end of the game. Special effects are suitably big and brash,            with beautiful rocket trails and shockwave-festooned explosions,            not to mention the obligatory surplus of blood and gore.                    Monsters come in all shapes and sizes, from giant mechs and            headless soldiers with various high tech weapons at their disposal,            through to exploding frogs and vast demons which hurl balls of            molten rock at you. Models and textures are surprisingly detailed            for a game which can have you fighting dozens of enemies at once            and only in the biggest of battles do things start to bog down a            little. There are plenty of graphics options to fiddle around with            if you find your computer can't keep up with the pace of the action            though.                    Sound is also used to great effect, and the clattering of hooves as            a kleer skeleton scampers towards you is enough to send shivers up            your spine after a few unfortunate encounters, while the distant            screams of a suicide bomber has you spinning frantically trying to            work out what direction it's coming from. Sam's frequent taunting            and triumphant shouts (~owned!~) is usually amusing and well timed,            and apart from a few groan-inducing puns the jokes are more or less            spot on.                    Serious Sam isn't particularly intelligent or even enormously            original, but if you are looking for a game where you can disengage            your brain and indulge in some good old fashioned wholesale            slaughter then this is about as good as they come. The button            pounding action is the most frantic you will find this side of an            arcade shooter, the graphics second only to the likes of Quake 3,            and the brightly lit Egyptian scenery a refreshing change from the            norm.                    Taking all the best bits from Doom, Duke Nukem and Defender, it's            silly, but a lot of fun. And at just \u00a319.99 it's certainly            well worth a closer look, so start polishing your shotguns!
