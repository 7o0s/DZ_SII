First            of all you have the simulations, heavy on statistics and accurate            driving models, often with fancy graphics to lace it all together            and endless tweaking potential. The more challenging and            comprehensive of these are practically timeless - Geoff Crammond's            Grand Prix III springs to mind. Secondly you have games which            simulate and speculate, which, when done well as with Gran Turismo            can be a real pleasure to play, tickling your chin with both            simulation and arcade racing modes.                         The third category is pure arcade racers, and these are harder to            pigeonhole. If you've ever driven a car you can tell whether a            simulation is on the money, but when you chuck all of the rules of            physics and science out of the window it becomes more difficult.            Downforce is one of the purest arcade racers released in a long            time.                         Eschewing the traditions of Formula 1, a group of renegade racers            has formed its own alternative association, and now banned from            world-renowned circuits like Silverstone and Monaco the organisers            have set up tracks which stretch Project Gotham-style throughout            urban metropoli. The vehicles no longer closely resemble one            another, with radical alterations leading to cars with ferocious            acceleration, higher top speeds and sudden braking. This is a game            where a hairpin turn means slamming the pedal to the metal, and            then screeching to an almost halt to pull away in thunderous style,            a manoeuvre which when performed correctly can help you avoid an            unceremonious slide, capitulation to the G-forces of nature and a            spectacular crash. It ain't real, but it sure is fun.                    The game's introductory video begins in cinematic fashion with cars            revving up on the starting grid, before they roar off and start            flying and spiralling about at the first corner. Although you won't            be doing that immediately, the latter sections of the single player            game are fought with some guile by your AI-controlled opponents,            who for the most part are just as uncompromising as you. They will            plough into you without a second thought, but fortunately if you do            end up watching your car hurtle along and disintegrate, it is            immediately righted and flashes for a few seconds to help you avoid            immediate collisions.                         The structure of the game is a bit odd, with two fairly similar            gameplay modes making up the majority of the single player game.            Trophy mode gives you tracks to complete in sets of three by            placing first to third, and while Championship mode includes a            qualifying section and a points system it is ostensibly the same            thing. Tracks improve in quality and go up in difficulty, with            anything from intermediate level upwards jam-packed with corners,            hairpins and suspension-buggering curbs, so it's quite an enjoyable            slog.                         The HUD keeps you up to date with information on your position,            speed, the lap you're in and your lap times, and although you don't            get a rear view, a little car radar in the top right helps you to            spot competitors close by and prevent them from scooting through if            you aren't quite going as fast as them.                    Graphically Downforce is a pretty elegant racer with a cartoon            finish. The characters are all fairly anonymous but their vehicles            differ in plenty of ways, and there are greater and more exciting            cars to be unlocked the more you play. Cars have different            markings, obviously, but they are also varied in length, width and            in terms of their various accessories. Some of them fold into            themselves slightly to attain better aerodynamics during long            straights, and some of them spit flame out of the back or worse, so            there's a lot to be said for trying out each one.                         Taking your car out for a spin you will be impressed with the draw            distance, but otherwise the graphics are fairly chunky and low-res,            even if the image is extremely sharp. The street textures are nice,            but there are only so many ways to paint a barrier grey so Smartdog            has had to experiment elsewhere with lighting effects and other            trackside paraphernalia. The sun peeks through between skyscrapers            at times, blinding you unhelpfully, and some tracks are bathed in            twilight or murky and 'orrible. Complementing the atmosphere are            some fairly unobtrusive techno beats but the noise of roaring            engines is more important and done quite well.                         There are roadside distractions aplenty but you won't want to take            your eyes off the tarmac for too long, because one missed curb            could flip you. In fact this becomes an issue at times, because            while the lines on the road are often unimportant, it's difficult            to pick out a curb and it can at the very least knock miles from            your speedo, which doesn't help in such a hi-octane racing game.                         Oh, and it's not 60Hz, but the framerate is top-notch throughout            and it does feature a screen centring utility. Okay?                    Lonely hermits will do all right with the single player game, but I            was also initially excited by the Time Tag multiplayer option,            which pits you against a friend with a simple objective: build up a            lead. Pass a certain distance threshold and your opponent will be            faced with a deadline to close the gap, dropping a point should he            fail. The problem is that it's a bit stop-starty, and the car with            superior acceleration often triumphs regardless of actual driving            skill. It's quite good fun, especially if you think you're about to            lose and your careless opponent flips his vehicle through some            chicane, allowing you to claim the point, but I lost interest quite            quickly.                         The free race mode is actually somewhat preferable. This is a very            fast-paced game, and thundering along behind your worried mate and            then laughing maniacally as he loses control is one of those very            special experiences. With such a large variety of tracks on offer            you'll want to try them all, and there's definitely longevity here,            and also for single players in time trial, where lightning            reactions and daredevil antics are required to top the            leaderboards.                         To some Downforce will seem irritating and inconsistent. Sometimes            the process of crashing and re-righting seems to take forever,            whereas elsewhere you can be up in a flash, and the AI is sometimes            a bit too good, reducing any lead you might build up in            seconds should you come unstuck, but ultimately this is a harmless,            adrenaline-soaked arcade gauntlet you'll want to run. Like the            drivers they created, Smartdog has ignored a lot of the traditions            of the genre and produced a racer easily suitable for a quick burn            now and then, and if you can find a friend the superb two-player            split-screen races with no obvious drop in detail and a top            framerate will definitely win you over."}
