That, and the extremely interesting            four-game-bundle keeping today's headline-writers busy, should see            Xbox in a significantly more influential position after Christmas,            and if MechAssault is an example of the quality of Xbox Live game            we can expect, then perhaps it's no surprise.        All the best games are built            on simple foundations, and MechAssault developer Day 1 Studios            knows better than to complicate matters. Anybody with more than a            few minutes of stick-time in any number of dual-analogue action            games will be a MechAssault master by midnight. Lefty moves the            mech, righty aims the mech, left trigger cycles weapons, right            trigger fires guns. If you're in a multiplayer game, you can survey            the leaderboard by holding the white button, and anything else you            might want to do/know is conveniently available from the pause            menu. It should be noted for online multiplayer virgins, however,            that the pause menu only pauses the action in the single player            campaign.                    Speaking of the lone gunman's prospects, we had expected a very            short, curt one player mode along the lines of that found in            Digital Extreme's Unreal Championship, but we were actually            pleasantly surprised to find a quite lengthy (and devilishly hard,            if you opt for the upper echelons of the detailed, Halo-esque            difficulty selection) undertaking with plenty of story hidden            behind the ominous Campaign button. Like Unreal, the basic gameplay            doesn't deviate too much from what you'll be doing online, apart            from the overlay of reasonably well-spoken sci-fi dialogue, but            it's very compelling.                    What you do is pick a mech (beginning with small, scout-classes and            moving up to hulking juggernauts before long, even unlocking some            stupendously powerful monstrosities if you complete the campaign)            and, quite simply, destroy everything - every enemy unit, every            enemy installation, every shack full of the planet's fanatical            Hitler-esque regime's followers, every shred of evidence that            anything existed. You do this using a variety of weapons and tools,            ranging from basic laser guns and miniguns to lightning-spouting,            railgun-esque blasters and heat-seeking projectiles. You can also            use a jetpack to reach elevated positions, which is quite useful            because the terrain in MechAssault is anything but level.        The landscape isn't so much dotted with buildings in amongst            the hordes of enemies as a little brother's vulnerable playset laid            out in the path of your stompy new shoes. Huge, rolling hills,            ridges and the planet's road and tunnel systems make for nice            scenery, but anything with four walls and a roof is game for            destruction. Pop a bullet into the average building and a little            window will smash, complete with shattering sound effect and            crumbling visuals. Fire a laser blast and half the wall is ripped            away, exposing the dark interior. Light it up with a heat-seeking            missile and a great gaping, smouldering hole will appear, and after            a number of blasts the building will lose its tensile strength and            fall to the ground in a pillar of smoke. The effect is one of the            most satisfyingly destructive in any game on any platform. And you            often have to beckon it out by ruining perfectly good masonry as            many as 50 times per level.                    However, although your orders are to purge the area, it's often            advantageous to keep the buildings around until you're done            polishing off the locals. Although foot soldiers won't cause much            trouble (you can actually squish them simply by walking over them),            mobile tanks can be an arse, and those stationary cannons on the            outside of installations are murder on a mech's paintwork. As the            campaign draws on though, the enemy wheels out mechs both great and            small, individually and in great numbers, and they take an insane            amount of damage before they go off like a nuclear explosion            (complete with mushroom cloud if you're lucky).                    Combat is very engaging, with lots of strafing and strategic use of            weaponry. If you're fighting in amongst buildings, you can often            get one to fall down damagingly on your prey, or better yet, you            can sneak inside one of them, Godzilla-like, and wait pensively for            the oblivious soon-to-be-scrap mech to round the corner.                    The 20 missions of the single player campaign basically rotate            around mech combat and city-clearing, with lots of armour and ammo            pick-ups strewn around and unearthed from the rubble of            past-buildings. It only takes about five or six hours to complete,            give or take a few hours of retrying levels, but it's very            enjoyable. If anything, the only criticisms to be levelled at            MechAssault's single player are the understandably repetitive            nature of the beast and the lack of mid-level save points, but            neither is terminal, and my guess is that 90 per cent of you are            more interested in the multiplayer aspect anyway.                    A good thing, because multiplayer is the best way to play            MechAssault.        Getting online with MechAssault is a            breeze (based on testing with the Xbox Live beta service, at any            rate). Simply choose whether to join a game already in progress or            host your own, and play. Games consist of up to eight players            dashing around in deathmatch and last man standing modes, either in            free-for-all (FFA) or team modes. Completely lag free over a cable            modem, the game seems to be doing very well online with several            thousand players dotted around. The comm. chatter over Communicator            is quite fun (particularly with robotic voice masking) and nobody's            worked out any way to exploit it yet, something which will come as            a great relief to anybody who's dabbled with console games online            in the past.                    However, those of you without Microsoft's great online games dream            firmly on your shopping list may want to reconsider. Fun though            MechAssault's single player campaign most certainly is, it isn't            going to last you more than a couple of evenings. The split-screen            two player mode is a nice addition, and you'll be able to have lots            of fun with that, but it doesn't look as spectacular with the            reduced viewing area, and in the absence of more than two players            regularly breaks down into mechs circling one another firing            heat-seekers. Shame.                    Planning to pick up an Xbox Live Test Drive kit? Then you should            make sure you get this too. Online play is definitely the way to go            with MechAssault, and coupled with an enjoyable single player            campaign (and incentives to actually play it, too), this is an            absolute must for Live players, and by all accounts behaves better            than the reportedly lag-ridden Unreal Championship. The prospect of            downloadable content (option on the menu) seals the deal -            MechAssault is a beautiful, addictive, mechanised feast of            destruction, ideally suited to online gamers both new and old.
