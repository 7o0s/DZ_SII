Some noble attempts have been made, certainly -            X: Beyond The Frontier is one which has a lot of fans, for a start            - but in general, the sheer amount of content and the incredible            reputation you have to live up to seems to dissuade developers from            working on this kind of game.                    Unless, of course, you're Chris and Erin Roberts - the men behind            the Wing Commander series, who set out to create a sprawling,            hugely ambitious free-roaming space trading and combat sim way back            in 1997. The development team at Digital Anvil has seen plenty of            changes since then, including a change of leadership when Microsoft            took charge of the project in 2000, but now Freelancer is finally            here - an epic in terms of development time, if nothing else.        Writing            about Freelancer, the first word that springs to mind is            ~polished~, because the game is certainly that. It's refreshing and            enjoyable to encounter a PC title with the same kind of production            values and attention to detail that goes into the best console            games, and Freelancer has been buffed to a shine from start to            finish. The intro video to the game is a perfect example, featuring            a gravely voiceover which explains the history of the universe            you're about to enter while stunningly rendered (and very Babylon            5-esque) footage of space battles runs in the background. Then it's            off into in-game cut scenes which deal with slightly more current            affairs, including the destruction of a space station by agents            unknown, and introduce your initially very hard to like character,            Trent, who is left with nothing but the clothes on his back            following the destruction of the station.                    No flying around for you yet, though - first you have to acquire a            ship. You begin the game on Planet Manhattan, in the New York            system - and like most stations and planets in the game, it has a            grand total of five locations, namely the launch pad, the bar, the            equipment dealer, the commodities dealer and the spaceship dealer.            You access each individual location by clicking a tab at the top of            the screen, and can then speak to people there by clicking on them            - an icon appears over each one to give you some idea of the sort            of conversation they may have on offer.                    A little bit of poking around will locate you a ship and an early            mission to fly, which effectively counts as a tutorial by            introducing you to a variety of aspects of the Freelancer universe            - such as some of the different factions, the trade lanes which            speed up interplanetary travel, and the basics of combat. From here            on, you'll alternate playing the ~freeform~ game, in which you can            take on whatever missions you like at the bars on various planets            and stations, or act as a commodity trader, or even become a pirate            or asteroid miner, whilst also tackling ~plot~ missions which move            the story of the game forwards and gradually open up more and more            of the universe for you to explore.        If that all            sounds a little familiar, that's probably because you've been            playing Grand Theft Auto recently - and indeed, comparisons between            Freelancer and GTA, however unlikely that may sound, are actually            quite solid. Digital Anvil has spent ages creating a living,            breathing universe for you to explore, in which plenty of stuff            happens without your intervention (you'll often see pirates            attacking convoys as you fly past, or the military laying into a            group of rogue ships - and of course you can pile in and help            either side as you see fit) and in which you have quite a bit of            freedom to do as you like and to play the game in whatever way you            see fit. The sensation of a living universe is interesting on a            superficial level - such as listening in to radio transmissions            between space stations and nearby ships - but it's also important            to the game itself. You'll gradually develop friends and enemies            among the factions, for example, which can restrict what parts of            the universe it's safe to travel to, or who will give you jobs and            information.                    In other ways, however, Freelancer is far more rigidly linear that            Grand Theft Auto. At preset points in the game - determined by your            character's growth in terms of net worth - you'll be contacted by            someone who drags you into a plot mission, and you don't really            have a choice about whether you take part in this or not. Although            the plot missions are quite entertaining (especially in comparison            to normal missions picked up at bars, which generally boil down to            ~go here and kill everyone you see~), once you commence one you're            locked into it for quite a while, which can be annoying as it often            feels like you're being dragged by the nose through areas which            you'd far prefer to hang around and do other things in.                    To make matters worse, if you fail an objective in a plot mission,            it's game over - you don't get to retry the mission without loading            a save game (although thankfully Freelancer does save the game for            you at sensible times). All of this is annoying when compared to            GTA; for someone expecting the pure freeform gameplay of Elite,            however, it'll be infuriating. That said, taken on its own merits            rather than compared to other games, the plot structure of            Freelancer has a lot going for it; it's interesting, doesn't have            too many long cut scenes, presents you with some really spectacular            space battles and, pleasantly, has excellent voice acting all            round.        When it comes to the            actual flight and combat system in the game, Freelancer takes an            unusual approach which pays huge dividends - namely, it eschews the            use of the joystick entirely, and is designed from the ground up to            be controlled with a keyboard and mouse. We can hear the space            flight sim enthusiasts howling from here, but don't worry -            although the flight system takes a while to get used to, it's            actually very precise and a lot of fun, feeling a little bit like a            first-person shooter but with full rotation on every axis. In fact,            the default key setup uses the standard FPS keys - namely WSAD for            throttle up, throttle down, slide left and slide right - with the            mouse for looking about and shooting. Your weapons follow the mouse            cursor exactly and right clicking fires bound weapons, while other            keys unleash missiles, torpedoes and countermeasures, and yet more            keys refresh your shield batteries or release canisters of nanobots            to repair your ship hull.                    It only takes a very short while to get used to the controls of the            game, and once you do, they feel very precise. The physics used are            distinctly in the realms of science fiction, so you won't have any            trouble getting your head around the control of your ship, and            there are plenty of handy automated commands so that you don't have            to manually handle tedious things like keeping on course throughout            long journeys or docking with space stations - very handy if you're            returning from a mission to a planetary docking ring twenty clicks            away and dying for a potty break...                    As you progress through the game, you'll gradually upgrade to new            ships and attach better weapons to your hardpoints - which is            initially a lot of fun, as your hard-earned credits go into new and            more evil beam weapons and missiles to knock your targets out of            the sky. However, this gradually begins to feel like a levelling            treadmill - not least because the degree to which you can upgrade            your ship at any given point is fairly limited, and the enemies you            face become harder at almost exactly the same rate as your ship            becomes more powerful. Although it can be fun to go back and slap            around some of the people who gave you trouble previously,            ultimately it's a bit of a shame that later battles in the game            don't play out in a particularly different way to early ones, and            the tactics which work two hours into the game will work just as            well ten hours later.        The parts of the game            where you're free to fly around and do as you please are quite            interesting, but again there's a question mark over the level of            variety offered by the game. On each space station or planet,            you'll go through the same ritual - repair your ship, replenish            your ammunition, and sell any goodies you collected in battle. Then            it's off to the bar to chat to the locals and see if you can find            out any useful information - the answer to which is generally no,            you can't. Many people in the bars will talk to you and tell you            ~rumours~, which generally turn out to be of little real value to            you. The game constructs the speech of NPCs like these from            snippets of recorded dialogue, which doesn't work all that well -            the library of phrases available to them is very limited, and the            conversations you'll have in the bar are almost laughably stilted,            not to mention very monotonous. The other option here is looking at            the jobs board, where you can find work for a gun for hire such as            yourself.                    As mentioned previously, this work all generally boils down to the            same thing - going to a location in space, usually in an asteroid            field or something along those lines, and killing all the bad guys            that show up. We'd have liked to see a lot more variation in these            missions - a few more convoy escort missions, or what have you,            would have spiced this section of the game up nicely. That said,            the combat model in the game is certainly enjoyable enough that            killing bad guys doesn't really ever get boring, so this isn't too            much of a black mark against the game.                    The other options open to you are trading and mining. Trading is a            relatively simple affair - perhaps a little too simple in fact,            since you'll find that prices for goods are static throughout the            universe. Freelancer operates no economy simulation, making it            extremely simple to profit through trading - but without any            element of risk involved, it's quite a tedious business. Mining            comes under the same heading, as you can make decent money mining            the asteroid fields but again, it's something you need to be very            patient to profit from.        The multiplayer options offered by Freelancer are intriguing,            but we can't help but feel that this is another game you won't            particularly want to play on online public servers. You have the            ability to create your own server, and in a manner not dissimilar            to last summer's RPG title Neverwinter Nights. Characters are            stored on the server - giving you a persistent world that you can            log into and play with your friends. Not quite massively            multiplayer, but fairly bloody big multiplayer nonetheless.                    The potential for flying missions and levelling up as a group            within a persistent world such as that offered by Freelancer online            is immense; however, we suspect that a lot of online servers may            opt for the more short-term fun of giving everyone enough cash to            buy a top-notch ship as soon as they log in, thus removing the            levelling up element of the game. If you have a group of friends to            play Freelancer with, it'll be great fun multiplayer - but don't            rely on public online servers for the same kind of experience at            all.                    We can't help but feel that Freelancer falls somewhat short of the            expectations set by Chris and Erin Roberts when they talked about            the epic scale of the project, and it's obvious that many of the            original ambitions for the game have fallen by the wayside since it            was conceived - mostly, we suspect, for technical reasons. The            universe the game has created is certainly interesting and dynamic,            but the range of things you can do within it is limited - albeit            that, like GTA, it offers the potential for finding new and amusing            things to do, such as getting yourself chased by a squadron of            bandits and leading them right into the guns of a military            battlecruiser...                    Despite not quite living up to expectations, however, Freelancer is            an enormous amount of fun to play. The game does suffer from a lack            of innovation as it progresses, but the basics of the gameplay are            solid and the sheer polish of the title - not to mention the            interesting plotline - are enough to keep you going for many, many            hours. Although somewhat flawed, Freelancer has enough charm and            enjoyable gameplay to rank it as one of the best PC games in a long            time, and one of the best PC space sims ever. If the online            multiplayer element really takes off and is done properly, then add            an extra mark on top of this verdict as well."}
