Since then a few developers have            attempted to mirror its success, but most have fallen short. Have            Lemon Interactive done any better with            the-game-formerly-known-as-Starmageddon, or have they merely lived            up to their rather unfortunate name?                        Project Earth makes a fairly good first impression, mostly thanks            to its eye-catching graphics. Space is colourful without being            garish, and the ships within it are nicely detailed, leave pretty            trails behind them as they fly around and produce spectacular            explosions when they're destroyed. It's hardly a leap forwards from            Homeworld, but it is pretty enough. The camera controls you use to            navigate this space would be more at home in a first person            shooter, but by the time you've completed the (admittedly rather            dull) tutorial most of it should be second nature. The mouse            rotates your view of the universe, the arrow keys move you left and            right, backwards and forwards, and page up and page down handle            vertical movement, while clicking the middle mouse button zooms you            quickly to whatever spot in space the cursor is currently hovering            over. If you need to select multiple units or click on one of the            interface buttons ringing the screen, simply hold down the control            key and your view locks into place, leaving the cursor free to move            around the screen in a more traditional manner.                        Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. The plot is a            clich\u00e9-ridden mishmash of ideas pinched from other games and            movies, starting with a mysterious race of aliens hitching a lift            behind a comet which appears out of thin air headed straight            towards Earth. Now where have I heard that one before? Dialogue and            voice acting are unremarkable, and the alien voices are garbled by            some hilariously poor processing which makes them sound like            juvenile Daleks. Sound effects are repetitive and uninspiring, and            quickly become annoying in the midst of big battles as the same            four or five laser noises are triggered over and over again,            booming out across half the map. The one redeeming factor on the            audio side is the spacey electronic soundtrack, which is actually            quite good.                    Project Earth doesn't fare any better on the gameplay front either.            The human campaign, for example, starts with a tedious mission            forcing you to mine or destroy every asteroid in the map, but as            you can't carry any ships, technology or resources from one mission            to the next this is a monumental waste of time and effort that            doesn't teach you anything that you haven't learnt already in the            tutorial.                        Mission descriptions are vague and often unhelpful, and the game            gives you almost no help once you've started. In some levels you're            expected to control more than one mothership at a time, in            completely seperate maps representing different sectors of space,            leaving you to flick between them using the function keys with no            clue as to what's going on elsewhere. If any of these motherships            are destroyed, the game ends abruptly with absolutely no            explanation, which may leave you wondering what the heck just            happened.                        Thankfully the European version of the game does at least include            the ability to pause and save the game mid-mission, something            woefully lacking in the US release, but the lengthy load times can            still prove painful. You wouldn't think that it would take over            half a minute to paint a pretty backdrop and plonk a few lumps of            rock into a big empty space. And if you're finding the going too            tough (or too easy) you're out of luck - difficulty settings are            only available in the game's skirmish mode.                    What really sinks Project Earth though is the AI, which is pitiful            even by the low standards of the real-time strategy genre. Ships            show little or no initiative most of the time, and will quite            happily sit staring into space as your base ship is picked apart            with laser beams a few pixels away.                        The enemy AI is just as poor, showing no understanding of attack            and defence and instead simply launching units at you in a            piecemeal fashion and then watching as they get blown to            smithereens. If you can withstand the initial onslaught you'll be            hard pressed to lose in a fair fight, as all you need to do is            occupy the area with the most asteroids and pick off enemy mining            units as they come to collect resources. The AI will continue            building miners and sending them straight into your fighters time            and again without so much as varying the route they take, so if you            just sit back and wait the computer will eventually run out of            resources and you can take apart its base ships at your leisure.                        Project Earth also lacks most of the niceties of modern strategy            games, such as waypoints, patrol routes and guard orders. All you            can do is tell a ship to be aggressive (in which case it moves to            chase any enemy that passes right under its nose, even if that            leads it into the heart of the enemy base) or defensive (it stands            rooted to the spot whatever happens and just fires back at anything            shooting it). Oh, and there's a self-destruct button, which is            handily placed right next to the aggression controls and doesn't            bother to ask you whether you really meant to press it before            blowing up every unit you currently have selected. Nice one. When            it comes to manhandling your ships, they can be told to attack a            single unit (by clicking on the target - almost impossible for            small fast moving fighters) or a group of enemies (by holding down            the alt button and dragging the mouse over the ships you want to            attack). You'll need to do this a lot though, as units have a            tendency to stop fighting in the middle of a battle and just sit            around waiting for something to shoot at them, even when they're            supposedly set to aggressive. This almost total lack of automation            combined with dumb AI leaves you to micro-manage practically            everything.                    The game is also deeply unhelpful and user unfriendly at times, not            bothering to tell you little things like what a given unit actually            does when you start building it. Given that ships are all named            after ancient Greek monsters and the like, working out what they            are can be a case of trial and error.                        Luckily there are only a handful of combat units on each side for            you to learn, although Lemon seem to have managed to make even            these unbalanced. The biggest, most expensive units are completely            overpowering, virtually invulnerable, and have beam weapons that            can reduce your mothership to dust faster than you can reload the            level. It doesn't help that your mothership is fairly weak and            completely defenceless without an escort. Meanwhile the game's tech            tree is more of a stunted lawn, with everything available to            research from the outset, although you do at least have to choose            your priorities as most technological advances are a case of            ~either, or~. For example, do you want fighters to cause more            damage to stationary or moving enemies, and would you prefer your            miners to move faster or have bigger cargo bays?                        Continuing the trail of despair is the multiplayer support, which            is essentially a waste of space. There's no in-game server browser            or matchmaking facility, and Project Earth doesn't even support            third party browsers like GameSpy, surely the lowest common            denominator for multiplayer gaming on the PC these days? Your only            option is to find someone else who wants to play online and type in            their IP address by hand, which is so 1995. If you actually            do find an opponent, or enough mugs willing to play the game at a            LAN party, you have a choice of about half a dozen uninspiring and            often poorly designed maps with room for between two and eight            players. You can play against the computer in skirmish mode, but            given the shortcomings of the AI this isn't a particularly            entertaining alternative.                    Project Earth is without doubt the worst Homeworld clone I have            ever had the misfortune to play, falling far short of its potential            thanks to some fairly elementary design flaws. There's little            tactical depth, unit behaviour controls are almost non-existent,            the campaign is tedious and unforgiving, the AI lousy and the            multiplayer bodged. Do yourself a favour, if you must have a            space strategy game, pick up a budget copy of Homeworld and leave            this lemon on the shelf."}
