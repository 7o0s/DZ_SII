Drugged and weak, Cord struggles hard to remember            how he came to be in such a predicament.                    The one thing that he knows for certain is that he was betrayed,            but by who and why escapes him. He definitely remembers his mission            objective, which was to track down a missing agent. He also recalls            that what began as a simple task became far more complicated,            changing instead to the prevention of a nuclear holocaust. As            Cord's memory gradually returns, he starts to tell his story right            from the very beginning, and this is where the game begins, playing            out a succession of John's memories, until you finally discover            just what went wrong, and who it was that betrayed Cord.                    In Cold Blood is an arcade adventure game set in Volgia, a former            republic of Russia, giving the game an instant grim atmosphere from            the start. You meet up with freedom fighter Gregor Kostov, who            helps you at the beginning of the game, and will pop up again            throughout at key moments...         You can choose to play the            game in two ways, either as a headless chicken topping any guards            that move, or the far more beneficial stealth method. Cord can            creep along silently and unleash a lethal chop to the back of the            head. Not only does this conserve your bullets for more volatile            situations, but it also doesn't alert other guards to your            presence.                    One thing that Revolution have tried to achieve is the feeling that            you are not just one guy going up against the guards, but part of a            living world. Technicians and other servants of Nagarov go about            their business, and most of them will find time to chat with Cord,            often providing vital information. Robots also patrol the            buildings, but these are impervious to your gunfire, requiring            accurate timing to evade them or sabotage their recharge stations.                    Cord is equipped with the handy REMORA wrist device, enabling him            to hack into security systems, keep a full database on everyone he            meets, and display a radar scan of his immediate surroundings. The            latter is extremely useful for showing you how many guards are in a            particular room, or whereabouts a patrolling robot currently is.                    The emphasis is clearly on communication. You will often find that            having spoken to somebody once, you can revisit them later in the            game to squeeze more information from them relating to subjects            that you have discussed with other characters in the meantime. This            even includes some totally irrelevant conversation threads, like            chatting about a football game which two guys are watching! A truly            inspired feature is the ability to threaten the characters with            your gun, sometimes reaping greater information rewards.                    Controlling Cord is sometimes very frustrating though, with a            tendency for the controls to be overly sensitive to your key            presses, resulting in your character facing in completely the wrong            direction. With this finicky setup it becomes almost laborious to            get Cord to walk into tight areas. Another real annoyance is the            occasionally poor sensing of actionable areas - you can sometimes            be miles away from a door, press action on something else, and the            game will think that you have selected the door button rather than            what you were intending to press. When time is against you, as it            is later on in the game, this can be scream inducing!         The whole            game plays and feels like you are in a movie, with the plot            intelligently woven around FMV sequences of Cord with his            torturers. The movies are superbly rendered, and owing to his            drugged up state of mind are fairly confusing to follow, as you            would expect. Clips of equal quality are also used throughout to            depict poignant sections of the game.                    It's not just the FMV clips that give the whole film-like feel            though; the voice acting is exceptionally good, making you actually            care about the characters. Cord's English voice is calm but with            dark undertones suggesting you really should not mess with him, and            the bad guys really do sound like they mean business.                    Every person you come across speaks with their own individual            voice, along with varied personalities. A lot of humour has been            injected into the dialogue too, keeping things nicely balanced and            entertaining. When you meet up with the male and female technicians            who are arguing over a stupid hat, you will know what I mean!         On first playing the game I was immediately reminded of the            classic arcade adventure ~Beneath A Steel Sky~. The graphical            design and overall look is very distinguishable, and I was not            surprised at all to learn that the team behind In Cold Blood also            created the aforementioned title.                    The pre-rendered backdrops look excellent, and in most cases            include spot animations to give them some added life. The            animations are simple but very effective, like the light fittings            juddering on the land-train, or the soft ripple of water in the            mines. Great care has been taken to make sure you never have your            vision obscured by the camera angle or a piece of scenery, making            for trouble-free scuffles with guards.                    The characters also look very nice, well animated and appearing            solid against the backgrounds. They do however lack in facial            detail, which is quite surprising when you consider how much            dialogue there is in the game, where facial expressions would have            enhanced things even further. Not all of the animations are good            though, with Cord's running style causing laughter when I don't            think it should...         The            game is not without its faults. A lot of the time you will find            that guiding Cord into narrow gaps in the scenery, or positioning            him such that he will climb a ladder, can be a royal pain in the            backside. The controls are generally clumsy both on keyboard and            joypad, with the character turning far too quickly at times, making            collisions with walls and objects a frequent occurrence.                    But aside from these quirks, In Cold Blood is a splendid adventure            filled with humour and intrigue, challenging puzzles, and a            beautifully scripted story. Thoroughly recommended."}
