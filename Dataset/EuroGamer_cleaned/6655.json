They make bell noises when they run,            and have a fixed grin that merely inspires irrational hatred. Hands            up who wants to be a Jester? Hmmmm. The Rent-a-ghost loon was            mildly amusing 20 odd years ago, and Pandemonium was ok, ish, but            we can't see anyone rushing to do a next gen sequel.                    Also pushing the Jester concept hard in the list of ~things that            should be outlawed in game development~ is making self consciously            'kiddie' games. It's just a bad idea. It never works. Stop it. But            Sony, as the platform holder, still has to be seen to support the            ageing PSone thanks to its steadfast refusal to stop selling, and            figures that bunging out an inoffensive colourful 3D platform game            for \u00a320 is the way to keep mum and her little Johnny quiet.        There, with that out of the way, we can feel the tension            draining out of our bodies and can go about our task of describing            what Jinx is all about for the few of you who care. The first thing            you need to know is that Hammerhead did the development - having            done a sterling job of porting Quake II to PSone back in '99 and            coding Blade (with slightly less impressive results) for            Activision. Thus, on a technical level, at least, we were ready to            give Jester a chance to impress us.                    The man with the jingly hat, Jinx, is the star of the game; a            failed magician, the son of a powerful wizard who now works as a            court jester for King Mamooset XIV. Waking up to find the world in            chaos, Jinx finds a group of pirates led by Captain Gripply has            attacked the land of Ploog, turning friend against friend with a            powerful spell, and to add insult to injury the pirates have            kidnapped the royal family and scattered members of the court            across the game world. In other words, he must bound around a            colourful world with lots of stars to collect, doors to unlock,            traps to traverse, blocks to push, water to swim in, and baddies to            bop.                    Unlike the staple platform fare of the 128-bit era, Jinx sticks to            one style of game - the run, jump and collect of old, and thus the            game pretty much plays its entire hand in the first half an hour.            It's colourful, it's generic, it's harmless, and utterly devoid of            any spark of imagination or originality whatsoever, but hey, what            did we really expect?        Every level we encountered has you searching around for objects            for the characters you meet so that platforms descend or doors            unlock - ensuring your progress. It starts off with very simple            ~find key~ or ~find cog~ type tasks, then rapidly builds up to            having to find multiple objects: find seven roses, round up eight            cows, that kind of thing. But whatever it is you're tasked with,            it's the kind of utterly predictable platform game that most of us            thought had been left behind a long time ago. Beating each clueless            baddie consists of pressing the square button when you're in the            vicinity. If they don't go down first time, then a second or third            crack normally does the trick. And if you don't know what to do,            there are dozens of sign posts to tell you exactly how to            progress. Oh yes. Challenging Jinx is not.                    If the utter vaccuousness of the gameplay wasn't enough to have any            sane minded gamer reaching for the off switch, there's always the            hideous camera system to kill any last remaining dregs of            enthusiasm. Time after time you're forced to make leaps of faith            because the camera point blank refuses to give you a decent view of            the action - and with a fairly clunky control system you'll be            continually plunging to instant death. L1 and R1 are assigned to            give you manual control, but it's next to useless thanks to the            game wrenching control back when it feels like it. R2 gives the            player a free look option, which just about save you from throwing            the joypad at the TV, but only just.                    What will have every gamer, young or old, despairing is the save            system - unlike every modern platformer, Jinx offers very few save            opportunities, and regularly you'll be asked to start entire worlds            from scratch if you've not had the chance to save before your lives            run out. Once this kind of event happens, your will to return to            the game is totally gone.                    Visually it's not bad for a PSone game, but by no means some            kind of revelation either. Yes, the worlds are big and bright, the            textures functional, and the character models quite detailed and            rounded. But in this 128-bit era, playing a game on nine year old            technology is always going to take a fair bit of forgiveness - so            seeing walls break up, and chunky textures, you're destined to            wince now and then.                    The audio deserves a special mention for having the ability to            drive you up the wall in record time. It's real plinky plonky            nonsense of the highest order, and any parent reading this should            avoid the game on this basis alone - or at least have the mute            button poised if your offspring is playing the game in the same            room.                    Overall, you'll play worse games than Jinx - it does what it sets            out to do; i.e. be a safe, neat, no frills platformer, that is            suitable for children. But then there are dozens of better games in            the genre on the PSone, and most of them will be available at a            fraction of the price. Avoid.
