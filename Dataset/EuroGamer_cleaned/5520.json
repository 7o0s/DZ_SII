Except in Blackpool, obviously, whereall of the above are still popular. Often simultaneously.Whatever, air hockey isn't cool any more. Or is it? EA certainlythink so, judging by the release of the aptly-named EA Air Hockey.And the more you play it, the more you realise that riskingbroken fingers in the cause of thumping a round puck with aslightly larger round paddle is actually God's Own Game. So it'seven better when your mobile takes the digit-damage out of theequation.On one level, EA Air Hockey is a pretty straightforward air-hockey title,taking advantage of the fact that the game is well-suited to therestrictions of mobile - a limited play area, simple rules,and no need for the sort of complex controls that you might findin, say, a football game.But as you'll see when firing up the Quickplay mode, EA hastaken a leaf out of Digital Chocolate's book when it comes toone-thumb innovation. See, you only use the '5' key to play EA AirHockey. Your paddle hovers around, automatically positioning itselfon the table, so all you have to do is press '5' to push it towardsthe puck.If this sounds a bit dumbed down, don't worry - you stillhave to decide how to time your push to send the puck off at thebest angle. And by holding down '5', you can do a harder shot.Games are played in a first-to-seven-goals format, and theQuickplay mode is a fun way to while away a train or car journey.(As long as you're not driving, of course - in eithercase!)There's also a very neat two-player mode that lets you competeusing one handset. The screen flips horizontally, and player oneuses the '4' key while player two uses the '6' key. We've foundit's incredibly addictive, having tried it on severalinitially-unwilling guinea pigs (that is, our friends, not smallsqueaky pets. They weren't so keen).In both these modes, you can choose to have power-ups switchedon for more unrealistic yet extremely fun action. The power-ups popup in four spots on the table, and if you hit them with the puck,you trigger an effect.The power-ups range from Bounce (the puck comes off the tablewalls at weird angles) and Close (your goal slams shut for a shorttime) through to Tilt (the puck is drawn towards your opponent'sgoal as if the table has been tipped up) and even Ghost (the puckjust passes through your foe's paddle - great fun intwo-player mode).Finally, there's a Challenge mode where you play a series ofmatches and are set certain objectives - for example, toscore a certain number of goals off the right wall, or get aperfect win, or win with no deflected goals, and so on. It does adddepth, although the games can get a bit repetitive if you play toomany in one go.Air Hockey works best in bite-size chunks, which makes it apretty decent mobile game, as does the thought that's clearly goneinto the one-thumb control system. Is it cool? Maybe not, but when it's this much fun whocares?"}
