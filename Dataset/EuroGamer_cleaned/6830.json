Boasting marginally improved visuals and other less obvious            changes the game is effectively just a port. Fortunately for Xbox            owners it is a game of unfathomable depth, featuring amongst others            things an involved franchise mode which can be played for ten            consecutive seasons, and a system of skill levels which award            points for performing specific tasks during a game. Parading your            skills up and down the rink buys you cards, of which 189 are            available, and many of these unlock new features from the sensible            to the outright obscure.                         The ubiquitous Play Now mode lets you get straight onto the ice,            but if you delve slightly deeper you can go for the exhibition mode            with its four player support, or a 16 player tournament mode, or            you could focus on your breakaway skills using the Shootout mode.            Before you begin though, you can adjust all manner of settings both            in gameplay and technical areas (and the difficulty level, which            could do with adjusting given I won my first match eleven goals to            three), not to mention creating a profile to record your            achievements and rack up your points and card totals. During the            game, tasks flash up in gold letters upon completion.                         Graphically NHL 2002 is a mixed bag. Although the players are            nicely modelled they have that tell-tale EA look and almost judder            at times. That said, 700 of them have their real faces, and            animation is very good in general thanks to some wonderful            superfluous detail. Facial expressions are varied and usually            relevant, and players all act realistically, making adjustments to            their stick and collecting stray passes with their feet, although            the players' sharp edges dampen the impact of the close-ups and            opening sequences, and the relatively sober fight sequences are            nowhere near as involved or varied as those witnessed in NHL Hitz            20-02.                    One of the 2002 revision's most controversial features is the            breakaway camera, which switches the game to a letterboxed close-up            and slows the play down whenever a player gets one-on-one with the            goalie. It's a nice effect, with muffled sound effects a la Max            Payne. The controls don't change and it's quite easy to slot the            puck away from this perspective, but whether it adds anything to            the game or not is debatable. The same is also true of the big save            and big hit cameras, which close in on and replay spectacular saves            and body checks. My biggest problem with these features is that            switching between camera modes interferes with play, and ice hockey            games are supposed to flow gracefully.                         Gameplay mechanics have naturally been updated for 2002, with EA            doing none too bad a job of it. Players have more control over the            puck than before, and individual players are singled out for their            abilities and given a sniper, hero, big hitter or big shooter            rating. As you might imagine, a hero can turn the tide with only a            few seconds left in the game. Securing a big comeback win in the            closing moments of an important franchise game is made even more            satisfying by the wide variety of goal celebrations, which can be            bound to various buttons on the controller.                         Meanwhile the duo responsible for the commentary is slightly            wackier than your average John Motson, spouting off cheesy lines            from start till finish. The main guy has that inescapable            excitement often found in American sports commentary, and the            pair's repartee is often triggered by events on the ice. It's rare            not to have them talking, and it makes a nice bit of background            jabber, so although there are a few slip-ups it's worth having it            around. Elsewhere, the sound effects are very good as you might            expect, but the menu music is frankly diabolical, with no jukebox            option in sight.                    NHL 2002 is a serious ice hockey game peppered with some unusual            gimmicks. It lacks a stirring soundtrack and there are a few issues            here and there, but on the whole it's a very good interpretation of            the game with plenty of replay value. I doubt anybody will unlock            everything the game has to offer overnight, and in any event it            keeps you coming back. Although the statistical side of the game            will doubtless be lost on many Europeans, and the slower pace comes            as a shock after NHL Hitz 20-02, the good definitely outweighs the            bad.                        -        NHL Hitz 20-02                    reviewNHL Hitz 20-02                    review"}
