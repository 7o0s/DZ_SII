Any home builder might have to skimp on the mouse and keyboard in            order to maximise on the hardware that they buy, as they are            undoubtedly on a budget. They may well end up with a 'regular'            keyboard and a fairly innocuous mouse that covers all the necessary            bases by simply having buttons on it.                    The off the shelf PCs are more likely to come with slightly better            input devices, especially mice. Ultimately though, any PC owner            interested in gaming is going to notice just how bad their mouse            is.                    Enter Microsoft.         Many people may regard Microsoft as                 being a software house, but they do also make a number of                 input devices. They have in fact been making mice for almost a                 decade now, and if you buy an off the shelf PC the chances are                 that you are using a rebadged Microsoft mouse.                    Since they have been making mice for so long, they have become            rather adept at this little known art. The first mouse they made            was exceptionally ergonomic (a buzzword at the time) and extremely            well weighted. It was this design that really started to make such            a name for Microsoft rodents.                    At the time though there were very few games that would really            require fast, precise mousing action, and for those that did (such            as Doom) there was no real difference drawn between one mouse and            another.                    Years passed and Microsoft redesigned the mouse, at the cost of            many millions, in order to provide a shape that was yet more            ergonomic, and suited to both right and left hand users. This            became known as the MS Mouse v2.0. By this time gaming had            progressed, and gamers were beginning to take a little more note of            the quality of their mice.                    After hitting on such a winning design Microsoft have updated their            mouse with a scrolling wheel, which not only aids scrolling in            Internet Explorer and other apps, but also helps with fast weapon            switching in games like Quake.                    This mouse became the choice for many gamers thanks to its            comfortable shape, good weighting, smooth action, and precise            control. The MS IntelliMouse was really making a name for itself in            the gaming world...                    With the advent of USB, sampling rates increased, yielding greater            input accuracy, and making the MS IntelliMouse a must have for any            gamer. Of course, other companies like Logitech have tried to keep            up, and to some extent they have with some preferring the different            shape and feel that Logitech provide.                    But now Microsoft have jumped ahead again, with an improvement so            sophisticated that it rivals the invention of the mouse itself!         Since the 1960s the mouse has                 utilised two sets of rollers connected to grooved wheels that                 translate to x and y co-ordinates. When these grooved wheels                 spin they cut a beam of light that registers the movement.                    By this method the mouse translates the movement of the rollers            into instructions to move the mouse pointer in the desired            direction. In most cases these rollers have been moved by a hard            rubber mouse ball.                    It is here that Microsoft have made their change. With their new            mice they have replaced the entire mechanism with a fully optical            set up. Instead of a moving ball and internal wheels there is            nothing. There is only a glowing red light that emanates from the            bottom of the mouse, from which all the movement is detected.                    The added advantage of using an optical mechanism is that there are            no moving parts that require cleaning, which will banish the            endless comments regarding dirty mice and poor play.                    To be fair, we have seen optical mice before, but in the past the            they have required a special mouse mat with precise tracking dots            in order to function. Should you wear out or lose it you would have            to fork out whatever the company wanted to charge you for a new            one. Microsoft's new mouse will work on more or less any surface            though.         The new mechanism, dubbed IntelliEye by                 Microsoft, works by scanning the surface at a rate of 1500                 images per second. By using a powerful 16Mips processor it can                 then determine not only the direction of movement, but also                 the rate.                    This in theory means that the IntelliMouse with IntelliEye should            be able to track just as fast, if not faster, than any other mouse            on the market. It should also be able to do this more accurately            too.                    Unfortunately there is a problem, as there always is. While            yielding super accurate tracking and immense response most of the            time, under certain conditions the mouse can become as useless as a            doorstop.                    Microsoft themselves say that while the mouse will work on almost            any surface, one should avoid reflective or transmissive surfaces            like glass or a mirror, and also avoid certain types of repeating            patterns like wood grain.                    When one looks closely, it does appear that while it doesn't            require any special mousing surface like previous optical mice, in            order to achieve good operation a sensible mouse surface still            needs to be used.                    It's very easy to see when the mouse isn't tracking properly, as            the pointer will begin to move in a random fashion or refuse to            move at all. I myself went through half a dozen mouse mats before            finding one that provided a good surface to track on.         Most importantly                 though, how does the IntelliEye technology fare in games?                    Well, in slower RTS style games, for which I used my personal            favourite HomeWorld, the mouse action is smooth, which translates            to fine control over both the camera and units.                    But how does it fare in a much faster paced environment, such as            Quake 3 Arena? Regrettably, I must inform you that while in general            it provides a high degree of accuracy, which is great for precise            camping with the railgun, under moments of extreme combat where            lightning fast mouse response is mandatory for survival, the            IntelliEye started to show its limits.                    At key moments the tracking failed resulting in random movement            that proved very disorientating in a deathmatch. It is possible            that this was due to the mouse surface used, but under other            circumstances no glitches occurred, which does tend to imply that            there is simply a problem with tracking very rapid movements.         IntelliEye is a great technology,                 and it is very nice to use. It takes a little while to get                 used to a mouse with no ball, but once adapted it becomes a                 joy to use. Graphical apps like PhotoShop become a joy to use,                 as the tracking is just that bit more accurate, which in turn                 allows for much easier graphical manipulation.                    Slower games will also benefit from the smoother mouse action, but            when it comes to a serious hardcore deathmatch the IntelliEye can't            quite touch the regular mechanical mouse. It is sad, therefore,            that I cannot recommend the IntelliMouse with IntelliEye            wholeheartedly, as it will not suit everyone's needs.                    If however, you do not play many first person shooters, and will            therefore not require such rapid mouse response, this mouse is            extremely capable and certainly deserves consideration if you are            planning to replace your old mouse.                    While it isn't an ~absolutely must have~ product, it is highly            commended for bringing such a new approach to an old technology."}
