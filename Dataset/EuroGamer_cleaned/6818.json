Darth Vader and            his TIE Advanced. The Death Star. Twice. X-Wings. TIE Fighters.            Stormtroopers. AT-ATs. R2D2. Rogue Leader is Star Wars the way you            remember it. Except this time you're piloting the ships and            fighting for the Rebellion, in the struggle to overcome the evil            GALACTIC EMPIRE. We often compare games to movies, but from the            archetypal star screen introduction right the way through to the            game's monumental climax, this is the ultimate accompaniment and            tribute to those three original Star Wars movies we all cherish.                         Rogue Squadron fans have been rewarded with a superb continuation            to the N64's best Star Wars game. Rogue Leader begins with players            taking on the guise of that whiny runt Skywalker, and as a warm-up            budding pilots must down the original Death Star, first taking out            laser towers and slaying a number of TIE Fighters. With a little            help from Han Solo (and of course the Force) Luke puts pay to            deplorable imperial machinations. And then the game gets            interesting.                         Visually this is Star Wars as you saw it on the big screen. Scenes            from the films are remodelled in the crisp game engine and look            almost perfect, accompanied by John Williams' inimitable score and            virtually any of the films' sound effects you might care to            mention. From the intricately detailed planes of the Death Star            with TIEs swooping this way and that, to the sight of Bespin            emerging from the haze, and the inevitable approach and decimation            of the then imperial-laden city, Rogue Leader leaves little to the            imagination. This is Star Wars. You will feel like you are there.            Is this now clear?                    Good. Then I can start telling you about the rest of it. The            mission structure is deadly simple. You have ten regular missions            to complete, some of which intersect with the films and some of            which do not. You play either as Luke or Wedge depending on the            mission (so for instance, while Luke's off giving his right hand            for a tussle with Vader, Wedge is busy carpet-bombing something),            and you can play from either third person or cockpit views.                        The whole game could be over in a day if you race through the            narrative, but the idea is to fight for the bronze, silver and gold            medals, which demand increasingly difficult objectives, and then            play with the prizes. Success could mean unlocking some of the            game's secret ships, levels or modes of play, and when you have            access to more of the ships it becomes easier to get the silver or            gold on earlier levels. Hidden ships range from the obvious to the            peculiar, and for those of you with a Fett-ish, Slave 1 is among            'em. You even get to play as the Falcon, which is a selling point            in itself.                         The objectives are similarly diverse, including the aforementioned            Death Star run, the Battle of Hoth and bits and bobs in-between.            The missions often feed into one another, and you get to down Star            Destroyers as well as the smaller TIEs and imperial shuttles. Some            of the missions seem a bit unnecessary, like the jailbreak mission            in the middle of the game, but it's good to see that they all stand            up to repeated play and give you a little breather now and then.            For instance, although you can pull down your targeting computer to            help you pick TIEs out of a particularly dense nebula on the way            out of Hoth, later on you can toggle the thing on or off without            holding down the relevant button and skewering your concentration.                    The control system itself is very responsive and early reports            suggested it went a bit far, but as the game wears on you start to            appreciate it. Over-responsive controls are obviously not conducive            to fine-tuning manoeuvres, and bouncing around the bowels of Bespin            in a Y-Wing can be maddening, but conversely, spinning 180 degrees            on an imperial credit and blowing the hell out of a pursuing TIE            Fighter can be the adrenaline rush to end them all. Overall though            the twitch-this-way-twitch-that-way feel of the system conflicts            with the game's principle virtue: its authenticity.                         That said the ships all behave differently. The Y-Wings, while            pretty frail, are very handy for bombing runs (for which the game            switches to an elevated view to help you find your targets) and the            B-Wings, while less manoeuvrable than an X-Wing, can make            themselves quite small and happily scamper about the nose of a Star            Destroyer without getting caught by too many laser blasts. All of            the ships are very much as they were in the films, thanks to some            detailed design which blows recent efforts like Jedi Starfighter            right out of the sky, and the bigger ships lose none of the detail            you might expect. Indeed, flying past the bridge of a Star            Destroyer you will feel a twinge of fear at the sheer size and            imposing sight of the thing. And there are bigger things to come.                         The fact that Rogue Leader crashes now and then has been the            subject of much discussion lately, but to us it's a minor niggle.            The game seems to save itself before it crashes, so there isn't            much harm in it, even if it is unfortunate that Factor 5 didn't            bother to fix it in the months since its American release. On the            other hand, without question the PAL conversion here is excellent,            with a full screen 60Hz mode and only slight borders at 50Hz, all            of the DVD-like extras that complemented the American release of            the game, and MusyX-powered Dolby Pro-Logic II surround sound. The            game also supports progressive scan mode if you happen to own a            Death Star of a TV, and the spectacular FMV cutscenes which            punctuate the levels blend together seamlessly with the gameplay            elements. There's a bit of slowdown here and there, particularly            noticeable when you're tow-roping AT-ATs on Kothlis, but you'll be            so busy concentrating on the action that it won't be all that            apparent.                    Rogue Leader is the absolute pinnacle of Star Wars games. It's            bloody hard in places, but it pampers the nostalgic and conveys so            effortlessly the beauty of the galaxy and the sheer tyranny of the            evil Empire that you will Force your way through it until there's            no stone left unturned. Some have said that it wouldn't be as good            without the Star Wars aspect, that it's a fairly mediocre space            combat game, but to me that's a ridiculous argument. Rogue Leader            is the embodiment of Star Wars in a videogame. That is the            point. This is a game charting the progress of Luke and Wedge            through the Star Wars trilogy, and it's the perfect vehicle for            fans of the series who have always wanted it to be real.                         At a slightly higher asking price than your average Cube title,            you might argue that it's a bit short, but it's the quality of the            experience which makes it worthwhile. ICO was pretty short, and            that's one of the best games of all time, well worth the outlay.            Rogue Leader falls under the same heading, but with replay value to            boot. The only truly major criticism I can level at it is the lack            of a multiplayer mode, which would have capped off an otherwise            superb package.                         Some games don't need a license to be good. Rogue Leader is good            because it lives up to its billing. You can argue with me about            that until we're both blue in the face, but the only deciding            factor here is whether or not you like space combat games. Do you?            Because everybody loves Star Wars, right? And this is that. Buy it.            Buy a Cube for it."}
