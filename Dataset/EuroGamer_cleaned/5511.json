Afterall, some sort of monetary reward should surely be mandatory if youhave to sit opposite Chris Tarrant for more than five minutes. It'sa blessing then that the ever-chummy presenter hasn't beendigitised and shrunk down to fit onto your phone.Thankfully, that and the grating soundtrack are the onlyelements of the show that haven't made the leap onto your handset,as in every other way this is a faithful reproduction of the show.The game is built around the famous multiple-choice questions thatpunters face on the telly and they become progressively harder asthe (theoretical) prize value increases.If you're planning onmemorising the answers in anticipation of the same questions beingre-used, don't hold your breath - there are plenty ofalternative questions available, so much so it'll take a few hours'play before you notice any duplicates.You'll gradually work your way up from \u00c2\u00a3100 and climb thesame rungs of the prize ladder until you make it to the\u00c2\u00a31,000,000 top prize. In reality this equates to nothing morethan a score, as the amount of money you've won, the time it tookto answer the questions and whether you had any assistance or notare translated into points.Those of us who slept their way throughschool will be relieved to discover that the three lifelines areall present and correct when you need a helping hand. 'Phone afriend' and 'Ask the audience' obviously have their limitations,with each lifeline generating an answer that you can never rely onto be correct but, more often than not, will help you out of asqueeze.These lifelines are selected, along with your choice of answerby using your phone's keypad or joystick and it's a very intuitivesystem. This is wholly due to the fact that the game is veryundemanding in regards to your phone's capabilities and it runsflawlessly on a huge range of handsets, which will be a boon to anyquiz and general knowledge fans out there looking for an enjoyableand challenging game."}
