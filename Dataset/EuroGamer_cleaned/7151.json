Produced by Origin back in the days before they migrated to            cyberspace, the games pushed the graphics and sound capabilities of            the PCs of the day to their limits. From the third game onwards,            the Wing Commander series also featured lavish FMV cutscenes that            rivalled many movies of the day when it came to special effects ..            and cost.                    The driving force behind the Wing Commander series was the Roberts            brothers, Chris and Erin, and it is their new company Digital Anvil            which is behind Starlancer. The question is, will Starlancer be the            spiritual successor to the classic Wing Commander games, or just            another space combat game in an increasingly crowded cosmos?         First                 impressions are certainly good, and the computer rendered                 cutscene that starts the game is stunning, even if the story                 that it is telling is a little cliched to say the least.                    The evil dictatorship of the Eastern Coalition has launched a Pearl            Harbour style surprise attack on the Western Alliance, wiping out            most of the French and Italian fleets. In the chaos that ensued the            Coalition has over-run most of the Alliance's colonies, with the            survivors falling back to Neptune. Now it is up to your group of            raw recruits to help stop the rout, and eventually take the fight            to the enemy.                    To get you started there is a simulation pod, which will introduce            you to the game's controls and arsenal. If you have played any            other space combat sim of the last ten years you should feel right            at home though.         Once you are satisfied that you know your yaw from your roll            and can find the fire button, it is time to head into combat...                    Before you can do this though, you need to leave your cabin and            head over to the briefing room. This only involves a couple of            mouse clicks usually, but it results in a rendered cutscene showing            your view as you walk through the bowels of the ship.                    It looks great, and no doubt sounded great on paper, but once you            have seen the same basic animation a dozen times you will soon get            sick of it. It takes up to a minute to get from your cabin to your            seat in the briefing room, and there isn't even any way to skip it            as far as I can tell. Annoying, to say the least.                    Having finally reached the briefing room, you then get another nice            rendered cutscene as your squadron leader outlines your mission            objectives, after which you can select your ship and missiles            before heading into combat...         The good news is that combat itself is frantic and fast-paced,            and just as much fun as it was in the old Wing Commander games.                    By the end of the game you have a choice of a dozen different ships            to fly, as well as a healthy selection of missiles ranging from            pods of dumb-fire rockets to fast and agile missiles that can chase            down their prey from a safe distance.                    The space that you are fighting over looks as interesting as space            can, with recognisable renditions of many of the planets in our            solar system looming in the background, along with distant stars            and the odd nebula. The ships that fill it are beautifully            detailed, and explode into a highly satisfying spray of particles            and shards of debris at the slightest provocation. Add to this the            impressive smoke, weapons and explosion effects, and you have the            best looking space combat sim so far.                    Potential targets range from fighters and torpedo bombers, through            cruisers and cargo ships, all the way up to massive space stations            and bases built from asteroids. And thanks to a little innovation            from the developers, you can actually make the most of these            behemoths now. The game includes strafe keys, which lets you slide            your ship left and right. Hardly a giant leap for mankind, but it            does mean that you can circle strafe your way around some of the            larger objects, a feature which was sorely missed in Freespace 2.                    It's not all good news though... The AI of your squad mates is            fairly poor, and all too often you find yourself ending a mission            with only a handful of survivors. This makes completing some of the            missions difficult at best, and downright impossible in some cases.         The mission scripting is rather haphazard at times as well,            and tends to lock you into completing your objectives in a strict            order.                    I was particularly annoyed when one mission debriefing accused me            of a ~lack of initiative and commitment~, after my entire wing was            wiped out within a couple of minutes, and the mission's scripting            made it physically impossible to complete any of my objectives.                    The idea was to take out a Coalition research facility and warp            gate, both of which were defended by laser turrets, and patrolled            by wings of fighters and a few larger ships. Having destroyed all            the fighters and cruisers, I took on the laser defence turrets on            my first target, the research facility. There were still a few left            intact when my commander decided I had blown up enough already, and            called in the torpedo bombers to finish the job.                    One of the torpedo bombers was immediately attacked by an enemy            cruiser that just appeared out of nowhere, but the first bomber was            so far away from the research facility that even with afterburners            on I couldn't reach it before it had been destroyed. Meanwhile the            other bomber was approaching its target. Unfortunately, the            research facility was so close to the warp gate that the turrets on            that could pick the bomber off easily.                    I tried the mission again, this time attacking the turrets on the            warp gate first, but the mission was scripted not to allow this.            However much ordinance I pumped into the turrets, it was impossible            to destroy them. So, once I had finished off the turrets on the            research facility, the torpedo bombers jumped in, the first one was            taken out by the cruiser before I could get near it, and the second            one was blown up by the invulnerable warp gate turrets. Again. At            this point I gave up and went home.                    Sadly this kind of limitation is all too common in the game, making            any kind of ~initiative~ very hard to achieve... On the bright            side, although the single player campaign is strictly linear, you            are able to flunk some of the missions. Failing one or more of your            objectives generally brings you a slap on the wrist from your            commander in the debriefing, and can lead to future missions            becoming more difficult, but at least you can continue the game.         If the stupidity of your AI wingmen is getting                 you down, replace them with the real thing! Starlancer lets                 you play through the single player campaign with your friends                 as your wingmen, over a LAN or the internet.                    The game also includes six deathmatch maps, ranging from ~Asteroid            Field~, a basic free for all map with you fighting amongst huge            spinning lumps of rock, to ~Nuclear Strike~, which adds six beacons            to the mix. Pick them all up and you will trigger a nuclear attack            that will wipe out all the other players.                    The multiplayer is perhaps one of the best features of the game,            but there is one small problem... Unless you have a LAN or a fast            internet connection, or you live in the USA, you can't play it.                    The developers haven't included a dedicated server option,            something which has been standard in first person shooters for a            few years now. This means that when you play online, one of the            other players is hosting the game. All too often that player will            have a Pentium II and an AOL connection, and the game will be            unplayable thanks to lag.                    And unlike in a first person shooter, in Starlancer lag causes the            game to freeze up completely. You see a screen listing all the            players, and ~Reject~ buttons appear next to the names of any who            are lagging particularly badly. Hit reject and that player is            knocked out of the game, or try waiting and see if the game            unpauses. Needless to say, this makes multiplayer a rather hit and            miss affair.                    Internet play is run through Microsoft's gaming portal, ~The Zone~.            This would normally be fine, except that it is based in Seattle,            there are no European servers, and most of the people playing on it            are American. As you can imagine, this makes finding a game which            you can actually play in without lagging out rather difficult if            you live on the ~wrong~ side of the Atlantic. Your chances of            finding enough Europeans online at once to play against are slim at            best.                    You don't have to play through The Zone, but the ~Find Games~            button in the multiplayer menu doesn't seem to work, or at least            I've never seen it find any games. So the only alternative is to            find a group of people who want to play, arrange a time, get            whoever has the fastest connection to host the game, and then type            in their IP address by hand.                    Back in 1995 this was state of the art stuff, and I'm sure our            older readers remember the joys of playing Doom modem-to-modem            (another option supported in Starlancer!). But it's hardly a            satisfactory multiplayer experience for the year 2000. Digital            Anvil created the rendered introduction movie for Quake 3 Arena.            It's just a shame that they didn't learn any lessons from the game            in the process...         On one level Starlancer is very successful. It                 is the best looking space combat sim we've seen so far, the                 dogfighting is enjoyable enough, and the plot is full of                 twists and turns, if a little hackneyed. Replace the evil                 Coalition with Kilrathi, and their repetitive taunts of                 ~allied scum~ with ~alien scum~, and this could easily be Wing                 Commander VI.                    Unfortunately it is let down all too often by poor mission            scripting and incompetent wingmen, not to mention the occasional            random crash. And the sheer annoyance of having to watch yourself            wander through the ship for up to a minute before you can get to            the briefing room at the start of a mission. And the missions with            the ~Dark Reign~ ion cannon that destroys your ship in a single            shot, and can somehow hit you even if you are directly behind it...                    The game is also lacking in imagination in many respects - although            it pushes forwards graphics and (to a lesser extent) sound, the            basic gameplay really isn't any different from the Wing Commander            or Freespace series. In fact, in a way it's a step backwards from            the old Wing Commander games, as the single player campaign is now            almost entirely linear, and your wingmen are mostly faceless drones            who only exist to die two minutes into the mission.                    If you are looking for a fast and furious space combat sim, this is            about as good as they come at the moment. Just don't expect            anything groundbreaking.                    -                            Freespace 2 review                    Freespace 2 reviewX :                    Beyond The Frontier reviewX :                    Beyond The Frontier review"}
