The result is Simpsons Road Rage, an            amusing if somewhat shallow driving game.                        The basic premise is simple enough - ferry your passengers around            the mean streets of Springfield at breakneck speed with the aim of            earning as much cash as possible. Depending on which difficulty            level you choose you may start with anything up to 75 seconds on            the clock, but when this runs out your car coasts to a halt and            it's game over. Luckily whenever you pick up a passenger you get            some extra seconds on the clock, although the further you get into            a session the less time you're given for each journey and the more            frantic things get.                        Reaching your destination ahead of schedule earns you a few seconds            more as well as a modest cash tip, and sometimes you're also            offered the chance to earn Road Rage and Safe Trip bonuses. The            former involves causing as much mayhem as possible by knocking over            trees, lamp posts, signs and innocent bystanders, while the latter            rewards you for avoiding collisions with other vehicles. I'll let            you guess which is more fun. You can even eke out an extra couple            of seconds by knocking over one of the stops for Mr Burns' evil            atomic bus fleet, which you can find scattered around each of the            game's six neighbourhoods.                    Taking to the roads of Springfield for the first time you only have            access to one neighbourhood - Evergreen Terrace, home to            Springfield Elementary School and the Kwik-E-Mart amongst other            landmarks. You're also initially limited to a choice of the five            main Simpson family members as your driver, including Lisa in an            electric car and Marge's gas guzzling Canyonero.                        The rest of the game's neighbourhoods and vehicles must be unlocked            by earning enough cash in the main Road Rage mode, which can be a            rather tedious undertaking. You need several hundred thousand            dollars to unlock everything, and a cool $1,000,000 to defeat Mr            Burns' plans and complete the game outright. Bizarrely I actually            found the tougher difficulty levels far easier than the .. er ..            easy option - the tighter time limits are more than compensated for            by the higher fares you charge your passengers - but whichever            level you choose to play on, you'll be hard pushed to earn much            more than $10,000 in a single run without cheating. Given that you            only have six neighbourhoods to drive around, this means constantly            circling the same few square miles of town over and over again just            to unlock a few more drivers and the rest of the levels. A little            more variety would have been welcome.                        The same goes for the voice acting. From Professor Frink, the fat            comic store owner and Springfield's leading quack Dr Nick to the            well-spoken kleptomaniac Snake and bumbling Police Chief Wiggum,            many of the best loved Simpsons regulars are included in the game,            with voices provided by the original actors. The bad news is that            there's a relatively limited set of lines on offer for each, and as            you hear at least two of them in any given car journey, after a few            hours they may start to get a little grating.                    If you want a break from the mayhem there's not much on offer in            the way of alternative game modes either. Sunday Drive lets you            tootle around in your own good time, giving you an opportunity to            hunt for shortcuts, learn the layout of the maps and admire the            scenery, but without any kind of time pressure or scoring system it            soon gets dull.                        There's also a Mission mode, but this merely consists of a linear            series of ten tasks. Most can be finished within two or three            attempts, and all feature a time limit of under a minute, which            makes this option rather shortlived. The tasks are also incredibly            repetitive, as eight of the ten involve knocking over a certain            number of specified objects, whether it's a drunken Barney running            down mascots or Otto smashing into lamp posts in the school bus.            The other two are simply a case of getting from A to B without            being run off the road by Mr Burns. To make matters worse, traffic            is entirely random, so you could lose before you've even got into            gear because a bus has parked itself in front of your starting            position. It's an amusing enough diversion from the Road Rage mode,            but it isn't likely to occupy you for long.                        Finally there's the fast and furious two player split-screen            option, which sets you and a friend loose on the streets of            Springfield in a duel to see who can reach the target fare total            first. To make things more interesting, you must both fight over            the same punter, so if your opponent gets to them first you'll have            to smash into the car to hijack their passenger and complete the            ride.                    Looking under the bonnet, the engine doesn't exactly stretch the            Xbox hardware to its limits. Textures are blurry low resolution            affairs and characters have a worrying tendency to run through            walls and other vehicles to get into your car.                        Having said that, the toon renderer does a reasonable job of            recreating Springfield in three dimensions, and the town's best            known landmarks are instantly recognisable, even if many of the            less important buildings are just poorly textured Frinkahedrons.            Everything from the town hall and the nuclear power plant to Moe's            Tavern and Flanders' Leftorium are included, although Simpsons            purists will no doubt complain that everything's in the wrong            place.                        Geographical inaccuracies aside, the level design is a mixed bag.            Some of the locations are fairly satisfying to drive around, while            others seem to have been hand crafted to be as annoying as            possible. For example, both of the out of town stages feature            broken bridges which you can jump across in one direction (if you            time it right) but not in the other. This means that if you carry a            fare to the wrong side of the Springfield gorge you have to waste            time taking a circuitous route back to the main part of the map            again. Factor in the shortage of side streets and shortcuts and a            lack of familiar landmarks and these two settings aren't as much            fun and often leave you with lower fares to boot. Given that the            game only has six ~neighbourhoods~ to start with, it's a little            disappointing.                    Simpsons Road Rage is surprisingly entertaining in short bursts,            but the charm tends to wear off fairly quickly thanks to the lack            of variety on offer. Missions, locations, music and voice acting            all get repetitive after just a few hours, and there's little            incentive to keep you coming back long enough to earn the $1m            you'll need to win the game. It's probably worth renting if you're            a fan of the TV series, but it's hardly a must buy."}
