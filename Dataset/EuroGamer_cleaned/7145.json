Today Everquest is one of the world's leading massively multiplayer            RPGs, with around 250,000 paying subscribers. However, the setting            was becoming stagnant. All of the high level zones had been            explored and charted, barely anything new was ever being            discovered, and newbie zones were full to bursting point as            overcrowding occured on a scale not normally seen outside of            Bangladesh. Something had to be done, and on the 7th of April this            year, something was done...                    The ~Ruins Of Kunark~ expansion pack was released to stem the tide            of bored players that were leaving the game, and it seemed to do            the trick. Subscribers hit an all-time high when it was released,            and over half of the existing players had ordered it in advance.                    Promised for the new expansion were enhanced graphics as well as            more items and enemies. Most importantly though, there was a whole            new continent to be explored, mapped-out, and ravaged by hordes of            blood-hungry adventurers, complete with a new playable race, the            Iksar; a lizard-like race that is native to the new continent of            Kunark.                    With so much promised, could the expansion deliver?         The improvements to                 the game's presentation were probably the most hyped aspects                 of the upgrade, with graphics enhancements to lure shallow                 eye-candy obsessed gamers into the lands of Norrath.                    The zones of the new continent are lush and loaded with details, a            far cry from the sterile atmosphere of a few of the old zones. A            good example of this is one of the low-to-medium level zones, the            ~Field of Bone~. This region is festooned with monoliths and            decaying buildings, showing that, unlike a lot of the game,            designers seemed to actually spend some time on the realisation of            the ideas.                    Compare this to zones such as Lesser Faydark and Nektulous Forest            on the old northern continent, which showed the graphic artists to            be suffering from something of a burnout, with the same landscape            used throughout, scant scenery, and an overall lack of imagination.                    Basically, the entire island of Kunark seems well-polished, and a            showcase as to what the artists have been doing in the            year-and-a-bit since Everquest hit the stores. The graphics engine,            although inadequate by today's standards, has been admirably            employed to the best of Verant's ability.                    Unfortunately, these picturesque delights come at a price.            Noticeable slowdowns are present in almost all of the Kunark zones            that I have explored. Landscape special effects such as waving            trees and flowing rivers may sound good around a board meeting            table, but don't really pan out in what is basically a dated            engine. Some of the features had to be removed, and those that            remain will only truly be appreciated by those with high-end            systems.                    My only complaint about the presentation (and it's been a long            running one) is that when switching between Full-Screen and Toolbar            View in any resolution other than 640x480, the Toolbar View screen            is either shrunk to fit 640x680 pixels, or in order to get            full-screen the monitor resolution has to change, seriously slowing            gameplay. This could have been fixed with the Kunark CD,            although Verant claim that it was ~deeply embedded in code~.         The main reason                 that half of the existing Everquest players immediately poured                 yet more coins into Verant's sagging pockets was the numerous                 new enemies to fight in the extra continent, and the chance to                 play as an Iksar.                    The new enemies are fairly imaginative, and certainly the new level            50-60 zones create a nice challenge for those players at the            pinnacle of their EverQuest career. Many are finding themselves            drawn to the continent from the old zones due to the lashings of            loot available from the loathsome enemies.                    Scores of new items are available, many of them much more powerful            and rarer than anything that vanilla EverQuest had to offer, and in            this respect Kunark excels. There's something to keep the jaded old            players interested, and the riches entice younger players to stay            on and persevere.                    Conversely, some cynics feel that these trinkets were all confined            to Kunark in order to convince spendthrift gamers to upgrade.            Still, this extra revenue for Verant will enable them to fix a lot            of errors in the game, and include many new things as time goes by.         Or will it? Unfortunately Verant's reputation as cold-hearted            buffoons who like to rule their customers like kings has been            seemingly cemented over recent weeks.                    On player verus player servers, where players of different races            and alignments are engaged in warfare, a bug allows Enchanters            under illusion to cast a Stun spell that will never wear off.            Instead of fixing the faulty code, Verant has instead removed the            Enchanter's ability to attack while under illusion. As an Enchanter            who loves sneaking around the streets of Freeport in disguise            eliminating Humans, never exploiting the bug, needless to say I am            rather disappointed.                    Also, some of the game's special abilities for players are faulty,            or at best flawed. Alchemy, a shaman skill allowing one to brew            potions, has many bugs and is officially certified ~broken~ by            Verant. The same goes for the Poison skill posessed by rogues. Both            have been ~undergoing maintainance~ for several months now, with            frequent reminders that the patch fixing them is just around the            corner, which, needless to say, it never is.                    It seems that whenever Verant have a problem with the game they            present an impractical workaround, say that they're going to do            something but then decide not to bother, or just plain lie about it            and pretend there's nothing wrong. A pretty shabby display            considering the amount of money that they rake in each month...         Fortunately for Verant                 though, Everquest is one of the most addictive RPGs I have                 ever played. I've dedicated over 4 weeks of my life to                 Norrath, and most players have spent even longer there, some                 up to 8 months .. and that's just the time actually spent                 connected to the server!                    It might be daunting for the uninitiated and poorly supported, but            there's just something about it that draws countless thousands to            the servers each night. The variety of enemies to fight, skills to            learn, and people to meet have a pulling power that most games can            only dream of.                    Despite the game's problems I know I'll keep on coming back, simply            because the game itself, preferably when played in a group, is so            much fun. And isn't that what games are all about?"}
