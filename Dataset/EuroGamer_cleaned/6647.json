The basic premise over the last 18 months seems to be to            design everything for the PS2 and then if it's a hit, bung it out            as ~cost effectively~ as possible on the Xbox and GameCube, and            presto, a whole new sku to service the cash rich early adopter.                    Except the early adopters have gotten wise to these evil ways, and            for the most part, every single one of these ill conceived            conversions has failed miserably - mainly because software designed            for its native system is almost always vastly superior. Thus, when            greeted with Jedi Outcast we were slightly optimistic            because of its PC origins. Surely porting a PC first person            shooter, based on the now ageing Quake 3 engine makes a lot of            sense? The Xbox, obviously, employs a similar architecture, and            gives console gamers hassle free fragging, complete with            split-screen multi-player action. Perfect.        Except for the fact that            Jedi Outcast was never perfect in the first place. The game is set            ~several years~ after Kyle Katarn avenged his father's death and            saved the Valley of the Jedi from Jerec and his band of Dark Jedi,            and Kyle must cryptically ~reclaim his past in order to save his            future~ - or in other words shoot a lot of Storm Troopers            and assorted dark side scum, while meticulously winding his way            through nine gameplay areas, unlocking every door in sight.                    Gestalt's            original            review of the PC version back in April last year scored the            game at 7/10, and observed that the game suffers from a low key            beginning. He was certainly right about that, and it's probably            enough to put even the most enthusiastic FPS veteran off. For fully            six hours (depending on how good you are, and making allowances for            the fact that playing with a joypad is inherently more difficult            than a keyboard and mouse) you'll be wading through the FPS            equivalent of sludge.                    Level after level of tedious switch and/or key hunting, execrable            jump puzzles, uninspired weaponry, botched AI, compounded by an            engine that next to the now ageing Halo looks years behind, and            certainly not a good advert for the Xbox. If you like your games to            stagger along pushing out bland, low textured environments then            Jedi Outcast is the one for you. Even forgiving its uninspired            visuals, the regular hard disk pause while more data is spooled off            the system is plain unforgivable. Regularly you'll fire off a shot;            the game will pause for an instant before the sound effect            eventually reminds you you're in a battle. Fortunately most of the            AI issues mentioned last year appear to have been corrected,            although we still managed to witness headless chicken Storm            Troopers running in circles and crouching as they inched towards            us. What was Vicarious Visions thinking? Probably about the money,            but the blame must also be levelled at Raven for a patchily            designed experience that could and perhaps should have been the            definitive Star Wars FPS.        But despite the ropey, frustrating, quick save laden beginning,            things do pick up once you hook up with Luke Skywalker, and            you're forced to learn your Jedi skills - but the way the game's            structured leading up to this, it'll be a wonder if many gamers            will even be bothered to trudge through this far. Somehow the lure            of pulling off Jedi tricks keeps you staggering on, and eventually            you'll get to switch to a third person viewpoint and pull off some            unintentionally amusing, but highly useful manoeuvres. Top of the            list for pure evil mind tricks is the ability to Force Push your            foes into bottomless pits, as well as Force Speed (temporary sprint            ability, while the world slows down around you), Force Jump, and            Force Grip, which allows Kyle to lift enemies clear off the floor.            Light Saber duels are also a good laugh, and make a pleasant change            from the FPS drudge that leads up to it.                    The initial set of weapons hardly helps endear you to Jedi Outcast.            The Stun Baton is next to useless, as is the Bryar Blaster Pistol.            The Wookiee Bowcaster is ok-ish, but you run out of ammo all too            quickly, while the Thermal Detonator is occasionally useful, but            only when the enemy's being exceptionally dim. This leaves the            Blaster Rifle, and it's hardly a pulse raiser. Later on we get the            Flak Cannon-esque Fletchette, the Disruptor Rifle, and the deadly            Imperial Heavy Repeater which are welcome additions if you get deep            into the game, but nothing we haven't seen many times before. If it            wasn't for the enjoyable Light Saber battles and the exceptional            authenticity the music and sound effects lend (in full 5.1 surround            on the Xbox), you'd often be wondering what relevance Jedi Outcast            has to the Star Wars universe at all. So much of the time it comes            across as an FPS by the numbers.        To make matters worse, the puzzles are often so obscure you'll            be marching off to GameFAQs in disgust - only to find you were            doing the right thing all along (just maybe not shooting or            pressing the exact right pixel!). Even at the earliest stages of            the game you'll be expected to keep a look out for obscure vents or            push an arbitrary switch that is entirely flanked and camouflaged            by similar looking consoles. It's never exactly taxing, but the            scenery so often blends into itself that it's often a painstaking            process of clicking on everything in the vague hope that it            activates something. You rarely know why you're pushing            switches everywhere, but hey, they're there so we may as well keep            stabbing away until something happens. Zzzzzzzz.                    Which basically leaves the game's six multiplayer modes to shore up            the package. Sadly, most are subtle variations on deathmatch: Free            For All is straight deathmatch with all weapons and all force            powers, Holocron Free For All is deathmatch except you start with            no force powers, Team Free For All does what it says on the tin,            Capture The Flag is Capture The Flag, which only leaves two            slightly interesting variations: Jedi Master, which gives the            player a single Light Saber on the map which you have to race for,            with no player able to score points until someone has picked it up.            Once a player has the Light Saber they can only use this as a            weapon, but gets level 3 Force powers. Oooh. Finally, Duel allows            only two players to fight at once, with a winner stays on approach,            with the loser going to the back of the queue. Up to 16 players can            compete on each of the nine maps, but bafflingly only supports            two-player split-screen. We can only assume that four-player            split-screen was too jerky, as two player is pretty rough as it is.            In fact, if you just play with bots and have the whole screen to            yourself, it still chugs unbelievably - especially when there's 14            bots joining you in the mayhem. It's all good fun - until you find            yourself cursing the frame rate. It's plain unacceptable, and the            lack of four-player, LAN or link modes just highlight its            shortcomings even more.                    In the final analysis, Jedi Outcast is certainly an entertaining            package when it gets things right, but it's also riddled with            design flaws, technical flaws and various minor irritations that            conspire to detract from your overall enjoyment. Given that it's            also not Live (or even LAN) enabled, Xbox owners don't even have            that crumb of comfort to elevate its status. With news of a sequel            in the works for release next year, let's hope LucasArts can            finally serve up the FPS that fans of the franchise have been            waiting for. Right now, this is the best Star Wars fans can hope            for, but they deserve so much more.
