Might & Magic began life somewhere back in                 the mists of time as a role-playing game series, now in its                 eighth installment.                    Since then 3DO have spun off a whole horde of different games set            in the same universe (with varying degrees of success) - ~Crusaders            of Might & Magic~, ~Warriors of Might & Magic~, and            ~Legends of Might & Magic~ are the most recent attempts.            Perhaps the most popular though is the turn-based strategy series            known as ~Heroes of Might & Magic~, which now boasts three            games and a whole host of official add-on packs and gold editions.                    And so we come to ~Heroes of Might & Magic III : The Shadow Of            Death~ which, apart from being a strong contender for the longest            game title of the year, is also the latest release in the Heroes            series, featuring the original ~Heroes of Might & Magic III~            game as well as a collection of new campaigns, missions, artifacts            and units.                    The result is a package of truly awe-inspiring scope - 14            campaigns, 86 solo missions, 16 character classes, 145 different            units, 138 magical artifacts, 8 city types... The full list makes            ~War And Peace~ look like light reading.         It's                 all a bit overwhelming really, and it's something of a relief                 that the developers have thought to include a tutorial                 campaign for newcomers to the series, although disappointingly                 the accompanying text only appears in an Adobe Acrobat file on                 the CD-Rom which you will have to print out yourself - why                 couldn't this have been included in the manual, or done using                 in-game messages?                    The basic gameplay is simple enough once you get the hang of it,            although the sheer wealth of options can be frightening at times.            You control one or more characters known as heroes, each of which            is accompanied by an army. Most of the game is spent moving these            heroes around the map, seeking out resources (which come in several            different varieties), magical artifacts, cities, and special            structures.                    Lumberyards and various kinds of mine can be captured to provide            you with more resources, which can then be used to construct more            buildings in your cities, Civilization style. Your basic town hall            can be upgraded to produce more revenue each week, marketplaces            allow you to trade goods, and a tavern can be built to allow you to            hire additional heroes. Mage guilds sell your heroes spell books,            and can be upgraded to provide more powerful magic.                    Meanwhile a whole variety of different buildings each allow            construction of a different type of unit. Each of the eight types            of town in the game has its own unique selection of eight units,            ranging from basic cannon fodder like pikemen, troglodytes and            skeletons, to powerful creatures such as dragons, devils and            angels. Additionally, each barracks building can be upgraded to            produce a more powerful version of the basic unit.                    The result is an almost bewildering choice of buildings to            construct, units to buy, and things to do. Getting to grips with            the basics is easy enough, but mastering the game is something that            takes weeks to accomplish...         Combat takes place in seperate chess-like battlefields, with            the two armies lining up at opposite ends and units taking it in            turns to move, with the fastest moving first and the rest following            in order. Sadly the battlefields are rather cramped though, and            don't allow much scope for clever tactics.                    One thing that you will soon learn is that your heroes are far more            important than the units they lead. As they win battles they gain            experience and their stats will increase, as well as allowing them            to learn new skills. Special structures such as universities,            mercenary camps, witch's huts and standing stones can also increase            your skills and stats, and maps are often liberally strewn with            these.                    The game's many artifacts can also temporarily improve your            characters' abilities, although frustratingly these are not carried            from one mission to the next in campaigns. Which is perhaps lucky,            as the developers seem to have scattered them around the maps in            vast quantities, sometimes leaving you with more artifacts than            your characters are able to use simultaneously!                    The result is that by the end of a long campaign your character            will be a lethal killing machine, with spells that can obliterate            entire units, from basic lightning bolts and magic arrows to area            effect attacks like fireballs and meteor storms. The Implosion            spell is particularly spectacular, capable of killing half a dozen            or more dragons with a single attack in the hands of a powerful            spellcaster.                    And as your attack and defence skills are added to those of your            troops, armies with a powerful hero leading them can effortlessly            destroy a larger force with a less capable leader. It certainly            encourages you to nurse your heroes, although it does make            something of a mockery of the careful balancing of the various            units, which is otherwise very good.         Another area where the game's                 balance breaks down is in the difficulty of the campaigns -                 there's a steep learning cliff from relatively straightforward                 to virtually impossible missions. In the end I had to resort                 to reducing the difficulty setting at the start of every                 mission.                    Playing on the default difficult settings (which actually rise as            the missions themselves get more difficult) was a struggle, and as            some of the missions can take a day or two to complete, losing is a            very frustrating experience. All too often I would play for three            or four hours without even seeing the enemy, only for them to            emerge from the wilderness with a totally overwhelming army that I            had no chance of defeating. Time to reload .. again.                    The Shadow Of Death missions are particularly hard, as they seem to            be aimed more at Heroes veterans than newcomers to the series. If            you own the original game and are looking for a challenge, this is            ideal. But then, if you already own the original Heroes III, paying            out for the game a second time might be a little grating. To be            fair though, Shadow Of Death does double the number of campaigns            and missions available to you. It might not be a whole new game,            but it is the next best thing.         The graphics might be                 spartan, the eponymous heroes a little overpowering, the                 missions lengthy and the turn-based gameplay slow paced, but                 despite its flaws, Shadow Of Death is still a strangely                 addictive game. It's all too easy to get sucked in and find                 yourself stumbling away bleary-eyed several hours later.                    It's certainly not recommended for casual gamers as it's time            consuming and complex, with a positively bewildering array of            units, buildings, artifacts, skills and strategic options. But if            you're a strategy fan looking for a game which will keep you busy            for months to come, this could be just what you're looking for...                        -        Heroes                    Chronicles previewHeroes                    Chronicles previewAge of                    Wonders reviewAge of                    Wonders review"}
