The fine art of putting a bit of throbbing metal            between your legs and risking life and limb by driving it roughly            across tarmac and through chicane. It's a noble sport, assuming you            don't fall off awkwardly and sprain your ankle, and for the first            time that I can remember, it has a very clear leading light in the            world of gaming: Climax Brighton's Moto GP.                         Moto GP is thoroughly good, from the colour and texture of the            tarmac right through to the unlockable extras crammed onto the            expansive Xbox DVD. However, the biggest triumph of all is the            unorthodox control method. Although you can pick up the pad and            simply paste down the A button to accelerate, screeching to a            wince-making halt five feet in front of a corner as you grapple            with the brakes, our favourite method uses the left analogue stick            for banking and adjusting the rider position, the right stick for            throttle concerns, and the left and right triggers for the rear and            front brakes respectively. Apart from choosing a camera angle at            the start of the race - with elevated third person perspectives, a            cockpit view and a suicidal nose-of-the-bike horror movie to pick            from - the control system really does come down to two sticks and            two triggers.                         The reason this control system is so ingenious is that the whole            thing is completely incremental. Want to carefully ease on the rear            brake into a corner? You can do that. Want to slam your front brake            on and try and flip the bike for a laugh? Yep, that's here. Want to            waggle the stick left and right and randomly apply each brake            furiously to see how much damage you can do in a packed corner? A            little masochistic perhaps, but yes, it's possible. Effectively,            you can control each aspect of the bike in the same way that you            could a proper, real-life motorcycle.                    As with the control method, the graphics engine has been designed            specifically to cater to the power of Xbox, and it does that with            aplomb. Road surfaces are realistically textured, and the term            'draw distance' is virtually exempt from inclusion in this review,            because the only things that 'pop up' throughout Moto GP are the            corners of your mouth as you grin excitedly. Bikes and riders are            also very detailed, with all sorts of damage skins for each, while            competitors raise their fists if you give them a prang. The screen            blurs slightly around you in the third person views to enhance the            sense of speed, little tyre-tread trails are left in the mud if you            falter off the track, and spectacular dynamic crashes are another            visual highlight. Weather effects are resplendent as well, with            water splashing and refracting realistically on the camera.                         Like every truly great racing game, Moto GP wins by offering the            best of everything. Graphics and control method wrap up a large            percentage of the game, but the overall presentation matches the            quality in other departments. The menus are comfortable to navigate            and use, with none of the bizarre jerkiness that seems to have            recently crept into more extravagant interfaces. Little touches            like movies of Moto GP races in the background add an intangible            touch of class to the rest of the game.                         And the section dedicated to creating your own rider isn't just            intricate - it's RPG intricate. If you want to spend time making            your own championship rider, you will find a wealth of bike,            clothing and helmet designs to choose from, and you can pick your            own combination of colours to match the rider too. You can go at it            from either end, designing the bike colour scheme first and then            either matching the colour scheme to your outfit or coming up with            a completely new one, or starting with the rider and then working            on the bike. Other baubles include writing and numbering, and you            can unlock more bikes, clothing and helmets the more challenges you            conquer.                    Once you've collected yourself, you can take your rider through the            training section to get him ready for the Grand Prix circuit.            Training is rather like Gran Turismo's license tests, with lots of            small tasks to complete in cornering, braking, top speed and            acceleration categories, and bronze, silver and gold medals to            compete for. If you opt for our preferred control scheme, build            your rider and then take him through the Training mode bit by bit,            you will find that the whole game opens up for you in the sense            that, although you're still a rookie, you can give the other            rookies a run for their money instead of a run for their gravel            rights.                         Fortunately though, Moto GP is a racing simulation and not a            driving challenge a la Project Gotham Racing. The Grand Prix            Motorcycle Racing circuit consists of ten real-world tracks from            its real-world counterpart, and all of the bikes and riders from            last year's season, with the option to be them or race            against them. Races feature as many as 19 other riders on track on            every skill level except rookie, and unlike in Formula 1, you get            spectacular collisions and a trackful of eager competition instead            of a lethargic one-by-one leapfrog across 70 laps.                         AI riders are prone to making the same mistakes as you (which is            useful, because at first you will make mistakes), and bunch up as            they scramble to get ahead of one another, racing competitively and            not spreading out evenly. Grand Prix mode is a tough challenge, and            you can throw it all away in a split-second twist of the wrong            brake trigger, but you can also race perfectly and collect the            gold. It may be hard but it's a perfectly weighted learning curve,            and it's extremely satisfying to place first. Perhaps the secret is            that it doesn't feel as random as other racers.                    Success on the track is difficult to attain at first, but plugging            away is something that comes naturally after a while, and the first            time that you place in the top five on Champion difficulty is like            conquering Everest. It's not as though you're racing for nothing            either, with unlockable bonuses like the vaunted wireframe,            cel-shading and pencil-sketch display modes amongst other features.            You won't unlock everything right away though. Ten tracks might            seem like a scant few compared to some of today's racers, but you            won't think that when you're scraping your way around every corner            trying to find the best line to unlock every last extra.                         Rounding out the package is an excellent multiplayer mode, which            sacrifices almost none of the single player detail in providing up            to four players with a split-screen race. Even with only a quarter            of the image to yourself the game is smooth with the same total of            20 riders in the thick of things as usual. If you can find enough            people with their own machines, you can even take advantage of the            LAN option for up to 16 players, and although we didn't get to try            this one out, it clearly wasn't an afterthought, with rider names            appearing above their respective heads and practically the whole            game available for sparring.                         Moto GP is an excellent example of a racing game. In fact, it's            the best game about motorbikes I've ever encountered. It made me            want to play it, luring me in with authentic, proven track designs            from the real world of Moto GP, great graphics and a peculiar            control system to master, not to mention the promise of extravagant            bonuses to uncover if I played it long enough. The sense of speed            is dazzling, it's an extremely well produced package, and the            experience is almost worth owning an Xbox for completely by itself."}
