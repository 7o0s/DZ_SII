Although it suffered from a few control issues here and there, and didn't push the envelope graphically, it did introduce a progressive, experience points-based reward structure. It also packed each of its enormous levels with fiendish tasks, not to mention eye-catching and occasionally dynamic design.            The Xbox version should have sealed the Birdman's casket, but            having spent the last couple of days disappointedly sifting through            it, the only change of note is a zoo level, but the lack of animals            is a bit confusing... There is an option for custom soundtracks,            but it's somewhat inobvious, only available from the in-game            options menu and not the main menus. As for graphical changes and            other optimisations: forget it. This is as straight a port of the            PS2 version as you could possibly imagine. The only other changes            evident are an updated loading screen showing the Xbox controller            map, and references to the right buttons instead of X, circle,            square, triangle etc.                             Sadly, neither the bulky Xbox controller nor the import-worthy            Controller S can handle Aggressive Inline as well as the Dual Shock            II. It's mainly a case of the d-pad being borderline unusable, and            the positioning and styling of the black and white buttons in            particular makes them almost inaccessible for those crucial cess            slides (or reverts, as Hawkers will know 'em).                             Fortunately, the bulk of the game - which we really liked -            remains completely intact. Those of you who picked Microsoft's box            over Sony's brick will almost certainly find value in this, and it            still pips the Xbox conversion of Tony Hawk 3 to the winners'            podium in this reviewer's humble opinion. Tony Hawk has certainly            been around a long time, but it's infinitely more enjoyable to            skate around Aggressive Inline at breakneck speeds and always have            that sensation of getting somewhere. The more you skate and the            more previously pointless trick tallies you tot up, the more XP the            game will hand you and the better your character will get. And the            characters, some real, some not, will all become increasingly easy            to handle at the most basic levels - allowing you to concentrate on            improving their high-end skills above all else.                    Z-Axis delivered a great skating game with Aggressive Inline, and            the Xbox version is no less impressive, almost on a par with            Activision's Xbox ports. However, the lack of graphical            improvements and the cumbersome custom soundtrack menu system            irritated me to a certain extent, but if you have even a passing            interest in skaters, you simply must own this, whatever your            preferred platform."}
