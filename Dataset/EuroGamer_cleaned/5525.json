{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/pocket-1402", "date": "14 Sep 2006", "game_name": "Captain Dynamo", "text": "The life of a computer game hero isn't all princesses,multi-format sequels and crazy go-karting spin-offs. For every Mario there are a dozen or more nameless characters that have but oneouting and are then lost to obscurity.A bit like this here Captain Dynamo. Originally the star of his very ownplatform adventure back in the early 1990's, he sank pretty muchwithout a trace soon after. And while Telcogames and Codemastersare keen to point out that he's a superstar, much like Sonic or the aforementioned plumber, we struggle to reach thesame conclusion.This isn't likely to change with Captain Dynamo's debut on mobile phone, either, as he'slimited to appearing on only handsets that support Symbian games.That means just 20 or so models (all of them Nokia), so he'scertainly not going to reach the mass-market.Should we feel sorry for the be-caped Captain?Well, first impressions would suggest not. The visuals, whilecompletely authentic to the original, have been surpassed by moremodern fare. Even though it's a Symbian game, which is capable ofbeing many times more graphically advanced than a basic Java title,you wouldn't know it.Things start to look up once you get into the game, though. TheCaptain moves on screen with a fluid and responsive smoothnessthat's rarely seen in mobile platform games. This gives you a greatdeal of confidence in Captain Dynamo's controls which, while simple, must bemastered if you're going to get anywhere further than the secondlevel.Providing the basic walk left/right combo with two jump buttons('5' for a small jump, '7' for a bigger, higher one), it's a systemthat's almost tailor-made for the N-Gage. Play on any other handsetand you'll struggle to find the same comfort level.That will make playing Captain Dynamo a lot harder than it already is. Based onthe traditional platform ingredients of jumping from one place toanother, avoiding hazards and bouncing on enemies to kill them, itrequires a degree of skill and control that's fine indeed.Working your way up the levels rather than from left to right,there's little or no margin for error in many of the leaps, dashesand jumps that you'll have to make. Understand: this is a very,very hard game.This is why it scores so well in longevity terms - despitethere only being ten levels, once you're engrossed in Captain Dynamo you'll keep banging away at a level untilyou nail it.You get three lives per level, which helps. Also, when you dieyou can choose to restart at any level that you've reached so far.So when you burn up your last life in the lava pits on level two,for example, you don't have to go back to the beginning of levelone. Mid-level save points further aid your cause, saving you fromreturning to the very start of the level when you've gotten closeto the end.This might all sound rather lightweight, as if you're beinggiven too many chances. But play Captain Dynamo for just two minutes and you'll be glad ofthe soft landing that you're afforded.This really is a game about the little victories, and completingeach level brings about a feeling of satisfaction that dwarves thatwhich arises when you finish most games. But you will have to workfor it and, if you don't have a handset that's expressly set up forplaying games (like the N-Gage), you may well walk out before theshow is over."}
