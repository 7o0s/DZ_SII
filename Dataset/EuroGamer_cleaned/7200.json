Most modern 3D graphics cards draw all the triangles (polygons) in            a scene, and then pass them through the rendering pipeline in order            to texture them.                    In doing this they perform a depth calculation (utilising the            z-buffer) that helps to reduce the number of triangles rendered by            the chip, by removing the triangles that cannot be seen.                    Unfortunately if a triangle is partially visible, it cannot just            discard it. Instead it must be rendered as if it was totally            visible. This process of rendering polygons which are never seen is            called overdraw.                    The PowerVR's architecture works in a very different way, and in            fact thrives in a high overdraw environment. I hear you asking            ~Why?~.                    Simply put, the rendering engine on the Neon 250 only draws            polygons that are actually going to be seen on the screen.                    It divides the screen into a series of smaller squares called            tiles, and then by a process of depth sorting, the tile is rendered            with only the pixels that are directly visible. The render engine            then passes on to the next tile.         This process is                 called deferred rendering, and thanks to the depth sorting                 (which is done on the fly in hardware) there is no need for a                 z-buffer.                    As no z-buffer is needed, less memory bandwidth is required, or            alternatively the memory bandwidth available can be used more            efficiently - which is the case here.                    Videologic have quoted a fill rate of between 200 and 500            MPixels/sec, which is not strictly true. The Neon 250 has a base            fill rate of just 125MPixels/sec, as it can render 1 pixel per            clock and with a clock speed of 125MHz this becomes the base fill            rate.                    But as soon as you introduce overdraw in a scene, the ~effective~            fill rate increases. So with an average overdraw of 2 the fill rate            is effectively 250MPixels/sec. If overdraw is an average of 4 then            fill rate effectively reaches 500MPixels/sec.                    This may seem like a cheat, but it isn't really bearing in mind            that any standard chip like a TNT2 will have to render a lot of            information that is never seen. In order to keep the framerate up,            cards like the TNT2 must increase their fill rate.                    The Neon 250 on the other hand will only draw what is visible, and            with most games containing significant overdraw, it should have no            problem matching other chips on the market...         The card                 is a relatively plain green board that features the PowerVR                 series2 chip and four memory chips. And that's it. Other than                 a heatsink there is nothing more on the board, and it looks                 rather unassuming when compared to the likes of a TNT2 Ultra                 board.                    Unlike a lot of other boards on the market there is also no TV-out            which is a shame, although in reality how many of us actually play            games on our TV? Admittedly there is the potential of playing DVDs            on the TV, but usually the TV-outs do not provide a picture that            can rival a dedicated decoder, whether it be a PC based one or a            stand-alone unit.                    One interesting thing to note is that originally Videologic had            planned to market the Neon 250 with only 16Mb of SDRAM, but thanks            to the fluctuating memory prices they decided to go with a 32Mb            solution.                    This doesn't actually add too much of a performance increase, as            the memory is used more efficiently than with other designs, but at            least it allows for more texture storage which is always a plus.         On the software side,                 Videologic have supplied a CD filled with not only the                 essential drivers, but also some technology demos that show                 off some of the more advanced features of the architecture.                    One of the more impressive is the overdraw demo, which really shows            PowerVR coming into its own. Thankfully these can (in some cases)            be run on other hardware which allows you to see how the            performance of your old card matches up to the Neon 250.                    Also on the CD is a selection of game demos that help show off the            card further. These include the memorable Incoming, the            not-quite-so-good-but visually impressive Klingon Honour Guard, the            oh-so-tedious Thief (well in my opinion anyway) [EDITOR - take that            man out and shoot him!] and the great-for-a-laugh Rollcage.                    As I have said there are others, and these will all work very            nicely on the Neon 250, which means that should you own the full            versions of any of them you can expect some very nice fluid            graphics.                    All in all the bundle is pretty good, and the supplied demos are            all fairly recent (which is a bit of a change) which helps make the            whole deal more attractive.         Unfortunately everyone will                 no doubt be more interested in how the card performs on                 forthcoming titles like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament.                    To this end I have included some shots of these games running on            the Neon 250 to show that it looks every bit as good as a TNT2            based card. You can find these scattered throughout the review,            with a few more on the last page.                    The picture I have painted so far seems to be a very rosy one, and            certainly puts the Neon 250 in a good light. It is a good card, but            I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't report on any issues that            affected the Neon 250. ~What issues?~ I hear you cry.                    Due to its tile based nature, some graphical glitches do occur.            Some titles throw up problems for the Neon 250, and one of the more            important ones is Unreal Tournament.                    Now from the screen shots (which were taken at 800x600x32) there            are no noticeable effects, but when the resolution is pushed to            1024x768 there are a few graphical glitches which, while they do            not affect the gameplay in any way, certainly detract from the            overall experience.         That said, the guys at VideoLogic are constantly working on            new drivers, and they have certainly come on a long way in both            quality and performance.                    They are also working with the game developers in order to ensure            that patches will be created for existing titles, and that new            titles will have no problems.                    At this price point the Neon 250 is a very competent card (as can            be seen from the benchmarks below), and certainly deserves            consideration if you are intending to purchase a new graphics card            and not spend the earth on it.
