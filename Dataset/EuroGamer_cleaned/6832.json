Starting in the depths of            Coruscant on a scouting mission, the game's star comes face to face            with a bold new enemy, the Jin'ha, and it quickly becomes clear            that they are allied with the greedy, malevolent Trade Federation.            Ultimately though this richly woven tapestry of Star Wars is soiled            by foul visuals, slowdowns, shoddy AI and boring level design. It            all feels like it was designed in a hurry.                         Presentation wise Obi-Wan is often as slick as its console            brethren, and on a system as powerful as the Xbox you would expect            that, but the game slips up in several areas. In this galaxy            far, far away the scrolling text star screen looks hideous, and the            characters in the in-engine cutscenes have no facial animation            whatsoever. Voice acting, used throughout these short scenes and            during gameplay is not bad, but the mimicry of Ewan McGregor is a            bit too actively Scottish to be his Obi-Wan, and the rest of            the cast is equally unconvincing.                         Obi-Wan's chief weapon is the ubiquitous lightsaber, although            throwaway sniper rifles and other toys are strewn across some of            the levels. The right analogue stick controls the lightsaber            regardless of the direction you move Obi-Wan with the left analogue            stick, and a double-tap of the right stick in any direction will            perform a different two-stage attack. Unfortunately this cunning            saberplay is overly simplistic and leads to random thrashing of the            right analogue stick in combat. During use of the right stick, you            also lose the ability to deflect shots from blasters. That said,            the technique for doing so is a bit chaotic\u2026                    I knew things were starting out badly when the training level got            the better of me. Apart from moving at a snail's pace it becomes            excruciatingly difficult when learning the technique of 'Active            Blocking', or deflecting blaster fire back to the sender. I'm not            quite sure what I was missing here, but it seemed nigh on            impossible to complete this seemingly mundane task. The frustration            of trying this over and over again carried into the first level of            the single player game, which plumbs the depths of adequacy,            featuring a series of connected ramps suspended in the air, packed            with unrecognisable aliens dressed in bright red wielding a mixture            of batons and blasters.                         Missions vary in length, from the very short to the tediously            drawn out. All of the areas are packed with bad guys, and defeating            them takes an eternity, especially when it emerges that the Jin'ha            are using Force-repelling armour. Between the start of the game and            the boarding of the Trade Federation ship as mediators - in other            words the starting point for the film - Obi-Wan's missions involve            defeating ceaseless hordes of enemies and finding his way through            idiotic puzzles. Often these consist of jumping down from ledge to            ledge and not falling to certain death, a task made agonizing by            the blurry low-resolution textures all over the huge passageways            and tunnels.                         Elsewhere, players team up with an AI-controlled Qui-Gon Jinn,            whose antics with the lightsaber are merry, but whose pathfinding I            honestly think I could have done a better job of programming.            Wandering through a swamp with vaguely reflective water (nothing we            haven't seen done better elsewhere), the so-called Jedi Master runs            off to slice every enemy into pieces, but fails to run up a small            hill, instead bouncing off the edge until he manages to get onto            it. And if Obi-Wan finds himself in Qui-Gon's way, the idiot stops            still and doesn't go around. Lazy, sloppy, shoddy. And I didn't            even touch on the Turok-esque fog used throughout that level            presumably to shield the lousy draw distance from view.                    One of the more interesting elements of the game is the Force. By            holding down the left trigger players can enter Force mode, and            then press any of the buttons on the pad to execute Force            manoeuvres. Enhanced jumping, Force push, Force pull, Force throw,            Force view and lightsaber throw are the basic ones, with a stronger            force lightsaber attack available to the Jedi with a full power            bar. Using a mixture of the Force powers and standard lightsaber            attacks it is possible to take a fairly varied approach to combat,            tossing blocks at a Droid's head before shoving another off the top            of a stanchion and slicing his mate in half\u2026                         Sadly though the game is let down by its terrible visuals. Partly            because I know LucasArts can do better, and partly because this            game has absolutely no excuse for looking this bad on this            hardware; I'm really quite appalled. Character models are lit with            pre-rendered shadows but the harsh angled outlines of the low-poly            models and the complete lack of lighting in the levels - giving it            all a Dark Forces vibe - leaves the game's main protagonist and his            entourage looking slightly out of place and almost cel shaded.                         The lightsaber combat animations are good, and not as predefined            as you might expect, but apart from other Jedi Council members and            the occasional nefarious Sith type, lightsaber combat is a dull            affair. The drone-packed levels make tedious work, and if you try            to run away you often end up with about twenty bad guys following            you, at which point you reach the final scene of the level. Now, at            this stage what often seems to happen is that Obi-Wan is overcome            by his pursuers, dies horribly, and then the player takes one of            his five retries, of which a couple may be remaining. Upon            respawning fairly close to his point of death, Obi-Wan finds most            of his enemies absent, because having been dragged like an            impromptu conga through various corridors and poorly textured            mining facilities they don't stick around once he's dead, instead            returning to their posts - d'oh! Even more annoyingly, if you            gather more than a handful of bad guys anywhere in the game the            framerate slows to a crawl.                    Interspersing the longer, more tedious levels of the game (the            first half is consistently disengaging) are a series of fights with            leading Jedi Council members as part of your ongoing training. Pass            these tests and you can unlock bonus encounters with other Council            members, and those you have defeated are then accessible through            the two player Jedi Battles mode which is available from the main            menu.                         Although you can't use the Jedi Battles mode as a lone player, the            sparring sessions in the main campaign are much the same. These            take place in a circular training hall, with each of your mentors            using different areas of the Force to press their advantage.            Defeating them comes easily after a while though, and often the            trick is simply to go at them full pelt and try to lure them into            the open where they aren't so tempted to use their Force powers.                         The overall picture of Obi-Wan then is a poor one. The            fifteen-stage single player adventure is tedious, and as most of it            follows the plot of The Phantom Menace there's little for even            hardened Star Wars followers to look forward to uncovering. The            enemies and environments are bland, although the Trade Federation            ship, the subsequent trip to Tatooine and the game's climax are            fairly true to their big screen inspiration. But that doesn't            really matter, because the game's designers didn't see fit to try            too hard with the level design anyway. Sprawling they may be, and            often time-consuming, but the bottom line is that this game is no            fun to play for a variety of reasons. This is not so much a missed            opportunity as one cast aside in favour of cashing in before the            release of Episode II, which will obviously render Obi-Wan's            storyline somewhat outdated. However desperate you may be for some            Star Wars adventuring, do not spend \u00a340 on this.                        -        Star                    Wars Obi-Wan screenshotsStar                    Wars Obi-Wan screenshots"}
