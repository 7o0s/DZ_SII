By day he was            just another school kid, but when he donned his brother's NFL            helmet he became Commander Keen, saviour of the universe. Or            something like that. Plot was never a strongpoint for id...                    Anyway, flash forward ten years and id's cult classic series has            been brought to the GameBoy Color, courtesy of David A Palmer            Productions. The only real surprise is that it hasn't been done            sooner - the cute, colourful cartoon-style graphics and platform            hopping action are a perfect match for Nintendo's hand-held, and            Palmer (with a little help from id's own Adrian Carmack) have done            a great job of producing something which is instantly identifiable            as a Commander Keen adventure without simply cloning one of the            original PC games.                    Once again it is up to you to save the world, armed only with a zap            gun and a pogo stick. The manual says something about plasma            crystals and sub-space anomalies, but the short version presented            in the opening screen is that ~the Earth is in trouble, this looks            like a job for Commander Keen!~ And let's face it, what more do you            need to know?                    Your mission begins in the Hub, from where you can choose to travel            to any of the three worlds that make up the game, each of which            features its own unique visual style and enemies. Security drones,            mobile mushrooms, slugs, bug-eyed monsters and robotic warriors are            all present and correct, with a mixture of new creatures and guest            appearances from old favourites like the            Dopefish.                    The worlds are in turn split into three levels each, with the now            traditional id gameplay format of pressing a few switches, finding            coloured key cards and matching them to the appropriate door, with            the odd teleporter thrown in for good measure. Hardly innovative,            but all good clean fun. Settings vary from fire-drenched canyons            and robot factories to forests and alien labs, complete with            bottled Keen clones. All of them are colourful and beautifully            designed, and there are some great button-pounding moments to be            had, dodging enemies while trying to land on a precarious platform,            or leaping through the air on your pogo stick, hopping between            bricks which are constantly sliding in and out of a wall above a            bottomless chasm.                    The boss encounters at the end of each world are a little hit and            miss. Each boss has his own weak spot that you have to shoot, but            it's not always obvious what you need to do. On the other hand, the            first boss I reached proved to be something of a push over. If you            do get stuck you can always give up, move on to another world and            come back to it later though. A slightly clumsy password system            saves your position as a sixteen character code at the end of each            level, and this records how many lives and continues you have left            as well as which of the game's nine levels you have completed. As            you always start back at the hub after inputting a password, this            means that you can easily move on to another world instead of going            back to where you left off.                    The gameplay might be decidely old school, but the combination of            imaginative characters, colourful backdrops and pogo hopping action            makes Commander Keen a lot of fun for both younger gamers and those            of us old enough to remember the originals. And to make sure it            caters for everyone, there is a choice of three difficulty settings            which alter the speed at which your enemies move as well as how            frequently you will earn new lives and continues.                    The only real downside is that the game is (like its hero) perhaps            a little on the short side, but while it lasts it's a lot of fun.                        -        Commander                    Keen screenshotsCommander                    Keen screenshots"}
