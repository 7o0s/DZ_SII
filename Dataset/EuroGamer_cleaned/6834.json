Midway's NHL Hitz            20-02, not to be confused with EA's NHL 2002, falls into the latter            category, streamlining the noble art of slapstick in the interests            of gameplay.                         Hitz is a fairly conventional arcade sports game, bending rules            here and physics there. The rink seems to be slightly smaller than            your average playing surface and teams are made up of four players            rather than five. On the other hand, as the presence of numerous            copyright screens aptly demonstrates, the game is still backed by            an NHL license, meaning that all the players and teams are based on            their real-life counterparts, right down to their individual            strengths and weaknesses.                         The main game modes are Championship and Franchise, the former            allowing puck peddlers to pick an NHL team and lock horns all the            way to the Stanley Cup. The latter is slightly more involved, and            before taking on the Franchise mode, players have to head to the            Custom Team page and create their own foursome. With only a handful            of different outfits and comedic variables though, and a bunch of            meaningless statistics to fiddle with, it makes sense to get some            time in on the ice first.                    The best way to get to terms with the game is through the            ubiquitous quick mode, known here as 'Exhibition'. This doesn't            even require you to enter a name to play (and without a keyboard            any tappy-tap-tap elements of the game involve tedious manipulation            of the hateful d-pad), and lets you pick from all the teams in the            NHL and their individual players, as well as choosing whether to            play home or away.                         Stepping out onto the ice it's immediately clear that NHL Hitz            20-02 looks very impressive, and with the volume up the atmosphere            is quite electric. Players joke around on the ice and reach for the            sky as the commentator reads off their names. Animation is            super-smooth, which helps complement the equally fluid gameplay,            and in general the models look very beefy, padded and realistic.            Sticks and pucks fly with satisfying thwacks and other onomatopoeic            nonsense, and players even talk smack at each other during            face-offs and after heavy clashes.                        With a complete lack of visible refereeing and a button for            turbo-charging attacks, it's a game of back-and-forth with players            clashing and sparks literally flying. Often matters get so out of            hand the game switches to a side-on view and lets players duke it            out beat 'em up style, with the loser relegated to the bench for            the rest of the match. Meanwhile the incessant shouting of the            over-enthusiastic commentator eggs you on, although relegating him            to half-volume creates a nice background.                    During the game's three periods of three minutes each players clash            regularly and the puck moves between ends with astonishing speed.            Players can actually tweak the game speed up or down, and I found a            setting about three quarters of the way to maximum worked best.            Sadly this speed negates virtually all real skill, with most games            coming down to one-timers, playing the puck in to the middle at            speed and striking it with a monstrous backlift, but playing it any            slower is like watching paint dry.                        This wouldn't be quite so infuriating if our old chum the Xbox            controller weren't doing his bit to resist the player too. Thanks            to the physical proximity and clunky feel of the diamond buttons            it's very tricky to perform a decent one-timer, switching quickly            from A to X. The control system in general feels unresponsive, but            it's a touch deceptive with the pad - and God - mostly to blame.            The shoulder triggers control your boost bar, which empties and            replenishes quickly enough, but you often find yourself pasting the            button down because using it liberally is nigh on impossible at the            speed the game moves. The other problem is that you simply cannot            turn very quickly at speed on ice, and whether or not this is            realistic it's certainly irritating.                        One thing that definitely isn't realistic though is the special            effects. High scoring games often see smoke rising up off regular            scorers' shoulders, and if they keep up that form fire and            eventually bolts of lightning and electricity can envelope the            whole team, enhancing their accuracy with the puck. This is handy            in the two player split-screen modes for burying upstarts in the            final moments.                    Play around for a while and you can build up some credits, which            can then be spent in the Hockey Shop on the main menu. The items in            the shop are useful mostly for Custom Teams, with bizarre            replacement heads and jerseys on offer amongst other things. Earn            enough credits and you can even unlock All-Star teams for use in            the Exhibition and Championship modes.                         Once you have a good-looking team you can start building them up            in Franchise mode, eventually fighting your way through the            fictional Midway Cup and conquering the game properly. Franchise is            also a far more agreeable tutorial than the Skill mode, Hitz'            excuse for a training area. Its several levels of increasingly            frustrating and unpleasant tests, all of which are set against an            unforgiving time limit, do little to encourage casual players to            persevere with it.                         Ultimately NHL Hitz 20-02 can be deep, but it can also be            meaningless. The graphics are certainly very nice, and unlike EA            Sports titles the crowd is modelled in 3D and animated nicely.            There's a hint of slowdown in places, particularly when players are            'on fire' or hurled through the protective barriers, but in general            the pace of the game is unrestrained. It would perhaps have been            nice to see the game tweaked a little to iron out some of the            blemishes, and the 'blitz' gameplay wears thin eventually, but the            Tony Hawk-like array of extras to be unlocked and hidden aspects of            the game like the cheat codes written on banners in the crowd all            add up to a nice little package.                         Whether ice hockey games are all that relevant to anybody in            Europe is difficult to say, but I doubt we'll run out of them any            time soon, and this is certainly an above-average one. Perhaps it's            time to give in and see what the fuss is about? There are better            things to buy on the Xbox, but NHL Hitz 20-02 is worth renting for            the multiplayer mode and if you get that far, you may just find            that you like it enough to buy it.                        -                            NHL Hitz 20-02 screenshots                    NHL Hitz 20-02 screenshots"}
