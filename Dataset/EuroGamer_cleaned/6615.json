The sight of a            comedy cartoon beat 'em up in the vein of Powerstone did little to            hold our attention. With Microsoft-published titles of the era            falling into two distinct categories (Genius - Halo, Gotham, and            Rubbish - Azurik, Nightcaster) we hastily confined it to the latter            category and thought nothing more of it.                    When you get to see and play almost everything of any worth, it's            easy to make rash judgements. It takes a lot to convince our poor,            hardened, cynical brains that the latest amazing new game            isn't, in fact, a worthless, crushingly derivative cash-in. We were            still very much in this thought mode when Kung Fu Chaos arrived in            the post. The fact that Microsoft hadn't (and still hasn't) even            pushed the game itself tended to reinforce this. When a game's a            bit of a stinker, publishers and PRs go all quiet, and slip out            review code hoping that you won't notice. When it's an absolute            disaster, they don't send them out at all. At least Kung Fu Chaos            couldn't have been that bad.                    Booting it up dutifully, the Just Add Monsters logo appeared. Hmmm;            it's that ex-Sony breakaway bunch that Argonaut bought a while            back. Maybe it had potential after all. Then the impressively            kitsch and amusing intro kicks in, complete with the Kung Fu            Fighting and Enter The Dragon theme tunes. The feel good factor            never lets up from that moment on.        Despite the wealth of options, this is fairly standard beat 'em            up territory. Various single, multiplayer (up to four players) and            practice modes allow you to play the game pretty much however you            fancy. But in order to unlock everything in the game, it's well            advised to plough headlong into KFC's Ninja Challenge mode. This is            the main event, and seamlessly acts as means of learning the game's            intricacies, while giving you an opportunity to progress.                    There's no pointless back story as such to ramble our way through.            Essentially, you've been hired as an actor by the excitable            director Shao Ting to star in his latest action blockbuster. After            selecting one of the eight available characters (two of which are            locked to begin with) you'll only have one level, or 'scene', to            battle through, and the aim is to reach a three star rating before            the director runs out of film. As you'd expect, a whole host of            extras appear on the set, and it's your job to kick the crap out of            them in as spectacular style as possible to earn your 'stars' up to            a maximum of five. But for the purposes of unlocking the next scene            a three out of five rating is enough.                    Throughout the bouts, the insanity of the director never lets up,            and he'll be barking orders at you at every turn, coming out with            all manner of barking mad quips that had us cackling in            appreciation.                    Each of the 27 scenes can be unlocked on either your first or            second go (apart from the last two bonus scenes), and they vary            from simple 'repeat after me' tutorials, to immensely entertaining            mini-games, and full blown scrolling levels which take place across            lavish film sets, culminating in the obligatory boss encounter.        At its core, the moves set is fairly basic, with combos adding            layers of combat underneath. Hit X to perform a basic attack, A to            jump, B to trip/pick up/throw, Y to counter, R to block, L to            taunt, and L with R to launch a 'smart bomb' Super Attack. Within a            few levels it soon becomes apparent that there's far more to the            game than initially meets the eye.                    Key to KFC's combat is its amusing taunt system, which allows            players to build up the aforementioned Super Attack. By tapping L            immediately after a successful attack, your character will deliver            a humiliating put down, which serves to stun your foe even more,            allowing you time to pick them up and throw them off into the            abyss. After three successful taunts you can then launch a smart            bomb-esque Super Attack to clear the screen of anything giving you            hassle for a few seconds. Mistime your taunts, however, and the            game takes an opportunity to take the piss out of you, with a poor            ~you're so stupid~ taunt emanating, closely followed by Donkey            noises, as if to prove the point.                    Progress through the Ninja Challenge is both swift and immensely            enjoyable. Levels rarely outstay their welcome, thanks to the            'against the clock' mechanic, and thus failure can quickly be            rectified. As we mentioned, attaining three stars on any of the            scenes is quite straightforward, but getting four or five will take            some doing, as it requires a more intimate knowledge of the combo            system. Killing groups of enemies quickly is the key to getting a            higher rating, but the rewards are numerous. Just Add Monsters has            clearly worked hard at creating incentives for the player to replay            the game, and such is the fun factor, you almost certainly will.        If KFC was merely a succession of battles, then it would all            get quite boring, and quickly. But the proliferation of imaginative            mini-games adds an extra dimension to the game, and elevates it            above the usual po-faced beat em up fare. In many senses this is            the Super Monkey Ball of the beat 'em up arena. The mini-games are            instantly playable, delightfully presented, and furiously            addictive. Reminiscent of Nintendo's Game & Watch efforts of            the early 80s, 'A Few Good Stuntmen' has you attempting to bounce            falling Stuntmen to safety while avoiding the Cows (much like            Fire), 'Water Whirl' has you avoiding a rapidly rotating pole while            three players attempt to smack it back in your direction, 'Four            Poles And A Princess', bizarrely, has you throwing a Princess at            your three opponents in an attempt to knock them off their            pedestals, 'Tomb Robber' is a straightforward Pac-Man clone, while            'Invasion Of The Brain Snatchers' invites you to chuck aliens into            a crate\u2026.the list goes on and it's always amusingly bizarre.                    In terms of all round presentation, Just Add Monsters deserves much            praise for bothering to create a unique looking game with a level            of individuality and polish so lacking from many games. The squat,            cartoony characters may not appeal to everyone's taste, but the            level of detail, animation and charm are top notch. Even more            impressive is the scenery and background detail - something not            immediately apparent. The director saves the bulk of his budget for            the later scenes, which include a comical Dinosaur chase sequence            (Enter The Dino), culminating with the UFO-laced Revengeance Day.            As a result, these often-spectacular set pieces act as a bizarre            backdrop to some already fairly insane action.                    Outside of the single player-only Ninja Challenge, there are plenty            of other modes to get stuck in to. Battle Game is a straightforward            bout on any of the game's six main sets for up to four players,            which can either be played as a free for all match or in teams,            with bouts winnable based on various different rules. The same            applies to the Championship mode, which allows players to take on            one or more opponent across all of six of the sets, with points            awarded depending on your final position. If you can get enough            mates around your Xbox, the potential is there to have an enjoyably            insane and irreverent beat 'em up experience. Shame it's not            Live-enabled, as this is the perfect kind of game to take advantage            of the service - and it's especially puzzling when the dire            Whacked! has Live.                    As long as you're not expecting a serious Soul Calibur-esque beat            'em up, then there's so much to admire about KFC; it's huge fun            from the word go, has an absolute shedload of unlockables and has a            style all of its own. Compared to its more serious competition it's            fair to say that the combat can feel a touch lightweight, but the            comic touch and the taunts work extremely well in balancing up the            game's pick up and play shallowness. It's virtually impossible to            play KFC without sporting a stupid grin on your face, and it has            all the hallmarks of becoming a cult classic."}
