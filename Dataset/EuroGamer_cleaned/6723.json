Medal of Honor: Frontline is of            course the de facto standard, but it's easy to forget that            Volition's Red Faction helped pave the way for EA's seminal            classic. We haven't forgotten though, and with Red Faction II,            Volition and publisher THQ aim to remind you the best way they know            how - by blowing a hole in the wall with a rocket launcher and            shoving it down your throat.        The original Red Faction was            a very good game, but it suffered from a handful of flaws - most            notably its framerate, which dipped quite considerably below            acceptable levels at times - but the thing it was most guilty of            was failing to innovate enough. Ironic, perhaps, because the            Geo-Mod system, which allowed players to blast holes in the masonry            and even dig makeshift bunkers with rockets, was arguably one of            the coolest things to appear in a shoot'em'up since the railgun.            Fortunately, Volition has taken each and every criticism of the            first game into account and five years after the rebellion on Mars,            your mission is a lot more beautiful and a lot more destructible.                    The player's role is that of a demolitions expect, sent in with a            team of five specialist squad members on a mission to oust the            maniacal dictator Sopot, whose reign of some fifteen years is            really starting to annoy the locals. But lurking behind this            unassuming and frankly quite uninspiring story is a carefully woven            tale of violence and intrigue, well scripted and well paced.                    Having been dropped from a gunship to take out a small fortress,            the first thing you notice about Red Faction II though is how            gorgeous it looks. Gone are the low-res textures and simple            geometry, replaced by well lit, carefully constructed buildings            offering some fairly intelligent design. Once you get into the            thick of things, dodging rocket blasts from sentry towers and            hiding behind thick concrete pillars, the quality of the character            animation also becomes evident - particularly death animations.            Shoot a bad guy and he might just flop to the ground, but he'll            spill his guts if you hit him hard enough, and you can even            relegate him to a pile of giblets with a bit of rocket-propelled            oomph. What's more, Volition has made use of some amusing            situational animations - in one area, a violent explosion rips            through a poor guard leaving him standing exactly where he was,            sans upper body...        Red Faction            II builds on the Geo-Mod engine that allowed real-time            environmental destruction, and this time around it can be split            into three distinct layers. First of all, there are the bullet            holes, scorch marks and so on which pepper the walls and mess up            the fine exterior. Beyond that, there are destructible objects like            lampposts and barrels, which rocket up into the air and crash down            in a smouldering mess, and beyond that, we have the heavy-duty            Geo-Mod technology, which mostly applies to puzzles and combat            tactics. At its simplest, you can take advantage of it to blow a            hole in a wall for easy access to something, but as you move on it            creates a nice halfway point between basic shoot'em'up gameplay and            the scripted sequences, which are back in abundance.                    Level scripting in RFII is greatly improved, with huge action set            pieces that don't upset the tempo, and along with your bevy of            troops and considerable opposition, unite to manufacture an            entertaining spectacle, which not only keeps you interested but            also involves you to a reasonable degree. That said, the amount of            scripting and the addition of new objectives is all a smokescreen            to try and hide the game's linearity, but at this stage it's no            less exciting on account of that. You may be moving from A to B,            but it's far from a stroll through some bland corridors.                    For a start, you have your arsenal to help keep you entertained.            Returnees from the first game include your trusty grenade launcher,            sniper rifle and rail driver, along with a clutch of new additions,            like the dual-handed weapons and versatile complement of grenades.            The dual handguns and machine pistols are a great addition, and the            control system adjusts slightly for them. With a regular            shoulder-mounted weapon like the rocket launcher you fire with R1            and use L1 to handle alternate fire, but when you have a pair of            pistols in front of you, L1 operates lefty and R1 operates righty -            a good system, which allows you to use them individually or akimbo            for that desirable John Woo effect.        In addition to your            basic arsenal of fifteen weapons though, you also have various            grenades, with the throwing action bound to L3. Frag grenades,            incendiaries and shock grenades are available - the latter will            paralyse your foes in single player, and in a nice touch, reverse            the controls of your opponents in multiplayer - but if bouncing            grenades round corners isn't your thing, you can always take            advantage of satchel charges. You didn't think they'd leave them            out, surely? One of the funniest sights in the original RF was a            satchel charge slapped on an enemy's back, and you can relive that            here quite happily.                    Your five squad-mates will also be packing a heavy arsenal, and            they are completely autonomous with particular skills to aid you.            They're not stupid, either. Their AI seems quite helpful in most            situations, without being too smart or conversely too            stupid, and they certainly don't get stuck on the walls from what            we've seen. What's more, they have a bit of personality about them,            which enhances the experience, and they can happily pilot things if            needs be.                    Piloting? Well, where would a modern first person shooter be            without a car park's worth of vehicles? Red Faction II starts you            off as a gunner on the back of a gunship strafing Sopot City, but            there are other options within. Halo-esque tanks and hover flyers            are available, and you can even take to the depths in a submarine,            but our favourite is the battle armour. Don the gear and you're a            walking tank, with miniguns, incendiary grenades to bounce around            and explosive rockets to reshape the scenery with. Oh boy, the fun            you can have with these in deathmatch...        So, we can say that the single player game is good at this            stage. Nay, it's very good. However, Red Faction II wants to            compete with the likes of TimeSplitters 2 and get one over on Medal            of Honor, and to do that it's going to need a very, very good            multiplayer side to it. To this end, Volition has packed the game            with options - including one for USB keyboard and mouse support! At            the moment the game handles four players, split-screen, with up to            six players per game (including as many custom CPU bots among those            as necessary), and there are plenty of game modes on offer.                    The standard deathmatch and team deathmatch options are present,            along with capture the flag and a couple of last man standing modes            called arena and team arena [wasn't she a singer? -Ed]. The            oddities are ~bagman~ and the team bagman variation, in which the            player or team is trying to hang onto a bag for as long as            possible, and ~regime~, which is a bit like bagman, but with a            silly hat. Levels lave all been designed to fit six players, so            they are generally quite compact but they all flow quite well, and            some are downright excellent. Volition hasn't been afraid to            populate them with power-ups too, like the quad damage-esque damage            enhancer and a slow motion toy, which leaves your enemies hideously            exposed.                    The bots are at this stage almost finalised, and you can alter            their characteristics on a number of levels. Obviously you can            tweak them to be clever or stupid, but you can also stipulate how            aggressive or cowardly you want them to be, and whether they're            fast or slow and whether they camp amongst other things. The good            news is that the difficulty level can be tweaked well above and            below my own abilities, which suggests that pretty much anyone will            feel at home.                    As you can probably imagine, Red Faction II has been a popular            fixture around here lately, and we're looking forward to getting            our hands on the final incarnation of the game later this week.            Until then, I'll leave you with a thought. When I first got my            hands on RFII, I was wondering how it would compete with            TimeSplitters 2 from Free Radical. A month on, and I'm wondering            just how TimeSplitters 2 can suppress this explosive faction..."}
