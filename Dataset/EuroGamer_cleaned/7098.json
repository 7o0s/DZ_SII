It's a fair enough concept with nice            visuals and execution, but the translation is dire at times, on and            off the screen. It may sound silly, but the notion is that you are            building houses from blocks, with the emphasis on being quicker            than your opponent, or in single player Mode to build a city.                         The manual that accompanies the game is a minefield of involuntary            patronization and confusion, in keeping with the direness of the            translation. Here are a few choice excerpts - please bear in mind            that these are direct quotes..                         ~What is a block? It is a coloured block which appears during the            game.~                         ~How to change the colour of the blocks. If a block is placed near            another one, this latter will change colour, assuming the one of            the block shot against it. If the new colour is already present,            buildings will increase in size.~                         Of most amusement to the EuroGamer staff was the ~What is a            deadline?~ section, during the course of which for some reason the            incompetent translators mistakenly included the word ~MISS~ instead            of ~LOSE~.                         There are plenty of options to the game, including Puzzle and            Battle Modes, which are drawn in a 3D style, as well as a port of            the original 2D Puzzle Bobble-style Arcade version. Rather like an            upside down version of Tetris, you have to build houses by bashing            blocks together.                    Puzzle Mode is about as simplistic as the game gets. You have a            3-dimensional base and have to create buildings of increasing size            under harsh conditions to construct a city, level by level. The            first levels are easy, requiring only small buildings to win, but            the lattermost levels are fiendishly difficult. If you manage to            grab the highest score in a single location, a hidden one will            appear in addition to the six available at the start, and as such            the game offers incrementally more complex challenges to overcome.                         The, er, deadline we mentioned earlier is actually rather            important, as if your building hits the deadline you lose.            Similarly, if the space left on the board is too small to fit the            necessary building your forfeiture of the round is immediate.                         Battle Mode is a fairly basic variation, allowing you to battle            against CPU-controlled opponents on the 3-dimensional stage to            build the biggest buildings. Coin-collection is the most important            aspect, and you do this by building bigger, and once you have            collected 100 coins, a symbol appears. Hit this and you win. The            crux is that your opponent is often more deftly skilled than you            and manages to get their first. The later levels are horrifyingly            tricky!                         I suppose at this point you're more than a little confused as to            why I think this game is unsuitable for Western audiences. Do            continue, gentle reader, for all will be revealed!                    Arcade Mode is where I imagine you'll put in the most hours, as I            have. The single player games are quite entertaining, and playing            Battle Mode against a friend can be Moderately enjoyable, but the            real juice of the game lies in the hurly burly over the top nature            of its classic Arcade Mode.                         So what's the problem? Well for starters, in order to retain the            true feel of the arcade Mode, the superior 3-dimensional platform            has been dropped in favour of flat 2-dimensional isometric guff            quite frankly. I've heard of bad design decisions but there aren't            enough adjectives in the world to describe how annoying I find            this..                         The 3D look is superb and vastly preferable, and the            implementation elsewhere proves this, but by shunning it for the            Arcade Mode developers Taito simply make themselves look like lazy            slackers. On the GameBoy or another handheld unit maybe this would            have been appropriate, but on the PlayStation, even though it is            now fairly outdated it just doesn't make sense.                         The other problem is that without the flashy 3D graphics it can be            harder to follow. You don't get the sense of depth and because of            this the discerning the colour of the blocks behind the buildings            can be difficult, especially since they are often yellow next to            green or some similar combination such as that. In the heat of the            battle not being able to distinguish the colour of the blocks can            make you hesitant, and the game is definitely about speed of            execution. As such you lose out.                    The style of the game's characters is distinctly anime in nature.            The slightly washed out look of the cut-scenes between matches is            very impressionistic at times, and similar to games like Secret of            Mana 2 from yesteryear. While some other anime-stylised puzzle            gamers prefer the richly coloured cells of Puyo Puyo and its ilk, I            find this more mature feel to be deeply gratifying.                         Sadly the sounds let Land Maker down as well. The happy beeps and            squeaks of the blocks crashing together and incomprehensible            Japanese pseudo-speak over the top is quite entertaining, but the            dull methodical background music does nothing for me. Often I            turned down the music and played some CDs on my hi-fi while testing            it.                         In a way that's Land Maker's biggest flaw. By the time you've            played through it enough to get a hold of the concept, you lose            interest. Games like Wetrix and Puyo Puyo are intrinsically            addictive because of their simplistic nature. Getting the hang of            them is never an issue, but with Land Maker it is, and at            \u00a320-30 it doesn't represent a terribly good investment.                    Land Maker is a bit of a catch-22. It's a nice, playable game at            times and visually quite appealing, but a couple of design            decisions and some dodgy background music immediately put you at            odds with it, and even though you may persevere it never becomes as            enjoyable as say Puzzle Bobble, from which it was clearly derived.            If you're looking for something new, perhaps give it a try, but            otherwise, take a look at the most recent Bust-a-Move title or head            back down to your local arcade and see how it's done for real."}
