Unfortunately for fans of the series,            Monolith have made plenty of mistakes and, like so many of their            previous releases, AvP2 is crying out for a patch.                         Monolith got one thing right though. AvP2 continues in the same            vein as its predecessor, which sported three separate campaigns for            budding Aliens and aspiring Predators, while for the rest of us            there was the bladder-slackening Marine mission to contend with. It            was three games in one with a brilliant co-operative multiplayer            mode to boot.                        The sequel is nowhere near as frightening, but Monolith have done a            surprisingly good job of building believable Alien and Predator            single player scenarios which intersect with one another and the            Marine campaign at times. The Marine campaign is perhaps the best            of them, and compared to the vomit-inducing fish-eyed Alien            campaign and every epileptic's worst nightmare, the Predator, the            Marine outing is a better first person shooter. With a            shoulder-mounted flashlight answering your every beck and call            though, the only scares will come as you face the wrong way when a            scripted sequence kicks off.                    Viewed as a whole, AvP2 is a pretty impressive blend of elements.            Each single player undertaking is a good few hours long and            requires a different playing style. As the Marine your biggest ally            will be heavy weapons and hacking equipment, but as the Predator            stealth and brutality will suffice. The Alien would be pretty            similar, but it also introduces extreme mobility and a subtle            frailty of character. Encouraging stealth early on as the player            grows from a face hugger to a chest buster and finally a proper            Alien, it also helps to be slightly psychotic. Slashing and            decapitating is still the only way to survive.                         The biggest change for the series though comes from the technology            behind it. The same engine that powered No One Lives Forever,            Lithtech 2.5, is employed to handle the activities, but it's an odd            choice. It isn't as visually stimulating as Quake III Arena - a            game which is already well past its second birthday - but it's very            endearing in its own way. Everything is much smoother and more            elegant, right down to the assault rifle gripped tightly in every            Marine's hands. The lighting (and there's a surprising amount of it            for an Alien-esque game) is often less than foreboding, but it            looks good.                         Character modelling is also up to NOLF's high standards, with            animated faces being used to some extent. The variation in            appearance and clothing is a step up from the first AvP, but it's            still not quite realistic enough to give the likes of FFX a run for            their money, and combined with some less than dramatic scenery            (which is par for the course on Lithtech apparently) the developers            have had to work hard to keep up the illusion of reality. Which is            hard enough as it is, thanks to the countless bugs and insane            system requirements. Generally speaking a PC based on a 1GHz            Pentium III with a GeForce 2 Pro graphics card is a damn fine            gaming system. Throw AvP2 at it though and it's quivering silently            on the floor in five minutes flat, with numerous blips throughout.            Fortunately my other PC is driven by one of those tasty Athlon XPs,            plenty of memory and a GeForce 3 Ti500. AvP2 didn't argue with            that, so I guess the sweet spot is somewhere in-between.                    One more victim of Lithtech 2.5 is the game's multiplayer support.            There are countless modes available, including all your favourite            first person shooter clich\u00e9s as well as the old Hunt mode,            Survivor (last man standing) and the new Evac mode, where one team            tries to reach an extraction point before the other team wipes them            out.                        Unfortunately none of these modes is really playable once you move            beyond the safety of a LAN. There are few enough servers out there            running the game, and only 250 players were online at the time of            writing. Thanks to the Lithtech engine's average network code,            playing online is hard enough even if you can find the            players, with pings varying wildly with no real pattern.                         One thing which doesn't let up though is the sound effects, with a            proper orchestral score that changes according to your situation.            The voice acting is typically American but it's not that bad, and            you don't get it often in the Alien and Predator campaigns unless            the person doing the speaking is about to meet his maker. This more            than makes up for any annoyance.                    Amongst the bugs and niggles afflicting the game are a few real            show-stoppers. Sometimes a scripted sequence will just not happen,            leaving you to ponder what's supposed to be happening for a few            minutes and then reload an old save game. As a result there are            times when in any normal first person shooter you would just assume            that you had missed a clue, but in reality the game has forgotten            to do the next cutscene.                         Sometimes smaller things go wrong. The AI has a habit of getting            stuck on the scenery, or the Aliens make stupid noises and then            come charging down the corridor, as if they weren't boring enough            as it is. The other annoying thing about the AI-controlled Aliens            is that they don't seem to bear any resemblance to those that you            play alongside in the Alien campaign. When you are fighting against            them the Aliens look awfully short and seem to have a tendency            towards crouching down and scraping your shins.                         There's quite a lot to do in Aliens vs. Predator 2, but despite            its technical tomfooleries and the criss-crossed storyline, it            isn't as good a game as the original Alien vs. Predator. Some            hopeful multiplayer options and the odd bit of excitement can't            rescue AvP2 from its bugs and poor mimicry, and it's a pale shadow            of Monolith's last big effort, No One Lives Forever. If you're            crying out for a new shoot 'em up you would be better off getting            Return to Castle Wolfenstein.                        -        Alien                    vs. Predator 2 screenshotsAlien                    vs. Predator 2 screenshotsNo One                    Lives Forever reviewNo One                    Lives Forever review"}
