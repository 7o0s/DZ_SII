After the atrocities of Blood 2 and the rather short-lived Shogo,            the Lithtech engine seemed to be marked for mediocrity, but a year            on, and No One Lives Forever is one of the best single player first            person shooters since Half-Life. Enjoyable on so many levels, and            stunningly attractive, it shows just what the technology is really            capable of.                         Although at times rather too linear for its own good, NOLF has a            pleasantly paced momentum to it, and the plot, which centres around            swinging 60's UNITY agent Cate Archer, is fairly plausible, if a            little too Austin Powers-ish. You start out on a fairly routine            mission providing protection for the American Ambassador to            Morocco, by picking off moustachioed assassins who dash from their            trench coat-shrouded holes to try and pick him off. After the            mission goes pear-shaped and your fellow agent is lost, you are            reassigned on a mission to uncover his murderer, a nasty chap by            the name of Volkov, part of an international terrorist organisation            called HARM.                         Your search takes you to the darkened doorways of Berlin, and            several infiltration missions later you have more clues. From here            on, the game accelerates toward its explosive ending, stopping off            in the Caribbean and the Alps en-route for some impressive James            Bond-esque action, including sky-diving battles ala the intro to            ~Moonraker,~ and some snowmobile rides through the snowy Alps, ala            ~On Her Majesty's Secret Service.~                    The Lithtech engine rarely shows any weakness, and despite the            fairly large levels, the load times are acceptable (unlike Blood            2's were, it ought to be said). The early Moroccan areas are very            nicely done, thanks to some lovely architectural work that actually            bears relation to the real world, with high-placed turrets and            beige stone walls. Berlin is rather weak, largely because of the            fairly generic army-base type textures, but the Caribbean is very            nicely done, with misty ruins and lush vegetation.                         It's safe to say though, that the sections in the Alps take the            biscuit. Snow is snow, but the mountaintop castle areas are            utterly breathtaking, with the morning sun reflecting in the frost            as your snowmobile roars through it. The castle part in particular            has a daunting ~Where Eagles Dare~ type ambience to it, and looks            like the sort of unshakable fortress suitable for an arch-villain.                         Of all the areas in the game, the weakest probably has to be the            UNITY headquarters. The Q-branch substitute is utterly devoid of            any interesting textures of gadgets beyond what you are being doled            out with. Part of the fun in the Bond films is the things that we            see going on in the background, like phone booths with airbags, and            flame-throwing bagpipes. Perhaps developers Monolith just don't get            it. Whatever, it was sorely missed, leaving little more than a            carefully prepared maze containing your new gadgets and a few            ~training~ sections, which bear little relation to what happens in            the game itself.                    Despite with the sublime game engine though, NOLF is rather too            linear. Having some enemy beg you to spare his life to help you            through a tricky section later in the game would have been nice, or            at least something to add to the replayability, but as it            is, even the characters you do socialize with, like the American            agent Tom Goodman, are rather incongruous. A lot of the time it's            all just a sideshow to the Cate Archer slugfest.                         The AI of your enemies is rather weak at times, too. Although            there are some excellent sections where you have to dart from            pillar to post avoiding rooftop sniper fire, there's very rarely            any danger as long as you shoot accurately and remember to take            cover and crouch. Your opponents once shot take milliseconds to            recover enough to fire again; the only opportunity you really get            to take them out is the split second before the initial volley. As            NOLF has dispensed with health packs, instead opting for armour            packs, it can be quite difficult to survive an entire level without            reloading a few saves here and there. The old mantra of save fast            and save often comes into play quite early on, and stays. It            reminded me of Soldier of Fortune at times.                         Thankfully though, although NOLF is hardly original, it does take            inspiration from some of the most entertaining games and films in            recent history. There's even the odd in-joke for people who are            watching closely.                    Aside from the nit-picking above, No One Lives Forever has one            problem, and one only. Its startling lack of replayability. Once            you've completed the single player game, there's no real impetus to            go back and do it again. You are bound not to have collected all of            the hidden spy documents and such in every level, which is one of            your sub-objectives, but crawling inch-by-inch over every single            level in the game just to top up your stats at the level's end            isn't something to be taken lightly.                         The multiplayer is fairly meaningless, too, as with the other            Lithtech games. Nobody seems to be on any of the Internet's            servers, despite GameSpy support, and even when you do eventually            discover an occupied server, playable isn't really the word one            should use for the action, which is played through pings in excess            of 150 (despite this writer's broadband internet connection), and            even over a network it isn't terribly exciting, with large,            underwhelming levels and inaccurate weapons.                         However, one thing that does see a lot of replaying here is the            second CD, the soundtrack, which features some top 60s tunes that            despite their quirkiness are actually quite easy to listen to. The            array of sound effects and musical samples throughout the game are            also very well placed, and the middle Eastern henchmen voices are            strangely appropriate, and an obvious take off of ~Mustafa~ in the            Austin Powers flicks.                    Still, although at times little more than a culmination of spy            films and stereotypes over the last forty years, No One Lives            Forever is an adventure and a half for the single player, and well            worth investigating if you're sick of world-threatening plots and            Quake-engine oddities. Thoroughly commendable."}
