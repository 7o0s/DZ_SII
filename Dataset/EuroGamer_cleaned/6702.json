{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-rocky-x", "date": "22 Oct 2002", "game_name": "Rocky", "text": "It's easy to            have our memories of the Rocky movie series tarnished by the latter            episodes (namely IV and V), but the 1976 original still stands as            one of the best movies of its era, with its triumph of the underdog            tale. And what better than to build a boxing game based on some            pretty rich source material?                    For starters, all the 'boss' opponents essential to any beat 'em up            are there, all the elements of training to be a champ are there,            and for the first time there's a set of consoles around with enough            power to faithfully recreate the characters, sets and all the all            round 'Rocky' experience.                    But with good boxing games rarer than rocking horse poo, we            couldn't help approach this licensed effort with a fair amount of            scepticism. After all, the very nature of boxing has seemingly made            it a tough sport to translate into an entertaining videogame, or            certainly to make them anywhere near as entertaining as any number            of other beat 'em ups, which have the luxury of complete artistic            license.                    Add to that the general lacklustre nature of licensed fodder, and            we were half expecting Rocky to be some lame attempt at a boxing            game, with some vaguely recognisable characters to give it a badge            of authenticity. But it takes barely a few minutes in the company            of The Italian Stallion to discover that Rage has pulled out all            the stops to make this as fun and comprehensive a package as            possible.                    As you'd expect, there is a variety of single player modes, ranging            from the basic exhibition bout to a knockout tournament, as well as            the game's central Movie mode. It's here that Rocky's depth and            charms become apparent. For starters, unless you're prepared to get            stuck into this mode, there are precious few boxers to play as in            the exhibition or two player mode. Also, anyone who wades straight            into a two player game is likely to find Rocky a frustrating            experience.        Three            difficultly settings allow even the most ham fisted fighter to make            some pretty decent headway, with the Italian Stallion dispatching            three made up characters before meeting Rocky's first 'real'            nemesis Apollo Creed. The game continues in this chronological            fashion, so that by the time you get to Rocky III era, you're            taking out Clubber Lang a.k.a Mr T, and so on to Ivan Drago (Dolph            Lundgren) and Tommy Gunn (who?). Clearly there is a lack of 'real'            movie characters to fight, which is down to the limitations of the            license, but the fictional boxers are so full of character that it            really doesn't detract from the movie at all.                    In between each 'movie' Rage has inserted key movie moments            recreated in FMV for a bit of narrative effect. In theory this is a            great idea if the rendering was up to the current benchmark. Sadly            it comes across a little creaking - and cheap - at times, but it's            still good fun to watch, and features all the proper voices fans            will know and love. It all helps build the atmosphere of playing            the movie, as does the various locations you get to fight in -            starting at a pretty down and dirty fight club where the audience            heckle and throw glass bottles into the ring if you hit the            canvass. As you work your way up the ladder, you move up to school            gyms, and eventually you're in top arenas complete with grand ego            entrances (e.g. Apollo Creed arriving on a chariot!).                    But before you get to indulge in such niceties you have to actually            be a good enough boxer to progress, and one of the crucial elements            of this is to get in a bit of training with the aim of enhancing            Rocky's individual stats, such as his strength, speed, stamina and            so on. At the start, you're completely useless, obviously. A major            chump, and certainly in no shape to cut it as a mean, lean, killin'            machine.        But with careful nurturing, you can quickly boost your            fighter's capabilities. Each bout gives you two sessions to improve            the areas of your choice, and you can either autotrain, which means            you skip the training but still increase a specific area by five            points, or enter the training yourself. This is effectively a            glorified, but highly effective, rhythm action style affair, where            you're expected to, for example, keep a punching rhythm going, skip            in time, or perform certain moves on the command of the typically            grizzled trainer Mickey.                    The fighting itself can seem extremely tough if you dive straight            in on the normal difficulty setting - but taking time to learn the            numerous combos, and how to block and dodge makes all the            difference. Certainly taking things down to Novice level made            things way more manageable. We wouldn't normally play anything            below the default level for a review, but in this instance the game            became a much more playable prospect without negating the            challenge.                    Once you've learned a few combos, blocking tactics and a decent            training strategy, it's possible to tear through most of the            opponents on your first go, meaning you'll be returning to the            Normal difficulty to play the game properly.        As you'll have already seen, the fighter character models have            been well crafted, with extremely well animated fighters always            looking convincing, with punches consistently crunchy and actually            connecting realistically - although some of the effects can be a            little over the top in true movie fashion. Blood, sweat and saliva            sprays all over the place - particularly the former, which makes a            fine mess of the canvas if you or your opponent is getting a good            pasting. The rings and locations are all uniformly impressive too,            while the cameras deliver a helpful, but dramatic viewpoint on the            action, all set in well animated environments with tons of            incidental detail (like Mickey waving at you like a loon as you're            getting a tanking) all adding to the atmosphere.                    Control wise, there is still a sense that it's not quite as            intuitive as it should be, and sometimes feels sluggish - although            this is more often down to the limitations of your boxer than you.            With the two shoulder buttons used in conjunction with the            directional/analogue pad and the four main buttons, there are a            huge variety of combos to pull off - most of which you'll need to            bring into play if you've any intention of getting good at the            game. While there's a sense that persistent play will bring its            rewards, many players may find the learning curve a little too            steep. But the more patient gamer will enjoy building up Rocky's            capabilities (shame you can't relieve him of his mid 80s mullet,            but hey, you can't have everything), and likewise will enjoy            unravelling its hidden depths.                    With a decent number of boxers to unlock, plenty of modes and a            crafted control system, Rocky is a slow burning beat 'em up that            takes its time to reveal its true charms. As an exercise in how to            use a film license, it's perfect 'interactive merchandise' in the            way that very few games have ever managed. I mean, it even            recreates Rocky's ~Adriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan~ moment. What more could            Rocky fans ask for? For non fans of the movie, it's still by far            the best boxing game ever made - so it if that prospect intrigues            you, there's plenty to recommend. For the casual beat 'em up fan,            don't expect a Tekken style all action romp - this is more your            thinking man's beat 'em up, with enough Arcade action to keep the            interest levels high.
