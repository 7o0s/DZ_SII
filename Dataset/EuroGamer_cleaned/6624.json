How could this important and revered genre have been discarded            with such irrational disregard for its audience? Well, for a start,            LucasArts lost the plot (how ironic) and felt compelled to churn            out 400 (mostly) piss poor Star Wars titles, and other publishers            decided en-masse that splicing action and adventure was the way            forward, and began churning out endless Tomb Raider clones instead.                    A few hardcore developers stuck with the old school adventure            principles of rich narrative, character development and some            fiendish puzzle elements, but the glory days are clearly long gone            - and the consistently poor sales figures certainly reflect this.                    But when Syberia appeared in the Eurogamer Reader Chart for 2002 at            No.29, we were forced to reconsider our view that the genre was            dead. With a PS2 port now on the shelves, we finally had the excuse            we needed to plough headlong into what we hoped would spark off an            adventure revival. But hang on; it's published by Microids;            legendary for bringing out some of the worst games in recent            memory.                    The game kicks off in slightly oddball fashion, with lawyer Kate            Walker arriving in the obscure village of Valadilene on a mission            to complete negotiations over the acquisition of the Universal Toy            Company from its 86-year-old owner Anna Voralberg. Upon arrival at            the local hotel it resembles a scene from Camberwick Green, with an            odd assortment of clockwork automatons hobbling around going about            their daily business. Rather annoyingly for Ms. Walker, the old            woman she's come to visit has just died, thus throwing a spanner in            the works for the deal.        Thereafter, the basic idea of the game is to track down Anna            Voralberg's enigmatic younger brother Hans, who has become the heir            to the Toy Company. The problem is, this talented toy designer has            been assumed dead for the past sixty odd years, and tracking him            down is something of a paper trail in the manner of the Resident            Evil series, and so the game has you steering the hapless Walker            around poking her nose into every conceivable corner, collecting            obscure items, talking to everyone you meet and reading verbose            diary entries that gradually reveal the mysteries of this epic            journey.                    Like all adventure games, Syberia is heavy on the puzzles. If            there's something to pick up, the chances are it will have some            relevance to furthering your quest, and the only way to progress in            Syberia is to be as nosy as possible; poke around, pull levers,            open drawers, or on one baffling occasion open a drawer and            pull a lever. A crucial element of any game of this type is to make            sure the puzzles have some kind of relevance to the plot, but            immediately Syberia throws up a series of unconnected barriers that            rely on a heavy amount of trial and error in order to allow you to            progress. Right from the off the game places you in a limited            number of locations, with progress barred until you make the            seemingly random association with an item in your inventory.                    The main problem we had with Syberia was its linearity. Unlike all            the classic adventure games down the years, the player is rarely            given several things to do at once, so if you're stuck, the game            shuts its doors in your face and refuses to budge until you chance            upon the (often wilfully obscure) solution. On several notable            occasions, the problem arises purely as a result of the design of            the location, which makes it a lottery to determine where your            exits are. Mostly it's patently obvious where they are, but it's            not unusual to find yourself chancing upon them, which is            fundamentally poor design. Given that icons pop up to tell you            whether you can interact with the environment, failing to make the            player aware whenever he or she is approaching something as basic            as an exit seems like a glaring oversight.        Part of the problem here is the control system, and the camera            angles which make Resident Evil seem positively forward looking.            Moving Kate around is straightforward enough, with the directional            pad or left stick allowing for direct control in relation to the            camera angle, and circle allowing her to run. But thanks to the            repeated reversal of the viewpoint between locations, you'll stride            out of a room, only to immediately end up back in the one you            started in because you're now heading in the opposite direction. If            that wasn't irritating enough, the areas of the screen that the            game allows you to walk to are often infuriatingly limited, with            large empty chunks of the play area arbitrarily unreachable - and            hence you're often 'funnelled' through limited parts of the screen,            and end up missing where an exit is located.                    And what of the much vaunted visuals? Once upon a long ago these            pre-rendered static locations would have had us drooling like            frenzied lust puppies starved of porn biscuits, but these days our            appetite for tasty treats knows no bounds. The last two Resident            Evil titles on GameCube show what can be achieved with clever use            of pre-rendered locations, but in comparison Syberia fails to            deliver anywhere near comparable levels of impressiveness. On the            PC the locations featured incidental background animation, and a            much higher resolution. Somewhere along the line, the efforts to            port to the PS2 have degraded the visuals to the point where they            no longer make the game feel alive, and Syberia suffers because of            it.                    As is always the case with adventure games, it'll last you a long            time. Divided up into four main sections en route to Russia,            there's easily 20 hours-plus of gameplay, depending on your            capacity for unconnected lateral puzzle consumption. The dialogue,            however, is lamentable, with the English translation the kind of            sub-amateur dramatic sludge that blights low budget games the world            over. This is a shame, as the story itself is well above the            standard cobbled-together gaming fare.                    Taken on its own merits, Syberia offers hardcore adventurers with            endless reserves of patience a decent challenge, but newcomers to            the scene will find the game totally inaccessible, with obscure            puzzles, ropey dialogue and uninspiring sub-survival horror            visuals.                    Far from being the awakening of the adventure gaming genre, the PS2            port of Syberia reminds us why games of this type ended up in their            own sleepy cul-de-sac. With neither the clever dialogue, the            beautiful visuals nor the fabulously constructed puzzles of            LucasArts adventure games of yore, Syberia merely leaves us            wondering why the adventure diehards got so excited about it. Come            on LucasArts; show them how it's done."}
