And the prospect of another mindless blaster from Namco - the kings            of the genre - was quite an appealing prospect given its heritage            and track record over the years, and any excuse to plug in the            G-Con 2 is always eagerly accepted, if only to prove that our            arcade skills haven't deserted us.        Ninjas and guns,            though, don't sound like a particularly likely combination, do            they? But suspend your disbelief for a moment, because you've been            assigned the task of rescuing Princess Kuto from the clutches of            'evil warlord' Sikai-oh, who wants to get his grubby hands on the            mythical Mach Gun, which - eek - has the power to enslave the            world.                    In true Namco style, there are not one, but two bodyguards, Gurun            and Gunjo (handy for two player action, eh readers?), who have to            save the Princess with their 'sharp shooting' ability (as opposed            to something more logical, like their deadly Ninja skills).                    So, spurious storyline aside, Ninja Assault is a straight up            shooter that arcade gamers might be familiar with, seeing as it's a            port of the game of the same name from a couple of years back. And            again, in true Namco style, the PS2 version has been lavished with            exclusive extras to tempt the punters, including new modes (Story            and Jujistsu), a new female character to play as, multiple endings,            and other hidden extras.                    The game itself features the usual plethora of diabolical cut            scenes and stilted Japlish voiceovers interspersing the actions,            although somehow Namco has managed to excel itself this time around            with truly some of the hammiest acting ever seen in a modern            videogame.        Game wise, you            hardly need to be reminded what is on the agenda here: shoot the            bad guys before they shoot/stab/maim you. And, as usual you're            given a massive number of enemies to shoot, and very little time to            actually dispose of them, which inevitably means firing like a            complete lunatic, waving around your gun as if your life depends            upon it.                    Ninja Assault sticks pretty much directly to the tried and tested            formula: pop a cap in a few enemies, try and get the secret items,            camera moves you onto the next area, more baddies, maybe a mini cut            scene, and the inevitable end of level boss encounter.                    Sadly, it's abundantly clear from the off that the game has been            rather too faithfully ported from the arcade. The graphics, being            of 2000 vintage, are woefully short of the standard that next gen            console owners demand these days, with some of the worst examples            of blurry texturing and old school character models we've seen on            the PS2. At times it's so bad that you're left wondering if in fact            this was a PSone title that had a last minute scrub up; how does            seams, jaggies, and awful scenery grab you?                    Another fairly unacceptable facet of Ninja Assault is the fact that            on default settings (i.e. Normal difficulty, eight continues) that            we managed to clear the Gurun story mode on our first go.            Admittedly the continues were used (who doesn't?), but once you've            played it through once, there's very little compulsion to see what            terrible voice acting there is on the other two episodes. Unless            you're feeling really masochistic.        But fortunately that's not all            there is to Ninja Assault. The Jujitsu mini game mode is excellent            fun, with a series of fast paced challenges against the clock            testing your reflexes to the limit. Although again, you'll have            most probably polished them off in no time, leaving just the two            player mode as the only long term fun offered. For \u00a340, there            really isn't enough gameplay to warrant this level of expenditure.                    And to compound the misery, the age old issue of Wide Screen TV            incompatibility rears its ugly head once again. It would be nice if            one day we could play a gun game on a wide screen TV, or is that            just wishful thinking? But hey, at least Namco has bothered            including a 60Hz mode in the PAL conversion, which is one crumb of            comfort. Maybe Namco could consider porting its arcade titles a            little quicker too, as the technical leaps made since this            originally appeared are all too apparent.                    For real die hard fans of the genre, you might want to give it a            try, as it's still a competent example of what this fast, furious            genre can offer, but for the rest of us, it's perhaps better to            consider renting it when you fancy a few hours of intense blasting."}
