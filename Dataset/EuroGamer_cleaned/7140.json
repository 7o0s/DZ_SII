Last year we had Outcast to rob us of                 sleep and social life, and this year we have The Longest                 Journey.                    Produced somewhere in the depths of Scandinavia, and only reaching            our God forsaken shores some months after it had been released            across most of the rest of Europe, The Longest Journey is quite            simply one of the slickest and most involving adventure games I've            ever had the joy of playing.                    You take on the role of April Ryan, an art student in 23rd century            America who finds herself caught up in an epic struggle of good and            evil that spans two worlds - her own scientific world of Stark, and            the magical realm of Arcadia.                    April has the ability to ~shift~ between these two worlds, and            before long you find yourself travelling backwards and forwards            between them as you try to solve the puzzle of who and what you            are, while at the same time trying to save the world from imminent            destruction at the hands of a pseudo-religious group known as the            Vanguard.                    The plot is told through a mixture of in-game conversations and            beautiful rendered cinematics that are amongst the best I've seen.            Although at times the info-dumping can get a bit much, and the            conversations are occasionally a little long winded, the strong            characters and excellent story drag you on through the game's four            CDs.         The first thing to strike you on starting the game is                 just how beautiful it is. The pre-rendered backdrops are                 simply stunning, ranging from the city-scape and slums of                 Stark to the forests, islands and medieval cities of Arcadia.                    In total there are over 150 locations to explore, and 50 characters            to speak to, from cops and engineers to talking birds and eccentric            alchemists. The characters are real-time 3D models, and most of            them are nicely detailed and well animated.                    Unfortunately the game is locked into a low resolution of just            640x480, which can make the characters look rather blocky at times            against the stunning backgrounds, and causes some nasty ~jaggies~.            If you have a Voodoo 5 or GeForce 2 graphics card you are in for a            treat though - full-scene anti-aliasing really does give this game            a whole new lease of life.                    The sound is equally good, with some excellent voice acting and            atmospheric music that suits the game and its mood perfectly. The            script manages to keep you involved in the game and its characters,            as well as injecting a welcome dose of humour, although some people            may find the frequent swearing from some of the characters a little            over the top. Make no mistake, this is not a kid's game...         Of course, one of the most important elements of any good                 adventure game is its puzzles, and luckily The Longest Journey                 scores well here as well.                    The puzzles are fairly challenging at times, but most of them are            logical enough if you stop to think things through. There are a few            bizarre puzzles which had me scrambling for the walkthrough though,            and it's not always entirely obvious what you should be doing.                    Luckily the game includes April's Diary, which is invaluable when            you get stuck. This includes entries about many of the key events            that take place during the game, which give you a further insight            into April's character and, on a more practical level, can often            give you a pointer as to what to do next.                    You also have access to a log of all her conversations throughout            the game, and trawling through the transcripts of her recent            conversations sometimes turns up clues that you missed when            listening to them the first time round.         Controlling the game is                 achieved with your mouse, using a very simple left and right                 click interface that allows you to move around, examine or                 pick-up items, talk to characters, and combine items in your                 inventory, all within a couple of mouse clicks.                    Talking to another character brings up a series of options at the            bottom of your screen, although as with most adventure games, at            the end of the day you usually end up going through most or all of            the options anyway in one order or another.                    You can also access April's Diary by moving the mouse to the top of            the screen and clicking on the little diary icon that appears. This            gives you access to save and load game options, game settings,            conversation logs, and the diary itself of course.                    It's all very intuitive and easy to use, and is very unobtrusive,            leaving you to concentrate on April and the world she is exploring.         The                 Longest Journey is not without its flaws. The humour may not                 appeal to everyone, the conversations can be rather long and                 meandering at times, and the labyrinthine plot is occasionally                 hard to follow.                    Also the 3D characters don't look as good as they should do because            of the low resolution, and although the game still looks gorgeous            and runs silky smooth even on my old RivaTNT, you will really need            a graphics card with support for full-scene anti-aliasing to make            the most of the game's visuals.                    At the end of the day though, The Longest Journey is an engrossing            and highly entertaining adventure game with characters that you can            care about, an involving storyline to keep you hooked, and settings            and characters that are both beautiful and bizarre. What more could            you want from an adventure game?"}
