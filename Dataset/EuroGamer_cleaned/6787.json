What excitement can we            expect to venture forth from this vast, collective imagination?            Innovative gameplay, a detailed story, likeable characters,            beautiful visuals, a memorable soundtrack? How about none of the            above? Apparently somebody threw a light gun amongst the two teams            and they vomited forth this abomination. Welcome to Vampire Night,            an exercise in slap-dash game composition.                         It's a good thing Vampire Night is a light gun game, because            somebody needed shooting. This disappointing blaster is a            typical gun-toting affair with a single player mode that's over in            an hour, a special mode boasting foibles which add practically            nothing to the formula, and a repetitive, overly elaborate training            mode which actually spoils most of the game.                         The story is pretty standard, cooked up on the first afternoon of            the game's development I'd wager, and sees the player taking on the            role of Vampire Hunter (with optionally playable sidekick) on a            quest to rid a nameless village and the haunting, Dracula-esque            castle overhanging it of their demonic inhabitants. The added twist            being that the Vampire Hunters may cease to exist if they vanquish            all the vamps. There's also an annoying little girl who springs up            at the beginning of the game and tags along - causing trouble for            everybody - and binding together what little plot there is, yelling            things like ~why can't you settle your differences?~ as two            blood-soaked Hunters take on a bizarre amphibious lizard death            monster vampire thing. You can't shoot the little girl though. And            believe me, we tried.                    The idea is to go around blasting enemies until their little green            health bars have depleted. There is no Time Crisis 2-style ducking            and diving gimmick involved here, but there is at least a            reasonable amount of variety in the enemies you face. At first you            come up against simple 'runners', who leap out of nowhere and slice            you unless you can blast them in time, and before long their ranks            swell to include possessed knights, flying demons, weird cackling            magicians that hide in the floor and throw blobs of black oddness            at you upon emerging, and enemies with flamethrowers and huge gas            tanks on their back for you to target, along with five boss            characters.                         Unfortunately, there are also some truly awful enemies who pop up            with infuriating regularity. Take, for instance, the little goblin            bastards who race around your feet and hurl what looks like paint            at your face, or the circular-tunnel-dwelling metallic demons who            spin around in little balls making them almost impossible to mash.            Perhaps most annoying of all though are the balls of lava thrown            into your path by the second boss character, whose gender we have            yet to establish thanks to the peculiar voice acting and ambiguous            character model. These bounce up and down, on and off the screen,            and fly at you from different angles. All must be destroyed, with            precision.                         There are also sections demanding the player to shoot little            octopus look-a-like blobs attached to infected humans. Hitting            these blobs will release infected parties from their unfortunate            curse and tot up a fair amount of points at the end of the mission,            but failure to do so, even by a hair's breadth, will mean the            victim's conversion into a werewolf and a lightning fast attack to            shield yourself from.                    Graphically, Vampire Night is House of the Dead 2 done differently,            although not too differently - the loading screens are almost            identical. First of all you dart around a snowy graveyard shooting            the recently undead, before skating across some glassy, unrippling            water and meeting uninspiring enemies and peasants under the grip            of the werewolf blobs. Levels consist almost entirely of big gothic            castle interiors and exteriors from there on in, although the            fourth ~chapter~ of the game (if this is a book, then it rivals            Spot The Dog) is a nice diversion through an icy world as you take            on the weird vampire Queen.                         Other highlights, if that's an appropriate term, include the            pursuit of the gender-confused vamp we mentioned earlier across            broken bridges and through enormous towers, and being pursued by            the game's first boss (arguably the best), blurring in and out of            sight as you race through the darkened forest towards the castle            and a fight with his alter-ego, a minotaur wannabe with ferocious            horns.                         Graphical detail is quite nice, with destructible suits of armour,            barrels and the like slightly more concealed than usual, but it's            still pretty repetitive in design. And since we're back on the dark            side of the game, we might as well deal with the script and            dialogue. The words ~utterly diabolical~ come to mind. Because            their light gun games are over in a flash, both Sega and Namco seem            to have taken to localising them for the US and European markets            whilst still in Japan, so the voices all sound like Stephen Hawking            meets Stereotypical Japanese Gentleman, with comical emphasis on            all the wrong words - and that's before we get to the script, which            is about as convincing as Harold Shipman's defence lawyer.                    The idea, as with Time Crisis 2, is to encourage replay in pursuit            of higher scores, and there's a bit of deviation in routes through            the game scattered about (often hinging on defeating a particular            enemy before he does something). Ultimately though the repetitive            uninspired gameplay, linearity and atrocious production values            condemn Vampire Night to a grave fate (and score). Shooting things            on the television is obviously fun for a while, but the sheer            number of rounds to pop off is quite enormous and the experience            wears you out quite quickly. Of course, then you figure out 'the            trick'. Instead of pointing the gun off-screen to reload, clutch            either the B button located on the barrel of the gun or the one on            the butt (originally used to duck in and out of scenery in Time            Crisis) and you can reload without moving the crosshair from your            target - welcome to fully automatic weaponry with unlimited ammo.                         Of course, there's more than just a calibration screen and modes            for two players on offer. Technically. Special mode is the same as            the vanilla arcade mode, but you earn pieces of silver and other            special items as you go along with which to purchase more powerful            weapons and accessories. But even if you take on both Arcade and            Special modes, you'll still only lose a couple of hours of your            life.                         Training mode completes the so-called package, inviting you to            practice various skills to three depths of difficulty, but these            gravitate between the insultingly simplistic and the ludicrously            tough, so it's not much fun. Admittedly, you could spend a couple            of hours here, repeatedly shooting enemies and targets and            replaying the boss battles over and over on different difficulty            levels, but there isn't much point, and the hardest task of all is            a level full of those annoying werewolf-spawning octopi, simply            because it requires you to shoot them precisely. Light guns, not to            mention humans, don't always do that, and having to do it over and            over again is not fun.                    Vampire Night is a good enough way to wile away a rainy Sunday            afternoon, and as such it's the perfect rental, but as a            full-priced videogame it's laughable - \u00a315 would be more            reasonable than \u00a335. The developers vary the pace here and            there, injecting some diversionary tactics into proceedings, but            after a while you get completely sick of the whole affair. The most            criminal thing about Vampire Night though is that it's a terrible            waste of a dreamy developmental crossover. We suggest you buy Time            Crisis 2 instead, and don't line the pockets of the people            responsible for this..."}
