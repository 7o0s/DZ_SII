Take Doom, for example. When it first came            out I had a 12Mhz 386, and to get the game to run smoothly I had to            reduce the area of the screen which it actually rendered to the            size of a credit card. Flash forward to 2001. Doom has arrived on            the GameBoy Advance, and some things never change - the game is            still pushing technology to the very limit, the picture is still            the size of a credit card, and the hardware is still struggling to            keep up.                        Doom is probably the most graphically impressive title that we have            seen so far on the GBA. It may lack the gaudy colours and crystal            clarity of Rayman Advance, but it makes up for this with detailed            texturing and sprites which are lifted almost pixel-for-pixel from            the original PC version of the game, although sadly the blood has            been replaced by Nintendo-friendly green gore. The weapons in            particular are beautifully rendered and animated, with the full            selection on offer from brass knuckles and pistol all the way up to            rocket launcher and room-clearing BFG. The eerie sound effects and            cheesy MIDI music stylings of Bobby Prince have also been            beautifully transferred, and classic noises like the roaring of            imps and the awful ripping sound as they claw at your flesh all add            to the atmosphere of the game.                        Unfortunately two things haven't made it on to the GameBoy though -            the all-important boss monsters. Although episode two still ends            well even without a cyberdemon to scare the bejeezus out of you,            the final map is something of an anti-climax. Gone is the giant            robotic spider, and in its place are two rooms full of monsters and            ammunition followed by some pointless unlocking of doors to reach            the exit. The last few levels of Doom were always the weakest, with            an over-reliance on pools of lava, cramped mazes and teleporter            puzzles, and the revamped last level just makes this even more of a            disappointing end to a great game.                    Otherwise the original twenty four levels have been recreated            faithfully for the most part, with only a few obvious changes, none            of which harm the flow of the game. Having said that, a couple of            the maps could really have used more drastic editing. Mount Erebus            in particular suffers from terrible slowdowns in a few places, and            although you can switch off dynamic lighting in the options menu to            get a frame rate boost, this removes all variation in lighting and            kills the atmosphere completely.                        Aside from the occasional frame rate problems though, Doom's short            monster-packed levels and fast paced visceral action work a treat            on Nintendo's hand-held. The ~three keys and an exit~ run-and-gun            gameplay is a little basic by today's standards, and the AI and            storyline are virtually non-existent, but the game makes up for            this with wall-to-wall carnage, a tense atmosphere and plenty of            secret areas to uncover.                        The controls are surprisingly easy to master, with the D-pad            controlling your movement, select bringing up a map, and the A and            B buttons handling running, opening doors, pushing switches, firing            and so forth. You actually have a choice of half a dozen preset            configurations, with the best using the shoulder buttons for            strafing but requiring you to hold down two keys at once to switch            weapons. This can be a little fiddly in the middle of a fight, but            on the bright side having dedicated strafe keys makes circling            around your enemies a doddle with a little practice.                    Dave Palmer and the boys have done a solid job of converting id's            seminal shooter to the GameBoy Advance, with only a few frame rate            issues and the weak ending letting it down. The game itself is            fairly short, but with a choice of four difficulty settings and the            addition of two player co-operative and four player deathmatch            options via the link cable, there's plenty here to keep you coming            back for more.                        -        Doom                    screenshotsDoom                    screenshots"}
