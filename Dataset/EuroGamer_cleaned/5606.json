The ground                 stands as it has done for years, overshadowing the houses                 along its perimeter. Empty coke cans rattle through the                 terraces, and litter skips merrily across the muddy pitch.                    The rusty team emblem swings in the wind, creaking like something            out of a Western movie. Inside a little white make-shift office is            a sad looking man. He sits at a desk, head rested on his arms,            empty whisky bottle to one side.                    He looks up. ~So you're my replacement then? You won't do any            better you know. There's no money you see. I've been in this job            for six years I'll have you know.~ With a tear in his eye, he grabs            his belongings and pushes past you.                    Congratulations you're the new manager. You're the one that has to            take this team by the scruff of the neck and point it in the right            direction. And you can do all this in            Football World            Manager 2000 from            UbiSoft.         Football management games are                 two a penny these days it has to be said, and any game in this                 genre is going to have to be something special to succeed.                    FWM has all the usual features you would associate with this genre,            boasting over 29,000 players, 95 divisions, 1400 clubs and 71            countries. This is an incredible volume of data to handle. If the            game is to get past first base with me the data crunching has to be            kept to a minimum, and the game must not take too long doing it!                    FWM is excellent in this respect, providing one of the fastest            processing engines yet seen in a comprehensive footie management            sim. The speed at which the data is processed is both a blessing            and a curse though.                    On the one hand, yes it's great that you are not dawdling around            waiting for the next game. However, there's something rather            pertinent about the gaps between play. This is a football            simulation, where you have to take great care in selecting the            right players for the upcoming game. The longer the game takes to            process the more nail biting it can be.                    With FWM you only have two options - either you can watch the game            played through naturally, taking about a minute per game, or click            a button to finish it instantly. Personally I prefer the options            Championship Manager 99/00 gives you, where you have different            speeds at which matches can be played out.         The game itself                 is icon driven and, as the manual states, nothing is more than                 two clicks away. Team lists appear in Explorer type formation,                 making it easy to find your way around, and the interface as a                 whole is top notch and easy to use. A lot of intelligent                 design has gone into it.                    Strangely though the whole game only operates in one static window.            There's no window re-size option and, much to my annoyance, no            full-screen option. I like my games to fill the screen, not float            Minesweeper style on my desktop!                    FWM's interface makes team selection, finances, transfers and all            the usual options a breeze. You have various people on your staff            roster who you need to keep in touch with, and who will sometimes            give you juicy bits of info which could help you in your next match            and beyond.                    Your Head Coach and Assistant Manager are of particular use,            reporting to you on the progress or failures of your players, and            providing suggestions for improvement. You can rely on your own            judgements if you wish, but your staff will make life easier for            you. Don't ignore them!         You can                 actually watch highlights of the games in FWM, which is a                 refreshing change, though the quality of the graphics used is                 poor to say the least. Still, I suppose it gives you something                 to watch, rather than getting the results instantly.                    Menu icons, and general screen layout is very nice. There's nothing            that can't be found easily, and you get to learn the different icon            meanings quickly. I didn't like the still graphics on the title            screens though, I would have preferred proper player mug-shots and            piccies of real-life action.                    Each menu has its own background sound, ranging from the telephone            rings of the Manager menu, through to footballs being kicked in the            Player screens. The crowd noise during the match display is            disappointing, and along with the poor graphics makes it all look            like an after thought.                    A nice touch though is the newspaper report screen, which is the            first thing you see after every update. This tells you graphically            the latest goings on in all the leagues. Yes, there is a paper            covering every single country!                    Way over the top, but smart nonetheless.         This game will be great for those                 people new to football simulations as a starter. For the more                 seasoned veterans amongst you though you may find the whole                 thing a tad on the basic side.                    The fact that you are stuck in a non-sizeable window infuriates me,            and goes a long way towards spoiling the game for me. Putting this            aside though, the game is extremely well presented and you are            never found searching high and low for one particular option.                    There are a couple of minor bugs which I've not mentioned until            now, merely because they're not that serious. One worth mentioning,            more for humour's sake, is that currently the news system is            telling me that I've won the Auto-Glass trophy and English Cup! The            thing is .. I got knocked out in the first round, and the paper is            still saying congratulations a season and a half on! Whoops.                    Football World Manager is a competent enough simulation, but one            which I won't be coming back to. It's a good introduction to the            Football Management Sim world for sure, but with the superior            Championship Manager 99/00 now available for \u00a319.99 from most            outlets, I have trouble recommending this game.                        -        EuroLeague                    Football previewEuroLeague                    Football preview                    Championship Manager 99/00 review                    Championship Manager 99/00 review            Further your enjoyment!
