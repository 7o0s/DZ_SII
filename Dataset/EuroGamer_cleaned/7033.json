All of            the action took place within the dojos of the Commodore 64 home            computer, where gamers stared at their screens with bloodshot eyes            and joystick incurred blisters on their hands.                    Needless to say if you are a veteran of International Karate from            it's 8-bit birth, you will no doubt be relishing the idea of this            game being freshened up and brought bang up-to-date on your GameBoy            Colour. It is actually quite ironic that IK has been ported over as            only a while back I was compiling a list of 8-bit games I would            like to see ported, and IK was top of my list.                    IK on the Commodore 64 had me chained in it's web of addiction for            months, so does the GBC version capture and maintain the hugely            playable standards of it's ancient brother? It most certainly does,            and then some.             The premise behind            International Karate 2000 is simple - pick a fighter, and do battle            with all manner of opponents to win the coveted black belt. Once            you have beaten all that oppose you do not think you can rest, as            you will have to prove yourself once and for all to Sensei, the            master. Once you have defeated Sensei you have completed the game.            Simple? Not exactly.                    To make matters that much harder for you each opponent has            differing skills in all departments. Where one guy will have an            excellent defence, the next opponent you face may have a lousy            defence but a devastatingly accurate 'roundhouse' kick to watch out            for. To further trouble you in your route to glory is the fact that            as the tournament wears on so your opponents become more adept. A            strategy needs to be worked out, as some players become            unbelievably good when competing for the black belt, where others            are much easier to take out.                    You begin by selecting which of the twelve fighters you want to            take control of, and to assist you with this choice there is a list            of all fighters in the manual complete with their favoured move and            fighting style. Once selected you will be taken to the world map            where you will be selecting your next opponents later on, but for            your first fight you don't get a choice.                    The idea is to kick, punch or even headbutt your opponent such that            his energy level depletes to zero, after which you are awarded            match points which are determined by the quality of your knockout            blow. A full point is awarded for a full on blow, and a half point            for a glancing shot. The round is over when you or your opponent            reaches three points, or when the timelimit expires. Whoever has            the most points after the times up wins the round, or if the points            are level the round is drawn and has to be fought again, with the            first to two round wins taking the match.                    After each fight you have a bonus stage, which will be either            deflecting bouncing balls or side-kicking bombs. Bouncing balls            come at you from left and right, at differing heights, with the            occasionally flashing random bounce ball, with their speed ever            increasing in later stages. For the bombs it is a simple matter of            side-sweep kicking them off the screen before they explode, or            avoiding the shrapnel if they do. Successfully deflect all of the            balls or bombs and you will receive a score points award, fail and            you don't win anything and you go on to choose your next opponent.         Your fighter has a            great variety of moves available to him, including high, mid and            low kicks, with an impressive array of punches to combine with            them. Probably the most satisfying of kicks to execute is the            'roundhouse', but if you can perform the rather more difficult            'flying kick' you will soon be slaying all that step in your way!                    Controlling is smooth, though you do find the directional key            governed selection of the kick and punches to be a little haphazard            sometimes, requiring a definite key press for them to happen. This            particularly shows itself up when you are attempting the 'high            kick' or 'face punch' manoeuvres which need you to press the up key            in combination with the A or B key.                    Apart from that controlling this game is a dream, providing some            superb fast and frantic match-ups that will have your palms            sweating and GameBoy screen misting up. Beware of thumb ache also,            I fully advise a five-minute rest in-between fights, as my thumb is            still hurting now two days after a particularly long IK2000            session.             Graphically they            have kept the side-on scrolling as featured in the original, but            have given the fighters a far more solid look. Animation is            splendid with all the moves excellently displayed, and it almost            makes you deliberately somersault the fighter to see just how good            it is. Never once does the action slow down, ensuring continuity to            the fights.                    With each fight located at different parts of the world, you will            not be surprised to hear that all the backgrounds feature key            locations to each country. In Egypt you fight against a backdrop of            pyramids, in Sydney the opera house, and in London, Big Ben looms            above the fighters. You get the idea! All of the backdrops look            great, and more importantly don't clash at all with the action            going on in the foreground.                    Possibly the aspect of IK2000 that got me smiling the most was the            music. The songs featured are those used in the original, and they            belt out in a true Commodore 64 style warble. The sound effects            during the fights are also rather good with lots of Bruce Lee style            slapping sounds and grunts of pain.             This game for me            is what I have been waiting for on the GameBoy Colour, with its            superb graphics, hard hitting sounds and gameplay straight from the            old school of gaming. It is raw gameplay like this that can keep a            man addicted for months on end, and IK2000 is difficult enough to            provide hours more play even when you have won all there is to win.                    I cannot recommend this title enough; you simply have to have it in            your GBC collection. A little piece of gaming history gets a fresh            airing, and boy is it good to have it back."}
