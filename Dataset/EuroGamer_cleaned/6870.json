After the events of the            first game, Raziel has emerged from the Chronoplast time portal in            his relentless pursuit of Kain, and returns to various eras of            Nosgoth's past, confronting the mysteries of Nosgoth's ancient            races and the secrets behind the corruption of the Pillars and the            vampire genocide. Dimly lit memories of his past egg Raziel on and,            as the game's literature puts it, his destiny comes full circle as            his personal vendetta is transformed into a hero's journey, with            the fate of Nosgoth hanging in the balance. Melodramatic to say the            least.                         For those who don't know, Raziel is an ancient vampire, one of            Kain's first brood. A former lieutenant to the mighty Kain, Raziel            was eventually condemned after he dared to commit an unforgiveable            transgression. For sprouting wings - a step which took him further            up the evolutionary ladder than Kain - Raziel was punished with            eternal damnation and all that, and dumped into Nosgoth's deepest            lake by the wrath of Kain's remaining lieutenants. With much of his            flesh burnt away and blue fire shooting from his eyes and mouth,            Raziel found himself in the seat of the Underworld, where a            mysterious god revived him. After being transformed into the Soul            Reaver, Raziel emerged as an angel of death, galvanized by a hunger            for revenge and the treacherous souls of his fellow vampires. And            so on.                    Soul Reaver 2 has much in common with its predecessor. A bit            over-furnished in the storyline department, it's the rich tale of a            power struggle with all the trimmings. The game is played from the            third person perspective, requiring equal skills in the areas of            conflict and puzzle-solving, and runs to over twelve hours of            gameplay all things considered. Although it feels the same at            first, a number of subtle changes have been made to the formula.            Like Raziel, Soul Reaver 2 has evolved into a greater being.            Puzzles no longer consist of increasingly tricky block formations,            but take on a much broader shape. New problems for the player to            solve are extremely diverse, often using environmental variables            like light and shadow. This time around they have an almost            Half-Life-like fluency to them.                         As an introduction to the Kain legacy, Soul Reaver 2 is an            excellent game. Players will gain much from a bit of past            experience with the series, but failing that the Soul Reaver 2 disc            also includes a few DVD-style extras, including the History of            Nosgoth text, which will fill in a lot of the blanks. In keeping            with the trend of recent PS2 games towards including bonus            materials, there is a new preview feature on Blood Omen 2 amongst            the extras, along with amusing out-takes from the game's voice            actors. It's nice to see them screw up their faces in embarrassment            at some of the lines too!                         The package as a whole reeks of superb presentation, and that's            carried over into the game world. Enemies and puzzles are            encountered at reasonable junctures, and slipping between the Real            and Ethereal worlds is no longer as chaotic as in the first game,            making the adventure a lot less hair-raising in places. That said,            in places the game has gone from intimidating to pussycat. Despite            facing countless hordes and running into some truly sticky            situations, I can't have died and restarted more than a handful of            times\u2026                    Interface tweaks and engine tuning account for some of the rest of            my favourite bits. Fear of getting lost is a thing of the past            thanks to Raziel's compass and map, which can be an indubitable aid            when you're wondering about that next objective. Controlling Raziel            is fairly simple, but changes to his repertoire of moves deserve            attention. Apart from the usual skills like walking, running,            jumping, hovering, swimming and such, Raziel can also make use of            any weapons that happen to be lying around. Weapons turn up all            over the place, but the Soul Reaver itself remains with you at all            times. It overheats after a while, which causes you to lose some of            your health, so raiding corpses and plundering the undergrowth for            a fresh supply of slaughter is never a bad idea. If nothing shows            up Raziel can always resort to hand-to-claw, and he's quite capable            of a little mortal combat.                         Fighting in Soul Reaver 2 is second to none. R1 targets an enemy            and can be released and reapplied, allowing you to lay waste to            anybody on the screen that takes your fancy. Once targeted, Raziel            can circle and avoid his enemy's attacks by strafing. This advanced            manoeuvrability allows him to appear all over the shop, confusing            the attacker and allowing Raziel to land some serious blows.            Compared to the relatively cumbersome original, this system is a            godsend. Along with some of his larger opponents, Raziel is also            capable of pulling off specialist moves, combinations and even the            odd finishing move. Collision detection does its best to mar the            otherwise exciting finishing moves, but you can't take the            satisfaction out of a good decapitation.                    Visually and aurally Soul Reaver 2 is as accomplished a PS2 game as            I have seen. There is a not-quite-Metal Gear Solid 2-but-almost            level of CG usage, but the story makes up the very core of Crystal            Dynamics' game, which is more excuse for it than Kojima had.            Excellent (if a little candid) voice-acting coupled with some truly            stunning CG makes up for whatever annoyance its presence causes.            What did you expect them to fill the DVD up with after all?            After a stunning intro sequence the cutscenes don't die down, but            reasonable load times make this a pleasant rather than unwelcome            intrusion.                         Of course, compared to his PSX predecessor Raziel is a high-end            model, boasting some 3,000 polygons along with the rest of the            major characters in the game. The usually lightning fast framerate            comes as a surprise, and it does a good job of accentuating            Raziel's fetid state. Not since Silent Hill 2 have I encountered a            game quite so gruesomely ornate. Particle and light effects come            into play in a lot of areas and, combined with stained glass            windows and water sources, fill the game with an eerie, if not            occasionally vibrant, cascade of colours. The PlayStation 2 is            hardly a texture monster though, and as such it does look a little            worn in places. In large areas the framerate sometimes takes a hit            too.                         One of the best looking PS2 games is also one of the best            sounding. I've already mentioned the excellent voice-acting            (with real, even recognizable, actors like Rene Auberjonis of Odo /            Deep Space Nine fame), but the sound effects and music are            something else. I can't even begin to describe it, but if anybody            can design a score to fit a story of vampire genocide and preaching            damnation, Crystal Dynamics can. Like everything else about this            game, it contributes to an outstanding whole.                    For fans of the original, Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver 2 is a dream            come true. It's amuch better game than its predecessor, built from            the ground up with a strong story element, and although extremely            linear in places, it's an adventure well worth partaking of,            whether you're a grizzled veteran or a newcomer to the series.            Although occasionally a bit too balanced, allowing the            action to let up more than one might expect, and despite a sum            total of no replay value, Crystal Dynamics have created one of the            finest examples of a third person action adventure game on any            system. If I had to choose between this and something like Abe's            Oddysee, I know where I would be.                        -        The                    Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver 2 screenshotsThe                    Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver 2 screenshots"}
