He will bring to life the great King of                 the Mongols. Before and after war reigns happily.~                    That's the cheerful message you get on first running            Urban            Chaos! It's coming to the end of the millennium in Union City,            and crime is at an unprecedented high. You play Officer D'arci            Stern, a rookie cop assisting the already weakening police force in            quelling the increasing crime wave.                    It's bedlam, with murder, vandalism, joy riding and even suicides a            daily occurrence. There's a strange feeling about it all, a feeling            that there's something more to all of this. Maybe someone else            pulling the strings.                    And it's down to you to thwart the spread of evil throughout Union            City. With the assistance of informants like Deeks, the stranger            Roper and other characters, you will slowly come to realise that            routine crime is barely just the start of it. You need all your            wits about you if you are to prevent Urban Chaos...         Before you                 can head out on to the streets you need to perform some                 mandatory training. First up you need to complete an assault                 course. This teaches you to jump, climb, and even how to use a                 zip-line to slide to otherwise inaccessible locations. You                 need to finish this course within a certain amount of time.                    You will then be taken for combat training. This will teach you the            basic kicks and punches that D'Arci can perform. You spar against            real targets, and get to perform the wonderful triple kick or punch            moves. You will also learn how to slide tackle your enemy, which            will allow you to perform arrests without the loss of ammo or            energy.                    In theory!         Now                 that basic training is out of the way it's time to get mean on                 the streets.                    Urban Chaos is mission based, and the tasks laid out for you can            range from preventing someone from committing suicide to taking out            a gang Kingpin. The game is only saved upon mission completion,            which gives it a refreshing console-like feel.                    There's enough variety in the missions to keep interest flowing,            even though the terrain doesn't exactly alter that much throughout            the game. And you will soon be finding your own favourite way of            taking the enemy down, mine being a triple punch, knee in guts and            arrest combination... Nice!                    The enemies themselves aren't that bright when it comes to combat,            but their ability to chase after you is pretty impressive. If you            scale a ladder thinking this will lose a persistent assailant, they            will follow. This can provide great entertainment, as you can hear            their footfalls on the ladder steps. As soon as their head pops            into view, let loose with your choice of weapon.                    In fact, unless the enemy has a gun they really aren't that            difficult to nail. Sometimes when you get three or four of them            attacking you one might clobber you to the floor. This is where you            can lose a lot of energy, as they stamp on you while you're down!                    A single gunman is easy to take down though - simply running up to            him and kicking will suffice. And most of the early enemies will be            armed with baseball bats, knives, pistols, or just bare fists.            Later on things get more difficult, when they are armed with            shotguns and M16 assault rifles...                    The combat system isn't without its problems though. Far too often            you will knock a guy to the floor but won't have the time to make            the full arrest. The problem with this is that sometimes the game            keeps the floored guy as your main target, and however hard you try            you can't switch to that other guy who is pumping you full of lead!                    This can lead to immense frustration if you are near the end of a            mission and this quirk is the cause of the mission failure.         Unfortunately                 there isn't a vast array of weaponry at your disposal in Urban                 Chaos, but there is enough to get you by.                    You begin most missions with only your fists for company. The            Beretta Pistol is a weapon you will nearly always have through an            enemy discarding it. It takes about three or four shots to snuff            out a victim though, so it isn't the best weapon for a quick            killing.                    Things start getting interesting with the shotgun. This truly is an            awesome version of the weapon that every game should have. It gives            out a satisfying blast, and knocks the enemy off their feet            realistically.                    The M16 assault rifle is very effective for the decimation of            entire gangs, but chews up ammo like there's no tomorrow. Grenades            are also found on later levels, but I found these overly difficult            to aim.                    Close combat is not all fists either, as you can arm yourself with            the very damaging knife or, if sheer brutality is your game, then a            baseball bat should cater for your needs.                    There are also explosives to use, but they are generally for            mission critical use only. You can of course plant one underneath a            vehicle for a laugh though!         The game takes on a third                 person perspective, and similarities are bound to be drawn                 between Urban Chaos and Tomb Raider.                    The world you romp around is very impressive indeed. I liken it to            running around the levels of the old 16-bit classic Syndicate,            which like Urban Chaos has a very Blade Runner theme to it all.                    I tried to run it at 800x600 resolution and found it to crawl along            in certain areas, and you can forget 1024x768. Eventually I settled            for 640x480 and the game still looks gorgeous, and more importantly            runs smoothly with virtually no slow downs.                    The video at the start of the game is excellent, setting the scene            nicely. The cut scenes all use the in-game graphics engine, but            most can be skipped past if you are persistently failing the            missions.                    To guide you to the various key locations and the location of the            enemy you have a scanner in the bottom left hand corner. This also            shows you how much energy and stamina you have left, along with the            current weapon you are using in icon form.                    Music is used intelligently within the game, only cropping up when            you are going into battle, approaching a key scene in a mission, or            running at full pelt. It's nice to play a game that doesn't just            have a CD track droning on in the background.                    Atmospheric sounds like the distant honk of a car horn or a dog            barking give a sense of life going on around you. The sounds that            accompany a fight are comical though, with real Batman type            ~thwacking~ sounds and short one-line quips from either D'Arci or            your enemy, and hearing some of the guys wail like a baby as you            pummel them is very amusing.         Urban Chaos is a blast! Right from the first mission it                 had me hooked, wanting to find out what forces were behind the                 city's anarchy. All I will say is that they are a strange                 bunch.                    Playing Urban Chaos gives you a great feeling of really being in a            run-down city. Litter blows through the streets, which are alive            with people going about their business. And yes, it is possible to            mow down innocent civilians with your M16, before you ask!                    There are some annoying glitches in the game engine though, where            some platforms are impossible to walk on to unless you jump or even            back flip on to them. However, the next time you visit the same            platform it will be working as it should... Bizarre.                    The lack of networking options may be a factor in your purchase as            well. But to be honest, with single player gameplay this good, you            won't be worrying.
