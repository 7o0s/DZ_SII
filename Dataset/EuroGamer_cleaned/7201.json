Four            inches can make a world of difference. Move up from a 15~ to a 19~            monitor, for example, and there is no going back...         Well, if you're a hardcore gamer you may already have one of            the latest generation of graphics card like the Riva TNT2 or 3dfx's            Voodoo 3. These cards are capable of some rather ridiculous            resolutions, and the next generation are likely to be even more            excessive in their pixel-pushing prowess.                    But that's no use to you unless you have a large monitor - most 15~            monitors will only stretch to a pitiful 1024x768. The Belinea 10 60            20 on the other hand runs happily at 1280x1024, and can go as high            as 1600x1200 if you have a graphics card that can handle it.                    And if you do something other than play games on your computer, a            higher resolution desktop can also be rather handy, and the bigger            monitor size means you'll be straining your eyes less. Going up            from 1024x768 to 1280x1024 might not sound like much, but it's            giving you two thirds more pixels. That's a lot of real estate...                    Of course, size does have its disadvantages as well. The monitor is            about half a meter along each side, meaning you need a big strong            desk to fit it on. It's also bloody heavy! Lugging 20Kg of monitor            up a staircase only a couple of inches wider than the box wasn't            much fun. This isn't the kind of monitor that you can easily pack            into the back of your car and take to a LAN party every month,            unless you have a lot of big hard mates to help move it...         One word - price.                    At around the \u00a3300 mark from most mail order companies and            online stores, the Belinea 10 60 20 is \u00a350 to \u00a3100            cheaper than most other 19~ monitors. I got mine from for just over            \u00a3250, and that's including VAT and shipping.                    So if it's so much cheaper than other 19~ monitors, surely there's            something wrong with it? Well, not really, no. The Belinea can            handle desktop sizes from 640x480 to 1600x1200, just like any other            19~ monitor, and has a perfectly adequate 0.26mm dot pitch and            150Mhz bandwidth.                    Even at 1600x1200 the picture is sharp with virtually no visible            flickering, although at that high a resolution reading small text            can be a bit of an eye strainer. But then, that's no different to            any other 19~ monitor - you have to go up to a 21~ to really make            the most of a 1600x1200 desktop, and 21~ monitors cost twice as            much.                    Game-wise 1600x1200 works a treat as long as your graphics card can            take the strain, and if you have a good one like a Matrox G400 or a            Riva TNT2, that shouldn't be a problem.         The            monitor is controlled by a system that isn't immediately intuitive,            but does make a certain amount of sense once you've read the            manual.                    The two grey arrows on either side of the central button don't            actually do anything - they're just there to look pretty. Instead            you press the ~Menu/Exit~ button to bring up the menu and then use            a wheel underneath it to scroll through the options. The wheel is a            bit dodgy - occasionally you turn it one notch and it moves the            menu selection two notches. But generally it works well.                    Hit enter to select an option, then use the wheel again to adjust            its settings. Hit enter again when you're finished and the setting            will be saved. Hitting the ~Menu/Exit~ button again will close the            menu - a big improvement on my old 15~ monitor where you had to            wait several seconds for the menu to close itself...                    All the usual functions are here - brightness and contrast,            horizontal and vertical size and position, various options to slant            and squash your display, tilt (though sadly it only tilts a few            degrees each way, so you can't panic people by turning their            display on its side), and degaussing.                    There's also a ~Moire~ function to correct distorted images, and an            option to restore all the settings to the factory defaults if you            do something silly. You can control the ~color temperature~, switch            power saving on and off, check the horizontal and vertical            frequencies of your current resolution, and even adjust where on            the screen the control menu appears. Which is nice.                    A rather more useful feature is that each screen resolution has its            own individual settings. So if you have your desktop set to            1280x1024 and play games at 1024x768 for example, you can have            different settings for each, and the monitor will automatically            switch settings when it switches resolutions.                    This can be annoying at first, as you have to adjust every            resolution seperately the first time you use it, and if your            monitor is anything like mine all the default vertical size            settings will be slightly off. But once you've got every resolution            set up to your satisfaction you shouldn't need to adjust anything            again, however often you switch resolutions, so in the long run            it's actually quite handy.                    The Belinea 10 60 20 seems fairly rugged. I haven't tried dropping            it out of my window, mostly because I'm worried that I'd damage the            pavement outside, but it looks solid enough and survived my            manhandling it up the stairs to my study.                    Energy-wise the monitor swallows up to 150W during use. That's 50%            more than my old 15~ monitor, and a lot of that seems to come out            of the holes in the top as hot air. Leave it running for a few            hours and you can use it to cook your dinner...                    The monitor also comes with an impressive looking manual.            Impressive until you open it up and realise that it's actually the            same half dozen pages translated into every language except Urdu -            15 of them in all. Still, it tells you just about everything you'll            need to know to use the monitor, and if you speak Magyar you'll no            doubt appreciate having the manual in your native language...                    If you're a hardcore gamer looking to make the most out of your            graphics card, or if you use your computer for more serious work            and need a high resolution desktop, you really need a large            monitor.                    Even at \u00a3300 the Belinea 10 60 20 is cheaper than many 17~            monitors, and if you can find it for \u00a3250 like I did then it's            a real bargain. Unless you have the money to spend on a 21~ monitor            (which cost anything from about \u00a3600 on up), the Belinea 10 60            20 is an ideal choice for both gaming and ~serious~ work - dirt            cheap, but solidly built and fully featured."}
