Essentially Westwood have taken the lone wolf missions from the            million selling real-time strategy series and given you a ground            floor view of the action.                        Playing as the elite GDI commando Havoc you get to rampage your way            through NOD lines, dealing with kidnapped scientists, hideous            experiments, tiberium mutants and tactical nuclear strikes along            the way. Settings vary from the rubble-strewn streets of an            occupied village to the coastal defences of a NOD stronghold, and            although the graphics are fairly primitive by modern standards they            do an adequate job of bringing the C&C world to life in 3D for            the first time.                        Missions typically begin with a pre-rendered briefing from your            commanding officer aboard a GDI ship, although things rarely go            according to plan and you will find yourself bombarded with            additional objectives from the moment you hit the ground. Radio            messages from your CO, local resistance fighters and other GDI            units come thick and fast, and you'll find yourself being            sidetracked to rescue trapped soldiers, take out SAM sites and blow            up power plants along the way to your primary objective. Luckily a            vast array of weapons is available to help you make it to the end            in one piece, from your basic pistol and assault rifle to            flamethrowers, chainguns, lasers, explosives and personal ion            cannons. There's even a rather tasty sniper rifle, allowing you to            pick off enemies from a safe distance.                    But however good the idea behind Renegade, the actual            implementation varies from merely shoddy to downright atrocious.            The game has evidently been programmed by a troupe of poorly            trained circus chimps and the AI gives a whole new meaning to the            word ~stupid~, making the braindead units of the original Command            & Conquer look like Albert Einstein by comparison.                        Enemy soldiers seem to follow a philosophy of ~if I can't see you,            you can't see me~, as a result of which they sometimes ignore you            completely as you blast away at an exposed arm or leg from around a            corner, or shoot them in the back as they reverse into you. This            problem is even worse when it comes to vehicles, because if they            can't find a way to reach you they simply stop dead and sit there            impassively as you pump rockets into an exposed corner of their            bodywork from the comfort of your hiding place.                        In some of the missions you have the misfortune to find yourself            fighting alongside other GDI troops, and they turn out to be just            as incompetent. The AI has no sense of self preservation, and            soldiers will quite happily wander into the line of fire and then            stand there getting toasted without even bothering to shoot back.            While this just looks incredibly stupid most of the time, if your            mission is to escort an NPC to the exit and he keeps running off            ahead of you and getting shot, it soon becomes frustrating.                    Westwood have compensated for the stupidity of their NOD troops by            giving them powerful weapons and near perfect aim and then throwing            vast numbers of them at you, particularly in the later stages of            the game. This can make things incredibly difficult, especially as            snipers and rocket troops can take you out in one or two shots, and            as a result the developers have had to pad almost every room with            health, armour and ammunition to keep you alive.                        The maps themselves are often completely linear, leading you from            one mob of enemies to the next with little opportunity for detours            along the way. Side roads are conveniently blocked off with            barricades, and despite being a highly trained special forces type,            Havoc is so feeble he can't clamber his way over a crate, jump more            than a few inches off the ground or swim across the shallowest            puddle. This means that areas which would be easily accessible in            any other first person shooter are beyond reach in Renegade,            leaving you feeling penned in.                        Adding some variety to the proceedings is the inclusion of            vehicles, but again you are limited in where you can take them by            the level design and only a handful are actually driveable in the            single player campaign. The controls are simple enough - look            around and aim the gun with your mouse and turn, accelerate and            reverse with the standard movement keys - but something about the            soggy physics and bland sound effects makes the vehicles seem            insubstantial, so you never really feel like you're rumbling around            in a mammoth tank.                    Renegade's saving grace should have been its multiplayer support,            with the innovative Command & Conquer mode effectively putting            you into the middle of a first person real-time strategy game with            up to 32 players. You can explore a full-scale C&C base,            purchase vehicles to drive (from mobile artillery and stealth tanks            to humvees and flamethrowers) and watch AI-controlled harvesters as            they drive out to mine tiberium, adding extra credits to your            team's income.                        Each side has its own unique selection of units, and players can            cash in credits to switch to a more advanced troop class, from            rocket soldiers and snipers to characters from the single player            campaign, each with their own primary weapon and a pistol and            explosives for backup. You can even become an engineer and run            around repairing buildings, vehicles and other players. Ultimately            the goal is to destroy the enemy base, and the loss of each            building has much the same effect as it would have in a traditional            C&C game, reducing the speed at which vehicles are produced,            narrowing the choice of troop types available, disabling defensive            turrets or decreasing the team's cash flow.                        Unfortunately Westwood have managed to foul up the network code as            well, making Renegade a rather laggy experience at the moment. I've            only ever found one server which consistently reports a ping of            under 100ms, even though I have a normally reliable 512kbps cable            modem connection. Most of the best servers are constantly full, and            even with a relatively low ping players tend to warp around a bit            at times, making sniping difficult. When the lag gets any worse you            can end up being dragged backwards across the map or suddenly find            yourself outside a building you just entered because the server            lost track of your movement. And then there's the occasional random            crashes, server drop-outs, unexplained disconnections...                    To say that Renegade is disappointing would be a masterful            understatement. The single player game is marred by incompetent AI,            poor mission balance and some very linear maps, while the promising            C&C mode is let down by dodgy network code. If Westwood can fix            the multiplayer problems then it could be a lot of fun online, but            in the meantime this is a game which is well worth avoiding for all            but the most forgiving of Command & Conquer fans.                        -        Renegade                    preview (October 2001)                Renegade                    preview (October 2001)                Renegade                    preview (September 1999)                Renegade                    preview (September 1999)                Renegade                    screenshotsRenegade                    screenshots"}
