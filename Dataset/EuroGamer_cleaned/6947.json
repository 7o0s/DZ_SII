There's nothing fancy about Kururin, it's just pure            Japanese lunacy, and incredibly addictive with it. The developer            has attempted something resembling a storyline, which has            absolutely no bearing on the game and is just there for            completeness' sake.                         Basically, a mother duck has lost her 10 baby ducklings (at            least... I think they're ducks), and it's up to you as            Kururin the swirly-headed duck to take flight in your curiously            slow-moving helicopter and find each of your brothers and sisters.            This all equates to a game which involves you piloting a spinning            stick around narrow mazes trying to avoid the walls... like I said:            lunacy. To liken it to something real world, you should think of            those games at fairgrounds where you have to negotiate a metal wand            around a curving metal bar without touching it, and it offers the            same kind of adrenaline rush as people tend to duck and weave as            they play.                         The main portion of the game is the Adventure mode which takes you            on a linear route through 11 different ~worlds~ each comprised of            several circuits to navigate. The journey begins in a short 5-level            training section just to show you the ropes of controlling your            stick, however you pick up extra tips during short mission            briefings once you set out on your way. The task of finding your            siblings isn't always as simple as passing through the level            carefully, and as the mazes become far more complex and tricky to            traverse you find yourself having to search hard for them.                         The learning curve from start to finish is a wonderfully crafted            slope, with levels starting from the pitifully easy to the            downright infuriating.                    Graphically the game is almost sickeningly cheerful, packed to the            gills with colourful epilepsy-inducing setpieces and cute animated            backgrounds, but it doesn't particularly push the GBA to its limits            which is especially important for the Versus mode. In this, you get            to take on up to four friends using just the one cart and link-up            cables in races around any of the 50 smaller ~challenge~ levels,            which are also available in a single-player challenge mode.                         As if simply getting from one end of the mazes to another wasn't            enough, you can also try and set time-trial records on every single            level in the game, and it's on this that the game harnesses some            precious longevity, as it's utterly compelling to keep going back            and try to beat your own, your friends or the pre-set times.                         Also throughout your journey, you occasionally come across small            flashing icons which contain upgrades for your stick which don't            actually serve to help your quest in any way, only to make your            rotating rod of wonder more eye-catching. These upgrades include            the ability to change the shape from straight to wavy or to give it            a fetching coat of hearts, and you can also apply a variety of            paintjobs to add a bit more interest - for some reason it becomes            absolutely crucial to locate every single one of the powerups in            order to feel fulfilled, and the ability to backtrack to earlier            levels in case you missed one enables you to do just that.                    There isn't another puzzle game available on the GBA at the moment            that can rival KuruKuru Kururin for its sheer addictiveness and            fun-value. It's a fantastic example of quick fix gaming at its            finest, and you'll undoubtably keep coming back to it as much as we            do. As one of the distinguished launch titles for the GBA, it            shouldn't be ignored by anyone and particularly not first time            buyers. This is an essential purchase.                        -        The Portable Avant-GardeThe Portable Avant-Garde"}
