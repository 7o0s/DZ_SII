Time            sure does fly when you are having fun!                    If you had to name three games that are guaranteed to be released            close to Christmas you would choose FIFA, the next Lara Croft            adventure, and of course the latest update to the Championship            Manager series. This is without doubt the most successful football            management simulation on the PC, constantly outdoing and improving            over its closest competitors. So can you expect to see a completely            new menu system, enhanced graphics, and maybe even FIFA style            in-game footage? Not on your life mister!                    CM00/01 is not a brand new game, but more of a data disk,            continuing on from where last year's 99/00 edition left off. Not            much has changed, but not much needed to be changed, and it is            still the same life-sappingly addictive game, just with a few added            refinements. Those of you that are veterans of the series will be            instantly familiar and at home with the way the game operates, but            the nice thing is that by maintaining a uniform format through the            game it makes it just as easy for someone who is new to the series            to leap in as it is for the die-hards.         Your first task is to select the football team you are going            to manage, which can be any of the teams from the Premier,            Nationwide or Conference leagues as far as the English sides are            concerned. It doesn't stop there though, with the ability to choose            from virtually every league you can think of throughout the globe!                    If you are a glutton for punishment, or simply want your seasons to            last a whole lot longer, you can opt to manage more than one team            at a time under different guises. Unfortunately you still can't            take control of any of the teams lower than the Conference league,            but you can scour them for talent and snap them up for nominal            fees. This can be an excellent and inexpensive way of bolstering            your side if the team you have taken control of is riddled with            injuries or suspensions, or if you just don't have a big squad.                    The difficulty level has certainly increased in CM00/01, where I            have so far not been massively successful in my management efforts.            The game is logical though, and taking control of Arsenal or            Manchester United provides possibly the easiest of routes to            success. To appreciate the game fully you really should try taking            control of a Conference team though. Previously guiding them up            through the leagues was a reasonably easy task to perform, but now            you will need strong management skills to succeed.                    Commentary speed was something I always used to ramp up to the            fastest to get the games over with more rapidly in previous            versions of the game. Now I find that it is almost a necessity to            watch each match at the normal speed to work out problem areas in            the team, or to weed out the weak player who is bringing the rest            down. It is extremely satisfying to make mid-game decisions that            actually have an effect on the outcome of the match, and equally            depressing for the decision to make things even worse!                    I may be paranoid, but I am also finding I have to pay far more            attention to the numerous player statistics than I did before.            Buying a player that has a full twenty rating for shooting, you            would be thinking you have got yourself a match winner. But not            when his passing and teamwork attributes are about as useful as a            chocolate teacup!         One                 of the most impressive additions to the game though has to be                 the interaction with the national and regional media, along                 with football web-sites. It gives the game that extra buzz to                 have the media questioning your recent signings, or asking for                 your comments about a first team player's age. You get to                 choose whether you agree, disagree or have no comment for                 them, remembering that it is not just the press this effects,                 but the player's morale also.                    Leagues are now calculated live as your game is in progress, which            enables you to see at a glance how well the teams above you are            doing. If they are losing and you need the win to take top spot,            you then know to increase the attacking nature of your side to            secure the points. Another really useful addition is your staff's            ability to provide feedback on all of your players, including            reserve team members. The physio and coaches will all give their            opinions on any player you select, and from here you can assess            whether to keep the player on or sell him at the next available            opportunity.                    I think one of the most fun new features though is being able to            complain about the referees! Should you have lost the last game due            to a dubious 90th minute penalty decision, you can now get your            revenge by filing a report against the ref! You can also ask to            postpone and rearrange fixtures, which can be useful should your            friendly and league match schedule be affecting player stamina and            causing injuries.         It's a little unfair to judge this game on its graphics                 and sound, as that's not what Championship Manager is all                 about, so I feel it more pertinent to provide an overview of                 the presentation.                    The game works around a text based menu system with still            background graphics of various footballing heroes to spice things            up. Every effort has been made to make the interface as simple as            possible to navigate, with very few moments where you are left            scratching your head wondering what to do next. Menus are neatly            laid out and in a logical order, and although there is an initial            familiarisation exercise, you will soon be wearing the comfortable            slippers of Championship Manager like the rest of us!                    You can play the game in full screen mode or in the rather more            convenient windowed option. This makes the game one of the best for            playing at work, where an Alt-Tab takes you back to that important            documentation you really should be working on! Not that I would            condone such irresponsible behaviour. Not me, no way.         Ultimately what you have here is CM99/00 with a few added            features, a more up-to-date database, and very little else. But            there is method to the madness - releasing the annual updates as            data disks would have necessitated owning the original Championship            Manager 3 to play. This way not only the existing fanbase but also            new disciples can enjoy the game, and CM00/01 still retails for a            significantly lower price than your average stand-alone game.                    There can be no denying that Championship Manager is still the            chairman of all football management sims, and with the additional            modifications of the 00/01 edition it is made all the better still.
