As one of the movie's characters comments, ~we've had            experiences with scientists before~.                    In ~Jurassic Park~ it was cloned dinosaurs, in ~Westworld~ it was            robots, and in The Andromeda Strain it is .. alien microbes. While            it might not sound like the most exciting of topics, the            combination of Crichton's original novel as its basis and terse but            effective direction from industry veteran Robert Wise (~The Day The            Earth Stood Still~) proved to be a winner.                    The village of Piedmont, New Mexico had a population of just 68,            until a military satellite code-named Project Scoop landed nearby            after straying off-course during re-entry on February 5th 1971.            Scientists arrive to recover the satellite, only to find the            village littered with corpses. ~We see bodies, lots of them~, the            recovery team reports over the radio as the supervisors at            Vandenburg Air Force base listen in shock. ~They're all over the            place, there must be dozens of them~.                    A ~wildfire alert~ is called, and a team of four top scientists            from around the country is hurriedly assembled at a secret            bio-hazard lab in the deserts of Nevada. Their mission is to            isolate and identify the alien virus which was brought back by            Scoop, and to discover a way of neutralising it before it can            spread any further. Their only clue is the two survivors of the            disaster - an old man and a baby. ~I'll have the answer when I know            why a 69 year old sterno drinker with an ulcer is like a normal six            month old baby~, team doctor Mark Hall declares.                    The whole film is shot in a semi-documentary style, right down to            voice-overs from a supposed Senate committee hearing into the            crisis a couple of months later, and this only helps add to the            mounting tension. It's chilling stuff, and despite the almost total            lack of action and a rather lengthy two and a quarter hour running            time, it manages to keep your attention throughout.                    Scientific accuracy, or at least believability, is usually a key            element of Crichton's work, and The Andromeda Strain is no            exception - as Dr Hall says, ~I never went in much for science            fiction~. The laboratory and its draconian sixteen hour            decontamination procedure are all recreated with stark and            painstaking detail, and Andromeda itself is brought to life thanks            to some trippy computer generated effects.                    Laboratory equipment ranging from glove boxes and robotic ~waldo~            arms to electron microscopes are all present and correct, and            there's plenty of scientific jargon and experimental procedures for            geeks to get stuck into, although some of it is a little dated by            today's standards, particularly the primitive computer systems. The            sight of the scientists exposing lab rats and monkeys to the virus            to determine its effects and lifespan is rather shocking as well,            the animals panting and convulsing as the virus spreads through            their blood system, killing them in a matter of seconds...                    The whole thing is filmed in a subdued and almost clinical manner,            as sterile as the clean rooms on Level 5 of the secret wildfire            facility. In ways it's reminiscent of ~2001 : A Space Oddysey~,            which was released just a few years earlier, and it's a highly            effective approach for the rather abstract subject matter and            scientific detachment of the main characters as they investigate            the alien life form. Director Robert Wise went on to use the same            cold style again several years later in ~Star Trek : The Motion            Picture~, much to the consternation of Trekkies everywhere...                    Dialog in the Andromeda Strain is terse and highly technical a lot            of the time, and the acting is mostly very restrained, although the            cast deserve a commendation for making lines like ~I didn't think            the total volume of blood could solidify that fast~ sound suitably            menacing. In a way the scientists are more caricatures than            characters, from calculating team leader Dr Stone (~stick to            established procedure~) to sarcastic biologist Dr Ruth Leavitt.            This just makes it more shocking when they lose their cool detached            outlook though, leading to a genuinely exciting climax.                    There are occasional lapses into borderline psychedelia thanks to            some rather trippy special effects, as well as a little            experimental split-screen camera work of the kind which was popular            for a few years in the late 60's and early 70's, where different            scenes are combined into a single frame. It's used sparingly and            works surprisingly well though, especially as the scientists            explore the village of Piedmont, the footage of them walking from            door to door interspersed with photographs of victims of the            microbe.                    The Region 1 DVD came as something of a disappointment, totally            lacking in any kind of extra features, unless you count the            illustrated scene access menu, which is useful but hardly exciting.            There are no trailers, no commentary tracks, no cast and crew            biographies, no stills galleries, nothing.                    The movie is presented at the original aspect ratio of around 2.35            : 1, but that's about as far as the good news goes. Sadly it has            not aged well in the last thirty years, and the print it is taken            from is dark and grainy at the best of times, with unremarkable            (and rather quiet) mono sound. The problems don't end there either            - the transfer has brief but noticeable compression and aliasing            artefacts in a few places, although luckily it's not too            serious.                    Overall it's a decent effort for a movie which is well past its            prime, but if you already own it on video there's no good reason to            buy the DVD as well, as the picture quality isn't any better than a            good video copy, and there are no extra features to speak of. If            you don't already have a copy on video it's well worth a look            though, as the film itself is excellent, the DVD is cheap, and            sadly this is the best version we are likely to see, unless            somebody digs up a better print or takes the time and effort to            digitally remaster it after all these years.
