A relatively serious adventure game based on an Atari original more            than ten years old, journalists and the public alike went            mad over it, caught up in a whirlwind of publicity and nostalgia.            In the process certain... inadequacies were overlooked, such as the            dodgy collision detection, imprecise control system and            over-ambitious level design.                         Majesco's THQ-published GameBoy Advance conversion is a reasonable            game, but it loses a lot of its impact due to the above problems,            which have apparently been flat-out ignored once again by the            developer. Pitfall : The Mayan Adventure, to give the game its full            name, is set across ten worlds of multiple stages and focuses on            the plight of Pitfall Harry, who has been taken captive. The            venerable adventurer has a son though, Harry Jr., and fortunately            for him the Indiana Jones-inspired offspring is carrying on the            family tradition and braving crocodiles, venomous snakes and other            hazards of the jungle to rescue his old man.                         During the course of the game young Harry has to overcome the            unwelcome attentions of the creatures of the Amazon jungle, the            occupants of Mayan ruins, and of course the obligatory abandoned            mines. Sadly, the past five years haven't been kind on the Pitfall            look though, which was perhaps a little dated even back then.            Nowadays it looks like a poor Castlevania clone, and thanks to the            colourful scenery picking out your enemies is often more difficult            than it should be, particularly when the lighting is against you.                    Of course, all of the original problems are back too. The collision            detection is still ludicrous, and coupled with the imprecise            control system it will lead to all too many unlikely deaths for            young Harry. This is a straight conversion of the Super Nintendo /            Mega Drive game, and that's as much of a curse as a blessing. Even            more disappointingly the original Pitfall, which was hidden in the            darkest recesses of the 16-bit version, is missing from the GameBoy            port. . Licensing issues are apparently to blame for its absence,            but nostalgic children of the gaming revolution all those years ago            have every right to wince.                         Perhaps the stupidest thing about Pitfall though is a new            GameBoy-specific problem - the lack of a save game or password            feature. For some reason Majesco expect you to play through the            entire game in one sitting. While this is possible, it flies            in the face of the unspoken GameBoy Advance ethic; that you should            be able to dip into the games every so often. Perhaps the developer            got too caught up in the official GameBoy Advance ethic;            Gaming 24:7. Either way though, it smacks of extreme laziness and            it's another reason why Pitfall : The Mayan Adventure should            probably be left well alone.                    I'm beginning to find these passive 16-bit conversions somewhat            trying, so Pitfall has come at a bad time. Games like Mario Kart :            Super Circuit have shown how these things can be done while            retaining much of the original game's charm, so why doesn't Pitfall            deserve a more adventurous update? The capacity is there in terms            both of physical memory and processing power to overhaul the game            and include the 16-bit sibling. But no, the only conclusion            has to be that the game has been thrown together for money rather            than love, and that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. If you were            a fan of the 16-bit game, this is for you, but don't kid yourself            otherwise, there are better games available now, let alone on the            horizon."}
