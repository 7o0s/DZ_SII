Recently released on all three next gen console platforms, (plus            the GBA), the lead character is John Anderton, a pre crime officer            who studies the findings of three psychics who, bizarrely, lay in a            water tank hooked up to a machine that projects their thoughts onto            a big screen that Anderton can manipulate in a futuristic kind of            way that we don't really understand. These pre-cogs (as they're            known) have the ability to predict when murders are about to take            place, and thus the pre crime officers move in to stop these            heinous acts taking place. And then promptly lock the would-be            guilty away so they can cause no more trouble.        Trouble is, Anderton (played by Tom Cruise in the movie)            discovers that he himself is going to commit a murder at some point            in the near future, and is forced to go on the run to avoid            permanent detention - but in the movie's high tech age this is            easier said than done, with retina scanners capable of tracking            individuals wherever they are, and jet pack powered cops swooping            in from every direction to wrestle you off to chokey.                    With an interesting take on the fugitive genre, it ought to have            given Treyarch (developers of Spider-Man: The Movie, Shaun Palmer,            Kelly Slater) plenty of inspiration to conjure more than your            average movie license spin off. But you gamers should know by now            that the chances of a decent movie tie-in game are about one in a            hundred, so we approached Minority Report with more than a little            scepticism.                    Our initial feelings about the game went up a notch when we            discovered the rare presence of a wide screen and surround sound            option. But that's about as good as it got. Minority Report merely            takes the escape element of the movie and makes a Final Fight style            beat 'em up out of it.        The controls are fairly familiar, for            a third person action game, with the left stick controlling            movement, and the right stick the camera. X punches, square kicks,            circle blocks, triangle jumps, while L1 shoots, and R1 targets -            with weapon select assigned to the D pad. A range of combos makes            the combat look initially promising, but stabbing the kick button            like a maniac seems to dispose of just about anything in the            vicinity. And if that doesn't work, you can always pop them with            some futuristic guns.                    Weapons are generally dotted around, but normally with extremely            limited ammo, so cautious use is advised. Anderton seems to be a            fairly feeble chap, so you constantly have to keep a check on your            health; otherwise you'll find yourself dead in a worryingly short            space of time. Health pick-ups are also available, but armed            enemies cause heavy damage so quickly you have to tread extremely            carefully. If you fail, it's an annoying trip back to the very            start of the level, with no mid level check points provided to            cushion the blow of your (inevitable) failure.        Initial forays are pretty straightforward, with a few unarmed            foes to dispatch, but the action soon gets tough after the first            three or four levels, with robots manning the facility, followed by            cops armed to the teeth. And once you've got possession of the jet            pack, things get even tougher, with packs of cops capable of            gunning you down in a matter of seconds. At this point, you really            wonder why you're bothering, as the old school trip back to the            start of a long, enemy strewn level just feels like gaming torture,            Groundhog Day style. On level 5, it's actually possible to avoid            half the enemies just by jet packing through them all, but Treyarch            arbitrarily throws up obstacles for the player, forcing them to            dispatch a set number of enemies before doors magically become            unlocked.                    You can collect cash lying around (which is mostly hidden in            'secret' areas), and buy ammo, armour, or better weapons, but            you'll probably be halfway through the game before you have            anywhere near enough to play with. The chances of you enjoying the            experience long enough to even get halfway are pretty slim, believe            us.                    And we haven't even mentioned the graphics yet. The fairest thing            to say would be that they're 'functional'. If we were being            cynical, we'd say that they're the result of a rushed development            cycle, whereby Treyarch were given a matter of months to churn out            something that would be released just in time for the DVD release.            If you turned back the clock a couple of years, this kind of low            rent, low texture, low poly blandness would have probably been -            just about - acceptable. It's no exaggeration to say that this            wouldn't look out of place on a PSone.        But the progression of technology is a harsh mistress, and sub            standard offerings become the subject of much pointing and laughing            by a community spoiled by (much) better things. Minority Report            doesn't even try to be cutting edge in this department, with            nothing truly terrible (ok the lens flare is comical), but nothing            ever even remotely eye-catching. Even the colour scheme is death by            blandness (at least the execrable Gungrave bothers to look good).            The lack of Tom Cruise as John Anderton in the cut scenes is            utterly predictable, but his digital replacement is so crushingly            generic, with such piss poor voiceovers that you wonder whether the            people responsible for this game even watched the film, it's so            embarrassingly far from representing the real thing. If we hadn't            watched the movie already, we would have no interest after            witnessing these cut scenes.                    As a game, the combat-centric nature of the gameplay bears little            relation to the movie, and to somehow stretch out a 15 level game            based on tiny snippets of the action is testing credibility to the            limit. There are a ton of cool gadgets the developers could have            employed, and a whole adventure element that would have suited the            game perfectly, and done justice to what is a pretty decent movie.            Instead Treyarch seems to have taken the 'churn it out quick'            option with a laughable attempt at appealing to the lowest common            denominator, but instead appealing to no-one but people who don't            know any better.                    What you're left with is a punch, kick and throw marathon that            bears more resemblance to early 90s side scrolling beat 'em ups            from Capcom than a 21st Century action adventure on a next            generation console. You'd think a publisher with a good reputation            like Activision wouldn't want to be associated with such second            rate titles - especially one attached to a high profile movie            license.                    If you fancy a couple of hours of entertainment, you'd be better            off spending a few quid on renting the movie than burning \u00a340            on this wasted opportunity to recreate the experience as a            videogame.
