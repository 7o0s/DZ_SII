But after years of chipping away quietly, Konami            finally broke through commercially with last year's ecstatically            well received Pro Evolution Soccer. For the first time EA found its            lynchpin brand outsold, outsmarted, and out of favour - and all            this despite huge marketing support, slick presentation, high            profile endorsements and all the official stadia, player faces et            al.                    But how had one of gaming's most popular brands been usurped so            dramatically? Well, even the most casual gamer could spot that            Konami's effort was in a different league in terms of gameplay.            FIFA was all style over substance and had very little in common            with real life football, while Pro Evo simply oozed gameplay            subtlety, class and depth - the very antithesis of FIFA's air            headed, bubblegum chewing bimbo approach.                    Clearly EA, the world's number one publisher, had to go back to the            drawing board - and fast, and the result is the best FIFA since,            ooh, FIFA '98. But how does it fare against the mighty Pro            Evolution Soccer 2? With both having just hit the shelves, we put            both to the test to see which one is worthy of the crown of Best            Footy Game Of The Season...        FIFA 2003: In a word, stunning. Never before has a            football game been lavished with so much attention to detail, and            the end result is one of the most beautiful looking sports games            ever. Around 400 of the game's top stars have had their mugs            recreated in the game, and with a few dodgy exceptions, most of the            game's big names are instantly recognisable, complete with facial            expressions to complement the effect. Even the shape of their heads            has been mapped, although the effect is marred thanks to the            slightly chunky bodies, even if the animation is fantastic. At this            rate, FIFA's on course to be photorealistic within three years,            which is a fairly scary prospect. To add even further gloss to the            on field action, the world's top stadia have also been given the            treatment, and again, they're superbly recreated. Meanwhile the            action replays are typically dramatic and up to the usual TV-esque            standard that EA has perfected over the years. Throw in countless            camera options, and you've got a game which is almost faultless to            look at.        Pro Evolution Soccer 2: Konami's footy titles have always            lagged a few years behind in the visuals department, and this            year's effort is no exception. Although certain players bear a            vague resemblance to their real life counterparts (Beckham has an,            um, Mohican), the game's players generally look pretty generic next            to FIFA, but by no means ugly. They're certainly a big improvement            over last year, and it's noticeable how much extra effort has been            made in the animation department - which was already excellent. The            stadia are very impressive, although entirely made up, while the            replay system is the same at last years - which is as intuitive and            slick as ever.        FIFA 2003: EA has been perfecting this system ever since the            PC version released way back in '94, and the John Motson/Ally            McCoist dream team again deliver a flawless and constantly varied            selection of soundbites that give the package a great deal of            atmosphere. This begins to repeat after a while, obviously, but            this is the benchmark every sports game should be trying to attain.            The crowd chants also reflect who you're playing as, so for example            if you're playing Chelsea you'll actually hear the ~Chelsea!            Chelsea!~ chants echoing in the background, while the more generic            crowd noises are superb throughout. Soundtrack wise, EA has once            more pulled out all the stops with an extensive array of top-notch            licensed tunes - all recently released.        Pro Evolution Soccer 2: Last year's commentary effort            was pretty terrible, and despite employing a new pairing of Trevor            Brooking and Peter Brackley, the results are just as lame, if not            lamer than ever, we're sorry to report. (The ~I tell a lie, he's            put it wide~ line will have you reaching for the volume control            within a few games, we guarantee you). In fact, we made more sense            of the commentary by switching it to Italian! The crowd noise and            ambiance is pretty decent, but not especially impressive. You'll            probably hardly notice it, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.            Meanwhile, last year's edition had some of the most uniformly            terrible music we've heard in a modern videogame, and while the            opening ~We Will Rock You~ video is superbly promising, the same            one man and his Casio drivel accompanies every menu thereafter. One            day Konami will get it right, one day.        FIFA 2003: Having played every FIFA since the first PC            attempt in '94, we can safely say that this is by far the most            accomplished effort yet. For a start, unlike every other FIFA ever,            you won't be racking up huge scores from your very first game.                    The whole game engine appears to have been ripped out and built            from scratch, and it's all the better for it. Gone is the pinball            gameplay, and the ancient 'ball stuck to the foot' system, as is            the stupid number of 'special move' controls that made every player            some kind of footballing god, and in comes intuitive, Pro            Evo-inspired gameplay that actually takes time to learn. Yes, for            the first time in years, you'll actually find yourself playing out            goalless draws while you adapt to the new system. Scoring is no            longer a formality, and instead you're forced to craft and scrap            for goal chances, which is thanks to a combination of a more            realistic tacking system and a delayed shooting mechanic which            relates to your player momentum - very similar to how PES works, in            fact.        However, practise and persistence reaps rewards, and FIFA            displays a maturity and depth we'd long since assumed we'd never            associate with EA's franchise. The mechanics for taking set plays            have also been simplified and simultaneously improved, and allow            players to direct their throws, corners or free kicks with            precision. For free kicks and corners a rapidly moving needle            swings left to right and back, with a small green zone denoting an            accurate kick. Hit the button at the right point and the ball will            go where you want it to - hit the red zone and you fluff it.            Tackling has been improved a notch too, with the so-called 'soft'            tackle enabling you to nudge players off the ball in yet another            nod to the superb system pioneered in PES. The sliding tackle isn't            as mental as before, and timed right can get you out of serious            scrapes, and thankfully you can still foul the keeper, if you get            really frustrated.                    But FIFA doesn't get it right all the time, and its PES            inspirations may frustrate those who actually prefer the more            instantly accessible gameplay of older FIFAs. Almost every goal            scored across the 30 odd matches played seemed to result from pass            and move forays and a shot just inside the box. Screamers from            outside now nearly always result in a convincing save, while            crossing into the area seems to be a relatively fruitless way of            setting up scoring opportunities. We're assuming that the            variations in ways to score will open up with practise, but as it            stands, running into the box and steering the ball past the on            rushing keeper seems to be the main route to success, resulting in            a rather one dimensional experience at times.        Pro Evolution Soccer 2: PES was in a league of its own            last year, and the sequel somehow improves upon the gameplay of            last year. Last year's effort took an age to get to grips with, but            with persistence the game's many charms became apparent. You really            did feel that every goal was down to the player's skill, with build            up play, intelligence and timing the key factors in gaining any            success. It says something that a novice would have had to play PES            several times before they even got close to scoring. It's a steep            learning curve, but once you suss out the timing of your shots,            players can soon carve out some truly impressive, and hugely            satisfying moves.                    Version 2 is very much an Evolution of this approach, and veterans            will slip straight into it. Over double the number of animations            allow for a far slicker experience, and minor irritations such as            players running off into touch happen far less frequently than            before, thanks to this. Also, the game now allows you to nick the            ball off opponents in a far more convincing fashion (normally            through use of the all-important soft tackle), although in a packed            midfield the ball can swap possession multiple times as the ball            pings between legs and players tumble around frantically. It can            look a little like pinball at times, but can result in some            superbly realistic comedy goals as the ball ricochets around - and            lends an even more authentic feel to the package.                    Where PES2 really scores over its rivals is this sense of almost            everything feeling right. The double tap shot system, while            initially confusing, does give the player a huge amount of control            over the power and trajectory of the ball. The same applies to            crosses, which after a while will be heading just where you want            them to. We wish the same could be said for the set piece/throw in            system that gives you an odd perspective on the proceedings, and an            unsatisfying 'trial and error' means of delivery, thanks to a lack            of any directional cursor or guide bar for you to aim at. This is a            small point, but detracts from an otherwise almost flawless            gameplay experience.        FIFA 2003: All the top clubs are present and correct,            complete with proper player names, and all the numerous variations            on their strips. We only wish EA had gone to Sony lengths on the            number of clubs featured, but you can't have everything.            Competition wise, there's the standard FIFA approach, with leagues,            cup and friendly matches to enter, with up to four players able to            compete simultaneously. Speed can be altered from the default            Normal, down to Slow, and up to Fast or Fastest. However, it was            pretty nippy on Fast, so we can't imagine many will wish to up the            ante too much. Of course, every option you can imagine is present            in terms of match time, weather, day/night, camera and formation            settings. It's hard to think of many things they haven't included.        Pro Evolution Soccer 2: Although the menu system still lacks            the gloss of its rivals, you can't fault PES2 for the sheer number            of modes and options available. Most of us will be content with            playing this game purely in two player mode, but for the lone            player, the Master League's revamped transfer system makes it far            more realistic than previously, while an important new addition for            the real fans is the ability to completely customise and edit all            40 of the game's Master League teams. To be honest, though, it's a            bit of a faff having to go through and edit all the made up teams            that Konami doesn't appear to have the license to.                    The brand new Umbro Player Training Challenge is a very welcome            addition, especially for newbies frustrated with their initial            ineptitude. Option wise, you're spoilt for choice - if only Konami            could revamp the general layout and presentation of its front end,            it would be so much nicer to navigate.        FIFA 2003: Once you've experienced the lavish presentation            and got to grips with the vastly improved gameplay, you sense there            is more to come, but the depth is still not quite up to the level            of its illustrious rival. But it's not far off. Will we be playing            this in a few weeks? Sure. In a year? Very unlikely.        Pro Evolution Soccer 2: There's so much to learn and            discover about this game it's almost scary. Reviewing this over the            past week has barely scratched the surface, and it's one we'll be            coming back to for the next 12 months at least - with the god-awful            commentary turned off, at any rate!        Whatever your thoughts of previous FIFAs, the latest is a            marvellous achievement that with a little more gameplay depth would            have reclaimed its throne. The improvements to every area of the            package make it the best football game EA has released by some            margin. But is it a better than Pro Evolution Soccer 2? Of course            the answer to that is more complicated than a simple yes/no. Pro            Evo is still the better game, and will last you longer, but FIFA is            arguably the sweeter experience in the short term. FIFA's            presentation, style and gameplay are all great, but Pro Evolution            Soccer 2 gives the hardcore footy fan the chance to really live out            their footy fantasies. It's a question of priorities: are you a            casual gamer looking for a slightly less in depth but infinitely            more gorgeous experience or a hardcore footy fan looking for the            ultimate in depth and subtlety? Brains or looks - the choice is            yours, and it's never been a harder choice to make."}
