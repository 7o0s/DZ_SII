In both cases, publisher Midway brought in            Crawfish Interactive to head up conversions to Nintendo portables.            The original Ready 2 Rumble Boxing on Game Boy Color was judged to            be a decent rendition of boxing. Unfortunately though, the second            time around things got worse instead of better.                         The first mistake was putting the same development team on the            project. No disrespect to them, but if they didn't get it right the            first time round, giving them a console with larger goalposts and            telling them to try again isn't going to help. In fact, they've            produced what is arguably the least favourable of all Game Boy            Advance launch titles.                         There are 11 boxers in total, including six from the original            game, and, to put it simply, the game consists of three bouts of            pummelling, during which time you may build up your RUMBLE metre to            execute a Rumble Flurry. Apart from the Championship mode, the game            features a smattering of sub-games including a training mode that            consists of five different exercises (two of which are daft and            three of which are potentially replayable), and if you play the            Championship mode for long enough you can unlock secret characters            like Shaq and The Prince of Pop, Michael Jackson.                    Thanks to the Game Boy Advance's limited graphics capabilities            compared to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2, there's no luscious 3D            engine, just pre-rendered boxer sprites on a 2D background. The            animation is more than acceptable, which is a relief, but if they            had to compromise, why didn't they use a bit of artistic license            and change the perspective to first person or something else            vaguely original? My one concern here (as with so many handheld            fighters) is that the sprites simply look too small on an already            small screen, and I would have liked to have seen them look a            little more overbearing. And since there's so much ring space to be            seen, Crawfish decided not to pan the camera much, if at all, so            frequently battles are taking place right under your right-hand            thumb as the characters close in on the corner, which is quite            silly when viewed on the GBA's wide screen.                         Once you've embarked upon the Championship mode, instead of being            treated to sharp, reflex-based boxing, you're at the mercy of the            controls. If you hit a punch button, you expect to have it directed            through the gap that you lined up, not for it to wait a few seconds            before landing. Thanks to the control system in Ready 2 Rumble            though, things rarely happen on time (or even at all!) and so every            bout is in effect a button-bashing affair, decided by exactly when            your opponent decides to let his guard down.                         You could blame this unfortunate ineffectual fighting style on the            ~Stamina bar~, which needs to be at a certain point for your moves            to connect, but even on full charge, with my opponent on the ropes,            a lot of the time simple button combinations fail to connect. You            get the feeling that there's something decidedly out of sync deep            within the game's motor functions.                         As for the RUMBLE metre, I've only managed to charge it fully the            one time in the course of an average encounter. The bouts simply            aren't long enough for a Rumble Flurry ever to come up!                    The final nail in Ready 2 Rumble's coffin is its lack of            multiplayer support. When we spoke to Crawfish's Mike Merren back            in March he told us that the GBA's excellent link-up potential            would ~widen the use of Multiplayer products and make multiplayer            only games a step closer.~ Clearly this didn't rub off on Mike's            own products, because there's no link-up option to be seen            anywhere; not even one that requires multiple cartridges (a bit of            a let-down as it would be). Mike was right though, the absence of            link-up options in GBA games makes them look all the more shallow.            Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is an unfortunate example.                         There's little to recommend about Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2            on Game Boy Advance, except that you steer well clear of it.            Perhaps Nintendo will drag out Super Punchout some day and show            Crawfish/Midway how it's done. At least then we might get a            multiplayer mode. In the meantime though, a few decent sub-games            surrounding a lacklustre boxing conversion aren't enough to justify            the \u00a330 outlay.                        -        The                    Portable Avant-GardeThe                    Portable Avant-Garde"}
