This was perhaps a little unfair on the developers - Dark Reign            might look rather dated today, but it was a nicely designed game            that ran well on the computers of the time, and one of the key            things that the developers did get right with Dark Reign was the            story. Which brings us to the follow up, Dark Reign 2...                    The original game pitted the Imperium, a technology orientated            superpower, against the Freedom Guard and their rebellion against            the imperial tyranny. Which admittedly sounds remarkably like Star            Wars. The story for Dark Reign 2 is set further into the future of            the game universe, after the defeat of both Freedom Guard and            Imperium by Togra's forces.                    Now the Jovian Detention Authority have become the controlling            power, and having been part of the old Imperium their technology is            an evolution on the units from the first game. They are opposed by            the Sprawlers, who are once again attempting to fight against the            apparent tyranny. As a commander in either the JDA or Sprawlers, it            is your job to carry out the orders of your superiors as the story            unfolds across twenty chapters, ultimately helping to crush your            enemies.         To accomplish this                 you will find yourself commanding a wide range of units,                 including ground infantry, walkers, tanks, hover-tanks,                 aircraft and naval units.                    Naturally each units has its own tactical strengths and weaknesses,            dictated not only by their weaponry and armour, but also by the            landscape over which they are fighting. It goes without saying that            a standard tank can't go over water, whereas hover-tanks will take            the rough with the smooth. The units are well balanced, with            neither side possessing any single unit or weapon which doesn't            have an equivalent in the enemy force, something which is obviously            important, particularly for multiplayer.                    As with any good real time strategy game these days, Dark Reign 2            allows you to assign waypoints, rally points and patrol routes for            your units. Other features include a self destruct option, which            can be helpful in preventing an enemy from capturing one of your            buildings, and can also cause damage to nearby enemies.                    You can also set unit behaviour, which allows your units to run            almost autonomously in order to carry out certain objectives. One            of the most useful is the 'terminator' setting which, combined with            the explore order, will cause the selected units to find any enemy            units and destroy them. This can be extremely useful when you are            hunting for the last couple of units which are preventing you from            completing a mission which requires you to 'destroy all enemy            units'.         Most real time strategy games                 now seem to be heading into the realms of 3D polygon based                 virtual worlds, with complex camera controls and increased use                 of landscape as a valid tactical feature - even the venerable                 Warcraft is going 3D in its next incarnation.                    While other games have sported overly complex interfaces and            difficult to use cameras (with Earth 2150 one of the few to make a            reasonably good attempt at simplifying this), Dark Reign 2 has been            designed for maximum ease of use. The camera itself is extremely            intuitive, working in a similar way to the one in Homeworld, and it            won't take long to get used to even if you haven't played other 3D            strategy games.                    Pandemic have also very thoughtfully realised that not all players            may want to take full advantage of the new 3D viewpoints, and may            prefer the classic overhead view. Fear not, as there are a number            of preset camera heights in the game, and you can flick between            them with the 'F' keys. One of the many presets is for an overhead            view, which is well implemented and gives a very classic feel to a            very new game.                    Normally I would tend to stick with the 3D views, but there is            sometimes a need to see the whole battle from above, and many other            games of this type don't offer this kind of view.         The                 visuals are stunning, with the desolate run-down Earth looking                 very worn, with hi-tech buildings stretching out to form                 cities. The detail is high for a strategy game and while some                 of the units may seem quite simple in terms of their polygon                 count, this is more than made up for by the scenery.                    There is something quite breathtaking about guiding troops around a            snow covered valley as a handful of JDA Enforcers descend from the            top of a big hill, guns at the ready. Some of the unit effects are            also superbly done, especially the Sprawl Freakers. These units            have the ability to cloak while standing still, which allows for            some fairly intense ambushes to be set up. The cloaking effect is            impressive enough for me to spend a couple of minutes just admiring            it at first!                    On the sound front Dark Reign 2 is superbly put together, with            units sounding appropriately gruff or sophisticated. The soundtrack            is also extremely good, and while it may not be everyone's cup of            tea, it does sit incredibly well with the game. As you progress            through a mission the music changes with it, which is fairly            impressive considering that the music is old-fashioned CD audio            based.                    One last point to mention about the game's technology is the AI. It            has to be said that most strategy games feature truly appalling AI,            while others have AI that is so unbelievably fiendish that it can            be almost impossible for the player to win. Dark Reign 2's computer            opponents appear to be well set and seemingly intelligent, and            attacks are varied not only in number and unit type, but also in            direction, which means that building a defence along one perimeter            won't always suffice.         Dark Reign 2 is a highly polished title,                 and one that I have been waiting on for some time. The length                 of the game might seem a little short for some of the more                 dedicated RTS players out there, but then remember that                 Homeworld only had 17 missions!                    And with Pandemic releasing new maps on a weekly basis, Dark Reign            2 is sure to become a hit in multiplayer circles - commitment of            this kind has been hard to find since Total Annihilation. Well            worth a look for anybody who has dabbled in a little RTS and            enjoyed the experience."}
