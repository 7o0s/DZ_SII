After a near miss with its            qualifying edition, Road To The World Cup 98, the game fused            accessible, addictive gameplay with - at the time - fantastic            visuals. Like World Cup 98, 2002 FIFA World Cup is a deviation, but            no less an integral part of the seasonal football franchise.            Selling strongly on the back of tournament hype and available on            every format under the rising sun, the game already looks to have            capitalised on the mass hysteria surrounding the illustrious            competition.                         Obviously the game's distinguishing suffix is now a prefix, but            the changes run a lot deeper than marketing, with major departures            in the areas of graphics and gameplay. As you might expect,            although the standard issue Quick Start mode and other distractions            complement the spectacle, the main focus is the World Cup mode,            packed with spectacular venues from Korea and Japan. Obviously at            the time of publication the official squads were still only drafts,            but the team data should also be largely accurate. Opting for the            main event, you can choose any of the teams taking part in the            tournament and even play in the correct groups, enjoying the            sumptuous presentation as though the games were being played live            on your TV set.                         As series fans will know, EA Canada has been telling anybody who            will listen about the startling changes to the formula made by FIFA            World Cup, and I'm about to do the same. Unfortunately for the            developer, I have a slightly different take on proceedings. To            begin with, the players have received a lot of pampering, both            visually and statistically. Star players - the world's best, as            dictated by EA - receive increased emphasis in the departments that            make them strong. For instance, David Beckham is a superb crosser            of the ball, and Thierry Henry has the pace of a racehorse, while            Emile Heskey merely resembles one.                    Each of the players in the game (at least those we recognise)            sports an extremely detailed face and body. Michael Owen enjoys his            typical inch-long short back and sides, and his nose, eyes and            mouth all look fairly well proportioned. His face contorts with a            number of expressions depending on his situation, perhaps best            emphasized by the zooming camera work that now follows goal            celebrations and shameful misses. This enhanced realism should put            the game a notch above its direct competition, but like the rest of            the players in the game, Owen's head is too big for his body and            squashed down into his neck. Despite superb mimicry on the whole,            the illusion is spoilt by this, and furthermore by the player's            unblinking eyes and gaping mouth. His shirt is creased around the            waist but barely moves, and although unmistakably fast he doesn't            run low to the ground, stretching his legs out like the real            Owen, and on the whole players lack fluidity of movement.                         This is a by-product of the overuse of motion capture. Like            previous games, the scene overall amounts to a jumble of poorly            connected motion capture animations. While other titles in the            series are just as guilty of this, it's the robotic feel applied to            such realistic players which unseats FIFA World Cup. Player models            are clotheshorses to abundant detail, and yet no attention has been            spared for the simple transition from a despairing lunge to a light            canter towards the halfway line, and it shows the whole game up.            Other little problems work to highlight these flaws. Players clip            through one another and even the ball at times, often as they move            between set animations, and this looks especially bad during            close-ups. The ball actually slides back onto the feet of pass and            shot making players - again, accentuated by close camerawork - and            despite most of the players casting a shadow from each floodlight,            the ball is apparently transparent.                         Further visual touches do little to rescue the blemished            aesthetic. Highlighting the arcade nature of the game, EA Canada            has supplemented the imagined visuals with coloured spots on the            pitch to track moving players, while adding a pronounced motion            blur to fast players and a fiery effect to speeding shots, complete            with sound effect. I didn't find these useful however, and they            can't be turned off. Tut tut.                    As you might expect, the tarnished visuals do little for the            gameplay, but the changes made by EA Canada fight to bring the            whole thing down by themselves. Every kick, from passes and goal            kicks to shots and crosses, now relies on the staple power bar,            which charges up as you hold down the relevant button.                         Because of this forced delay between input and reaction, the game            loses its immediacy, and even on its sternest setting the liberal            refereeing often leads to quick turnover up and down the field.            This in turn creates the false impression in the player's mind of a            sluggish control system, perpetuated by unfeasible slowdown in            animation as players congregate on the ball and play it between            them. One-touch football is almost completely absent, and you will            find none of the depth of the simulation-focused Pro Evolution            Soccer. To add insult to the injury of PlayStation 2 owners who            might purchase FIFA World Cup, their version of the game suffers            from even more slowdown than the Xbox and GameCube versions, which            in turn occasionally strain the hardware on replays and close-ups.                         Those PlayStation-less gamers among you may find solace in FIFA            World Cup's 'lite' simulation features, but these too are limited.            Fatigue accumulates during a game, rendering over-used players            (usually down the right flank) completely useless midway through            the second half, and although passing, lobbing, through balls and            one-twos are options for those seeking greater depth, the poorly            realised power bar interferes with a potentially enjoyable dynamic.            Shots can't be directed as accurately as in the likes of Pro Evo,            and World Cup offers none of the little dinks and cunning technique            of that game, while tackling is simplistic and often brutally            inefficient. Seasoned players should have no trouble tracing a line            to the goal through an easily fooled defence.                    For all its shortcomings though, there is no game closer to the            televisual experience of the World Cup than 2002 FIFA World Cup. To            magnify this, EA's commentary team is eminently respectable,            comprising people's favourite John Motson and Scottish loudmouth            Andy Gray. The pairing might not work particularly well in real            life, but they do work surprisingly well here. Motto has an            enormous array of metaphors and expressions which he puts to use            throughout the game, and the commentators' respective analysis is            mapped superbly to the events on the pitch. Intro and exit comments            are almost insightful, and Man of the Match awards are presented,            although disappointingly this is usually a goal scorer's            distinction.                         Returning to the downward spiral though, gone are the rousing pop            and rock melodies of Robbie Williams and co., replaced by BBC Sport            style classical themes, unfortunately executed with none of the            pizzazz and none of the notoriety of the channel's themes. Even the            game's sound effects fall short of the standards set by their            predecessors; slide tackles sound like someone kicking up gravel,            and players grunt and moan far too audibly to be realistic.                         It's hard not to take a negative tone with this game, and I'm sure            by now the conclusion (and pun) must be obvious, but I'll say it            anyway: EA has dropped the ball with its latest release. Let's hope            this poor showing doesn't return the series to its position of            outright inferiority. Lacking the depth of its major rival,            saturated with problems and bloated with unnecessary detail which            actually works against the developer, this FIFA is a blotch in the            copybook of an otherwise competent arcade football series. Not even            sterling presentation and John Motson can rescue the party, and            ultimately this deeply average incarnation of FIFA may not sell as            well next time unless something is done to rectify the situation."}
