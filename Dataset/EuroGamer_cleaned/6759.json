Over            the course of the game's dozen missions you'll get to run a variety            of resorts, each with its own problems for you to solve. You may be            called in to complete overdue building work, solve a food poisoning            outbreak or give an old resort a new lease of life. Or you could            just opt for the sandbox mode and mess around to your heart's            content.                        However you choose to play the game, the basics are the same as in            any other management sim. A wide range of buildings are available            for you to construct, starting off with a handful of key locations            such as a soft drinks stall, lifeguard towers for the beaches and a            hut for your cleaning staff. As you progress through the game more            and more options will open up, including clubs, theme pubs and            water rides to lure more guests to your island, and additional            staff such as security guards and reps to make sure everyone has a            good time.                        There's only one real resource for players to worry about - money -            but by the end of the main campaign you'll have found many ways to            earn it. You can fine your guests for littering, raise sun tan            lotion prices during heat waves, water down your beer and build            souvenir shops to sell authentic ~made in Taiwan~ tat. Prices for            almost everything can be adjusted, as well as salaries for your            builders, mechanics, cleaners and other staff, although if you drop            your pay too low they'll become disgruntled and stop to ogle your            guests more often.                    The other key to success in Beach Life is the satisfaction level of            your guests. As in the likes of Tropico and Startopia, clicking on            any character will pop up a box giving a range of stats on their            current condition and mood, including how sunburnt they are, how            full their bladder is and how they rate their holiday so far in            terms of safety, cleanliness and ~totty~, amongst other factors.            You'll also get a list of the last three things to go through the            character's head, which can be anything from ~does my bum look big            in this~ to ~you need a gas mask to go in that toilet~, a sure sign            that it's time you called in the cleaners. Sometimes their comments            will even be useful, informing you that the queues are too long or            that you're missing a vital building.                        It's not just daft comments that bring your characters to life            either: the game includes a vast array of amusing little animations            for each type of guest. You can track visitors as they walk around            the island, go swimming, sunbathe, queue for a burger, strut their            funky stuff at a club, get involved in a brawl outside a pub, go            behind the bushes to relieve themselves or head down to the beach            for some late night smooching. Builders will occasionally stop to            wolf whistle at the girls and rub their legs Vic Reeves style, and            guests suffering from over-indulgence or food poisoning can be seen            turning green before stopping to vomit or heading for the toilets            clutching at their stomach. There's even a special tanning system            in the game which will gradually turn your guests a healthy golden            brown or painful lobster red as they spend time in the sun.                        Completing the authentic holiday experience is a great soundtrack            with seperate day and night playlists, giving you a selection of            uplifting choons during the night and more laidback melodies during            the day. The likes of Laurent Garnier and Kinobe are included, and            if you're not happy with Eidos' pick you can always add your own            songs to the mix by simply dropping a shortcut to an MP3 into the            game's music folder and then updating the in-game playlist.                    Beach Life might not be the most innovative game ever developed,            and the graphics are somewhat fuzzy when you zoom in for a closer            look at your resort, but so far it's proven to be a lot of fun.            There's loads of silly little touches, dozens of buildings to            construct and plenty of options to fine tune, ranging from the            price of your hotel rooms to the type and strength of the beer you            serve at your bars. Whether it can maintain that charm throughout            the entire campaign remains to be seen, but we should have a full            review for you by the time the game hits shelves on September 6th."}
