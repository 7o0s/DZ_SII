If you've been living under a rock somewhere in            Outer Mongolia you might not be aware that this is the latest            effort from Peter Molyneux, marking his return to the god game            genre that he helped to create with the classic Populous.                    We have all heard about the hilarious giant creatures and the way            that you can train their revolutionary AI to aid you in the game,            how they will dance to your music and design their own websites,            complete with snapshots of their friends, not to mention the            ability to receive e-mail, ICQ and SMS messages within the game            itself. Unfortunately the first of these features falls far short            of expectations, and the rest of them either don't work properly or            were cut from the game entirely in a desperate last ditch attempt            to actually release the damn thing after months in development            limbo. But even without many of the crazy features that Peter            Molyneux and friends apparently had planned for us, Black &            White still comes across as a lot of neat ideas which don't quite            add up to a game.                    Despite talk of contributions from Hollywood script writers and TV            producers, the plot is at best peripheral to the game, leading you            through a series of islands to a final showdown with the powerful            god Nemesis. Having said that, the first level does manage a good            job of introducing you to the game and its rather awkward controls,            with your good and evil consciences popping up to give advice and            push the story forwards, while a wide variety of quests (some            obligatory, some optional) are available to keep you occupied. But            after this the developers seem to have run out of steam, and the            gameplay becomes repetitive and glacially slow - build up your            village, expand your power base, then convince the nearest village            to worship you by showering it with gifts or fire and brimstone,            depending on whether you are a good god or an evil one. Wash,            rinse, repeat. Once you rule every village on the island your rival            will vanish and a portal will open to whisk you away to the next            level.                    In an attempt to add some variety to the proceedings, the third            island sees your creature being captured by Nemesis, and it is up            to you to rescue him. By converting three villages. Once this is            done your creature is released, you capture the final village from            your enemy, and he vanishes .. opening a portal to the next island.            Woah, deja vu.                    And it's only when your creature is taken away from you that you            realise just how hollow and ultimately unrewarding the game is            without him. Most of your entertainment comes from watching him do            silly things like breakdancing or breaking wind on a hut full of            cowering villagers, and most of your time is spent futilely trying            to convince him to help you. Your creature is like a young child -            it requires constant repetition to teach it anything, and once it            learns something new it does it obsessively for several minutes            before losing interest and quickly forgetting all about it. Even            something as basic as remembering to feed itself seems to be quite            beyond its abilities, and all too often you will see your creature            collapsing from starvation while still steadfastly refusing to            accept any food.                    Teaching it to use miracles is an uphill struggle; you will have to            cast the same spell twenty or more times within sight of a creature            before it finally learns it. And although your creature won't            forget a miracle, it will forget what it should be doing with it.            It took most of the first level to train my creature to use the            water miracle on fields to grow fresh crops, but despite constant            encouragement it mostly just uses it to put out fires now. It also            hasn't worked out how to use the healing spell on itself, instead            wandering around casting it on random villagers.                    A simple punishment and reward system is used to discourage or            enforce your creature's behaviour. If he does something you like            you can tickle and stroke him. If he does something you would            rather he didn't do again you can slap him around, often reducing            him to tears or knocking him clear off his feet.                    Sadly the AI seems to have a very limited list of objects and            actions that it can recognise. For example, I spent over an hour            trying in vain to teach my creature to throw rocks. When I was sure            that he had caught on to what I was doing I gave him a rock. He            dropped it, picked up a nearby sheep, and hurled the startled            looking animal down the hillside, before rolling around on the            ground laughing. Not quite what I had in mind. I tried            again, and this time it decided to start throwing my villagers            around. At this point I gave up and out of sheer frustration            spanked the infernal creature until it passed out from the pain.            This is probably why the RSPCA won't let me keep pets.                    If you want to find out what your creature thinks he knows, you can            go to his cave. Here you will find scrolls listing his achievements            and stats .. except that it doesn't work. My creature seems to be            convinced that I am on the side of good, despite the fact that my            godly hand has turned into a wrinkled red claw. He believes he is            ~very, very compassionate~, even after his villager flinging            exploits. He complains that I don't pay him much attention, even            after I spent over an hour doing nothing but teaching him to use            miracles. And the list of things which he has learnt how to do only            ever includes the same half dozen basic actions which are built            into the game as standard, and most of which he never does despite            having allegedly mastered them all. This just isn't right...                    Apart from trying to train your wayward creature, the game offers            little real challenge. All too often the enemy AI simply sits back            and watches as you take control of its outlying villages, only            bothering to put up a fight if your creature strays too close to            its temple, at which point the AI will always fry your poor            animal with lightning bolts until he passes out.                    Should you have the patience and compassion which I am clearly            lacking, and manage to avoid the handful of show-stopping bugs that            lie in your path, you may finally reach the fifth level and defeat            Nemesis. Unfortunately at this point there is little else to do.            You certainly won't want to play through the single player campaign            again, because there is no way to skip the lengthy tutorial at the            start of the first island, and having a little white-bearded guy            floating around your screen explaining how to move and rotate the            camera in a condescending voice quickly becomes irritating the            second time through.                    There is a skirmish mode, but this simply drops you and your            creature into one of three islands to convert villages and fight            enemy gods with no side-quests and no storyline. Multiplayer            support is more of the same, but with real human opponents. The            problem here is that you can bring your creature from the single            player game with you, so whoever has the strongest and best trained            avatar is almost certain to win. The alternative is for all of the            players to agree to start from scratch with a new god and a new            creature, which means that you will spend most of your time trying            to teach your dumb animal how to cast miracles, water crops and            gather timber all over again...                    The reality of Black & White sadly falls far short of our            (admittedly very high) expectations. The story is largely            superfluous, the gameplay boring and repetitive, the creature AI is            far less impressive than we were promised, and the game suffers            from a number of annoying (and at times fatal) bugs, despite months            of beta testing. There are rumours that a beta version was            mistakenly released by Electronic Arts, possibly as a result of a            disgruntled employee, and despite denials from the publisher the            fact that the game installs debug drivers and an empty log file            titled memoryleaks.txt is certainly rather odd.                    But whatever the causes of the bugs and shortcomings, the fact is            that there is still no sign of the patch which was supposed to be            available ~shortly~ according to an official post on the Lionhead            messageboards dated April 5th. Until that patch arrives it's hard            to recommend the game to anyone, and even once it is available            Black & White is likely to remain a game that you will either            love or hate.                        -        Peter                    Molyneux interview (Part One)                Peter                    Molyneux interview (Part One)                Peter                    Molyneux interview (Part Two)                Peter                    Molyneux interview (Part Two)                Black                    & White previewBlack                    & White preview"}
