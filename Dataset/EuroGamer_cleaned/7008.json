Directed by Edward Zwick (~The Siege~, ~Shakespeare In Love~),            Glory tells the story of the 54th Massachusetts, the first negro            regiment to fight for the Union during the Civil War. Facing racial            discrimination from their own side and the threat of execution if            captured by the Confederates, the men of the 54th proved themselves            in battle at a terrible cost. But their sacrifice helped to inspire            180,000 black men to volunteer for the Union army over the            following years, something which President Lincoln described as            helping to change the course of the war.                    The result is a rousing but tragic story of courage in the face of            terrible adversity, including an Oscar-winning performance from            Denzel Washington as an escaped slave who volunteers for the            regiment, and a typically dignified turn from Morgan Freeman as the            elderly Sergeant who acts as a spiritual leader for the men.            Meanwhile Matthew ~Ferris Bueller~ Broderick puts in the            performance of his life as the young Colonel Robert Gould Shaw,            proving that when he is given a good script he can act as well as            the next man. Sadly most of his time since Glory has been wasted on            tripe like ~Godzilla~ and ~Inspector Gadget~...                    Colonel Shaw and his men had to struggle even to see active duty,            as the army remained unconvinced that negro troops were suitable            for combat. As a result much of the early stages of the movie is            taken up by the 54th's training, as a brutal Irish drill instructor            helps to turn a group of runaway slaves into an effective fighting            unit.                    But as movies like ~Full Metal Jacket~ have proven, boot camp can            be just as interesting a place as the battlefield. The 54th are            treated as second class soldiers; even getting uniforms and shoes            for his men proves to be a struggle for Shaw, and the military            refuses to pay them the full wage earned by white soldiers,            earmarking them for manual labour only. In one of the most moving            scenes of the entire movie, Denzel Washington's character is tied            to a cart wheel and flogged for desertion after he was caught            leaving the camp trying to find some boots, his feet sore and            covered in blood, his back covered in weals from being whipped by            his master before he escaped slavery.                    Even after they have left the training camp they find themselves            relegated to the kind of work they would have expected as slaves            rather than soldiers. By the time they see their first action half            of the movie has passed, but these early scenes establishing the            characters and following their transition from ~contraband~ to            soldiers are excellent in their own right.                    And once the battle scenes start it soon becomes obvious that they            were well worth the wait. Despite the relatively modest budget of            the movie the battles are amongst the most spectacular of their            kind ever filmed. It's hard not to cringe as the soldiers line up            on either side, advance at a walking pace to within a hundred feet            of each other and then let loose devastating volleys of rifle fire            as the entire battlefield vanishes into a choking cloud of smoke.                    Compared to action movies the gore is relatively restrained, apart            from one memorable scene involving an artillery shell and an            exploding head, but the fights are so brutal that they bring home            the sheer futility of the tactics of the time. The air is always            thick with smoke from the gunpowder, and once the carefully formed            lines meet they soon disintegrate into a chaotic melee of bayonets,            pistols and swords. The climactic night time battle as the 54th try            to storm Fort Wagner at the end of the movie is simply stunning,            eerily lit by flares and explosions.                    The whole thing is accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack by James            Horner (~Titanic~, ~Aliens~) which is built around traditional            music of the period and does a great job of enhancing the mood of            the film, ranging from sombre to uplifting. With excellent            direction and choreography, a great script, and top performances            from all of the actors, Glory is probably the best Civil War movie            ever made, and ranks as one of the best war movies of any kind to            grace the big screen in recent years.                    This great movie is backed up by a superb DVD here in the UK, with            sharp and well-defined pictures at a widescreen friendly 1:1.85            ratio and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack which is used            to great effect to bring the army camps to life, as well as in the            numerous battle scenes.                    There is also a whole slew of extra features on the disc, including            an above average director's commentary from Edward Zwick, which            gives an insight into the making of the movie and some of the            tricks which were used to make the relatively small number of            extras and stunt men available for most of the scenes fill out the            spectacular battles. Interesting and at times amusing, only            occassionally does it lapse into the traditional ~this actor is            really great~ school of commentary, and overall it's well worth a            listen.                    The disc also includes no less than three featurettes, ranging from            an eight minute making-of feature filmed at the time of the movie's            cinematic release to the sprawling 45 minute documentary about the            real life 54th, narrated by Morgan Freeman, which was originally            included on the 1991 VHS release of the film. Including shots from            the film as well as out-takes and footage of re-enactments, while            it may be a little long-winded for some it does give an interesting            look at the facts behind the fiction, as well as continuing the            54th's story beyond the battle for Fort Wagner which marks the end            of the movie. The final feature is the 20 minute ~Glory : The            Making Of History~, which mostly focuses on exploring individual            scenes, including excerpts from the director's commentary and            interviews with other members of the cast and crew.                    There are two deleted scenes (one of which was definitely best left            deleted) totalling six minutes, an isolated musical score allowing            you to admire James Horner's work uninterrupted by musketry and            cannon fire, and trailers for two other Denzel Washington movies -            ~The Bone Collector~ and ~Devil In A Blue Dress~. Finally there are            short ~talent profiles~ on the director and stars, although these            are essentially just glorified (sorry) filmographies.                    Even if (like me) you already own Glory on video, this DVD edition            is still well worth buying for the host of extra features and the            high quality widescreen transfer. And if you don't already have a            copy of this film, you owe it to yourself to buy one! Note that            while this disc is only available here in the UK, a very similar            package is being released in the USA on January 30th, spread across            two discs to accommodate additional audio tracks and subtitles.
