Blizzard's WarCraft III saw the series take a radical            new direction earlier this year, earning rave reviews and an            overwhelmingly positive reception from its fans, and now it's the            turn of Microsoft's franchise, Age of Empires, to show off its new            colours with its third incarnation, Age of Mythology.        On the surface at least, Age of Mythology seems to have rather            a lot in common with WarCraft III in terms of what's been added.            Like WarCraft, Age of Mythology takes the basic gameplay of the            earlier games in the series, adds significantly enhanced story            aspects, RPG-like hero characters and a selection of more complex,            plot-driven missions, then wraps the whole lot up in a 3D engine.            As a result, the two games are destined to be compared at every            turn - which is somewhat unfair, because behind these superficial            similarities lie two very different types of game.                    Where WarCraft III moved heavily into the realms of RPG gameplay,            with heroes who level up and a focus on micro-management of small            numbers of units, Age of Mythology has gone in almost entirely the            opposite direction, going instead for gameplay focused around huge            numbers of units and heroes who, outside of their duties in            carrying the plot forward, are really no more than powerful special            units. At its most basic level, Age of Mythology strays far less            from the path of the traditional RTS than WarCraft III did - while            still managing to innovate within the boundaries of the franchise            itself.        The key            difference between Age of Mythology and earlier titles in the            franchise - and it's this that is the reason for the change of            title as well - is the addition of mythological units, powers and            gods. Advancing through the ages of the game now requires that you            choose a new god to worship with each advancement - giving you a            highly customisable selection of godly powers, mythological            creatures and civilisation enhancements to play with, depending on            which god you choose at each advancement.                    Obviously, with this, any semblance of historical accuracy carried            by the original games goes out the window - the single-player            campaign starts with Atlantis being attacked by Krakens, to give            you some idea of the scale of mythological silliness we're talking            about here. To the credit of the developers, however, they've done            a vast amount of homework in researching the ancient mythologies            they cover in the game - namely Greek, Egyptian and Norse - which            makes the game feel just as cohesive and consistent as its            predecessors.        The big question, of            course, is whether the addition of powerful hero units and            mythological units - never mind godly powers - unbalances the            gameplay. Thankfully, Ensemble Studios has not lost its touch, and            the more fantastical units fit in perfectly alongside traditional            infantry, archers and siege weapons, which are the mainstay of Age            of Empires gameplay. Rather than making mythological units more            powerful than anything else on the battlefield, the developer has            chosen to simply add them into the complex rock, paper, scissors            game which underlies any good real-time strategy title.                    God powers are equally well balanced, although they can sometimes            feel rather pathetically weak for commands which are meant to            represent the intervention of deities in the affairs of men. Those            of us brought up in faiths which wax lyrical about rains of fire on            Sodom and Gomorrah may be somewhat disappointed to note that Zeus,            father of the gods, won't stretch himself beyond a quick            thunderbolt that kills a single unit, while the rather promising            Plague of Serpents ability summons a shower of the weakest snakes            you've ever encountered. Each ability can only be used once,            although there are so many of them that in general you'll be able            to find one that improves your personal playing style.        Although the range            of customisations available to each race in the game is huge,            thanks to the various different gods demanding worship, long-time            fans of the series may be somewhat disappointed by the miniscule            number of initial races to choose from. Ensemble has taken a leaf            from Blizzard's book on this particular topic, providing three            races with very different types of gameplay, and then aiming to            satisfy traditional AoE fans with the ability to customise those            races further. The approach works well; compared to the almost            identical races offered to the player in earlier games in the            series, the three central races in Age of Mythology are            entertainingly different and players will probably play with each            of them for a while before settling on their favourite.                    The single-player campaign provides a good grounding in how each            race works, providing a single narrative thread that runs through            campaigns as each of the races. The storyline itself is relatively            entertaining, borrowing aspects from a variety of ancient myths and            using WarCraft-style in-engine cut scenes to advance the plot.            Missions in single player are varied and generally a lot of fun,            with a good gradient on the difficulty curve which makes the game            challenging but certainly not frustratingly difficult, even for a            relatively unskilled RTS player.        Moving into three dimensions            hasn't made much of an impact on the way Age of Mythology plays,            although the developer has tweaked a few things to take advantage            of the new graphics engine. Building placement no longer conforms            to a strict grid, for example, with the player able to drop down            buildings anywhere that there's room for them - particularly useful            when constructing walls and other defences. In general, the whole            game seems smoother and slicker, and not even with dozens of units            on screen does the frame rate take a hit. The view can also be            zoomed out significantly further than it could in WarCraft III,            which is a good thing in our view since one of the most annoying            aspects of WarCraft III over extended play was the downright            claustrophobic camera.                    Audio-wise, the music in Age of Mythology is quite good -            particularly the rousing title theme of the game - although it            can't quite compare to the superb orchestral score which            accompanied WarCraft III. There's really not much to write home            about here in terms of sound effects, either. As with its            predecessors, AoM takes the time to make sure that each race has            accurately recorded sounds, so peasants and soldiers acknowledge            orders in their native languages - a nice touch, but that's about            the height of it as far as sounds go.                    Age of Mythology is certainly going to suffer badly by comparison            to WarCraft III. The latter game is very innovative and has            production values higher than just about any game ever released on            the PC, while Age of Mythology is simply a worthy successor to an            excellent series. It's in that context that it's most fair to judge            AoM - as a game which improves upon its predecessors and will            provide hours and hours of entertainment for fans of the Age of            Empires titles or of traditional RTS gameplay. WarCraft III is            simply in a league of its own, and there's no real reason not to            own both games if you're an RTS fan."}
