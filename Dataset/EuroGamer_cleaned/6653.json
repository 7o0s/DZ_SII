A rich tapestry of military insight and clever            storytelling they may be, but if we wanted long-winded descriptions            of American weaponry and terrorist threats, we'd subscribe to bin            Laden's newsletter. It's only thanks to the likes of Rainbow Six            and Splinter Cell (which jostle competitively for position near the            top of our All Time Greats list) that we can say we enjoy his work.                    And as a result, the Xbox Live enabled Ghost Recon was quickly            stolen (using our Splinter Cell super sleuth skills) and rapidly            absorbed (using our Rainbow Six briefing mental assimilation            technique), and now here we are ready to report.        Set in 2008, Ghost Recon tackles the            possibility of an ultra-nationalist group of Russians trying to            rebuild the Soviet empire, by causing/influencing problems in            nearby states and amalgamating them into a huge red bloc once more.            You play the lead in a specialist team of US Green Berets nicknamed            'Ghosts', employed to counter any threats in their infancy, and            with the utmost discretion. And violence.                    But instead of plunging you into the midst of a big fancy maze full            of scripted sequences and clumsily controlled AI squad mates,            developer Red Storm has managed to build up a hugely cerebral            tactical shooter. As well as leading the Ghosts, who come in two            teams (Alpha and Bravo) and several flavours (Sniper, Rifleman,            heavy weapons based Support and Demolitions), you can also switch            from man to man at the touch of a button, organise their movements            with waypoints using the in-game squad management system and            effectively play co-operatively - with yourself.                    The controls aren't as complicated as you might expect either. The            keyboard/mouse FPS control scheme has been adapted to the Xbox pad            with precision to rival Halo's, and GR-specific tricks have made            the transition intelligently, like the ability to stand, crouch and            crawl depending on the situation (D-pad) and pull up the map and            team info overlay (left trigger). In short, whenever the interface            calls for a PC approach, Red Storm has come up with a chunky,            primary coloured console alternative of the same depth.                    Sadly Red Storm's technical expertise did not stretch as far in the            visuals department. Soldiers are amply detailed, but the game world            looks merely adequate - more Operation Flashpoint than Halo - with            big, poorly detailed open spaces (featuring lots of questionable            foliage), a draw distance that isn't all it could be and an            abundance of fog. Given a fairly saucy environment (with buildings,            caves, etc), Red Storm can perform, but graphics whores won't be            blown away. Audiophiles, on the other hand, will no doubt            appreciate the 5.1 surround sound, accentuating every whistling            bullet and Soviet yelp.        Given the state            of the tremendously shoddy training mode (with huge, half screen            obscuring windows featuring one line of text, voiceovers which            interrupt each other or fail to kick in at all and inadequate            explanation of the controls), it's a good thing we're not too short            tempered. Once you start playing it, the mood changes.                    Campaign mode is the central preoccupation for single players, with            a diverse range of missions - usually to do with rescuing hostages,            taking out encampments or cleaning cave networks of Al Jazeerah            film crews - and complicated tactics are the norm. Often the            expansive environments play host to several key mission objectives,            and it'll take some serious thought on your part to retrieve a            prisoner without losing a single man from either squad - worth            doing, because each picks up skill points after a successful            mission, which go toward their Weapons, Endurance, Stealth and            Leadership attributes.                    Single player fun doesn't stop with campaign mode, either. There            are also various Quick missions to complete in four modes            (Firefight, Recon, Mission and Defend), and by finishing the game            you unlock seriously beefy, experienced soldiers to lend the game a            new slant. And finishing Ghost Recon on the highest skill level,            Veteran, is a task that would certainly test Rambo's mettle.        It's safe to say that Ghost Recon isn't going to last lonesome            players forever, and beyond getting all your troops through alive            and playing with your beefy super soldiers, replay value is almost            negligible. However, taken online Ghost Recon has the sort of            timeless lure of PC classic Counter-Strike, and versus the            substandard Whacked!, the acquired, bittersweet taste of            MechAssault and the efforts of MotoGP, it's the only proper            co-operative game Live really has, where free-for-alls play second            fiddle.                    Sadly though, and despite a patch from Ubi, things still need a bit            of fixing up, with the odd bug (and usually they are odd) popping            up here and there in the oldest of FPS traditions. Otherwise though            it's incredibly smooth and lag free, and completing missions in            groups, outwitting AI or even human controlled enemies in the            process, can be tremendous fun.                    But there is a problem that blights Ghost Recon on Live, and it's            nothing to do with the game itself. It's the players. We only hope            that someone, somewhere compiles a list of the Gamertags of these            bastards who go around shooting their teammates, just so we            know who to ignore and ban. There are always servers to play on,            and games in progress of every description, but if you plan to play            co-operatively you're going to have to get used to people on your            team shooting you in the head to get past you, shooting you in the            head because it's ~funny~, and shooting you in the head because            you're new and apparently everyone has to go from fresh meat to            Dutch from Predator in the space of one game. Does it spoil the            experience that much? Yes, it really does.                    Ghost Recon is a fantastic port - and unquestionably best on Xbox -            but it suffers in part thanks to last century's tech and in part            because pathetic team killing gits thrive in the current Live            community. We would recommend it to fans of the PC game with Live            access, because you deserve a decent online version of it, and it's            definitely among the finest tactical blasters we've encountered.            But if you enjoy scratching braindead insignia into train windows,            hurling abuse at passers by and nutting your friends for a cheap            laugh, then please go away and die instead."}
