However, the last instalment in the venerable Thunder Force series was still bloody good; and thanks to the decision to stick with 2D backgrounds for much of the game (while keeping foreground objects in 3D), it still looks damn pretty even now.In essence, it's a side-scrolling shooter not unlike many you've played before, but any shooter can really be judged on two qualities - level design, and the combat ~hook~. Thunder Force V's developers had been doing this for a decade, and it showed; the level design was almost flawless, the bosses perfectly tuned, and the attack patterns ideally balanced between challenge and frustration. The hook, too, was interesting; collecting ~CRAW~ power-ups that floated outside your ship essentially gave you limited shields and extra weapon turrets, and you could deplete the power of one of your CRAWs to fire a powerful Over Weapon shot and take out nastier enemies. A very solid shooter, in other words, which deserved far more credit than it received - not least because any shooter with bosses called Deep Purple and Iron Maiden is alright in our book."}
