{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-emi-pc", "date": "9 Dec 2000", "game_name": "Reviews", "text": "Ever since Monkey Island 3, every new adventure game has been            labelled a death knell for the genre, a swansong, and (somewhat            unfairly), most have been judged as such. The truth is, the genre            is alive and kicking, it just doesn't move as swiftly as its            counterparts in the first person shoot 'em up field. It's alive and            well, have no fear. With Stupid Invaders just about to be released            in this country, and now Escape From Monkey Island, it's a            surprisingly busy Christmas period in fact, and a welcome change.                         Escape From Monkey Island, like its predecessors, is a very funny            game. But unlike those previous adventures, it takes on a wholly 3D            perspective, using an updated version of the Grim Fandango engine,            abandoning the once-great SCUMM system for which Lucasarts became            known.                         The conversion to 3D is faultless, and familiar characters like            Otis and Elaine look splendid in their multi-dimensional threads.            Guybrush himself is slighty stouter than I remember him, especially            after spending time with the elongated characters of MK3, but when            coupled with his new setting looks perfect. Elaine is beautiful,            and new characters like Mr. Cheese and the villainous Charles Le            Charles have been painstakingly modelled. The style is remniscent            of Grim Fandango, but different. The cartoony, piratey world of            previous adventures is retained, dousing red hot fears that            Lucasarts might opt for a more 'realistic' approach with soothing            rush of insult firefighting no doubt.                         The other benefit of using the Grim engine is that control is            entirely keyboard based. There's no 'look for an object you can            click on and select it' here, you control Guybrush with the cursor            keys and wander around the Tri-Island area. The various locations            are modelled in true 3D but with superbly-rendered textures. The            placement of the camera is perfect in more or less every situation,            with none of the obscuring angles that were occasionally criticized            in Grim.                    Actually, the camera angles make EMI incredibly easy to control.            You move Guybrush to and fro, and whenever he nears something that            he can interact with, a textual description of it appears at the            bottom of the screen. If more than one item is available, it joins            the list, and when you have scrolled down to the description you            want using the Page up and down keys, you either Use, Examine or            Pick them up, Your inventory is now cyclic, rather like Tomb            Raider's, so that when you are examining the contents you move them            round and round in an invisible circle until you've selected what            you want.                         This system is simple and effective in every situation. For            instance, you find yourself stuck in a bank vault with an open            safety deposit box, a broken sword and some sea sponge. You examine            everything and decide the best thing to do is try and break the            door off its hinges to escape. You break one hinge with the sword            but the other one seems a bridge too far, so you cycle through the            inventory and find the bits of sponge, selecting them and thinking            'I'll wedge those in the gap'. You select a small piece, select            'Use small sponge with lower hinge' with the Page up and down keys,            hit enter and Guybrush shoves it in. I won't spoil the rest of the            puzzle, but like every puzzle and conversation in the game, the            intuitive control system never intrudes upon the player's actions.            In previous games I'd thought 'sod it, this is too fiddly'... not            here.                         As usual the superb graphics and effective controls are            accompanied by some lovely music. Some piratey tunes from the            previous games are rehashed, and there are also original tunes,            with hip and happy rhythms. The voice-acting is also very good,            with some sterling performances from Guybrush and Elaine in            particular. In fact, I didn't encounter even one character whose            voice I disliked. The deliverance of the lines is crucial to make            the gags count, and at times it's utterly superb. The first time            you talk to the barman in the SCUMM Bar, for instance, you get            bored of begging him for free booze and express a need to 'go'.            ~Aye, well, grog'll do that.~                    Of course, a game like Escape From Monkey Island doesn't sell on            programming excellence alone, it needs to be well written and            funny. Although some of the jokes are a bit too            self-referential (this really is a game for fans of the series by            the way), on the whole it's good, solid humour. There aren't as            many belly-laughs, but everything is amusing, and at times            laugh-out-loud so.                         The plot is as imaginative as Monkey Island ever was. An            Australian land developer is buying up properties in the Tri-Island            area and redeveloping them. Where he can't buy, he is forcing the            deeds out of unwilling sellers by humiliation. Each owner tends to            be an expert in a certain field, such as Insult Arm-Wrestling, and            when the Australian defeats them, they hand over the deed in shame.            Insults, it seems, have become a way of life for the Islanders,            with most activities now revolving around them. Insult            Sword-Fighting remains, but there is also the aformentioned Insult            Arm-Wrestling amongst other things.                         The immediate problem for Guybrush though, is that he has returned            from his honeymoon with Elaine to discover that her position is at            stake. The islands have assumed that she is dead, and moved to            elect her replacement. Your job at first is to try and get a            restraining order to stop her mansion being pulled down and then to            try and get her back into office! The game develops from there, and            eventually you end up back on Monkey Island, and as the name of the            game implies, it's a helluva job to get off it again.                    Being an adventure game, there's no risk. You can't die, you can            only make the mistake of not completing tasks in the right order.            Until you do, progress will be haulted. The game is at times very            difficult too, so you are given plenty of opportunity to try and            figure out just what the heck to do and take everything in, like            the Termite Circus on Lucre Island.                         The puzzles are as I said damnedly difficult, but they do have a            sort of bizarre logic behind them all. You may be stumped, but the            feeling of elation when you finally work it out easily            counter-balances the frustration you may feel in the process of            extracting a solution. Unorthodox solutions like the 'Use monkey            with wrench' puzzle from MI2 are also fairly rare - unless you're            inexperienced with this type of game, there won't be more than a            handful of occasions where you really have no idea what to do.                         And even if you aren't sure, it's worth persevering, because            Escape From Monkey Island's system of rewarding the player is            second to none. Places like the tourist shop for Guybrush            memorabilia shop offer an incredible opportunity for            self-indulgence and in-jokes that only veteran players will 'get'.            If you have played any of the other three games, EMI will            encapsulate you. Even if you haven't, I would be surprised if you            find it easy to put down. Not only is EMI funny, beautiful, easy on            the ears and challenging enough to keep you occupied for hours on            end, it's built on a strong story with a beginning, a middle and an            end. EMI really is an adventure gaming novel, so to speak, and one            well worth reading.                    I've been playing Escape From Monkey Island for nearly three weeks            now, and although I have finished it, I'm still going back over            bits here and there to relive a few moments. As with most adventure            games, it's startlingly linear, but don't you dare let that rob you            of the experience; this is a game that should be bought, played and            cherished. I imagine that as with the previous titles, in a few            months time I will dig it out of the draw and play through it            again. It's just one of those games."}
