You            can always tell a home grown Sony effort from its American or            Japanese brothers, mainly because of the enormous marketing efforts            that accompany every SCEE-developed release. As well as the recent            Primal Art exhibition, there's been a truck load of advertising and            even a lovely super-rare press pack: a whopping great box with a            claw slash across the front, revealing a lavish character art book            mounted in mock red velvet, and also housing a ribbon tied numbered            art print [which Kristan kept, folks -bitter deputy]. Great stuff;            but isn't it interesting that such beyond-the-call-of-duty efforts            weren't afforded the recent SCEA developed titles Sly Raccoon, and            The Mark of Kri? Both total flops in the UK, we might add, despite            being two of the best games released on the PS2 this year.                    Anyway, yes. Primal. Developed by Sony's Cambridge studio; the same            bods that brought us the two award winning Medieval titles, along            with the technically excellent, but less revered C-12: Final            Resistance. But this is the Big One; its labour of love, where            Chris Sorrell and the team have been given the time and the budget            to create a lavish, deep, dark, adult action adventure that really            shows off their talents and what the PS2 can do.                    Sony wants you to believe in Primal and has constructed an            elaborate back story for the game world, as well as each of its            many characters. The realm that you inhabit during the course of            the game is based somewhere between the mortal world and the            afterlife, where the balance between order and chaos has tipped            dangerously towards the latter. And it's your job, as 21-year-old            coffee bar waitress Jennifer Tate, to sort this sorry mess out.        In a coma after witnessing her rock star boyfriend being            captured by a giant winged demon, Jen has her spirit ripped from            the mortal world by a stone gargoyle called Scree, who insists she            is the chosen one, without properly explaining why this is the            case. Naturally Jen's a tad confused and concerned. All she wants            to do is find her beloved Lewis.                    In true gaming tradition, we stick with whatever plot nonsense is            thrown at us, because we hope that at some point it will start to            make sense. Even if it doesn't, at least there's a decent game to            prop it all up isn't there?                    But the explanations keep on coming (sorry, we are trying to            keep this concise). At the heart of the 'Nexus' sits a being by the            name of Chronos, who is fused to a giant machine. He balances the            forces of order and chaos across the four realms: Solum, Aquis,            Aetha, and Volca, and is having a bit of a rough time of it at the            moment, thanks to the battle between Arella (order) and Abbadon            (chaos). In a nutshell, this area acts as Primal's hub. Jen, with            Scree in tow must visit the four realms in turn and kick whoever's            arse needs it most - which is generally most people.                    With all the longwinded background out of the way, what about the            game? At its core it's a straightforward exploration-based third            person action adventure, with its fair share of puzzle elements,            object collection and combat. At any point the player can switch            between Jen and Scree (by hitting select) in order to progress.            Jen, being tall and svelte, can squeeze through narrow gaps and            shimmy along ledges, as well as kick the crap out of the numerous            minions of doom. Scree, on the other hand, can climb up walls, as            well as drain corpses of energy, and 'possess' statues as a means            to unlocking doors, or to kick the crap out of enemies otherwise            too big to deal with.        Most doors in Primal's world are far too heavy for one person            to open on their own, so guess what? Yes! You have to push/lift            them together. The buddy dynamics can be a tad contrived at times,            in the same way that Resident Evil Zero foists arbitrary puzzles            upon you that only two characters working together could solve, but            at times it can work well in an ICO-esque sense. Insisting that two            characters must open a door together, however, is just plain            annoying after the 15th door.                    Scree also serves as the game's in-game hint provider. Tapping            triangle prompts the noble gargoyle to offer occasionally useful            advice of where to head for next - we say 'occasionally useful' as            for the most part his clues are so obscure as to be practically            worthless. Sometimes, the best bet is to hit the Start button and            observe the map, which will display a symbol to indicate precisely            where you should be heading for next. This is important, as the            environments are sprawling multi-level affairs, and it's easy to            find yourself wandering around cursing bitterly like a headless            Mugwum after 14 Hoegaardens. We can't emphasise enough how            important it is to keep referring to the map, as Primal can            otherwise degenerate into a frustrating aimless wandering farce in            no-time. We're emphasising it, because the game certainly doesn't            point this vital fact out.                    Part way through the first realm, it transpires that Jen is, in            fact, half demon (Devil May Cry, anyone?) and can transform herself            by hitting left on the directional pad. While this undoubtedly            fulfils her ostensibly Gothic ambitions, it makes her a better            fighter, as well as able to perform higher jumps. As you progress,            the range of forms Jen can take increases - for example, in the            Aquis realm, the previously aquaphobic Jen is suddenly blessed with            the ability to swim underwater without breathing, as well as            communicate telepathically. While she assumes this state, she has            limited energy, but is able to draw strength from Scree if he's in            the near vicinity. Should she run out, Jen switches back to her            weakened human form.                    Primal tries hard to take the hassle away from the general,            everyday controls, by removing the need to learn 14 commands, Tomb            Raider-style. Instead, what you get is a context sensitive system            that jumps and crouches as and when required. More specific            commands, such as performing a shimmy onto a narrow ledge, climbing            a rope, pulling a lever, smashing a barrel or opening a door can            all be taken care of with use of the X button in the correct            scenario. Sometimes it feels like you're playing with a straight            jacket on, but it does work reasonably well, allowing the player to            concentrate on the task at hand, without degenerating into a trial            and error exercise in command learning.        Curiously,            the combat commands have been assigned to the shoulder buttons. R1            acts as a block, L2 and R2 deliver a strong blow and finishing move            when performed at the correct time, while L1, L2 and R2            individually deliver context-specific spins, swipes and kicks. Our            preferred method, rather worryingly, was to mash R2, occasionally            pull off the finishing move (certain creatures won't piss off until            you do), and win every single time, no matter how many creatures            tried to eat our face. With no jump command, or individual kick and            punch commands, it very quickly feels like the combat was a            stitched-on afterthought. In earlier builds we convinced ourselves            that the enemy's curious AI must be a quirk that would eventually            be rectified. How wrong can you be?                    Even if a gang of five monsters appear, the ones that you're not            immediately attacking just back off until it's their turn for            punishment. They stand around looking utterly gormless, maybe            occasionally swiping, but provide very little challenge. To say the            combat is a disappointment is the understatement of the PlayStation            era, and given that you can avoid confrontation most of the time            merely highlights the problem. It's as if these drones have been            placed at specific locations to make the world feel more alive,            rather than actually offering the player anything other than an            irritating distraction, and a chance to fire up a turgid,            lamentable Goth rock soundtrack. Without exaggeration, Primal            serves up the limpest attempt at combat that we've seen in a modern            videogame. It may not be the game's staple diet, but playing this            after, say, Indiana Jones, the chasmic gulf in class is there for            all to see.                    And the annoyances don't end there. The camera system is woeful,            and catastrophically short of being an acceptable window to your            world. Anywhere near a restrictive viewpoint it freaks out, often            turning the viewpoint into a twitching, glitching mess. In Aquis,            it's just plain disorientating as you roll and flip underwater            unexpectedly, forcing you to switch the compass display on in a            vain attempt to get your bearings. It's not something that just            happens now and then, either, and conspires to remind you every few            seconds that this is a mere videogame, after all.        The tasks at hand rarely inspire much enjoyment either. Most            often, the game mechanic is thus: visit point A, view cut scene, go            off and get object X, take it to point Y, find out you need to go            and talk to character Z, and cue fisticuffs melee. And that's if            you know where you're supposed to go. The levels are impressively            expansive and carefully crafted, but if you've not been paying 150            per cent attention, the point that Scree suggests that we go and            seek out that ornate locked door, you'll want to smash his stupid            stone face into dust with a mallet.                    So often the game assumes that you'll remember every single            character, location and object that you encounter, and repeatedly            makes reference to things and places you'll have long forgotten            about. As we mentioned earlier, the map displays an icon pointing            out where you're aiming for, but that's never made clear. Metroid            Prime this most certainly is not, and the lack of any kind of 3D            map makes referring to it a painful experience. Of course, you            learn your way around eventually, but only after hours of            repeat visits.                    If it wasn't for the tediously moribund combat, glitchtastic camera            and reliance on repeated exploration, Primal might stand a chance            of being entertaining. In its favour, the storyline is very well            thought out, and provides a credible template for the game. For a            fantasy related story to not bore us to death is a triumph in            itself, although we'd still have to admit that it's not our cup of            freshly drained Ferai blood.                    By far the most impressive aspect of Primal is its visuals. The            game boasts arguably the most detailed, high-res environments the            PS2 has ever seen, and for once we're treated to the full set of            16:9 mode, 60Hz and even Progressive Scan support for those with            the necessary kit. The intricately-crafted character models and            texture-laden environments feature such a staggering attention to            detail, and are seamlessly presented with a Jak & Daxter-esque            no-load streaming data system that very rarely trips up. If there's            one major incentive to owning or playing Primal, it's to experience            one of the best-looking games out there, with a consistently            impressive array of tricks that proves yet again that the PS2 has            plenty up its sleeve.                    It's refreshing, also, to note that the array of cut scenes always            utilise the in-game engine, and are no less impressive for it. If            anyone can think of a more technically impressive PS2 title, then            let us know. A well put together promo video of Primal's glorious            moments would mark it out as a must have title.                    Sadly, the end result is a long way from the intentions: a rank            combat system, quirky camera and a lack of inspiration at the            game's exploration/puzzle core make playing the game hard work. The            bottom line is that Primal is rarely very much fun. Call us            old-fashioned, but isn't having fun the whole point of playing            games?
