Not a bit of it - Urban                 Chaos doesn't tie you down to a linear level structure, but                 instead offers you several routes to take, from several                 missions, in order to achieve different goals.                         There are several training missions for the beginner in combat,            fitness and vehicle driving. Each can cater for various skill            levels and once completed various missions start to reveal            themselves. It doesn't stop there, as within each mission there are            a number of different tasks to complete. All sorts of different            tasks, like preventing suicides and rendezvousing with known            criminals, are available to complete. Due to the non-linear nature            of the game, these missions may only appear once and in one mission            before becoming inaccessible again. The city isn't just a muted            venue either - as a somewhat unpopular city cop you'll face a lot            of verbal abuse from the location's criminal occupant.                         The free-roaming nature of the game isn't all that well            complemented by its graphics. The characters and backgrounds look a            little edgy and badly defined at times. The animation too is a            little jerky and the cop cars a bit clunky, lacking taste.            Sonically the game isn't all that impressive either, they fail to            complement such a clever game otherwise. The sound effects are            surprisingly atmospheric, even if the musical interludes lack            proverbial punch. The echoing hoots of the back street gangland and            the voice-overs of the central characters are suitably plush, if a            little questionable in the latter            case. The gameplay is the single factor                 that keeps Urban Chaos from sinking though. It's involving and                 imaginative. The city sprawls in all directions before you and                 it's full of characters to interact with. From the suited                 businessmen hurrying around to the young men and women going                 about their daily business, everyone is happy to stop and chat                 to you, be it about current cases, or just a hunch on your                 part. And if they annoy you enough, you can nick 'em!                         Like Grand Theft Auto and Driver, you have free reign over the            city and what you do. In contrast with these other similarly themed            titles though, the occupants of the city are fully interactive, as            is much of the scenery. If you see someone walking down the street,            you can walk up to them and have a chat, arrest them and throw them            into the brig, beat them up or even gun them down. Your options are            endless, but you must beware that if you don't behave yourself you            may just find yourself in trouble with your work-mates.             Being an evil law-disenforcer                 isn't what Urban Chaos is all about however. A group of                 occultists are attempting to aid Nostradamus' predictions of                 Armageddon for the year 1999 in whatever ways that they can.                 Havoc reigns supreme and your job is to try and prevent them                 from achieving their goals. It's a deep and engrossing plot                 that twists and contorts as you play.                    Urban Chaos offers a lot of enjoyment for your pound (Euro?) and            will definitely keep you occupied for several weeks. If you enjoy            Tomb Raider style games, this will appeal greatly to you, and if            you like adventure games, the same is true. There's very little            available on the market right now with this level of interactivity.            Even though the graphics and music let it down a little bit, the            atmospheric sound effects and gameplay are quite the opposite.                    In conclusion, Urban Chaos is fantastic fun to play. Graphically it            isn't all that impressive for the platform, but the depth of the            title is astounding at times and the amount of different things            that you can do is quite phenomenal.                         Would I recommend you to pick up Urban Chaos for the Playstation?            Well, if you have a suitable PC, I'd suggest that you purchase that            version instead, but on the Playstation it does the job almost as            well.                        - Out Now"}
