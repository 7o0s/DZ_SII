You play a British secret agent with the unlikely name of Red,            carrying out a series of dangerous missions behind enemy lines. You            will find yourself assassinating Russian officers, blowing up dams,            destroying V1-style rocket launch ramps, and stealing documents            from Russian army bases. The missions are just varied enough to            keep things interesting, and although the first person shooter            sections of the game don't shine, they are still vaguely amusing.                    If Infinite Loop had left it at that they would have had an            enjoyable if unremarkable game... But instead they decided to let            you drive a wide range of vehicles as well, including tanks,            trucks, motorbikes, boats and even aircraft, and this is where the            game falls down.                    The problem is that the vehicle sections of the game are poorly            implemented, and just don't suit a game that is designed to be            played entirely with the mouse and keyboard. I'm no flight sim fan,            but I can at least keep a plane in the air in most games. In            Codename Eagle though the controls are unresponsive, the physics            are truly crazy, and the planes all handle like pigs.                    Actually, that's an insult to pigs...         Infinite Loop have also decided to totally ignore the                 laws of physics.                    In one mission you have to steal a Russian plane to escape after a            raid, which should be easy. Except that there is a bloody great            mountain at the far end of the runway, and it's almost impossible            to get your plane to pull up steeply enough to clear it without            stalling. Crash into the slope as you try to gain altitude though            and your plane usually just sits itself on the cliff face and then            tries vainly to drive up the side of it. This kind of stupidity is            sadly all too common in Codename Eagle.                    In another mission you get to sail a small boat across a lake.            Unfortunately the developers apparently forgot that boats can only            sail in water, and if you find a beach with a gentle enough slope            you can actually take the boat clear out of the lake and ~sail~ it            over hills, along roads, and across bridges, all the time floating            in the air a few feet off the ground.                    In fact, it's actually easier to ~drive~ the boat than any of the            land vehicles, which all seem to suffer from severe understeer at            high speeds, powersliding around almost uncontrollably whenever you            try to steer them. In a hardcore rally game this kind of behaviour            would be fine, even admirable. But this is an action game, and you            are supposed to be shooting at people with your turret guns as well            as struggling to control your vehicle. Besides, if this was a rally            game I would be using a steering wheel to drive with, not a mouse            and keyboard...         The                 choice of camera views doesn't help matters much either...                    It's almost impossible to hit anything firing a gun from the third            person chase cam view, but at the same time it's almost impossible            to drive most of the vehicles from a first person view because you            can't see the vehicle around you, and so have no idea of how big it            is, often crashing into objects that seemed to be well out of the            way.                    On the other hand, I found it hard to control the planes from the            third person view because of the way the camera lags behind the            plane when you turn, but I couldn't hit anything with my bombs from            the first person view because I couldn't see where they were            falling.                    Then there are the mission scripting problems. In one mission you            are supposed to assassinate a Russian General, sniping him from a            church tower as his car stops at a checkpoint at a bridge. For a            start off the car doesn't stop - even if you kill the man at the            sentry post, the barrier across the road lifts as if by magic as            soon as the first armoured car in the General's escort gets near            it, and your target never even slows down.                    Then there's the bug that left me waiting for half an hour in the            church tower for the General to arrive. And if you have graphics            detail set to ~low~ in the options menu, the fogging is so severe            that you never even see the General as he drives through the            mist-shrouded village below you. Whoops.                    Luckily my machine (a P2-300) is powerful enough to handle ~medium~            detail at a reasonable framerate most of the time, but given that            the graphics are rather unremarkable by today's standards, I'm            surprised that the game requires so much horsepower for so little            apparent benefit.                    With mission-based first person shooters all the vogue at the            moment, and the promise of being able to drive such a wide range of            land, air and water based vehicles, Codename Eagle was a very            promising game. Unfortunately the reality is rather disappointing.                    The voice acting is so bad it's funny, although I'm not convinced            the humour is entirely intentional. The accents are appallingly            cliched, and way off mark - the British characters all sound like            an American's idea of an English aristocrat, and the Russians sound            like Chekov from Star Trek crossed with a drunken Scotsman. The            plot is also pretty dire, with a hilarious plot twist that makes            the ~Luke, I am your father~ scene from The Empire Strikes Back            look positively inspired by comparison.                    The graphics are adequate but unimpressive most of the time, the            controls are poorly suited to the mouse and keyboard combination            the game is aimed at, the vehicles' ~physics~ are laughable, and            the whole thing feels hackneyed and uninspired. AI ranges from dumb            to dumber, with soldiers happily ignoring nearby alarms and gun            fire.                    Strangely, a couple of people have told me that the multiplayer is            actually quite good, especially in Capture The Flag mode. Sadly I            haven't been able to test it for myself though, because nobody            actually plays the game online, and I don't have a LAN handy.                    If you can find someone to play online with it might be worth a            look. Otherwise this is one to avoid..."}
