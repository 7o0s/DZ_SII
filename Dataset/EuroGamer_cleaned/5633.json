But Microsoft stuck to their tried and tested model of ~if we can't            make it, let's buy someone who can~, and bought up some talented            design studios dotted around the world. Midtown and Motocross            Madness did much to boost their credibility, but for many the            pivotal game was Age of Empires.                    This isometric strategy game had millions hooked for months. The            winning combination of classic real time strategy gameplay and            controlling real people, rather than faceless tanks, brought a            breath of fresh air to the genre.                    Cue Ensemble Studios            and the sequel - ~Age of Empires II : The Age of Kings~.                    Boasting a mountain of improvements, and an all-new graphics            engine, Age of Kings promises to satisfy die-hard fans of the            original, while also enticing new players into the genre.         For those not familiar with the series, here is the            game in a nutshell - you take control of a small group of villagers            from a particular civilisation and start with humble beginnings in            medieval times.                    You guide them through a unique evolutionary maze of technology            until they are strong enough to defeat the enemy.                    Of course, any decent game transcends the sum of its parts, and AoE            II is no exception. The list of new features and improvements over            the original game is over a page long, so here is a brief summary :                            13 new civilisations, each with a unique unit and team                    bonus                                    13 new civilisations, each with a unique unit and team                    bonus                                    New units, including kings, heroes, female villagers,                    knights, cannons and exploding ships.                                    New units, including kings, heroes, female villagers,                    knights, cannons and exploding ships.                                    8 new map types, including Arabia, Black Forest and Rivers,                    from a total of 15.                                    8 new map types, including Arabia, Black Forest and Rivers,                    from a total of 15.                                    New ways to trade with other players over land, buying and                    selling resources at the Market.                                    New ways to trade with other players over land, buying and                    selling resources at the Market.                                    New combat features - order military units to patrol,                    guard, or follow, and use formations to precisely control                    how your army moves during combat. You can also garrison                    units inside buildings for protection, healing, and                    surprise attacks.                                    New combat features - order military units to patrol,                    guard, or follow, and use formations to precisely control                    how your army moves during combat. You can also garrison                    units inside buildings for protection, healing, and                    surprise attacks.                            There are five single player campaigns, including William Wallace's            battle with the English, Joan of Arc's struggle against the            English, and Genghis Khan fighting, not the English again, but the            mighty Persian Empire.         Proving that you don't have to have a                 rotatey-zoomy\u2122 engine to be good looking, the game is                 played from a fixed isometric point of view. It supports                 resolutions up to 1280 x 1024 though for super crisp, high-res                 graphics.                    The minimum spec is low and, surprisingly these days, the game            actually runs acceptably at this level, even at 800 x 600. Increase            the RAM to 64Mb and add a good graphics card and you can happily            run at 1024x768 or higher if you have a mid-range Pentium II.                    Overall I was impressed by the graphics, despite their bitmapped            origin - all the buildings have been modelled to a very high detail            in 3D before being converted to 2D sprites, and all the tiny            characters have unique details to separate them from others. It is            easy to distinguish units simply by the way they are dressed, or by            the tools or weapons they are carrying.                    Each of the 13 civilisations has its own unique style of buildings            and dress, as well as its own unique technology tree. In the box            comes a large fold-out map of all the races and the units they can            build.                    The technology tree is divided into four ~ages~ - Dark Age, Feudal            Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age. You must construct the necessary            pre-requisite buildings and have enough resources to advance to the            next age.                    Once there you are able to use a whole new group of structures and            weapons. For example, once you have built a Barracks in the Dark            Age, you can train villagers to become Militia. Once you graduate            to the Feudal Age, you gain access to Men-at-Arms, who in turn give            rise to Long Swordsman, Two-handed Swordsman, and finally Champion            in the final Imperial Age.         The gameplay will be familiar to fans of the first            game, but with enough new features and improvements to keep them            satisfied.                    Gamers new to the series are treated to an in-depth manual, and            there are excellent tutorial campaigns, slowly introducing each new            unit and building one at a time. There are a lot of things to think            about, but you are gently reminded of the fundamentals every now            and then - ~Don't forget - keep exploring the map!~.                    This ensures that you get into the habit of doing several tasks at            once, and to keep checking their progress so you can give new            orders.                    To make sure all your villagers are working at peak efficiency            there is a new function which is so obvious you wonder why it has            taken so long for someone to think of it. Just click on the ~Idle            Villager~ icon and, hey presto, the screen focuses on the nearest            idle villager. It's not exactly rocket science, but you would be            surprised how useful it is.                    The sound in AOE II really enhances the whole gameplay experience,            and again, it is the attention to detail and subtle touches that            elevate this game above its rivals.                    For starters, each civilisation speaks its own language, so units            respond in the appropriate accent. I think this helps the player            really bond with their villagers - it gives them a personality,            rather than the standard ~Acknowledged~ grunt of military RTS            games.                    The addition of female units also adds the variety, although            everyone is equal - the women are just a capable as the men.                    It's hard to describe, but it's just the general ambient sounds of            busy villagers getting on with their work - woodsmen chopping,            farmers harvesting, the hustle and bustle of the market - that            helps you become immersed in the game.         Many subtle improvements have been made to the            multiplayer experience as well to help make everything a little            fairer, and a damn sight more tactical.                    Gone are the days when you could simply make a handful of the            appropriately lethal unit and then stomp your opposition in the            first five minutes - vulnerable villagers are now able to take            refuge inside buildings until the danger has passed.                    In larger multiplayer maps, an attitude of ~me vs the world~ will            very rarely end in victory. Strategic alliances with other players            are crucial, allowing you to trade resources and mount joint            attacks on the enemy.                    A rather handy feature are the ally-friendly gates in your            perimeter walls - they will open for you and your allies, but slam            shut on the enemy. You can focus on other areas happy in the            knowledge that your mates can come and go as they please, but the            enemy will be repelled.                    For a bit of variation, there is also a new type of multiplayer            game called Regicide. The principle is similar to Chess, though on            a larger scale. Everyone starts with a King, some buildings, and a            few villagers. You battle against the other teams, protecting your            King and trying to kill theirs. The winner is the last King            standing.                    It's good fun, as it opens the game to sneak attacks and suicide            runs, as the only thing that matters is the death of their King.            But don't leave yours open to counter attacks...         I never got into the original game, yet I find                 AoE II enchanting. The sheer depth of the technology tree and                 evolution of the civilisation are always a surprise.                    I particularly like the intuitive logic that makes battles more            tactical. Archers are good at medium range attack, but weak at            hand-to-hand combat. To get past an enemy wall, you can use a            battering ram, or catapult over it. This may all sound obvious, but            it forces you to have a range of units in your arsenal - no single            unit type can dominate a map.                    With AoE II, Ensemble seem to have stumbled on to a unique            combination that might amount to the gaming holy grail.                    It is a sequel that is better than the original, with enough new            material to satisfy die-hard fans of the original, yet a subtle            learning curve to not intimidate new players.                    The single player skirmish mode coupled with the varied campaigns            make for a solid single player experience, and the multiplayer is            about as tactical as you can get, which makes a nice change from            the typical ~tank-rush~ of other games.                    It appeals to people of all ages, and should find fans among the            fairer sex, many of whom already play AoE.                    And it is strangely playable on low-end systems, as well as top of            the range hardware. How many games can you say that about?            Release Date - available now"}
