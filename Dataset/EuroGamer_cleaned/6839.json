In Europe, on the other hand, punters are more            likely to be watching a Formula One car bumping through a chicane            or some nutter flying down a narrow forest dirt track in the middle            of the night amidst a cloud of gravel and dust.                        Which brings us to Rallisport Challenge, developed right here in            Europe by Digital Illusions and cherry picked by Microsoft to help            them launch the Xbox on this side of the pond. And what a catch it            is. With its fast paced arcade-style action, stunning graphics and            wide range of insane events to take part in, it is without doubt            the single most entertaining title in the Xbox launch line-up. If            you don't have a grin the size of a hairpin corner on your face            after a couple of hours with this, you should have your pulse            checked.                        The game's tracks are split between rally, rallycross, ice racing            and hill climb events. The rally stages are traditional A to B            affairs, spread over three locations - the sandy African Safari,            winding Mediterranean stages with a mix of dirt and tarmac            surfaces, and heavily forested Pacific mud tracks. Hill climbs are            much the same, but take you anything up to 500m up the side of a            mountain, with sheer drops and rocky cliffs on either side of the            road. In both cases you will be racing against the clock, with only            one car on track at a time. Rallycross events, on the other hand,            involve four rally cars racing head-to-head around a dirt track,            while ice racing takes this action out on to slippery snow and ice            circuits. All of these tracks are purely fictional, but the design            is mostly impeccable and they offer a wide range of challenges and            experiences.                    The game's real genius though is in the way the cars handle as you            career at high speed over mud, sand, gravel and ice, giving you a            feeling of being completely in control. There's nothing quite like            speeding down a straight, slamming the brakes on, hurling the            steering wheel to full lock and sliding flawlessly into the next            straight, wheels spinning in a cloud of dust as the tires scramble            to find some grip.                        That's not to say the game is easy - keeping all four wheels            pointing in the right direction can be difficult at times - but the            handling of your car is utterly consistent and the feedback the            game constantly supplies leaves you in absolutely no doubt of what            is happening at any given moment. Part of this is down to the            continual throbbing of the Xbox controller in your hand, showing            off the Xbox's superb force feedback hardware to great effect. As            you speed down a stretch of tarmac the pad will gently vibrate in            your hand, becoming a low rumbling as you sweep around a sandy            corner, and then a violent shaking as you spin off the track and            career through the bushes. If a stray traffic cone gets caught            under the front of your car you will usually feel it before you see            or hear it.                        If you're not entirely happy with the way your car is handling, you            can always tweak your setup before the race begins. This isn't a            hardcore sim so you won't be able to adjust your ride height to the            nearest micrometer, but you do get some basic options. For example,            you can trade off speed against acceleration by selecting short,            medium or long gear ratios, change your brake and power            distribution between front, medium and rear, and choose which kind            of tyre you want. Usually the defaults will get you through a race            without any problems, but you can often improve your performance by            altering the setup to better suit your driving style or the            circuit's characteristics.                    If your choice of car just isn't working out for you though, you            can always switch to another one. Rallisport Challenge features            around thirty vehicles, from rally favourites like the Ford Focus            Cosworth to wild customised cars, including the long sleek lines of            the Toyota Tacoma Hill Climb special - a real handful, and a marvel            to look at.                        Naturally not all of these vehicles are available from the outset,            and in true Gran Turismo style you must unlock aditional tracks and            cars by working your way through the Career Mode. This is a fairly            straightforward affair in which you earn points to unlock the next            tier of events, taking you from Pro through Skilled and Classic to            Unlimited. Each tier has its own set of championships to complete,            ranging from three to nine races long, and you will need to win            most of these to accrue enough points to continue.                        It's at this point that you discover the game doesn't feature quite            as many tracks as you initially believed, as higher level            championships often share some of the stages that you cut your            teeth on at Pro level. Don't let this worry you though - driving a            much more powerful car down the same track can often prove to be a            whole new experience, and sometimes the game will try to catch you            out by sending you through a rally stage back to front. Some of the            rallycross circuits also reappear with a thin coat of the white            stuff in ice racing championships, but the change of surface makes            for a radically different race.                    Every time you unlock a tier, all of the new tracks included in its            championships also become available in single race and time attack            modes. Single race does exactly what it says on the can, putting            you and three other cars on any track (even normally solo rally            stages) and leaving you to duke it out, while time attack allows            you to hone your skills and work towards the perfect lap, with an            optional ghost car showing your previous best lap as comparison.                        And you'll need all the practice you can get if you dare to take on            the euphemistically named ~Normal~ difficulty level. It's not that            the AI cars put up a stiff resistance (although they do), it's the            unforgiving championship structure. You only have one chance            to get each circuit right, and if you foul up it can ruin your            entire championship, forcing you to start again from scratch. While            this isn't too bad for a typical three or four race season, trying            to master every circuit and consistently win every event through a            nine race season is incredibly hard. Completing this epic Pro Rally            World Cup is necessary to unlock the second tier, and it acts as a            daunting learning cliff to less experienced racers.                        If you drop down to ~Beginner~ level you will discover that you can            now restart races as often as you like. Sadly your rivals are also            much slower on this skill level, leaving me finishing half a minute            ahead of the rest of the pack in some events. Things do get much            more challenging in later championships, but I found the balance a            little uneven at times. Ideally Rallisport would have included an            Easy level between Normal and Beginner, allowing you to restart            races but with the same high quality of opposition found on the            harder level. As it is your only choice is between bloody hard and            rather easy.                    Apart from this one fly in the ointment though, Rallisport            Challenge is a stupendous game. Even when you're getting            comprehensively beaten it's still a joy to play, and if you get            bored of racing against the AI you can always indulge in some            excellent four player splitscreen action with your friends. There's            nary a slowdown in sight, no obvious scenery pop-up, and some            spectacular scenery to take in. All in all one of the most            entertaining motor racing games we've come across, and the shining            star in the Xbox's launch line-up. What are you waiting for?
