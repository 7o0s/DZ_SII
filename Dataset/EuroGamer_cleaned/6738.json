Own up, I know exactly what you thought; you thought ~boobies~, and you were quite right. Tecmo will forever be known for their pneumatic fighting series Dead or Alive and little else, and it's a myth they seem only too keen to perpetuate with their forthcoming contender for most gratuitous game of all time, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. And if you're struggling to think of what else they've made, it's hardly a surprise - but their latest release, arriving via French publisher Wanadoo, shows that this is a team that knows how to thrill in more ways than one.            Project Zero doesn't exactly arrive burdened down with            expectations. Wanadoo is fairly new to this whole game publishing            lark, Tecmo aren't exactly veterans of survival horror, and most            tellingly of all - we thought - the game carries a budget price            point, retailing at an RRP of \u00a329.99 (but available for as            little as \u00a320 if you shop around). The signs were not good;            the signs couldn't have been more wrong. Far from being            budget-priced tat, this is one of the most intelligent, terrifying            and downright superb games the PS2 has yet seen.                           The basic plot of Project Zero is simple, if a little bizarre. In            the prologue section of the game - which is entirely played in a            strange black and white film effect, with washed out sepia and grey            tones the order of the day - you play an effeminate young chap            called Mafuyu Hinasaki, who has followed a benefactor of his, a            famous mystery novelist, to a long-deserted mansion in the Japanese            countryside. The novelist and his two assistants went there and            disappeared, and Mafuyu is off to see if he can find them. He            apparently doesn't get very far though, and after some nasty            scares, an ghostly Japanese priestess attacks him and the prologue            comes to an abrupt halt.                    The focus then changes to Mafuyu's younger sister, Miku, who            follows in her brother's ill-conceived footsteps. Is anyone            starting to see a pattern here? Miku is a far more likely candidate            for being a videogame protagonist anyway, being a late-teens            Japanese girl in a leather miniskirt and high leather boots - this            game is from the people who brought you Dead or Alive, after all!            There are no high kicking antics here, though; aside from her wits            (well, your wits to be precise), Miku's sole method of self-defence            against evil spirits is an old camera left to her by her mother,            which Mafuyu dropped in the entrance hall of the mansion when he            was attacked in the prologue. The camera can see things which            aren't visible to the naked eye, while taking pictures of            aggressive ghosts damages them - combined with Miku's ability to            sense the supernatural when it's near her, this is basically all            that lies between you and a particularly grisly death.                           Hang on - evil spirits, aggressive ghosts and grisly death? I'm            getting ahead of myself a bit. First, a word about the graphics -            which are, quite frankly, superb. Everything in the game is            real-time, with not a touch of FMV in sight - but rather than the            crisp, clean edges we're used to in videogames, Tecmo have used the            unusual graphics hardware of the PS2 to generate ~noise~ effects on            the screen. These range from fully-blown ~aged film~ effects,            complete with vertical black lines moving across the screen, to            simple film-style speckling and noise in some places. The clever            combined use of these effects, along with the highly detailed and            expressive character models and utterly creepy surroundings, make            for a very cinematic experience indeed. The camera positioning is            also excellent in places, using horror film tricks to add to a            sense of unease. You are being watched...                    Unease is a sensation you'll get used to when playing Project Zero.            Shock, disgust, fright and the feeling of your flesh crawling are            also sensations which will become second nature. This is a survival            horror game unlike any other survival horror game; the only            sensible comparison we can draw is with the original Silent Hill,            which utilised similar camera and movement systems, and also used a            torch in the character's hand as its main source of illumination,            as Project Zero does. However, both Silent Hill and the granddaddy            of survival horror, Resident Evil, take their inspiration from            American horror movies; Silent Hill from the freakish horror of            David Cronenberg and his ilk, Resident Evil from the shambling            zombie B-movies of George Romero.                           Project Zero stays close to home for its inspiration, tapping into            the rich seam of gory and unpleasant Japanese folklore tales which            spawned such cerebral excursions into terror as the Ring series of            movies. In fact, Ring (and its sequels, Ring 2 and Ring 0) are the            films which Project Zero most reminded us of; with several very            obvious homages to the movies in the game. The hideous apparitions,            written clues, pieces of diary and research paper and tape            cassettes you find gradually add up to a fully coherent back story            of immense cruelty and evil which is in itself more shocking and            unpleasant than any of the foes you'll face in the game - this            isn't a game which you'll forget once you finish it, but one whose            story may well come back to haunt your dreams for years.                    The single biggest puzzle, of course, is the question of what            happened at the creepy, abandoned Himura mansion, which is the            setting for the entire game. Although the mansion is huge, you'll            be running around bits of it over and over again as you attempt to            piece together the mysteries of the past and find your lost            brother. It never becomes boring, however, as pathways through the            mansion change, doors mysteriously lock and unlock and new items            appear as you play. While some of the puzzles in the game are            fiendish, they are all logical and it's generally obvious what            exactly you need to be doing, even if you're not always sure how to            accomplish it. Unlike Resident Evil titles, which occasionally            frustrate players utterly with illogical puzzles (why on earth            would I need an eagle crest to get into the bathroom, for god's            sake!) or Silent Hill, which sometimes went so far out of its way            to be creepy and weird that it lost the plot entirely, Project Zero            stays focused and everything makes sense - even if sometimes, it's            not a kind of sense you particularly want to think about.                           Compelling and utterly addictive, this is a game which drags you            into its web and won't let you go until you've finished it. It's            intelligent, scary and unsettling, providing a fresh and unexplored            angle to the survival horror genre in a highly polished and slickly            presented package. We did encounter one show-stopping bug near the            start of the game, where something messed up and doors which should            have opened failed to do so and we had to restart, but a lack of            complaints or comments online suggests that we were just very            unlucky. Overall, this is a game which you simply must buy if            you're a fan of survival horror, or of the Ring movies, or of            horror in general; and it's one which deserves pride of place in            your collection even if you're just a gamer looking for something a            bit different. It's no stretch of the truth to call this one of the            best games on the PS2, and probably the best game released in            several months. While Tecmo is unlikely to stop being a by-word for            boobies, it'll now also bear overtones of the very best in            spine-chilling horror."}
