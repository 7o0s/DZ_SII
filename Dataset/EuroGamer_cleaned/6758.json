Apparently the evil Dr Ooze is turning animals            into strange geometric shapes, and it's up to you to take control            of the Ark and its fleet of ZooCubes to return the unfortunate            creatures to their natural form.                        Obviously this involves capturing them two by two (it's an Ark,            alright), and this being a puzzle game you'll achieve this by            spinning and rotating your Cube around all three axes to catch the            poor creatures, who pile up on the Cube's six faces. When two            identical shapes line up next to each other they both vanish in a            puff of smoke and you get some points. As with any good puzzle game            it's a ridiculously simple concept, but one which gets ever more            complex as each level passes.                        At the start of the game you only have to deal with one shape at a            time, and there are only six different varieties, one for each face            of your Cube. Gradually things get more frantic though, as two or            more shapes arrive in quick succession and you find yourself            dealing with anything up to two dozen different shapes, some of            which can look quite similar. Bonus points can be earned by            collecting little icons that appear floating off the end of a line            of shapes, or by clearing the Cube, or balancing it so that it has            the same number of shapes on every axis, or...                    The main game is the ~Classic~ mode, in which you need to rescue a            set number of animals to progress to the next level. Once you've            done this the level is unlocked, allowing you to jump directly to            that point in the game next time you play.                        As the action hots up, lines of shapes will start to stretch            outwards from each face of your Cube, and if you get too many in            one pile they eventually reach the edge of the screen and it's game            over. Luckily the piles can be shuffled by hitting the right            shoulder button, allowing you to bring the shape you want to the            business end of the line, and you have a limited number of smart            bombs which will blow up one shape on each axis. There's also a            helpful display which shows you what the next two or three inbound            shapes will be and which direction they will arrive from, giving            you time to get yourself pointing in the right direction. Hit the A            button and the nearest shape to the Cube will be locked on to that            axis and dragged inexorably towards it, even if you're busy            frantically spinning the Cube to catch another shape. At first this            is just a way of scoring a few more points, but as you get further            into the game's seven levels it becomes absolutely vital.                        You can also unlock levels for the KO and KO Blind modes, which            start you off with a Cube with one of each type of shape already            attached to it, leaving you to match the appropriate block to the            inbound ones as they appear from the edges of the screen. This also            pops up in the Classic mode in the form of KO Bonus levels, which            are sometimes triggered when you completely clear the Cube of all            shapes. Meanwhile the KO Blind mode builds on the KO mode and makes            it harder to identify the shapes by turning them all grey unless            there's a matching one on the same axis.                    While this describes the basic mechanics of the game, you really            have to play ZooCube for yourself to appreciate how it all adds up            to an enjoyable little puzzle game. The graphics are colourful, the            gameplay simple yet effective, and although seven levels might            sound like slim pickings, it will take many hours to unlock them            all in Classic mode, nevermind in the KO and KO Blind modes. And            then of course there's the choice of co-operative or competitive            two player link modes. It's all good clean fun, and makes ZooCube            arguably the best example of its genre on the GameBoy Advance to            date."}
