The concept of a sequel being its own            game is completely alien to the average gamer, and it's for this            reason that Driver 2 suffers so badly. In its own right it could be            just about playable, but with the original still fresh in many            people's minds it's going to take a lot of flack.                         This is because, if we're honest, Driver 2 isn't a very good game.            Reflections have decided to focus on minor niggles in the Driver            code instead of tightening up some of the big issues that plagued            the previous game. As such these problems (including pop-up amongst            other things) are accentuated, and because the engine is so            over-stretched in places, the game even locks up at times, and the            framerate is ghastly.                         But where did it all go wrong? Well it starts right at the            beginning. The whole concept of you, Tanner, the undercover cop was            clich\u00e9d to begin with, but by focusing so heavily on the            driving angle the first game worked. It started out hard by making            you learn advanced techniques in the underground garage and it then            let you sit back whilst it eased you gradually into higher gear            until you were fighting the steering wheel against the clock in            later missions. Even so, the challenges were definitely            proportionate to the feeling of satisfaction gained from victory.                    In contrast, Driver 2 vanquishes the proving grounds because it            seems they were too hard, and instead throws you directly into the            action without any real schooling. And thanks to the fluctuating            difficulty level this is going to be quite a major problem. The            first couple of missions are like a leisurely drive to the edge of            a cliff on a summer's day, but the third is like driving down the            side of it, only to have your fall broken by the cushy fourth,            which introduces you to the next series, which are a bit like            driving back up the cliff in a torrential downpour. Then repeat;            it's erratic and no real fun at all. The learning curve must look            like a join-the-dots picture.                         To go back to the original again, you may remember the overly            cumbersome cutscenes, and how one of the best aspects of the game            was that by ignoring them completely you could still have immense            fun. Driver 2 includes even longer scenes with even less favourable            production, and ultimately requires you to pay attention. This is            actually quite a chore, and thanks to their cryptic nature you            never really have a clue what's going on anyway.                         Things don't get much better if you look elsewhere either. The            alternative modes, Gate Chase, Quick Chase, CTF, Take a Ride,            Survivor and Checkpoint have all seen some level of alteration as            well, with some available in two-player. Playing with two players            is no more boring or interesting than otherwise, and because the            camera is fixed to the front of the car you don't see any real drop            in framerate (although it was terrible to start with so don't get            your hopes up).                    The most obvious addition to the Driver formula is the ability to            step outside of your vehicle for the first time. This might sound            like a step in the right direction, after all it's what we had all            expected to be able to do anyway, but in the end it's too            restrictive in what it lets you do. That said, at least it adds            some variety. The fixed camera makes controlling it and using it            effectively stodgy and awkward though, something I'd like to think            could have been avoided if the title weren't so rushed.                         So what else is new? Well the addition of curved roads will allow            a large group of Driver fans to emit a sigh of relief, but to be            honest; they're in the wrong game. And as if to add insult to            injury, they emphasize the stuttering car animations as you            gradually turn off freeways.                         Graphically, the stuttering animations aren't the only subject of            demur. For all their cheesiness and mind-dulling boredom, the            cutscenes are professionally filmed with some very lifelike human            behaviour, but in-game, where the emphasis should have lain, is a            mess. The framerate as previously mentioned is atrocious, and the            pop-up is awful, with buildings only a few blocks away leaping up            in front of you. Things look slightly duller than before, and the            low resolution remains. On balance it's quite obvious that the            Driver engine is being pushed beyond what it can really deal with,            a fact made most obvious by the way the game actually crashed on me            twice.                    It certainly does sound bad. If you thought the Driver soundtrack            was awful, you will deride D2's with a similar level of dismay. The            Cuban, blues and other rhythms are a joke and ruin the atmosphere,            and after a matter of minutes the soundtrack becomes unbearable.                         The sound effects are still in place and if they have changed I            didn't notice it. The smashing and crashing as windows cave in and            the clash of upset piles of crates as you thunder down back alleys            remain with all their onomatopoeic effectiveness, but when one of            the only upsides to a game is the sound effect score, you know            you're clutching at straws, very soon to slip beyond hope of            retrieval over the precipice and into the dull, murky depths below.                         And that's what Driver 2 feels like. It feels like the developers            spent the entire development cycle attempting to pull themselves            back from the brink, and just when they looked like they had a            chance of pulling through, the unfinished code was plucked from            them, served up in a PSX jewel case and shoved onto store shelves            in time to beat the PlayStation 2 out of the blocks and give the            PSOne something to sell on.                    I was one of Driver's biggest fans before I played this. Now the            series has been trodden on, reshaped and served up as an            entr\u00e9e for its master the PSOne. If ever there was an            opportunity to indict that console as a Sony cash cow this would be            it. Bottom line; do not buy this game, buy the original if you            don't already have it."}
