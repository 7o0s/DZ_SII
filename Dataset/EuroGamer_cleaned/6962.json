Either way, Sega            didn't hold out on us too long, and one of the most understated            aspects of its final run of Dreamcast releases is a pseudo-sequel            to House of the Dead 2 called ~Confidential Mission~.                         The game met with critical acclaim when put on display at last            week's Electronic Entertainment Expo, but there are a number of            things this writer didn't like about it, starting with the            characters themselves.                         The games gives you control of a James Bond-esque fella, Howard            Gibson, and his sassy sidekick Jean Clifford. Since it's one of my            pet hates about games of this sort, I'll start with the voice            acting, which is predictably dire. Howard sounds like a Japanese            man trying to emulate an American doing an impression of Pierce            Brosnan. Jean's voice is fairly effeminate on the other hand, if a            little too weak for someone who blows people's brains out, and most            of the bad guys sound like Rick Moranis in Spaceballs.                         Moving on, there's the equally detestable            bobbing-the-camera-to-simulate-movement irk. For most of the game            you stand in full view of your attackers shooting at them as they            appear. It's certainly no Time Crisis, but it isn't difficult to            spot when you're on the move, and it does not require the hilarious            bobbing antics that have been a trait of all light gun titles from            the original Virtua Cop to the present day.                    The story is a knocked off Goldeneye spy satellite drama, starting            you off in a museum of antiquities shooting your way through            history in pursuit of a short little fat man with a computer disc.            Instead of just blasting the whole time, the developer has opted to            include small sub-games, the earliest example of which crops up            when Howard and Jean get caught in a room that's filling with            poison gas. Using adhesive bullets, Howard is given 10 seconds to            plug the five vents above. If he manages it, it's a bunch of points            and off you go. If he doesn't, it's sub-mission failed and the            screen goes wavy for about half a minute while the poison wears            off.                         I didn't think much of these little distractions at first (more in            a moment), until I noted that one of two of them actually changed            the course of your movement through the levels. In the first level            Jean pulls out a Rope launcher and you have the task of hitting a            target on the opposite side of the courtyard. If you manage it, you            can zoom down the line and through a window, whereas if you don't            you have to take the long way round and fight off even more guards.                    Going back to the first point though, the reason I took issue with            the sub-missions (particularly the adhesive bullets one) was the            difficulty involved in hitting the target enough within the ten            seconds whilst moving the gun away to reload. Even with a properly            calibrated gun, hitting the target is less of a science and more of            a fluke, which takes the fun out of these little sub-missions and a            lot of the sections later on where enemies are perched two hundred            feet away in a pillbox.                         The poor controls aren't really Sega's fault - it's been a problem            with light gun games on the Dreamcast since day one. Oh, and make            sure your television isn't in some weird mode. I had mine in 16:9            instead of 4:3 for a minute or so and most of my shots were a            couple of centimetres high or low. Speaking of which, if you don't            have a 21~ or larger television, don't even bother buying            Confidential Mission, or any other light gun game. The later            levels, even on low difficulty, will be quite frustrating.                         In a way though, it's a blessing in disguise for Sega, since            although it becomes next to impossible to beat off the attentions            of five or six assailants with one clip in later levels, there's            always a desire to continue or restart, if only to find out what            happens if you do succeed in that sub-mission in Level x.                    Poorly calibrated controls and cute sub-missions may conceal the            linearity of the game for a few moments, but once completed (for me            about an hour after turning the Dreamcast on for the first            time), you'll have no trouble spotting how narrow the paths you            tread really are.                         All in all, it's a colour by numbers Virtua Cop game in fancy            dress, with virtually nothing to distinguish it from earlier            efforts, except the odd diversionary sub-mission and a few training            scenarios. The graphics are good, albeit very Virtua Cop-ish, and            the same targeting system is used as well. Although it's worth            playing through a couple of times, if you're like me you will have            difficulty mustering the energy to continue after the cascade of            unshootable heat-seaking rockets from the game's second big boss            take you down one credit yet again. You can't escape the feeling            that games of this ilk have no real future in the single player            arena.                         Even in multiplayer, unless you own two light guns (and lets face            it, who does), you'll rarely get full enjoyment out of it. The            final levels are virtually impossible to complete with a gamepad (I            managed it only once in nearly a week's solid play), so unless you            buy another gun, Confidential Mission will be as short-lived as the            voice-acting career of whoever played Howard Gibson. Our            recommendation is that you buy a second hand copy of House of the            Dead 2 - Confidential Mission is only a mite better than that            anyway.                        -        Nightmares and                    DreamscapesNightmares and                    Dreamscapes"}
