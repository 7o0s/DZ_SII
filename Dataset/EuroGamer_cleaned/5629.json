{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/thiefgold", "date": "4 Jul 2006", "game_name": "Thief Dark Project Gold", "text": "~Thief : The Dark                 Project~ was first released at the end of 1998, just sneaking                 into the stores in time to pick up my ~Game Of The Year -                 1998~ award. Half-Life? Never heard of it...                    The emphasis in Thief is on stealth rather than combat. As Garrett,            the master thief of the title, you have an uncanny ability to hide            in shadows. Find a dark corner and you will be almost invisible to            guards and other characters.                    The idea is to break into a location, steal everything you can lay            your hands on, and then leave without anybody knowing you were            there. Which is easier said than done...                    The game can be nerve-wreckingly tense at times, and the only way            to play it is late at night with the lights turned out and the            speakers turned up. Literally - the game is so dark that you simply            can't play it during the daytime!                    The whole thing is driven along by an excellent plot that takes in            secretive cults, magical items, satanic rituals, and the end of the            world along the way.                    Drawn cutscenes between the missions give you a wider sense of            purpose than simply taking from the rich and giving to yourself,            and along with the steampunk mix of technology and magic it all            adds up to a sinister and atmospheric experience.         Now, almost                 a year later, we have ~Thief Gold~. Essentially this is the                 ~Director's Cut~, featuring another faction to rob, three new                 levels, and digitally remastered versions of a few of the                 other maps. Or something like that.                    The ~new~ maps and characters fit seamlessly into the middle of the            plot, complete with their own cutscenes. Which is hardly surprising            as they were actually part of the original design.                    Lack of time forced Looking Glass to cut the maps first time round,            but now they have finished them and added them back into the game.            Thief Gold is Thief as it should have been, the designer's original            vision for the game made whole.                    But does it live up to its promise? Well .. yes, and no.                    The biggest problem is that the new faction, the mages, are a bunch            of pansies. They speak in big booming voices that make them sound            like Death from a Terry Pratchett novel (ALWAYS SPEAKING IN CAPITAL            LETTERS), and they come out with lines like ~You cannot change my            destiny~, and ~I shall return in larger numbers~.                    And while their magic powers look pretty and cause lots of damage,            the mages take a couple of seconds to cast a spell. Simply whacking            them over and over again with your sword will usually prevent them            from damaging you.                    Sadly they serve more as comic relief than credible bad guys...         The three new levels are                 a mixed bunch as well.                    The first one (in which you have to rob a thieves' guild hideout)            is excellent - the map is massive, the design good, and the            gameplay very challenging, especially on higher difficulty            settings. This one alone took me two or three hours to finish!                    Then comes the mage's tower, which is a bit of a let down .. not            least because it is full of mages. The texturing isn't particularly            good either, and there is far too much jumping between flying rocks            and leaping about above pools of lava. Thief is a first person            sneaker, not a 3D platform game!                    The last of the new maps is rather good though, starting in a            network of caves before you emerge into a fully modelled opera            house. The design and texturing of the opera house is amongst the            best in the game, and the relative lack of shadows to hide in makes            it quite hard as well. There are also some nice touches, including            a singer warming up for the night's performance.                    Of course, Thief Gold also includes all the levels from the            original game, and they are as good as ever. Constantine's mansion            is a particular high point, a trippy Escher-esque nightmare where            walls, floors and ceilings are interchangable.                    To be honest, I didn't see much sign of the changes that have been            made to the original levels, except that mages and their guards            have replaced the zombies in the Lost City map.                    That actually makes quite an improvement though, as before you            could complete one section of the city by simply outrunning the            zombies. With mages and archers around, that isn't an option            anymore.                    The Lost City was always one of the game's best maps, and now it's            even better...         Graphics-wise, Thief is                 beginning to show its age. The game was already well overdue                 when it was released last Christmas, and the graphics engine                 was hardly state of the art to begin with. Another year on it                 is looking a bit rusty.                    Where Thief really does shine though is in the audio department -            the use of sound and music is simply the best I've ever heard in a            computer game.                    Footsteps echo through the level, changing as a character moves            from grass to gravel to paving to carpet, adding a whole new            dimension to the game. You often depend on your ears more than your            eyes to judge where someone is and where they are going.                    Guards stop and chat with each other, whining about their dinner            being delivered late, or complaining that they don't get paid            enough. The religious Hammerites wander around muttering prayers            and ritual chants to themselves.                    As well as helping you locate where guards are, it all adds to the            atmosphere, and there's something strangely satisfying in sneaking            past a pair of guards as they discuss their orders to watch out for            a thief.                    Music is also used to great effect, varying from total silence to            pulsing industrial techno, with a range of droning noises and            ambient sweeps in between. It is always in the background though,            and adds to the atmosphere without interfering with the gameplay.                    Other games could learn a lot from Thief when it comes to sound.         If you missed Thief the first                 time round, go buy Thief Gold NOW! Although the graphics are a                 little ropey in places the game is still a classic, and at                 just \u00a315 you can't go wrong.                    For those of us who have played the original game to death already,            it is a little harder to recommend though. Three new missions            aren't much for your money, especially as one of them isn't            particularly good.                    On the bright side, those three missions should add five or six            hours of extra play to the game, and it gives you a good excuse to            play through Thief again while you wait for the sequel, ~Thief 2 :            The Metal Age~. There's even a nifty ~Making Of~ film on the CD,            featuring interviews with the team working on the new game.                    And let's face it, if you enjoyed the game the first time, don't            you think Looking Glass deserve some more of your hard earned cash?"}
