They seem to have made up the core pre-requisite in                 most 2D fighting game design documents for many a year. There                 are 10 Combatants, each of whom heralds a few unique special                 abilities. The ferocity of these abilities is dictated by the                 increasing rage and animosity toward the opponent, represented                 by a Power Bar at the foot of the screen. Vibrations from the                 Dual Shock controller, which is fully supported by the game,                 further demonstrate this ferocity.                         While many of the Capcom and SNK titles that dominate this genre            offer well-known characters that we can relate to, Guilty Gear's            crew aren't too shabby. I felt a lot more endeared to them than I            had expected to as I struggled through the Single Player game, and            while there is always a sort of standoffishness about playing with            any beat-em-up character in Multi Player, I developed my favourites            very quickly and learnt how to most effectively make use of their            respective arsenals.                         The actual combat was frenetic - the action is fast, fast, fast,            and the combination manoeuvres border on the absurd. The developers            have evidently spent a lot of time balancing the game out however,            because the actual length of the bouts is not significantly less            than most 2D beat-em-ups, presumably thanks to the time and effort            put into creating the right balance of executive speed and damage            infliction.         2D beat-em-up graphics have been                 just about ~done~ to excess, with the limited collection of                 different techniques appearing in a multitude of titles across                 a variety of formats. The classic ~cartoon~ look suits Guilty                 Gear perfectly - it's got a lot in common with Street Fighter                 Alpha's pen-and-ink style. Of course it's been done a hundred                 times before, but it lends itself well and the presentation is                 very fluid - even more so than that found in Capcom titles                 such as SF Alpha! With some games, there is an air of                 awkwardness to be found with the navigation of menus and such.                 Guilty Gear feels very                 sleek. The animations of the characters                 are very nice, with a suitable amount of frames afforded to                 each movement and special manoeuvre. While sometimes fairly                 over-the-top in order to accentuate the viciousness of the                 attack or combo, the character fighting animations are usually                 suitable, and don't go anywhere near as far as the                 unbelievable repertoire exhibited in Marvel Vs. Capcom.                    Although as I have said, the gameplay is very finely tuned, the one            or two exceptions to the rule upset the balance somewhat. Some of            the moves to be carried out simply cause too much damage, and when            in the hands of the fiendish computer AI they're devastating.            That's my other concern with Guilty Gear; that the AI is unfairly            well versed in beating down on you with impunity. I'm sure that            I've said before on these pages that it's incredibly hard to get            computer AI ~just right~ in beat-em-ups, 2D or otherwise.            Programmers that have been living and breathing the title for many            months frequently have its ins and outs locked down so tightly that            they mis-program the AI for their own level of experience, as they            are not wholly sure of how well the average gamer will take to the            title. That's my theory anyway. Of course, if you play enough Multi            Player against a similarly talented gamer, you'll gradually become            a more veritable opponent for the computer, but otherwise you may            find yourself rather frustrated soon after beginning.                         Thankfully, these two faults aren't enough to dislodge Guilty Gear            from its position of sanctity amongst my favourite 2D beat-em-ups.         If 2D beat-em-ups are moving                 toward extinction, they really are ending on a high note with                 stuff like this. 3D really just doesn't have that same                 old-skool feel when it comes to beat-em-ups. Still, if I                 wanted something to remember the genre by, Guilty Gear's just                 as good an example as anything, creating a less-than-subtle                 blend of Street Fighter Alpha, 20 cups of coffee and a class-A                 drug. The visual effects are astoundingly fluid, the controls                 wonderfully responsive and the overall experience pleasurable.
