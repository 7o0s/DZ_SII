Visually though,            Tecmo has achieved what no other developer has so far managed to do            with the Xbox hardware.                         The game's opening screens are a testament to Tecmo's prowess with            the Xbox graphics chip. The title screen, for instance, is simply a            logo overlaid on a flyby of a random stage from the game, and it            looks absolutely stunning. Be it the incandescent mid-afternoon            atmosphere of the beach stage or the cold, hard lines of a            glasshouse perched atop a neon-endowed skyscraper, the graphics            leave a strong impression. They also carry Tecmo's Dead or Alive 3            on their shoulders.                         Character design and animation is absolutely stunning, with            hundreds upon thousands of frames spent on the fine details like            the way hair flaps around in the wind and the effect of being            hurled to the ground on the lacy bits of Leifang's outfit, as well            as more substantial details like Kasumi's bouncing bosom and Tina's            stunning curves. All right. Parents, this game is a wet dream            waiting to happen. If you want to stimulate growth, buy your teens            an Xbox with a copy of Dead or Alive 3, and watch them sprout hairs            and ogle the girl next door when they think your back is turned.                    Having said that, I am informed by capricious members of the            opposite sex that this approach is quite insulting, not so much            because of the brazen display of flesh, but because the blokes            allegedly do about as much to stir the tender hearts of young women            as I do. In fact, ruminations from a whole lounge full of young            ladies seemed to involve skewering the developer for obviously            failing to hire any women to help perfect the models. ~It's like            drawing a picture of fruit based on a potato~, apparently.                         Nevertheless Dead or Alive 3 is visually spectacular for more            reasons than your average game, with a dazzling take on the fairer            sex for us blokes to lap up (along with some helpful grunts and            screams during each round) as well as an array of gentlemen from            young to old and nimble to husky. There's also plenty of variety            and a wide choice of costumes to deck them all out in.                         Each character has a specific fighting style, which gives them a            few handfuls of moves (kindly detailed in the manual), many of            which are a joy to behold. The bending of bodies and clash of flesh            and nature is very powerful. Furthermore, the use of            processor-hungry effects like fluttering leaves in the forest level            and precipitation elsewhere, not to mention feet splashing in            puddles and shattering glass, are at just the right level that the            Xbox doesn't flinch under the strain, and throughout my time with            the game I hardly noticed so much as a dropped frame.                    Sadly Tecmo's ability to wield a graphics chip effectively is let            down elsewhere by lazy design. Many of the game's key features -            including the characters and stages - are lifted verbatim from Dead            or Alive 2, which also managed to do a fairly good job of rendered            breasts. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of the whole game, the            fighting dynamic, is lifted 100 percent from its predecessor. A            Dreamcast and a copy of the game can now be had for the cost of            Dead or Alive 3, and when that's almost exactly the same as buying            this new game even on the newly reduced Xbox, this makes for a poor            killer application.                         The second big problem is actually not Tecmo's fault. With the            analogue stick disabled and Controller S still a fortnight off,            we've been struggling with the regular D-pad, which has proved            turbulent to say the least. You can toggle the analogue stick on            and off, but control is hopeless. More or less every button on the            pad is utilised, but the game might work better without the            reliance on the White and Black buttons, which are awkward to            reach.                        Tecmo also had pressure-sensitive shoulder buttons at its disposal,            and in a game with several characters whose main strength is            wrestling, you don't have to be a game developer to come up with a            creative use for those. Fortunately, complex thumb movements with            the D-pad aren't as important as they were in the likes of Street            Fighter, and big hitting combos become quite easy to string            together after a while, which stands in the game's favour.                    As far as well-stocked beat 'em ups go, Dead or Alive 3 is            resplendent. Apart from Story mode, which charts the tale of each            fighter by way of some breathtaking CG cutscenes and increasingly            difficult battles culminating in a boss encounter, you have Time            Attack mode (a single match consisting of eight fights with a tag            match option), Survival mode (which is a succession of fights            fought until your health is depleted), Tag Battle mode (for one to            four players with a mixture of CPU characters making up the gaps),            and of course a Versus mode. There are also variants such as Tag            Change (where the off-screen character gradually recovers his or            her energy) and Team Battle mode (which is exactly what it sounds            like), as well as a handy sparring mode with varying degrees of CPU            interaction available.                         There are also a number of extras to unlock, and of course            trademark features like the ability to literally bust through the            seams of some levels will breathe a certain amount of life into it.            But ultimately, DOA3's main failure is to be accessible, and more            than that, just plain engaging for newcomers. Many of the            characters are uneven, and a series of battles between two DOA            virgins seemed wholly random in terms of outcome. Sometimes the            lads would pick a pair of matched characters, but for the most part            repetitive hammering of the buttons corresponding to high kicks and            other chainable attacks were the order of the day. Good beat 'em            ups, like Soul Calibur, are easy to hammer your way through with a            degree of depth and nuance to uncover. Dead or Alive 3 is as simple            as the moves pictured in the manual, and with its unparalleled            visuals it feels like a generic tech demonstration rather than a            good game.                    Dead or Alive 3 stands out as a beat 'em up for people who haven't            played the others. It's an also-ran by design, knocked together in            a short space of time using assets employed throughout its            predecessor. It invites criticism from start to stop, but it            definitely has more than its fair share of bouncy breasted heroines            and the finest visuals of any game on the format to date. Coupled            with the average fighting mechanics, for some that will be enough.                        -        Dead or Alive 3                    screenshotsDead or Alive 3                    screenshotsXperienceXperience"}
