But there still remains a contingent of gamers            hell-bent on the visceral thrill of sheer unadulterated            destruction, as proven by the success of Serious Sam, which stole            our hearts by looking great and being fantastic fun. Who cares if            all the bad guys look the same, or if I'm moving at four times the            speed of a normal man and the guns I'm carrying are bigger than my            entire body? Obviously 4D Rulers don't, and they're hoping to            appeal to that contingent by crafting a game that has, in the            finest id tradition, absolutely no depth whatsoever.                         For four long years 4D Rulers must have been completely shut away            from the outside world, because they've come out of their hole with            Gore, a game so shockingly out of touch that everything about it is            three years too late. The textures, models, maps and character            design all look and feel antiquated and smack of a development team            without any ideas. There's an attempt at a story, but it's of no            consequence. Put simply (and trust me, the full version isn't much            more complicated than this), the world has gone mad and is            controlled by the mob. The government decides to construct a team            of unstoppable marines to combat this threat, and one of them            happens to be you. Genius.                         This all boils down to pushing forward through wave after wave of            mindless drones, with no real objectives other than to maim            everything that moves. At least Serious Sam looked good while it            was doing this, but Gore just looks dated. There are tiny glimmers            of conceptual development here and there, such as being able to            select from any one of twelve classes of character, with differing            attributes from speed to weapons. There's also a Day of Defeat            style stamina meter, which depletes whenever your character is            exerting himself through running, jumping and using heavy weapons.            This can add some desperation to the action, but that's about the            extent of the innovation on display. There are of course            multiplayer modes for you to engage in, but why play a            cheap-looking Quake III when the original is waiting for you,            looking all glamorous and modded up to the nines?                    There is no reason for me to recommend that you spend your money on            Gore, unless you're completely desperate for another game that            you've played a dozen times before. It's a shame that 4D Rulers'            first title ended as a product that is so completely irrelevant in            today's gaming climate. Never mind, lads."}
