Yet when Nintendo released Pok\u00e9mon Red back in 1997, even it couldn\u2019t have guessed what would grow from the deceptively simple premise. A TV series? A staggering amount of cuddly merchandise? Highly possessive ten-year olds with the trading skills of a stock exchange veteran? It\u2019s incredible really.Or perhaps not. The truth, which many people are loath to admit, is that Pok\u00e9mon is a masterclass in children\u2019s entertainment. It is not merely a cleverly marketed product of wily old Nintendo - rather it is a genuinely compelling and well-executed series.Despite this, however, you can\u2019t help but feel that the double header that is Pok\u00e9mon Leaf Green/Fire Red is where the franchise takes a discouraging turn for the worse. Not because of a sudden dip in standards, but because of a sudden dip in imagination.Unlike previous sequels in the series, Leaf Green/Fire Red is essentially a remake of the first Pok\u00e9mon games, Red and Blue. So while newcomers will be pleased with how polished and huge the gameplay on offer is, veteran Poke-trainers might be a little miffed at having to tread an altogether familiar path.For the uninitiated (if any exist - hands up who's never played a Pok\u00e9mon game and tell us in less than 25 words why), the basic premise of a Pok\u00e9mon game is to wander around, collect and train monster-pets to do battle in a simple RPG setting. At its heart, the gameplay is pretty straightforward in a Top Trumps kind of sense, with each Pok\u00e9mon having strengths and weaknesses that must be used strategically in battle. For example, a water Pok\u00e9mon will be strong against a fire Pok\u00e9mon. However, each creature can also learn a selection of skills - many of which affect vital stats or inflict ailments - and it is through careful use of these that the more difficult battles will be won or lost.In truth, though, the battle system itself isn\u2019t what makes these games so much fun. Instead, the most satisfying element is best summed up by that most annoying of taglines: \u2018Gotta catch \u2018em all!\u2019 Catching your Pok\u00e9mon, and subsequently raising them, evolving them and turning them into high-level killing machines is insanely compelling.The sense of \u2018ownership\u2019 you get from naming and rearing a Pok\u00e9mon is satisfying in the same way that all good RPGs are: there\u2019s a real sense of accomplishment and control, even if it is just an illusion, or the symptoms of the kind of obsessive compulsive disorder that many of us gamers go through at one time or other.In that regard, this surpasses all other Pok\u00e9mon games before it. It has a huge selection of creatures to capture - most of the Pok\u00e9mon from the other GBA titles are in there - and it keeps on going where the original Red and Blue titles ended, offering high-level challenges to experienced players. It also features the \u2018two-on-two\u2019 battles that weren\u2019t in the first games and is generally the most comprehensive game in the series yet.But that still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that Nintendo has failed to bring anything new to the table with Leaf Green/Fire Red. Surely we have gone through enough of these games to warrant a bit more effort in the innovation department? Even a visual overhaul would be nice at this point.After all, one of the staples of the series is the \u2018evolution\u2019 of Pok\u00e9mon - could the same philosophy not be applied, more liberally, to the gameplay? The one saving grace, in that regard, is the addition of a wireless adapter with both Leaf Green and Fire Red. This basically takes the place of a link cable (though it only works with a few games at present, including Mario Golf Advance Tour) and lets players battle each other and trade Pok\u00e9mon within three feet, and instant chat messaging for them to call each other names. It\u2019s a welcome bonus that\u2019s sure to please the more rabid Pok\u00e9mon fans and their equally rabid friends, but it\u2019s not the extreme shake-up that we\u2019d like to see.You reap what you sow. If Nintendo hadn\u2019t made Leaf Green/Fire Red such a comprehensive example of what has made Pok\u00e9mon so successful, then we would have been far more critical. Instead, it has - just about - earned one last harvest from this series. Newcomers to Pok\u00e9mon can justifiably add a point to the score below, because as a first-time experience it would be addictive, satisfying and value for money. Veteran trainers, on the other hand, need to ask themselves if they want more of the same\u2026 again. If not, then perhaps it\u2019s time for Nintendo to move on to pastures new?Order yours now from Simply Games."}
