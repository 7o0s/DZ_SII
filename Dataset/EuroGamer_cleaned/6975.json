I have a whole shelf of the            things. As a console game reviewer, it's quite important that I            have a decent stock of blocks, so to speak, so whenever I feel the            rumble of change in my pocket on the way home from town, I pop into            my local games store and order three from the top and one from the            bottom. It's become something of a habit, and I need to get out of            it for psychological reasons.                         Not to mention financial ones.                         Which is why, when I first heard about the X-Port, I stammered            with approval and muttered, what a bloody good idea! The X-Port,            you see, allows you to save your PlayStation 2 save files onto your            PC hard-disk, and swap and change them over the Internet.                         Genius, it is, but not without its flaws. And the first one is a            biggie, especially for me. The X-Port doesn't seem to support            Windows 2000. Now, I am a hardened Windows 2000 user, and run            several PCs for various purposes (including a laptop), all wired up            with Microsoft's NT-based consumer/business operating system.            Datel's X-Port instruction manual (and packaging on the whole)            makes no mention of PC software requirements except for a single            line in the instruction manual, which is of course useless if you            are picking it up off the shelf of your local games store.                    Apparently the device requires ~Microsoft Windows 95 or            higher~ (my emphasis, by the way). I took 2000 to be higher            than 95, so duly plugged the USB cable in to my PlayStation 2 at            one end, and my PC at the other. Windows picked up on the USB cable            immediately that I plugged it in, and prompted me for drivers. I            pointed it at the X-Port CD, and it found what it claimed to be a            suitable driver.            *Click*             ~SystemRootSystem32Driversusbio.sys driver could not be            loaded. Error status was 0xc0000221~                         It's not obvious which is the ~correct~ orientation for the cable            (there is a sort of blob, with cable extending from both sides,            each terminating in a USB jack), so I tried it both ways. Same            error. I rebooted with the cable installed (perhaps after all it            was a simple Windows error) and received a stunning blue screen of            death during loadup, attributed to our friend usbio.sys. Out comes            the X-Port, and the machine boots flawlessly. The story is the same            for three separate machines.                         Nonetheless I wasn't going to be deterred in my mission to save            money on expensive PlayStation 2 memory cards by one small            operating system hiccup. After painfully reformatting and            installing Windows Millenium on an old Pentium II system, I was            once again ready to do battle with the X-Port.                         Under Windows Millenium, things were pretty hunky-dory. Installing            took less than five minutes (including reboot) and from there I was            able to transfer back and forth from PS2 memory card to PC hard            disk. To do so, you run the CD in the PS2, and simultaneously run            the software on your PC to cooperate with it. Then it's just a case            of deciding which blocks to put on the memory card.                    The interface on the PlayStation 2 side is fair enough - it's            functional and easy to manipulate with the gamepad. On the PC side            I had no complaints either, apart from the aforementioned Windows            2000 issues. The X-Port software is apparently compatible with the            Datel USB PS2 keyboard, as well.                         One area that the X-Port must win in, is its price. At a smidgeon            under \u00a330, it gives Sony's official memory cards a run for            their money, especially when you compare the laughable capacity of            those to that of your PC hard disk. The ability to swap saves via            email and the Internet is brilliant too. I successfully emailed            several save games to a friend before dashing over with my X-Port            and downloading them to a memory card.                         Unfortunately, you have to own a PlayStation 2 memory card as            well, because the X-Port is simply a method of transferring            files between PlayStation 2 memory card, PC and vice versa. What I            had hoped for, of course, was the ability to save direct to            hard disk from within any PlayStation 2 game. The price of the            X-Port may then be reasonable, but when a memory card is also            required, the total can be up to and over \u00a350, and having to            shift save games back and forth between hard disk and memory card            as required is quite a clunky way of doing things, particularly            when you have to have the X-Port CD in the PS2 drive at the time.                    Another issue about the X-Port, is that most people do not have            their PC in the same room as their PlayStation 2. Datel were lucky            with me, because I have a small PC handling Internet connection            duties and such, just a few feet from my PlayStation 2. The X-Port            cable itself is about two metres in length, meaning that most            people will find it difficult to put to use, unless they lug their            PlayStation 2 into their study every time they want to use it. As            far as I am aware there is no extension available.                         Personally, I had hoped for (and perhaps expected) some sort of            wireless RF system. That may have cost more, but would certainly            have made up for the huge distance in some cases between PS2 and            PC.                         At the end of the day, if you already own a memory card and have            been thinking about buying another, the X-Port can be an excellent            purchase, depending on your needs. If your playing habits are            fairly mild, another memory card may just suffice (and will            certainly save you having to leap up off the couch as often to            switch CDs), but if you play rather a lot of games, and constantly            find yourself agonizing over which blocks to trim, the X-Port can            be invaluable. Ultimately, it's severely flawed, but it does have            its uses.                        -        Play                    your GameBoy games on the PS2!Play                    your GameBoy games on the PS2!Datel                    introduces file-sharing service for PS2Datel                    introduces file-sharing service for PS2"}
