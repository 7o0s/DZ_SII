It's amazing to            think that in a universe dominated by battleships and conflicting            cultures it took this long for the writers to inject some actual            grit into proceedings. Perhaps that's why it feels almost fake            watching Commander Sisco admit that he no longer has the stomach            for casualty reports, or the troops on AR-558 bonding as they            defend the outpost from Jem Hadar. These aren't things I'm            accustomed to watching as a Star Trek fan.                         Somewhat annoyingly though, just as soon as games developers are            given something meaty to get their teeth into, they decide to stop            filling in the blanks and produce a fairly bland, totally linear            strategy romp through space by the numbers. Star Trek: Dominion            Wars concerns the conflict between the bumbling allied forces of            the Federation and Klingon Empire on one side and the ruthless,            never-ending forces of Dominion-controlled Jem Hadar and their            Cardassian allies on the other. Unfortunately it has been done in            classic Star Trek style. In other words, you fly about the galaxy            in big spotless space cruisers shooting the hell out of the enemy.            There's no futility of war stuff, no painful losses, no            character-based storyline worth keeping up with. It feels like            we've gone back to square one.                         That said, the single player game is pretty enjoyable in its own            right. You take on the burden of a fleet of up to six ships, which            you select from a fleet of many more. Your credits can buy you one            or two big ships and some really small ones, or a fleet of mediums.            As you move through the game you get more and more credits, which            fund the upgrade and/or purchase of new vessels. The other thing            you need for your fleet is captains, and you have a decent            selection of those to choose from. Captains come in various classes            to fit the various ships, so you can't get snide little runts like            Wesley Crusher to command towering destroyers, but you can get them            to pilot smaller ships if you want to. Captains gain experience            points the more missions they successfully complete, so it's worth            keeping your ships in good nick throughout battle too, even if you            are loaded with credits.                    The single player game is startlingly linear, with your choice of            ships making no difference to anything in particular except the way            in which you dispose of your enemies. Instead of adopting a Red            Alert-like sector-based conquest system (which could have been            pretty interesting) the game just gives you 20 missions to overcome            one by one, and they all invariably centre around the destruction            of Jem Hadar or Cardassian vessels, whether they're attacking a            convoy, attacking a station or another ship, or you're simply            attacking them. There are one or two missions which centre around            the use of a cloaking device to try and 'stealth' your enemies, but            aside from that it's mostly plain sailing. During the course of a            mission your enemies usually take a few chunks out of you, and if            you're really unlucky you'll lose a ship, but if you lose the            mission outright you can just replay it over and over until you get            it right.                         You move your vessels around using the mouse, lassoing them RTS            style and directing them toward a target. You can give them            commands, like guard, cloak, balance shields and you can use the            warp engines to get to a point quickly. You can even re-enact            famous Picard battle strategies if you can remember them, like            warping to within ten feet of an enemy ship and firing torpedoes.            There are of course simplistic preprogrammed attacks if you're too            boring to come up with some of your own. You can hit and run target            and circle target amongst other things, and you can use multiple            units together in more complex attacks. Simply sending your entire            fleet towards one lone Jem Hadar ship is a bit dangerous though, as            enemies tend to attack from multiple directions, meaning that you            can quite easily go off, destroy three or four ships and return to            discover your prize in tatters as a lone raider scampers off into            the nearest nebula.                         Thankfully there's a useful tutorial option, which gives you a            basic grounding. There are a lot of ways to control a starship            though, and I felt I could have done with more instruction even            after the tutorial. There must be over 50 keyboard controls to keep            track of, and you can't easily pause the game to issue new            instructions or look up a command; nor can you whip out a map to            get a glimpse of the bigger picture.                    Beyond the single player game there's a fairly handy multiplayer            aspect too, although new pilots should avoid it at least until            they've completed half of the single player game and got to know            the ropes. The good news though is that because this is both a Star            Trek game and a fairly good space strategy game, by the time you            have gotten to know the ropes there will be a largish number of            people willing to take you on. At the time of writing it's mostly            Americans and other reviewers, but by the time you're ready there            ought to be a bit of interest.                         Unlike the single player game, up to 48 ships can fit in a            multiplayer outing, which makes real space armadas possible. It's            pretty good fun, although you do occasionally lust for the odd Borg            cube to fly out of the nearest nebula and attack you. There are            several modes of play apart from the standard free for all;            domination, find the founder, capture and hold and conquest.                         Visually the game is very impressive, with some beautifully            detailed ships. Obviously with so much space around ships and            stations were going to need a lot of lavish detail, and the            developers haven't disappointed us. Even when you get close to the            big ships they look just as clean, sparkling and intricate as those            seen in the television series and movies. The engine can handle a            lot of them on-screen too. They're big objects with lots of            polygons, so this is pretty impressive. I've had ships filling up            the screen without much slowdown, and I've been playing the game            using an ATI Radeon, which often sacrifices performance in favour            of glamour.                         What's annoying about the graphics is that you cannot change the            resolution and colour depth. I was absolutely livid when I            discovered this and refused to believe it was true for a while.                    Sadly there are some rather annoying niggles that mar the otherwise            fairly engaging experience of Dominion Wars. Odd bugs crop up now            and then; for instance if you lasso a bunch of ships and set them            to guard something, occasionally the order doesn't actually get            carried out. This means that you end up learning to clumsily hit            the guard button about four or five times on each object just to            make damned sure. Another issue is the way the game gets into a            muddle when you save mid-mission. All the ships start to act like            hyperactive children, jerking about involuntarily. There are            patches available that supposedly fix these issues but they only            work with the American version.                         The biggest problem with Dominion Wars though isn't some silly            bug, the lack of grit or its somewhat troublesome learning curve;            no, the difficulty is that you're in a war, and actually the            so-called heat of the battle is lukewarm at best. The pace of the            thing is completely wrong. These are great big lumbering starships,            but they can get their skates on every once in a while,            surely. It wouldn't be so bad if they could actually turn            either, but as it happens even the smaller ships apparently need a            decent sized moon's worth of space to slingshot themselves in the            other direction.                         Ultimately then, Star Trek: Dominion Wars is an interesting,            occasionally exciting game that suffers from a few notable flaws.            It's not really an accurate portrayal of the final series of DS9            because it's so faceless, but it's pretty good in its own right. If            you think the bugs and plodding pace won't trouble you too much,            and you like the idea of piloting a band of huge starships around            the universe, you could do worse than to check it out."}
