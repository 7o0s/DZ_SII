You see, Konami know a thing or two about gameplay, and it shows.            The Castlevania series is one of the most challenging and            constantly spellbinding we've ever come across, and Circle of the            Moon is no exception. It doesn't stray from the basic Castlevania            formula, so you spend most of the time using your whip creatively            to outfox zombies, bats and other demonic forces, while collecting            hearts to stay alive and power your secondary weapon; Holy water, a            boomerang, a dagger or a stopwatch.                         In terms of storyline (as if it required one), Circle of the Moon            gives you control of Nathan Graves, whose kidnapped father is            currently at the mercy of the oft-resurrected Dracula. The            structure of the game disregards the SNES-based Castlevania's            principles of ~levels~, favouring a PSX-like continuous castle,            with your progress charted by the futuristic auto-map. Quite why            Graves decided to create a map on the fly despite obvious intel            from the Belmonts of yore will remain a mystery.                         Also, like the esteemed Belmonts before him, Graves starts out            with next to nothing; a simple whip and a lot of enemies to            overcome. In the first hours of his quest, he learns gradually more            advanced techniques like running, double-jumps and even an Indiana            Jones-like whip swing.                    Rather like the auto-map, Circle of the Moon's experience points            and dual-select systems (DSS) are very RPGish. Experience points            are collected by defeating enemies, and once a certain number have            been accrued, Graves goes a level up. On the other hand, collecting            DSS cards from defeated enemies and secret areas gives you a more            varied arsenal to play with in certain tricky situations. DSS cards            come in two categories; Action and Attribute, and when one card            from each category is combined, you can use specialist attacks,            which are often particularly useful against bigger, nastier            enemies.                         The graphics are one area of Circle of the Moon which might have            done with a little work. They are very SNES-like, despite the GBA's            extensive capacity to go beyond that, and although pretty, they are            unlikely to catch anybody's attention. Retained are the            multiscrolling backgrounds from the Super NES era (which help            manifest the illusion of depth), but these are absent in a number            of areas, which is frankly a bit peculiar. One of the other            quibbles I have on the graphical side of things is the character            animation, or distinct lack thereof. Graves looks no different to            Belmont, granted, but that's no excuse for the lack of frames in            his movement! It's like watching someone moonwalk forwards very            awkwardly whenever he decides to shuffle along.                         To complete the graphical complaints section, there's the            ~contrast issue~. I say issue, but to Konami it's a bleedin'            feature. Already labouring under a barrage of complaints about the            lack of backlighting and difficult to see LCD graphics, the Game            Boy Advance now welcomes a game where the developers have            purposefully toned down the contrast in order to create a mood.            Frankly guys, you needn't have bothered, but I guess you weren't to            know. It's not that much of an issue if you play in            reasonable light anyway (and you shouldn't be playing Circle of the            Moon without giving it your full attention, really, which means            decent lighting), so we won't deduct merit points here.                    Back on the other foot again though, and you simply cannot question            the gameplay. It's a surprisingly difficult game at times, but it's            never frustrating or tedious; you always want to keep            playing until you're through, which is one of the biggest assets            any game can ever boast.                         To put it into perspective, in one of my other favourite GBA            launch titles, Super Mario Advance, you get to play with a number            of characters and in a variety of worlds, but ultimately you're            doing nothing but bop people with plants and shrubs from end to            end. The gameplay doesn't get much more advanced. In Castlevania            though, every new turn is a potential upgrade to your armoury, and            there are techniques to learn gradually from start to stop. In            terms of replay value, we don't know yet, unlike every other launch            title we still haven't finished Circle of the Moon. It's big, it's            sprawling, and it gives you something new to play with every few            minutes. That's textbook gaming, that.                         Castlevania: Circle of the Moon feels more like Super Metroid            Advance than Castlevania Advance. The idea of ~levels~ is gone,            replaced by a single, overpowering castle of epicurean proportions,            and the execution (apart from some occasionally questionable            graphics) is spot on. A fantastic game from the ~just one more go~            school of development. Kudos to Konami.                        -        The Portable Avant-GardeThe Portable Avant-Garde"}
