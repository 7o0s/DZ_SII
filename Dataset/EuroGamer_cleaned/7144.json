Well, here's a brief                 explanation : a warp is formed in space by a Ripstar, which                 allows a spacecraft to fly through a faster-than-light wave.                    This wave consists of millions of sub-atomic particles called            Tachyons, which can never go slower than the speed of light.            Tachyon Coil Generators (TCGs) are used to harness this power,            creating Tachyon gates which allow you to travel immense distances            in just a few seconds.                    It's the 26th century, and Jake Logan is quite happily employed as            a Corporate star-pilot in the Sol system. Whilst on a routine            escort mission to Halley Station though, two shuttles launch            carrying passengers riddled with a lethal disease. The occupants            refuse to return to the station, and Jake has no other alternative            than to eliminate them rather than risk galaxy wide infection.                    The shuttle he had been escorting suddenly explodes, taking with it            the entire station. Star-Patrol (the local constabulary) appear on            the scene, and immediately accuse Jake of the crime. His sentence -            banishment to the fringe of colonised space, where anything goes,            and anything could happen.         All of Tachyon's locations are                 split into regions, each of which can be reached via a                 Mega-Gate, a slightly more powerful version of the Tachyon                 gate. You need security clearance to use one, and until you                 have got further into the game you will be fairly restricted                 as to where you can travel.                    Each region has a main base where you will receive all your            missions, buy or upgrade ships, and listen to the latest news. You            will also be able to hire wingmen (or women) with varying skills            and reliability. Unfortunately there is no trading in the game -            it's purely mission based, and completing these missions is your            only way of making money.                    At first missions posted to the job board are from two distinct            cultures - the Bora and Galspan. AS you would expect, the two of            them aren't best buddies, and you're going to have to pledge            allegiance to one of them. There are other missions that come your            way as well, usually something dodgy, or else a routine errand.                    So far, so predictable.         Before you                 travel anywhere though, you are advised to get some basic                 training in. The training mode is excellent, particularly the                 Saturn ring circuits in which you have to fly through a series                 of hoops in a set amount of time, getting progressively harder                 and adding targets for you to shoot.                    The HUD at the bottom of your screen is both informative and easy            to use. On the left a box shows you your current target and, in the            case of an enemy craft, its hull and shield integrity. The next            area shows you your currently selected primary and secondary            weapons. If the ammunition of a weapon is limited, it also shows            you how much you have left.                    The centre of your HUD is taken up with a simple but effective            radar system, with the usual range of coloured dots depicting the            objects around you. Green is an ally, purple is a neutral, and red            is an enemy. Gates are shown as blue dots - make sure you know            where these are at all times, should you need a quick exit.                    To the right of the radar is an icon of your ship, with a circular            field around the front and rear. This is a graphical depiction of            your shield and hull integrity. If your shields are depleting the            circle around the ship will gradually dim, and if your hull is            taking a beating the icon will change from green to red.                    Finally you have the 'Energy Allocation' section. This is a clever            feature which allows you to allocate energy to particular parts of            your ship. You can shift more energy to the shields, lasers and            afterburners to reduce recharge times, but this has a detrimental            affect on the speed of your ship.                    Another nice touch is the ship's slide mode. When activated you can            rotate your ship in any direction, whilst still maintaining the            same course and speed. As soon as you release the slide button your            ship will then head in whatever direction it is now facing. This            can be very useful when repositioning yourself to dock at a            station, and can be very handy in combat to surprise your enemy.         Combat in Tachyon                 is a fairly repetitive affair, but enjoyable all the same.                 Most battles will involve a blip on the horizon gradually                 getting closer, eventually blazing its guns at you. You would                 do well to avoid face-offs, especially in the early stages of                 the game when your hull will break easier than a soggy                 biscuit.                    Dogfights with enemy craft are quite difficult at first, but once            you have mastered how to lead with your laser fire and follow your            opponent it all becomes too easy. You will often find that you can            pelt the ship with lasers and missiles, and it doesn't make any            effort to move. Also, after an initial head on attack, it's very            rare for them to put up any further attacks that are of any threat.            Most of your deaths will come from tangling with bases, which are            heavily fortified with gun turrets.                    Disappointed with the AI opposition, I took the game online.            Tachyon features an in-game browser which directly connects you to            the available servers. Over a hundred star-pilots can be on a            server at any time! The servers that I found had nowhere near that            number of people on them, but I did manage to find one with nearly            thirty, and the connection was still surprisingly smooth and            playable.                    There are a few breeds of game-type to play online, but the main            two are 'Arena Match' and 'Base Wars'. The former is a            straightforward free-for-all deathmatch, kill of be killed. 'Base            Wars' is what I've been waiting for though... One team play the            Bora, the other the Galspan. Each team has to reach a technology            level of 10, collecting crystals and defeating any enemy attackers            to get the money needed. Once this level is reached, the team can            then destroy the other base's life support system. Darn good fun!                    The game also comes with its own voice communications facility. Now            you really can have your very own wingman!         Tachyon's graphics are rather good. They lack the intricate            detail of games like Starlancer and Freespace 2, but are by no            means bland, and the size of some of the starbases and freighters            is impressive.                    The constructions and spacecraft are all well designed, making it            easy to recognise locations and the many different ships. Weapon            effects are nicely done, and although none of them really leap out            and impress, the explosions certainly light up the night sky!                    The game is badly let down by the sound though, and the weapons            sound puny. Firing your lasers sounds more like a playground            re-enactment of Battlestar Galactica then a meaty hull piercing            bolt! The explosion sound has no guts behind it either. The noise            made by the ships is perhaps the worst though, sounding like a            vacuum cleaner gone very wrong!                    A decidely average soundtrack doesn't help things either. Never in            the game does it grab you, spurring you along to get that next            kill. There needs to be far more drama in the music - it is a space            epic after all.                    The saving grace is the voice acting, which is truly excellent.            Most impressive of all is Jake himself, played by Bruce Campbell,            better known as Ash from the Evil Dead movies. Some of his            sarcastic comments will make you laugh, although whether that's            because you find yourself picturing him with a chainsaw strapped on            to the stump of his arm saying 'Groovy!' is another matter.                         Tachyon's story and gameplay isn't going to win any prizes for                 originality, and the mission based nature of the game may well                 dissuade the Elite purists out there.                    However, it does have a lot to offer, with an impressive selection            of missions to get through, good graphics, and excellent design,            not to mention probably the easiest internet play interface you're            likely to come across in a space combat sim.                    The single player combat is a little disappointing though, as are            the poor sound effects and music. Another thing you will notice is            that as you upgrade to a newer more powerful ship it never really            feels like anything has changed. You keep expecting some sort of            learning curve to control a newer model, but each handles exactly            the same as the last.                    It's all good, harmless entertainment, but don't expect it to be            the next great space adventure.                        Try before you buy!
