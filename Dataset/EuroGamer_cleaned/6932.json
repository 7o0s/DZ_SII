The aptly named            Original War sets itself up in Siberia, where a time travel device            has been uncovered that sends anything it comes into contact with            two million years into the past.                         The machine is powered by Siberite, a rare element discovered only            in the neighbouring area of Russia. The Russian government isn't            happy about all this, and doesn't like the idea of Americans            exploiting their resources. In an inventive twist, it becomes your            job to hop two million years into the past and excavate Siberite            deposits, leaving them neatly stacked in Alaska, which was of            course just around the corner in those days.                         It gets better, and the game is delightfully non-linear,            encouraging you to write your own ticket. The difficulty of future            missions and the choices to be made in them depend on your actions            in the present, and there are plenty of different ways to complete            the various missions, with the story traced in the sand by some            hammy voice acting and amusing characters in your unit.                    Real time strategy games aren't generally known for the roving            nature of their missions, but Original War is all about keeping on            the move, directing units according to your orders (which may            conflict with one another, requiring a bit of planning on your            part). There's no base unit, no tank-rushing, no boring            build-rush-build-rush cycle and all the other things that plagued            the likes of Red Alert. In fact you can't actually mass-produce            anything, least of all troops. Instead you have to put up with your            pre-determined units.                         Although it shies away from a lot of real-time strategy traditions            the fog of war still exists, but you need to be careful how you            deal with it. The usual trick of dispatching a jeep out into the            black is unrealistic here; it would just end up getting shot to            pieces by the first patrol it meets and leaving you none the wiser.            The trick is to marshal your efforts conservatively. Space your            troops out, but never abandon them, and don't leave people on their            own.                         Before you set off into the unknown though, troops have to be            trained as a soldier, a mechanic, an engineer or a scientist. Many            of these skills will be required regularly, and like role-playing            game characters your men develop experience in their work, and            become more and more valuable as they work or fight. At the            conclusion of each mission you can upgrade the attributes of the            various troops in your unit and train them in new disciplines. For            example, as your mechanics peak in prowess you can teach them to            drive a tank. Vehicles are pretty powerful on the whole, and            virtually every one can be customized to improve its weaponry,            speed, power source, chassis and more. You can also opt to change            your men's discipline mid-mission - quite useful if you're under            attack and your scientists are loitering near the armoury\u2026                    As you can probably tell, Original War's biggest virtue is that it            tries to endear you to your units. It doesn't give you a pack of            disposable troops and a wad of cash to reinforce them over and            over, but instead offers you a number of men with different skills            and asks you to manipulate them.                        When you take the level of customization and non-linearity into            account, you've got the prospect of a pretty exciting strategy            romp. Structures are rare but don't fall easily, troops and            vehicles are often extremely individual, and I haven't played a            single level of the game involving a group of tanks speeding            furiously into the enemy stronghold with a minute gone. It's ..            original.                         Obviously all this pleasure has to come at a price though, and            Original War is marred by a number of small problems. I haven't            mentioned the visuals up to now, because by and large they are            neither remarkable or terrible, but there are gaps. For instance,            troops don't run. I'm sure their combat gear is probably quite            heavy, but why not have them throw it down and shed a number of            experience points if a tank is bearing down on them, instead of            walking very, very slowly in the opposite direction.                    Another problem is the artificial intelligence. I know you're            groaning at the thought of yet another strategy game with dodgy AI,            but there's no escaping it. For the most part there's nothing to            worry about and the troops all wander around and help one another            out, but in the thick of battle there seem to be invisible            range-limiters at work, with troops ignoring the warning signs of            fallen comrades and standing around catching their breath for a few            seconds before hot-footing it towards the nearest tank moments            later armed only with a bayonet. A little common sense might have            been useful. Lassoing troops away from danger should be the least            of your worries when you're under attack.                         Of course, you might not expect this sort of thing from the            average real-time strategy game, but Original War is a game that            encourages thought and stimulates the grey matter from time to            time. The troops natter away with one another, complaining about            the weather and hard going, and the stereotypical love-of-war            character who spurs them on sounds like a mixture of virtually            every Arnold Schwarzenegger character you have ever seen. This            isn't a game that should suffer from dumb-soldier syndrome.                         Ultimately though, it would be unfair to neglect Original War            because of these minor niggles. Okay, so the voice acting is a bit            daft and the artificial intelligence has 'issues', but there is so            much here that deserves to be enjoyed. For crying out loud, it's a            real time strategy game that innovates. Open ye wallet, sir, and            avail yourself of \u00a330. You won't regret it."}
