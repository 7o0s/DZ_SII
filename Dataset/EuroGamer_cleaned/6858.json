You can argue about the futility            of the naming convention all you want, but in terms of raw power            the Ti4600 boasts a 300MHz GPU and 128Mb of the fastest memory,            clocked at 650MHz. Some card manufacturers - Gainward is one - have            squeezed even more out of the chip, ramping up those clock speeds            to improve performance.                         At its peak the Ti4600 can shovel 10.4Gbyte/sec. That's an            improvement of more than 25% over the GeForce 3 Ti500 and more than            a third faster than the Ti200, meaning that while the Radeon 8500's            memory subsystem can outperform the Ti500, it's no match for the            heady heights of the GeForce 4. Coupled with an array of new            features (including improved anti-aliasing and the new nfiniteFX II            engine), this is the second card in a row to improve on the            original GF3 formula. But ultimately the question still remains,            why would anybody buy this card?                         The most important thing to remember about NVIDIA's flagship            graphics card is that once again early adopters are paying for the            privilege of a few tech demos and perhaps the odd game next year.            Existing GeForce 3 graphics cards are already capable of rendering            virtually anything developers can throw at them, and even on            maximum settings the original GeForce 3 board barely breaks into a            sweat for cutting edge games like Medal of Honor : Allied Assault            and Aquanox. Consumers could pay up to \u00a3150 as a premium on            top of the cost of a regular graphics card, and yet there is no            present-day application to justify that investment.                    In terms of what's new, it's the same old story. With each new            video card from NVIDIA we're forced to reassess the boundaries of            what's possible on a PC. For example, as NVIDIA's press pouch            informed me, the new nfiniteFX II engine sports dual vertex            shaders, advanced pixel shader pipelines, 3D textures, shadow            buffers and z-correct bump mapping, all of which can combine to            render high quality hair and fur, arguably for the first time with            any reliability. Thirteen years ago, we're told, it took a network            of IBM mainframes made up of twelve 3090 processors and four 3081            processors two hours to draw a single frame of a fuzzy bear.            GeForce 4 Titanium 4600 can do it in real-time.                         Wolfman up there contains over 100,000 polygons, more than 20            times the complexity of previous projects. Wolfman uses eight            concentric fur shells, and the colour and density of the fur is            controlled using a separate texture map that covers the entire            body. This gives the fur its distinct look, rather than a uniform            pattern. Wolfman has a completely skinned animation with a 61-bone            skeleton, of a complexity equal to that used for models in movie            special effects. Each vertex of the skin, fur layers and fin            geometry are deformed in real-time to match the movement of the            underlying skeleton, with the nfiniteFX II engine handling the            vertex deformation for each of the right layers.                         Another aspect of Wolfman is the computationally expensive            anisotropic lighting - the way his hair and fur reflect light more            in some directions than others. The nfiniteFX II engine has            advanced pixel shaders to deliver anisotropic lighting to the            Wolfman while maintaining fast frame rates.                    Apart from realistic hair and fur, GeForce 4 promises superior            antialiasing via something called Accuview Antialiasing. Accuview            is a fully integrated multisampling solution, which reduces the            strain on the GPU by providing wider internal data paths to handle            the extra pixels. GPUs can compute these 'virtual pixels' or            additional samples at full speed. Tests with a GeForce 4 Ti 4600            indicate that the card can handle 2x antialiasing in 1024x768 at            32-bit colour depth at the same speed that the GeForce 3 Ti500            board runs without the antialiasing. Accuview offers several modes            including a new 4XS mode that delivers improved subpixel coverage            and better texture quality. Accuview also incorporates anisotropic            filtering.                         Furthermore on the features front, after the success of NVIDIA's            Lightspeed Memory Architecture (LMA) on the GeForce 3, LMA II has            been unveiled as its successor to help compensate for memory            bandwidth restrictions. It introduces a number of new technologies            to maximize bandwidth efficiency, combining new features with old.            Thanks to a new Video Processing Engine, NVIDIA is also offering            world class DVD playback to boot with advanced adaptive            de-interlacing. Top line Ti 4600 offerings will also ship with            ViVo, as well as DVI and VGA output.                         Rounding out the new features we have the nView multi-display            technology. Thanks to the Ti4600's DVI output (and the application            of a DVI-VGA dongle if you don't have a flat panel), multiple            monitor support is bundled into the package. Unlike our GeForce 4            MX 440 card, we had no trouble with multi-monitor out under Windows            Millennium, 2000 and XP Pro, and running a single desktop across            two monitors is greatly assisted by the nView software, which            shunts dialogue boxes to their respective windows, remembers            program locations (if those programs are willing to play ball) and            tweaks performance settings (such as cutting out unnecessary frames            of Windows GUI animation).                    A host of new features then, but the big question is one of            performance. We clocked the GeForce 3 Ti500 at 7,500 3D Marks.            Astounding us once more, the Ti4600 managed 9,138 on the same            Athlon XP system. Like the Ti500, we couldn't find anything that            really made the card break a sweat. Nothing stretched it short of            whacking the resolution up to 1600x1200 in 32-bit colour and            enabling 4xFSAA.                         On the functionality front one can hardly complain. Installing the            card was a breeze - I just whipped off the side of my PC's case,            pulled out the old card and stuck in the new one. The Ti4600 is a            lot larger than the Ti500, and if I ever want to install any more            memory I ill have to remove it to get at the memory slots clips,            but generally speaking there were no problems. Watch out if you            have a small case though. Cooling is amply dealt with on our            reference board too. As you can see, NVIDIA has furnished the card            with an enormous, colourfully decorated heatsink/fan unit, which            adequately cools the monstrous card.                         In fact, the only complaint we really have with the Ti4600 is that            the refresh rate issue (which, without the use of an external            program, seems to condemn users to the Windows default 60Hz            whenever they fire up a game) has yet to be resolved. It's worth            considering that this is a Windows problem, inherent to 2000 and            XP, and that ATI's cards also suffer from it, but with third party            fixes on the market, why won't one or other of the pair stick their            neck out and do something?                    With the GeForce 4 Ti4600 NVIDIA has created a monstrous icon for            the video card industry. On the marketing front it's not a true            successor to GeForce 3. NVIDIA seems to like releasing one            technological revamp every couple of years and padding out the            interim with speed bumps. If you own a GeForce 3, I suppose the            point is that you ought to wait for the GeForce 5 before you really            consider upgrading. But if you're falling behind and want to keep            yourself in games for a couple of years, the Ti4600 represents the            pinnacle.
