Without beating around the bush here,            we'll put one thing straight: Metropolis Street Racer is truly one            of the greatest driving games ever conceived.                         The one thing that makes MSR so fabulous, so unmistakably            brilliant, is its unerring originality. When I first read the rave            previews about MSR, I couldn't possibly imagine what could            differentiate this one driving game from all the hundreds before            it, aside from perhaps some improved physics, more cars, better            graphics, yadda yadda.. so what? However, upon finally playing the            game, after an hour or so we could see exactly how Metropolis            Street Racer would conquer the racing videogaming world - Kudos.                         Kudos is (in the most simplistic term) MSR's scoring system. To            explain this can be quite cumbersome and tricky, so please bear            with us. When you start the game, you begin a chapter consisting of            10 races. From those 10 races, you must gain a set total of Kudos            points in order to proceed to the next chapter. Everything in MSR,            how you drive, how fast you drive, how well you corner, how many            walls you scuff, effects your Kudos rating at the end of a race. So            not only do you have to worry about beating the clock or the other            drivers, you also have to worry about taking on the role of a flash            git in a convertible, joyriding around the streets of London and            impressing your mates by power sliding round 90 degree corners            without even coming close to the barriers. Needless to say this is            a Hard Thing\u2122 to do, and your progression in the game relies            wholeheartedly on your ability to pull this off, but the Kudos            system lends the entire game an unmatched sense of originality in            the genre\u2026 we think maybe the best way to describe it is that            it's a kind of driving RPG.                    But that's not the only challenge you face, because from the outset            you're forced to compete for your first car before you're even            allowed to start the game proper. So, you're given a list of car            models which are unlocked by default, and pick which one you feel            you'd like to try your hand at ~winning~ so you can add it to your            garage. The challenge takes the form of a time attack, where you            pit your driving skills against a par time for a certain circuit,            on which you have unlimited laps until you beat the time or give            up. Once you've won the car you must customise it as you see fit,            which is the point at which we realised just how much attention to            detail MSR has. You can customise your number plate with any            combination of letters and numbers, choose what kind of roof you            would like in which type of weather night or day, choose the level            of tint for your windows and, of course, pick which colour you want            your voluptuous bodywork\u2026 it's this that made us realise that            MSR simply oozes class.                         The sheer level of thought poured into every single aspect of this            game is simply tremendous. The locales, which are set in streets            dotted throughout London, Tokyo and San Francisco, are astoundingly            detailed, with notable landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament            modelled and textured with loving accuracy. The cars themselves are            also incredibly beautiful, not just in looks but also in            feel. It's not often that a driving game fully manages to            accurately recreate the handling of the vehicles, but Bizarre have            clearly put a lot of time, research and development into getting            exactly the right handling for each car - the only other game to            come close to this kind of detail is the ageing Gran Turismo on the            PSX, and MSR beats it hands down, no question.                    Of course, being critics, we must point out where this            standard-setting title falters and although being slight, it does            have its faults as can only be expected. For example, the game            immediately shuns the pick-up-and-play gamer in one fell swoop as            in order to do anything at all in the game, even the split-screen            multiplayer, you must unlock a car in one of the time challenges.            Picture the scene; you're out with the little lady, picking up            Christmas presents or something, and on a whim you dive into the            local games emporium and snag a copy of MSR. Upon your return home            from the pub with associated mates later that evening, you fire the            thing up and fancy a bit of spur-of-the-moment multiplay, but alas,            you can do just about nothing because you haven't unlocked the            right vehicles yet. Disappointment should not be the first emotion            that follows a \u00a340 outlay, and there ought to be a dummy's            mode or something to compensate, rather like Gran Turismo.                    My other gripe would have to simply be the sheer difficulty of the            game\u2026 we had enough trouble getting through the first            chapter, let alone how on earth anyone is supposed to progress            through the next 25 in order to be gain the status of World            Champion street racer. Certainly, it represents a challenge for            even the most hardened gamer, and should keep the game spinning in            most gamer's Dreamcasts for many months to come, but should a game            really be that challenging? Perhaps the addition of varying skill            levels or separate competitions of graduating skill to take part in            could have levelled the learning curve a little.                         The final, and definitely the most insignificant problem I            personally had with the game was the ~radio stations~, which            resemble something like those of Grand Theft Auto but without any            of the class or humour, which is instead replaced with mountains of            cheese in the form of dreadful voice actors posing as DJ's\u2026            and that's before the actual music kicks in, which is just as            odious. They offer many style for you to choose from, from Rock to            Trance to Jazz, but none offer anything particularly toe-tapping,            especially after you've heard them once before. Cleverly, you can            listen to music in radio station form, or in the guise of a CD            player\u2026 you can even compile all the tracks you like into            your own ~CD~, which is neat, but they needn't have bothered. The            sonics of the cars themselves are excellent, and each car has been            recorded and fine-tuned specifically which lends the crucial            audible authenticity.                    Metropolis Street Racer is most definitely not for the quick-fix            gamer, however if you're out for a challenge and you haven't yet            found a racer to steal your heart (and let's face it, there isn't            one that could steal it better than this) then you'd be a fool to            miss out on the opportunity to own possibly the best driving game            ever made."}
