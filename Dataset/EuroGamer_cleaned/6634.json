The only reason I'm reviewing            ATV Quad Power Racing 2 is that in the long run, it will mean I'm            the most qualified to review Rainbow Studios' ATV Offroad Fury 2,            which is due out to coincide with PS2 Online by the end of spring.            Does this make me a bad person? Kristan thinks so. Does this imply            that Quad Power Racing 2 is a bit of a dud? Well, only a bit.        The best way to describe it is SSX on quad bikes. Think three            laps round very long tracks, boost and point meters, brutally            unseating other riders, and tricky tendencies and you've got the            general idea. What lifts QPR2 slightly above its rivals is the use            of quad bikes, which require a bit more effort to master. The            courses are uniformly bumpy affairs, and every trip through the air            has to be landed correctly if you want to retain momentum and speed            off efficiently. An uneven landing will often lose you vital            seconds - more than enough to cost you the race.                    As the left stick is used to turn left and right, and move the            rider forwards and backwards in the saddle as you race, so it is            used in mid-air to angle the quad for a suitable descent. Mastering            landings takes lots of effort, and it gives QPR2 a satisfying            learning curve.                    However, there are plenty of other ways to keep yourself ahead of            the pack, and these come in handy until you've matured to an expert            level of quad biking. You can boot other riders into the dirt if            you can get alongside them, much as you could in Road Rash all            those years ago. Sadly the animation and sound of unseated bikers            kissing the dirt is sorely lacking, but I'll get to that later. You            can also perform tricks, similar in style and number to those in EA            Sports BIG's Freekstyle, but nowhere near as smoothly implemented.        In order to perform tricks you have to hold down one button            while tapping a trick modifier, and angling your craft            appropriately with the left stick. But having to boost to maximise            your take-off speed, and simultaneously charge and release another            button at the point of take off to jump as well means a three            button clash before you even think about what you're doing. And            then there's the problem of timing - QPR2 is far less forgiving            than BIG's offerings, and you'll spend half the time wondering why            you didn't manage a trick that jump. It's not just you, believe me.            We'll all be spending half an hour repeating the tricks training            section because of ~bad timing~.                    Worse still, unlike SSX' and Freekstyle's memorable track designs,            QPR2's are long, visually repetitive and difficult to memorise,            making tricks that little bit harder still. Track design is            consistently good, but you'll only enjoy an easy ride for the first            couple, after which point passages narrow, jumps become less            straightforward and the locations throw up their own obstacles -            water hazards in the swamps for example.        But this choice of exotic locales takes its toll on the frame            rate, which suffers in places. Then again it is normally 60fps and            not just 50. The graphics themselves are unspectacular, but nicely            put together. The draw distance is ample. The use of light and            shadow is nice, contrasting sandy dunes straddled by beaming            sunshine and rear view glare nicely with shadowy forested locations            illuminated by shafts and reflections. And weather effects like            rain on the camera and lens flare, although expected, hit all the            right notes.                    The characters and bike models are very appealing, and it's a nice            change to watch your back wheels spin in the mud before a race            starts - something most other racing games can't easily help you            with. As I mentioned earlier though, character models are only good            when they're seated. Kick someone out of the saddle or go flying            yourself and it all starts to look a bit 1995, with the spindly,            sprite-like polygons hitting the ground sharply and staying there.                    We also think Climax missed a trick with the camera modes. The            choice is good, but a first person view would have made this an            even greater experience - particularly during a backflip! It isn't            hard to imagine why this was left out, but it's a risk we would            have liked to see taken. Particularly given the generous complement            of just about everything else.        There are lots of things to do and see in ATV Quad Power Racing            2. After 20 minutes of training, you have a long and winding path            ahead of you. The Career mode is split into three classes with 15            tracks, and it'll keep you occupied for a good while - particularly            since attaining gold medals will unlock new bikes, which give you            an even better chance of securing golds in the higher classes.                    Then there's Challenge, which has you completing ramp and            ground-based objectives to unlock more characters. And then there's            Freestyle, a trick mode set in a sort of Skate Park. Unfortunately            though, the trick mechanic's complexity comes back to haunt us here            and derails this mode as inaccessibly hard. At least until you've            conquered everything else and built up a tolerance for the insanely            tricky trick system. Fortunately there are two main modes and also            the obligatory Single Race, Arcade and Time Trial modes on offer.            Not to mention two-player split-screen.                    Speaking of tolerance though, we haven't much for the soundtrack.            Godsmack, Boxcar Racer, Midtown, Rollins Band, Bionic Jive - who            are these people? Are we some sort of musical lunatics for not            understanding this curious blend of rock and pop, which pulsates            like a rundown Vaxuhall engine? Well ok, we could be, so we'll let            you decide if it floats your boat. The rest of the sounds in the            game are mostly great, from the riders yelping in anguish to the            menacing roar of the quads, but we could have done with some more            crunches, particularly if we've just smacked into a log and gone            goose over stumps swampside.                    So you may well ask, what's really missing here? A bit of            inventiveness, we think. This is all very unsurprising, albeit            fairly enjoyable SSX-type construction, and a bit of thought and            adventure could have elevated it above its cohorts in the genre.            You could argue that that's a tough brief for a quad bikes game,            but hey, it was there choice to make two of them\u2026                    Fundamentally QPR2 is a good, competent racer with SSX tendencies            which don't quite work in the same way. Nobody's going to be too            disappointed with it. It's a pretty playable quad bike game with a            good handle on what's important and offers a successful blend of            Road Rash/Excitebike type ideas - the only problems are            unresponsive tricks and a lack of imagination. And the fact that            the reportedly much better Offroad Fury 2 with online support is            due in just a few months.
