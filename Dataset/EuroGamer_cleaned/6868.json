It's a true car enthusiast's game, with eleven classics such as the            Mini Cooper, Ford Escort and Cortina faithfully and intricately            re-created.                         Seven cars remain locked away along with most of tracks when you            first start the game up, meaning you must prove your worth in the            championship if you're to fully appreciate the scope of the game.            Jumping straight into a race is simple enough, as the menu system            remains uncluttered and curiously low on customisation options,            certainly not going to the lengths of Colin McRae Rally 2.0, for            example.                         The handling in Rally Trophy is definitely an acquired skill, and            actually succeeding requires a massive amount of skill and patience            in most cases, even when the game is on the Novice skill setting.            As you hurtle forwards and come towards your first corner in the            game, you'll soon realise just how tricky these old timers are to            manage on the road. The drivers you come up against seem to be in            possession of unnatural talent, and as the cars have realistically            rudimentary handling it can all take some getting used to in order            to get anywhere close to a winning time. Coming directly up against            the other drivers in the arcade mode offers a better chance of            success, and is more immediately satisfying than the mammoth task            of tackling the championship.                    The game's 45 tracks span five countries, which offers plenty of            variation in both track and weather conditions, which affects            handling substantially. The design of the courses themselves is            often crafty and despite the best efforts of your co-driver, blind            corners sneak up on you with alarming regularity. The tracks aren't            particularly suffocating, however, allowing a certain amount of            leeway should you venture beyond the edges. Trackside obstacles            usually force you back onto the beaten path though, and you're at            risk of seriously bashing up your Cortina should you decide to go            for an off-road jaunt for any length of time.                         Rally Trophy is a superb looking game, with the car models looking            especially beautiful in their detail, although they seem to absorb            damage well and so the models don't deform quite as much as we            would expect. The game engine itself is also extremely capable,            throwing about dust and mud particles and recreating some of that            lovely lens-flare that we seemingly can't do without these days.            All the detail comes at a cost though, and the game is hugely            demanding on anything but the most masterful of ninja setups. The            audio is very impressive as well, with motors sounding wonderfully            authentic as opposed to the dreadful computerised whine we're            usually served up.                         It's refreshing to have a new rallying title present fans of the            genre with a relatively unexplored angle on the sport. It's            obviously an enthusiastically developed game and is all the more            endearing for it. The attention to detail is one its most            captivating features, but the massive challenge of the championship            plus the more immediately satisfying arcade mode offer plenty to            any racing fanatic looking for something different to compliment            the more traditional racers in their collection."}
