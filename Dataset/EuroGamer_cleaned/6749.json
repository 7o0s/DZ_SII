Two years ago,            the Quake III engine pulsating beneath the surface was a purveyor            of jaw-dropping visuals, and we were suitably impressed by the way            developer Raven wielded this power. Then again, two years ago was            two years ago, and we've all moved on. Sadly, Elite Force hasn't,            and yet Codemasters are still dangling the game like a mouldy            carrot in front of PS2 gamers with nothing better to do. Except,            shock horror, they do have better things to do. Something bad            happened in the transition between PC and console - it always does;            the textures are of dismal quality, the character models are            grotesquely angular and the environments are depressingly            simplistic. Despite this, nothing has actually changed much.            Overlooking its technological shortfalls, Elite Force is still very            much the same enticingly atmospheric and yet disappointingly short            game we remember it to be.                         The story starts on the many decks of a Borg cube, and you, as            Ensign Munro, are charged with the task of locating the rest of            your assault team and getting them back to Voyager. The first Borg            mission is a perfect example of how the player can become unnerved            simply through the use of spot effects and a moody soundtrack.            Well, that and the way the sneaky sods come barging out of nowhere            mumbling rubbish about assimilation to take a swipe at your head.            The first mission also lets you to get to grips with the PS2 pad            controls and the finely balanced auto-aim system. USB mouse and            keyboard support is included, something missing from the likes of            Medal of Honor, and this combination does of course offer the best            level of functionality for first person actioneering, but the level            of functionality on the pad and the ease with which you can pick up            the controls is surprising.                         It's rare that you find yourself physically ducking, weaving and            jumping in surprise when you're playing an FPS, and the only games            in recent memory to evoke similar reactions include Aliens vs.            Predator and, of course, Half-Life. This lends a deal of weight to            Elite Force's argument. Furthermore, the scripted behaviour of your            teammates also adds to the atmosphere, and occasionally you even            care what happens to them. Shocking. It's just a shame that while            these elements of the game shine, it looks and feels so dated that            it dulls the experience, and the fact that it takes two days to            complete it seals the game's fate. When compared to stronger PS2            titles like Deus Ex and Medal of Honor: Frontline, it lacks            longevity. The addition of a split screen multiplayer mode is a            nice move by the developers, but it really doesn't prove to be much            of an attraction after a couple of hours play, suffering from the            same afflictions which drove the PC equivalent into obscurity.                    While Elite Force could have been worse, there's still not much of            a reason to spend your cash on it when there are better            alternatives waiting in the wings. In addition to the titles            name-checked above, Red Faction is also a fine PS2 sci-fi shooter            with twice as much content for half the price. But as far as Elite            Force is concerned, only Star Trek completists and PS2 owners            completely out of options need apply."}
