Two gameplay options awaited me, Challenge or Free            mode. I assumed that Challenge mode was to be just that, a            challenge, and so I headed for the Free fishing mode in order to            ease myself into the game. I was then given a choice of four            fictitious fishing areas with some cute names (Jungle Bass brought            a smile to my face\u2026 do you see? Jungle? Bass? Arf!), but each            area had no discernible difference as to how the game is played,            except for changes in scenery (muddy banks or reeds? Ohhh\u2026 I            just don't know!).                         So, after I chose my locale, I faced the literally life-or-death            decision of which lure I wanted to use. None of the lures had any            statistics in order to help newcomers to the sport decipher which            was the most appropriate to the their situation, so after            deliberating for several tense seconds, I chose the pretty orange            one. Now here's where the exciting stuff really started to happen.            Presented with a nicely modelled fella standing in his boat holding            his rod aloft, I could rotate his field of vision, which was            focussed on a small pointer, around the lake. The snag was that I            could only rotate the casting angle left and right, and not nearer            or farther. What this meant was that I could only cast as far as my            rod would allow, and not choose precisely where in the lake I            wanted to fish. This surely wouldn't have been a hard thing to            implement, and although not exactly a reputation-shattering            omission, it's something that I felt was missing that clearly            shouldn't have been.                    Once I'd decided on which muddy bank I wanted to cast in the            direction of, I tapped the X button to unleash my lethal Lure Of            Death\u2122, and the camera angle proceeded to leave the back of            my hardy fisherman's head and dive into the water ready for me to            experience some harsh bass-snagging action. It was set to be a            delightfully tense experience if some of that ~engaging atmosphere~            I'd been tempted with really existed. But it didn't. My ~technique~            consisted of tapping the d-pad buttons now and again to snag on the            line, and holding X to reel the lure in, closer to the boat.            Snagging the line makes the lure wiggle under the water in order to            catch the attention of the meandering bass. More often than not,            you can manage to get a bite, and I guess that's why it's ~action~            bass, because I really wouldn't imagine that the fish would be            quite so snappy in real world angling.                    Reeling your biter in to the boat it simply a case of holding X            until the line-tension meter reaches its limit, and then letting go            of X to let the line relax a little whilst holding a d-pad button            in order to not let the fish go anywhere. It's really as simple as            that. The supposedly ~heart-pounding~ action is little more than a            repetition of the proceedings the first time, and so any lasting            appeal soon wears off worryingly fast, so I soon got bored and            exited the free fishing mode. The thing that tickled me the most            about this game was the aquarium function. Yes, that's right, you            can actually enter a section of the game where you can observe all            your catches swimming about in their watery paradise. Quite why on            earth this was deemed entertaining is beyond me to the absolute            extreme, and the way it's presented in its supposed seriousness            only heightens the unintentional hilarity.                         I figured after repeating my obvious winning tactics a few times            and to great success, I'd try my hand at the Challenge competition.            In the Challenge mode the player must fill the requirements of the            area in order to proceed. The requirements for each area differ;            some you will have to finish amongst the top three with the highest            amount of bass caught while in the more difficult challenges you            must finish first. After passing each of the four areas of the            Challenge mode the player will receive a new lure. After completing            all of the areas the player will then unlock the Extra mode, which            is essentially the same as the Challenge but much more difficult            and with two new areas to fish.                    Unfortunately, the prospect of collecting new lures and areas to            fish offers little incentive to carry on playing through all of the            challenges, and that's where Action Bass falls down massively -            longevity. In a graphical sense, Action Bass is functional, if            ever-so-slightly cheap looking, and it does that wonderful            polygon-warping thing that the PSX is famous for brilliantly (this            is a Bad Thing\u2122, by the way) in the underwater sections,            which cheapens the feel tenfold even though the fish themselves are            nicely modelled and animated. The different fishing areas really            offer little difference in the way you play your tactics; some            lakes are marginally shallower, and other waters are a little            cloudier. I suppose I shouldn't really expect a lot more from a            game costing just a tenner, and I guess it's quite a bargain for            angling enthusiasts in that respect, but I assumed that the idea of            Action Bass is to attract a far wider audience than those stuck            with their head in Carp World magazine. In the end, it's a bit of            an anticlimax really, and I found myself asking ~Is that it?~ after            only about an hours play (if that).                    I wanted so much more from this initially promising arcade-style            diversion from the norm. Unfortunately it wasn't to be."}
