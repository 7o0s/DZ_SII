NorGamesmasters' north-of-the-border cheeky chap Dominik Diamond. Youprobably won't remember a game called Turrican, either. Itis to Halo what milk is to cheese, a forerunner, if youwill, from a time when Wagon Wheels were five times bigger thanthey are today, when boys discovered enlightenment through grunge,and girls were mourning the loss of New Kids On The Block. It wasan age when the sideways-scrolling platform shoot-'em-up was inits' prime, offering the complete entertainment package for anyself-respecting nerd, geek or dweeb.So how well has this game endured after a generation of rapidlyadvancing technology and tastes? Upon playing it on mobile phonefor the first time, it appears to be firmly loyal to its roots,sticking like a well-rubbed balloon on a woolly jumper. And this isno Bad Thing. The main problem with this game is that it feelstired, like it wants to take things slowly, go on a cruise and wrapits dentures around a Werther's Original.The average level finds you running around in a big metal suitand this is fine, but that's about as good as it gets. The controlsare very fiddly and, when faced with an onslaught of mutant beesand dwarf robots, it's practically impossible to dispatch them withanything resembling ease. Resorting to random jumps and wildbutton-thrashing in the hope of shooting the bad guys leaves itunrewarding, and you, the player, wanting to sob and cry and harkfor a better, more simple life.Interspersed with these walkabout levels are sideways-scrollingshoot-'em-ups, where you take control of a spaceship and shootendless randomly-shaped objects whilst collecting power-ups inorder to blow the rest of the screen away. This can actually bequite fun and the enemies and obstacles come thick and fast, butthe speed at which everything happens becomes catatonic in theextreme. The handling is reduced to a dead snail's pace and thatwill soon extract any enjoyment that could have been had.However, there are elements in Turrican that are very good indeed. On offer are various multiplayer options and difficultylevels, and the graphics on the whole are solid with nice backdropsand character animation. It's just a shame that they're let down bythe awkward controls and sluggish pace. The one true highlight isundoubtedly the music. With great, pounding tunes you'll be theenvy of the bus, office or toilet cubicles. It isn't enough to makethis a modern classic in the way the original was back in the day,but it sure sounds pretty."}
