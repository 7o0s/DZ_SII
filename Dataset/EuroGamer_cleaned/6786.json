There must be a            significant emphasis on allowing players to ease themselves into            the game, to get the feel of the vehicle and the landscape, and all            the while still fulfill the needs of hardcore fans with            authenticity.                         I was hoping 4x4 Evo 2 would manage to get this balance just            right, yet jumping in for a quick race dashed my hopes rather            quickly. As my AI competitors pulled away in a cloud of dust I was            left cautiously plodding around the track for fear of succumbing to            physics more suited to the moon than an arid desert racetrack. This            turns out to be the game's major flaw throughout, and no amount of            customisation can relieve the frustration of having your truck            fling itself all over the place, seemingly out of your control at            anything approaching high speed.                         Getting used to the vehicle's fetish for acrobatics does come            gradually, but unfortunately a greater aspect of fun racing does            not. The AI doesn't race competitively or particularly            intelligently, instead attempting to barge their way to the front            of the pack regardless of what might be directly in front of them,            including other cars. This lends each race an unpleasantly            aggressive feel, forcing you to pile on the acceleration and hurl            yourself around the track, eventually falling foul to those physics            as you reach the crest of a hill. This will of course mean that you            miss a checkpoint, at which point you may as well restart the race.                    You could of course argue that the bullish nature of the game is            what 4x4 is all about, offering adrenaline fuelled, aggressive            racing as opposed to the enormously high speeds and elegant road            handling enjoyed by its genre-brethren. In fact, I would agree with            you to an extent, but 4x4 Evo 2 just concentrates on the aggression            and forgets to make it interesting, with each race basically            boiling down to holding on to the accelerator, steering wildly and            hoping for the best.                        There are attempts to broaden the scope of what could be done with            the game though, in the form of mission-based solo driving            excursions. Somewhat reminiscent of Smuggler's Run on the PS2, the            mission portion of 4x4 Evo 2 seems like a fantastic idea, wherein            you perform freelance tasks in exchange for cash which you can then            use to upgrade your trucks for use in the championship racing.            Superb! Except .. it's not. Smuggler's Run was good at missions            because that was what the game was about, in an offroad Grand Theft            Auto kind of way. 4x4 Evo 2 isn't good at missions because they're            so utterly dull and present little in the way of a challenge.            Example? Locate the bones of a ~Bythelakeosaurus~ by the (cough)            lake for $3,000. This consists of looking at your map, determining            which direction the bones are in and driving there. Show me the            money.                         Everything bar the insane amount of customisation you can perform            on your trucks smacks of half-heartedness. The graphics are quite            pretty, with some nice truck reflections, trackside detail,            particle effects and rolling landscapes as far as the eye can see,            but this has little impact when the rest of the game just feels so            completely underwhelming.                    Sadly 4x4 Evo 2 falls short of offering an entertaining package,            instead delivering wholeheartedly the ability to drive lots of            vehicles, minutely fine-tuned to your particular tastes, across            some bouncy tracks. The problem seems to lie in the fact that the            game doesn't really know what it wants to be; are we playing an            arcade racer or a sim here? The conflicting ideals of the game            don't sit well together or complement one other, and we're left            with a clumsy and ultimately disappointing title."}
