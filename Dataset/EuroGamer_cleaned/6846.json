{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-toki", "date": "17 Mar 2002", "game_name": "Toki Tori", "text": "Capcom picked up Toki Tori from Netherlands-based Two Tribes at a            time when the company could have been forgiven for abandoning the            ageing GameBoy Color format altogether. Instead they have released            what turns out to be a surprisingly entertaining and deceptively            cute little platform puzzler.                         This is a genre which rarely involves any kind of complex plot            content to trouble your mind with, and Toki Tori is no exception.            For some unexplained reason, an unknown force has abducted all the            eggs on a chicken farm. Only one egg remained, containing Toki, who            hatched just in time to see his brothers and sisters flying off            into the distance. He followed them until they all dropped inside a            castle, which then proceeded to fling them all over the place. So            it's your goal as Toki to find all the eggs and discover the force            behind this nonsense.                         This incomprehensible mission leads Toki across a massive sixty            levels, spanning four seperate lands. And while the developers            could have settled with just serving up a mediocre platform            adventure, instead they have injected a fiendish puzzle element            into the proceedings.                    Progression through each level involves the use of Toki's ever            expanding set of skills, which can result in anything from the            construction of a small bridge to teleporting you a short distance            across the level. Without his tools Toki is a pretty useless            chicken; he can waddle, waddle a bit faster with a double-tap on            the D-pad, climb ladders and fall as far as you like, and he can            jump a miniscule amount.                        One other skill that you find yourself using constantly is the            ability to scroll around the entire level layout, which allows you            to plan your approach before you set out. The design of each level            is relentlessly crafty and at times completely unforgiving,            especially once you get past the initial training stages. The game            rarely relies on throwing a torrent of beasties at you to throw you            off course though; instead the creatures are integral to the            puzzle, along with the placement of each egg, and any beasts that            you do come across can be dispatched by firing a freeze gun at            them, turning them into a block of ice.                         Success is usually a case of trial and error as you stumble about            each carefully constructed level, and you can be sure of screwing            up at least once on each. The challenges you come across are often            infuriatingly difficult, and you will probably find yourself having            to reset the level over and over again. Strangely though, you don't            find yourself simply switching off your GameBoy, throwing it out of            the window or grinding it under your foot. Rather you persevere and            just keep trying, and that's where Toki Tori's success lies - it's            just so compelling.                    A cutesy platform puzzler with an evil learning curve that bends at            a 90-degree angle makes Toki Tori quite a shock to the system at            first. Blending this with well-animated and colourful characters,            devious level design and a charming soundtrack make Toki Tori an            entertaining and challenging addition to any mobile gaming            collection though."}
