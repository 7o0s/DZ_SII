And indeed, if            you go through Resident Evil and replace the zombies with            Tyrannosaurs, Raptors and other assorted prehistoric nasties, you            do end up with a resoundingly similar picture.                         Dino Crisis though, puts you in control of a lass called Regina,            rather than a lass called Jill, and Regina is a member of a secret            government organisation sent to bring an a nasty situation under            control at a remote location in the middle of nowhere\u2026 Oh            shut up. Anyway, the remote spot just so happens to be an island,            controlled by the elusive Dr. Kirk, who has been conducting some            rather unusual experiments involving prehistoric creatures.            Dinosaurs, no less, which in due course break loose and run wild            all over the place. Controlling Regina and regularly interacting            with other operatives on the island, you must evacuate survivors            and try and locate Kirk himself, if he is still alive.                         Basically it's survival horror by numbers. You have to find keys,            push buttons and shoot things to get your way. Thankfully, the            shooting and moving sides of things have been speeded up            noticeably, so running Regina around is no problem, and the freedom            of movement makes dealing with dinos a lot easier than otherwise.                    The sense of freedom in Dino Crisis is also greater. There are            multiple paths that can be taken, and your choices can directly            affect later stages of the game. Sometimes you end up covering the            ground you missed during the course of the game, sometimes you            don't. A slightly unfortunate side effect of this is that at times            missing out a room can call for some tedious backtracking once the            rest of the level is dispensed with.                         In keeping with the branching plot are the multiple endings. There            are three in total, uncovered simply by taking different courses            throughout the game. If you do particularly well, you are also            rewarded with extra costumes for Regina, who looks splendiferous            bedecked in her new gear. It would be grossly inaccurate to say            that the extra costumes encourage replay, but the extra endings            certainly do - and with the chief attraction here being a            suspenseful single player game, branching levels help to keep            things fresh with each subsequent turn.                         Although rather clich\u00e9d, the story definitely suits the            setting. After all, if you were conducting deadly experiments, you            would no doubt use an abandoned island as the setting. And although            the experiment did go wrong, unlike other games which often            dispense with such pleasantries as the whys and wherefores, Dino            Crisis actually lets you in on the secret, albeit gradually, as the            game wears on. This is mostly thanks to some spectacular FMV, which            advances the story nicely at regular intervals. They also leave            lots of unanswered questions that help to keep everyone tense.                    It's about now that we start to pick up on the negative points.            Dino Crisis is a great game, and very enjoyable, but regrettably,            Capcom didn't see fit to do much to help spice up the Dreamcast            port. The original PlayStation version was released eons ago and            like all PSX games suffered from some rather poor graphics and            low-poly models. The background and general setting has been            smoothed over quite effectively here, but the low-poly models            remain, and they really do take some of the bite away from the            game.                         The level design, sound effects and such are all identical too,            which is somewhat annoying, especially in light of the rather            brilliant Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Dreamcast update that we took a            look at last week. Visually it's unremarkable, and a missed            opportunity.                         The only area that has seen an appropriate level of attention we'd            say is the control system. It was perfectly acceptable to begin            with of course, but now it mimics Resident Evil: Code Veronica in            its styling, with additions like the ability to swivel on the spot            to take on multiple attackers. Also, in the original incarnation of            Dino Crisis, the camera angles sometimes made it hard to guess            which direction you pressed to make Regina go forward - not so now.                    Speaking of camera angles, another big point of tension is the way            these are put to use. Although their positioning is quite            restrictive, to the point of becoming frustrating at times, they            definitely build up tension by obscuring certain points of entry            for enemies. If you suspect a dino is lurking just off screen, you            are right 90% of the time, and although this makes the action            rather predictable, it doesn't half add to the tension.                         Other good points are the moody soundtrack, which thankfully            remains untouched, and also the AI of the dinos, which although            rather limited is very effective. Raptors sail through the air            toward you and Tyrannosaurs stomp dramatically - I didn't notice at            any one point a dino getting caught on a wall or anything else like            that. Quite an achievement.                         But ultimately, you have to ask, is Dino Crisis as scary a year            on? Having not really played it since the original PlayStation            release, I certainly thought so. A lot has happened to survival            horror since then, but the effect is still quite startling. The            only criticisms to be levelled at this game are that it doesn't            take advantage of the Dreamcast's technical improvements, and that            unlike other Capcom ports, it doesn't offer anything new to            old-hands.                    Capcom have released a lot of games on the Dreamcast lately,            including quite a few ports from old PlayStation games, and            unfortunately, Dino Crisis is not the best of them, not even the            best of the survival horror games. Still, if you're new to the            genre, it's one of the tidiest efforts, even if it's starting to            show its age, and if you own the sequel, this demands to be played            for the sake of completion. If only they had taken some time to            refine it for the DC audience though. Ah well."}
