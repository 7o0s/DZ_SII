Dates may change and you            may not care about 90 per cent of them, but they all cross our            desks and we have to give them all a bit of time and appreciation.                    It's a situation that hasn't changed much since I started the job.            The first review I wrote for this organ was about a racing game,            and there have been many more since. So believe me when I say that            a racing game has to do a lot to make a serious impression on me.            Last year only produced a handful of examples.                    Racing Evoluzione is the first game to make this year's list.        First and foremost, Racing Evoluzione distinguishes itself by            keeping things relatively simple. Load up the game and it doesn't            address you with seventeen different variations on lap racing and            another dozen concerned with time trials. There's Dream Mode,            Arcade Mode and Options. Arcade mode opens up to reveal Quick Race            (pick a track and pick a car), Time Attack (the now fairly standard            name for a Time Trial mode), and One-on-One (which is for the            two-player split-screen mode).                    Dream Mode, on the other hand, is a very different proposition to            your average ~Campaign~, ~Career~ or ~Championship~ option. Instead            of picking a car and then buying better ones or simply unlocking            them as you go, you start off your own car manufacturer, building a            car up from blueprints and entering races to impress people and            pick up orders. The game begins as you dust off a rundown            corrugated iron garage with your Joey-From-Friends mechanic, who            luckily discovers a set of three concept car blueprints, from which            you'll build your company's first car.                    ~Six months later~, your garage looks a bit tidier, with a            bookshelf storing game options (something Joey is very surprised to            find himself telling you about), a calendar on the wall listing the            two championships you can enter (and the 37 others you can't until            later), which acts as a gateway to racing, and the workshop floor,            where you can see your car, tweak engine options and head out onto            the test track (a car park - how sweet!).                    Finish your first few races ahead of the pack (we varied between            first and fourth - the qualifying bracket) and Joey will tell you            that orders are flying in. Moving onto the new production            department, you can check up on sales. When you have 100 sales, you            can choose to build another Roadster, or wait until 300 to build a            sports car. This goes on in R&D, where you pick from other            blueprints. And so on.        However, despite the depth this            approach implies, it feels more like window dressing for a normal            racer. Building your own cars is a nice idea, but you don't have            any say in how they look (other than colour) or even much say in            how they handle. You can select between normal and drift handling            to begin with, and then you open up gear ratio options and a little            more later on - but never a huge amount. Fortunately the options            you do change make an appreciable difference. Switching to a low            gear ratio will improve your acceleration and likewise, switching            to drift handling gives the game more of a Ridge Racer feel than a            GT one. Of which more later.                    And even the principle selling point - the idea of running your own            car company - is pretty much just a Ridge Racer style ~excuse~. As            you get better and better, Joey tells you to hire secretaries and            you see more staff milling about, but you have little to do with            them and don't get to pick them. This isn't Theme Hospital for            cars, sadly. What's more, the sales figures (which unlock more            R&D funds) are a simple substitution for points. Win a race and            you get a set number of sales, then slightly lesser figures for            second, third, fourth. It's not all that original. The only real            difference is in small diversions offered between some            championships, like a wealthy Sheikh ordering a demonstration, and            buying 25 cars for his family if you win - but these seem similar            to the equivalent ~challenges~ thrown at you in games like Gran            Turismo and TOCA Race Driver. So on the whole, although a nice            aesthetic for a racing game, Racing Evoluzione's exciting new angle            isn't much more than a nice menuing system.                    Or it would be, except the presentation is good enough that you            don't care. Your garage is a nice layout and more interactive than            the (similar) office/garage setting in TOCA. Your mechanic is a            jovial, friendly chap who doesn't blurt out appalling Ridge            Racer/Auto Modellista-esque one-liners like ~you'd better teach me            how to race!~ and instead stands on the sidelines to encourage you.            And after a while you move to bigger premises. And as you win            championships, you unlock the real cars, which your competitors            drive for Arcade mode. Toyotas, Mercedes, Lotus, Renaults, MGs,            Fords, Chevrolets, Mitsubishis. Everything you'd expect. It does            feel like progression as you gradually build more and more            explosive cars, right up to Concept Dream Cars and so on, and it            does feel like a story, without the race-fixing and Yank petulance            which disrupted TOCA's efforts.        And indeed, then there's what goes on between the start and            finish lines. On a graphical level, this is on a par if not beyond            Project Gotham, which remains one of the most beautiful racing            games we've ever set eyes on. The level of detail on the cars is            fantastic, although the damage model is slightly odd (with visible            tears in the metalwork at times), but the reflections work            brilliantly (whether they are real time or not) and the concept            cars designed for the game fit in perfectly snugly with real world            equivalents on the race course. Meanwhile, the trackside scenery is            colossal in scope and nothing less than brilliant in execution.            Dazzling light effects play a big part, as the road sizzles under            the sun and the glare forces you to take a cautious line at times,            and landmarks pepper the scenery: flyovers arch into the sky,            mountains glisten with snow, which piles up on the side of the            track, cars can be seen minding their own business slowly pottering            around behind barriers, aeroplanes pierce the vista as they swoop            low towards airports, and on the whole there is always something            happening on-screen, and never a dull moment. Our only complaint is            that you'll rarely see much of it because you spend most of the            time with your eyes on the road.                    The tracks aren't all urban jungles either. You can pick from city,            mountain, racetrack and speedway (think NASCAR bowls), and many of            the individual tracks have been designed in the same way as Project            Gotham's offerings, snaking over the same broad design and thus            rehashing bits of each other to great effect. It works just as well            here as it did there.                    Oh, and despite throwing around more polygons than any other Xbox            racer we've seen, Racing Evoluzione rarely if ever skips a frame.            And that includes our appraisal of the two-player split-screen,            which was examined at jaw-to-the-floor inducing length. It looks            more or less exactly the same to our eyes as it does when            plastered over the entire TV. Glorious. Other bits of gloriousness?            5.1 surround sound, which had us oohing and ahhing, 480p            progressive scan support for HDTV nutters (according to what we've            read anyway), and the welcome inclusion of custom soundtracks, even            if the game does pick one song per race and replays it until you            finish.        We know what you're thinking. There's a question forming in            your mind which goes something like: ~So it looks good, it's            technically excellent, even if the whole car company idea is a bit            lean, but how the blummin' heck does it play?~ Well,            somewhere between pure arcade racers like Burnout 2 and out and out            simulation titles like Gran Turismo 3 lurks a little niche of            half-breeds - and nearly all of these titles are exceptional. Ridge            Racer Type 4 and Project Gotham Racing are our favourites, and            Racing Evoluzione's efforts also fit into this category.                    The game isn't a true simulation. It sacrifices elbow grease and            cuts corners if it means entertainment. The racing model is            somewhere between Gotham and Gran Turismo, with appreciable            variance in handling on different cars and a handful of tweakable            options, but by massaging the brakes and gas you can still swing            the rear end about like your car's a curvy blonde from Spearmint            Rhino.                    Coming to it off the back of games like Burnout 2 and Gotham, the            handling feels a bit awkward - switching on drift helps, but it's            still neither salaciously unrealistic nor a brittle reconstruction.            However, with five or six races under your belt, you start to            appreciate it. After five or six competitions, you're sliding with            the best of them and wringing the physics model for all the extra            oomph it can offer. And after 15 hours or so you feel as hopelessly            hooked as you did with Bizarre Creations' offering - the only            possible complaint being the lack of a Kudos system equivalent and            the strict adherence to racing, racing, racing.                    What may derail you at this point is the AI, which not only has the            frustrating tendency to cover enormous distances whenever you slip            up (or come to a dead stop because you hit a sharp edge on the            inside of a turn, grr), but also seems to avoid deceleration on            grass verges and other surfaces that blight your efforts. The            developer does go to some effort to emphasize the other drivers'            fallibility, as they overcook turns and lose places to one another            in your rear-view, but it smells like a cover-up. I think the other            drivers cheat. Still, at least they don't snake their way around            the track like GT's boring opposition does - there are real battles            going on here, and it feels like a race.                    And for us, the challenge to the strength of the game's 'feel'            posed by the AI's flaws merely serves to reinforce RE's greatness.            We persevered with the tricky AI, and became a better driver. You            can judge most turns by using the little map in the top left and            keeping an eye on the road, and it spurs you on when you cock it up            on the second lap of four and your previously distant rival            suddenly speeds past you.                    At the end of the day, the effect RE's flaws have on the game's            worth is subjective, and for us they fail to outweigh its visual            and physical excellence. We can put up with the sound of someone            smacking a tin sheet with a hammer whenever we nudge a competitor            (which is roughly what it sounds like), we like the trumped up            'Dream Mode', and we've overcome our dissatisfaction with the AI.            We firmly recommend Racing Evoluzione to people who can do the same            - other than that, it's only a few lengths behind Project Gotham            (which offers slightly more variety), and perhaps, dare we say it,            Ridge Racer Type 4.                    If only it had Live support."}
