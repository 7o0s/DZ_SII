{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-rez-dc", "date": "30 Mar 2004", "game_name": "Rez", "text": "While some would like to think of Rez as genre-breaking (or even            genre-forming), it's essentially a 3D shoot 'em up. There isn't            really a lot more to it than that. It's not deep; there is no            elegant, unfolding narrative; there's no character development or            huge locales to explore. It's just a shoot 'em up.                         But ~just~ is such a misleading word. Because although Rez is            based around a tried and tested formula, UGA have done something            truly amazing with it. The action follows the story of a huge            computer network under siege by viruses taking control of the whole            system. The attack has forced the systems central AI, Eden, into            hiding deep within the network, and it's your task to release her            by trekking through the five sub-systems, shooting down viruses and            breaking firewalls (bosses) until you find her.                         Rez plays a lot like Sega's classic Space Harrier, with the camera            watching the action and player from a third-person perspective, as            he/she/it progresses through each level on a set course. You're            able to rotate your character through 360 degrees on occasion to            take out enemies coming at you from behind, and sometimes the game            takes care of this for you as well so you're left to concentrate on            the action.                         Bringing down your adversaries consists of simply holding down the            fire button and passing the crosshairs over them, at which point            your laser is locked onto them and they're shot down as soon as you            release the button. You can also rack up multiple targets before            releasing the button to inflict the maximum amount of damage.            Naturally as the game progresses in difficulty, some enemies take            multiple hits to despatch. Now, you'd be forgiven at this point for            thinking ~so?~, but what makes Rez so damn appealing is that it's            literally an interactive work of art.                    At first, your environment consists of a few red bars running            underneath your floating humanoid body, itself simply made up of            squares to begin with, however your character can evolve through            several humanoid forms throughout your journey by collecting blue            orbs dropped by ex-virii. The soundtrack is merely a slow, thumping            bass drum and the experience is a sparse, empty one. As you shoot            down your first couple of viruses, they emit small sounds, like a            snare hit or synth stab as they explode into shards of wireframe            polygons. These sounds release in time with the thumping bass, and            as more enemies come at you and you get a lot handier with the            targeting cursor, something resembling music begins to form.                         Eventually a small cube will float into view, which contains the            ~password~ to the next level. Shooting this down will progress your            character deeper into the network, all the while your surroundings            becoming more complex, forming recognisable shapes and structures            around you which pulsate and deform in time with the music. By the            time you reach the first boss, your speakers and screen are            exploding in an orgy of sound and abstract colour which forces a            smile onto your face.                         The boss battles are an incredibly stressful experience, and can            often be an exercise in luck more than skill. This is especially so            in the later stages of the game when it chucks as many projectiles            at you as possible in a bid to thoroughly confuse you - a tactic at            which Rez succeeds admirably.                         Once you get over how damn gorgeous Rez looks and sounds (you            really have to see it moving, these shots don't even come close to            doing it justice - especially when using a VGA box), there is            nothing more here for you. There are extra areas to unlock, and            score attack modes to play, but .. well that's it. UGA have gotten            so carried away with making this a sensually immersive title that            they forgot they need to justify to your average gamer why forking            out \u00a330 on a game that will take five hours to finish would be            a good idea. It's worth at least renting, though, just to see            whether or not you like it.                    Rez is one of those games which shouldn't be released at full            whack. The forthcoming PlayStation 2 release is even less            attractive, thanks to Sony's inexplicable reluctance to permit            cut-price software. When Rez eventually turns up cheaply it will            become indispensable, but until then it's a luxury. Albeit an            extraordinarily pretty, addictive and entertaining luxury. For            people with disposable income and aspirations of class, perhaps.                         Once you get it on a big TV or monitor and hook it all up to a            meaty stereo system, it really is something special to behold. In            an entertainment medium currently obsessed with realism, it's nice            to experience a new take on game design ethics of the past that            reminds us why we play videogames in the first place: for fun."}
