However, the new handheld incarnation of            this apparently unstoppable franchise is far better than you might            imagine.                        Ubi Studios have obviously gone to a lot of effort to cram            everything they possibly could from the original game onto the            cart, right down to the familiar Rogue Spear theme tune which            greets you in all its orchestral glory when you first load up the            game. Naturally a change of vantage point was necessary, but this            has been worked around with a carefully considered top-down view.            You can see a fair distance around your team, and a manual-aiming            mode enables your viewing radius to increase, as if peering through            a rifle scope.                        It was hard to get used to the cartoonish style of the graphics at            first, but the variety of textures across the environments coupled            with the wonderfully detailed animations soon help any misgivings            to disappear. And while the visuals might not be as realistic as in            its PC forefather, Rogue Spear is still very much alive. Both            ambient and functional sound effects (such as shouts from            team-mates and enemies) convey the tense atmosphere of the original            admirably, and the music is nothing short of excellent. It's likely            that you will hear an enemy before you see him, whether he's            yelling at a hostage to shut up or actually shooting at you. Should            the latter be the case, a visual aid in the form of small red            arrows indicating the direction of your assailant will appear, and            if you're particularly slow to react your AI team mates will kill            him for you.                    Save the change in viewpoint, the conversion is extremely faithful.            As you no doubt know by now, Rogue Spear follows the exploits of a            team of elite special forces troops known as Rainbow Six as they            battle terrorists in situations considered too delicate for the            involvement of the UN.                        The handheld version of the game takes in fifteen missions spread            across eight different environments based on maps from the PC            original, with objectives varying from rescues and reconnaissance            to full-on assaults. Up to four people can also play on any of            these maps in deathmatch and co-operative modes, accessible via a            single cartridge. One thing that has been stripped from the game            though is the somewhat confusing planning phase. This is replaced            by a rudimentary team selection screen, where you can pick            specialist team members such as demolitions experts or snipers and            choose their uniform. The developers made the right decision in            axing the planning stages, and while it lends the action phase more            of an arcade feel, it by no means detracts from the completeness of            the experience.                         Controlling your team is perhaps more laborious than I would have            hoped for though, with even simple functions often requiring the            use of three-button combinations. Unfortunately this renders the            game less than intuitive, and you may have to refer to the manual.            But once you're used to the complications, it becomes obvious that            this was a necessary evil in order to fit in all the moves you            would expect. Despite your detached viewpoint, stealth still plays            an important role, and to this end you are able to hide behind            crates, crouch to render your footsteps silent, and creep beneath            windows without detection - the tension this creates within the            tiny game world is astounding.                    Rogue Spear is a first for portable gaming - an engaging tactical            shooter with a real sense of tension. It's a superb addition to the            series, and although it can occasionally be more difficult than            enjoyably challenging, you'll still get a great deal of play out of            it."}
