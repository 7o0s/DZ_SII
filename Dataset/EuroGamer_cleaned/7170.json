While testing the game for the first time, I            discovered that it actually consisted of not two games, but one!            The first game is called ~JoJo no Kimyouna Bouken~ and its sequel            ~Miraihe no Isan~ (actually ~JoJo's Bizarre Adventure~ and            ~Heritage for the Future~ in English). The original did see some            exposure in the West, in American arcades at least, although I            wouldn't blame you for having missed it - I hadn't a bloody clue            what it was about either!                         Ironically, the first, which gives the game its catchy title, is            the one which you'll play the least. The moves and characters in            Heritage are the same as the original, and so is the Story Mode, so            in essence playing the sequel is about all you'll end up doing -            the choice is a welcome bonus though.         In order to bring a little variation to the            table, Capcom have altered the standard Street Fighter button            layout. The top three buttons are light, medium and heavy attacks -            which may be punches or kicks, dependant on the character you're            using. The other two buttons of the five-button control system            handle taunting and ~Stand~. Pressing the three attack buttons all            together lets you dodge the attack and lets you avoid otherwise            devastating attacks from your opponent. Timing is key to this, so            it's hardly the quick-fix solution to getting your arse kicked.                         ~Stand~ isn't what it sounds like. It brings up a spiritual guide            to aid you. Upon pressing the ~Stand~ button, he arrives and mimics            you during the battle, allowing you to double the power of your            attack. It's a useful and inventive addition to the game.                         The fighters have a fairly limited arsenal of attacks to choose            from, in spite of JoJo's inventive control and attack system. Each            character can expect to have about 16 moves, maximum, including            supers. Although small, the quantity of moves needn't be a            hindrance, as by stringing attacks together into combinations, the            tiny amount becomes veritable in combat.                         The supers and juggle combos make the battles almost as            entertaining as the totally over the top battles in Marvel Vs.            Capcom. The characters themselves provide half the visual glitz and            glam, animated so well not just visually but also            characteristically. The wacky carnival freaks perform all sorts of            amazing acrobatic attacks and finishing combinations that it's            truly a sight to behold!                         From belly dancers to enchanted dogs, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure            isn't short of quirky combatants, making each battle enjoyable.            Thanks to the game's eccentricities, each battle can be both            action-packed and humorous. The whole game just breeds fun.                    Unlike virtually every other beat-em-up in existence, JoJo's            two-player mode actually suffers compared to the single player            campaign. I enjoyed the CPU battles more than the human ones - my            friends simply weren't as talented and inventive as the CPU            opponents.                    I find it hard to class JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in the same            category as the likes of Soul Calibur and Street Fighters Zero 3,            but I can't help but enjoy the thing. It's probably going to be a            bit of a sleeper hit at the end of the day, with those who don't            play it not really caring, but those who do really enjoying it. I'd            give it a rental at the very least. If you've got Soul Calibur and            are looking for something new, give it a try!                        - Out Now"}
