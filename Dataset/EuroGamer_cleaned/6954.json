However, in the midst of all            this gloom come a few beacons of hope which could well set the            Dreamcast as a format in good stead for the next year or so. One            such glimmer of hope has come in the form of Sonic Team's latest            magnum opus, Sonic Adventure 2.                         The original Sonic Adventure was somewhat of a departure for the            famed blue spikeball, with the fast-paced action of previous            outings taking a sidestep to introduce more sedate adventure            stages, which necessitated the exploration of your surrounding            world in order to reveal the storyline at your own pace, unlocking            and discovering action phases as you progressed in your adventure.            While this proved to be a successful blend of the old Sonic formula            and an attempt at a deeper approach to engaging the player, it            didn't wholly suit the brand of Sonic as we knew him, and we            ultimately missed the all-out action the original formula provided.            So with the sequel, Sega have taken steps to provide those players            with lashings upon lashings of hair-raising speed and excitement            from the outset, but that isn't to say that the notion of depth has            been entirely outcast.             This is the first Sonic title to actively pursue                 some kind of decent narrative, instead of the usual blind hunt                 for the Chaos Emeralds for no apparent reason. The tale dates                 back to when Dr. Robotnik's (or, as the game irritatingly and                 consistently refers to him, Dr. Eggman) grandfather, Gerald                 Robotnik, constructed a huge space colony named ARK, aboard                 which he was conducting experiments into the secret of                 immortality. A product of these experiments was a curiously                 familiar looking creature known as Shadow (basically, Sonic's                 evil twin). When the military finds out about this project,                 they attempt to capture Shadow in vain, instead killing                 Gerald's niece by mistake. Shadow is then consumed by the                 anger of Gerald Robotnik, and vows to assist Dr. Eggman                 Robotnik in his continuing attempts to take over the world.                 Yes, highly cheeseball, but what did you expect? What matters                 is that although the game takes a considerably linear approach                 to progress compared to its predecessor, the narrative is                 driven very well simply with the aid of cut-scenes and clever                 plot crossovers.                    At the starting menu, you have the option to play the story in Hero            or Dark modes, and each mode proffers three characters for your            control. However, you don't choose an initial character to stick            with from the start, but rather the characters effectively take it            in turns level by level. Obviously, things kick off with Sonic, and            kick off they do in spectacular fashion with Sonic boarding down            the traffic strewn streets, weaving between cars and leaping off            ramps. It's a superb start to the game that really sets the pace            and feel for what is to follow, concluding with a manic escape from            a marauding juggernaut, somewhat reminiscent of the whale escape in            the original. Sonic's levels really are the most joyous to behold            within the game, as the ever-shifting dynamic takes you on a            frenetic rollercoaster ride of twisting, undulating levels            interspersed with monster pummeling platform sections - it's the            constant change of pace throughout the entire game that keeps you            interested.                         As the story develops, control is handed over to Tails in his            missile equipped mech-suit, in a slightly more slow paced approach            to the proceedings which is a lot more Mario 64 than classic Sonic,            with the emphasis set greatly on precision platforming action. It's            quite refreshing to have a return to these sort of pure gameplay            dynamics, yet Sonic Team have enough clever tricks up their sleeves            in order to maintain an air of constant surprise and excitement.             The third and final ~hero~ character is Knuckles                 the echidna, who's missions involve hunting for various                 emeralds in small, dedicated levels using a bafflingly vague                 ~radar~ and a lot of guesswork. Of the three main different                 types of play, the hunting mode is crushingly dull in                 comparison to the rest, which is a great shame and stops the                 game as a whole from escalating into the highest echelons of                 greatness.                         If you choose to play the Dark story mode, the proceedings are            more or less the same as in Hero mode, with Shadow taking Sonic's            role of dashing about like a madman, Robotnik assuming the position            of Tales in the platform sections, and new character Rouge the bat            doing the hunting. The clever part of all this is that the two            modes are following the same story, but the characters switch            positions and often locations, occasionally coming across each            other in the form a boss section. During cut-scenes, you can            witness the actions of the other side from a different perspective,            and it all intertwines neatly. Playing both story modes at the same            time as we did, you can view the progressing narrative from both            perspectives, which really enriches the experience - this way of            telling the story reminded me somewhat of the way Half-Life's            Opposing Force expansion pack told the same story from the other            side's perspective.                    Underneath the huge range of ways to play the game through come the            little sub-games and sections which give the title extra longevity            and depth, and Sega haven't skimped a bit. For starters, once            you've completed a stage proper, you can retry the level again with            a different objective. For example, on the first stage the aim is            to simply reach the goal. On replaying the level, your objective is            to collect 100 rings. Achieve that, and you then have to find a            lost Chao creature. There are a total of 5 different missions            per level, which adds up to plenty of stuff to do once            you're finished with the story.                         Oh yes, and speaking of the Chao, they've returned once more in            their own dedicated section which can be accessed in-between            levels, or via the stage selection screen. You can only access the            Chao garden between levels by finding a key on the previous level,            however, and the advantage to this is that you can crossbreed the            animals you find during your mission with your Chao to create an            impossibly huge combination of results.                         But we don't stop there, oh no, there are even more unlockable            nicknaks, like a Kart Racing mode where you race against all the            other characters on a selection of tracks, and upload your fastest            times to a world leaderboard. Unfortunately, the kart racing isn't            available in multiplayer for Mario Kart style get-togethers, but            the regular games VS modes sort of compensate for this. While not            being quite as riotous fun as we'd hoped, the 2-player racing,            battle and hunting modes do serve as a pleasant diversion from the            single player game for a while.                    Naturally, no game is without its faults, and SA2 is without            exception. The largest problem, as with the original, is the            dynamic camera. It often switches to the most awkward positions            possible, leading to death at the hands of an out-of-view gap, or a            monster hidden under a wall which you didn't see because the camera            couldn't catch up to your position in time. The trigger buttons to            serve to alleviate this somewhat, with the ability to swing it            round to your preference, but sometimes it just doesn't budge at            apparently random times.                         Another niggle which surfaced - albeit extremely rarely - was some            slightly dodgy collision detection when attacking monsters and            trying to hit speed boost pads whilst running - that is, however,            an extremely slight complaint.                         Sonic Adventure 2 is a triumph. Whilst its predecessor was a            fantastic game in its own right, it could be a little overbearing            with the ~adventure~ aspect, and with this Sega have gone back to            Sonic's roots in style - buy it now."}
