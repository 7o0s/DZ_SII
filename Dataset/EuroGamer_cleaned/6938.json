It's a            visual tour de force, an auditory delight, and a game that will            suck more hours out of your life than smoking fifty a day. It has            so much to offer, it does it with style and finesse, and boasts an            unparalleled reward structure to keep you coming. Can you tell that            we like it yet?                         It's not entirely without its problems. Without further ado, let            me introduce you to the AI, an acronym which any cinema-goer who            didn't already know can now tell you stands for ~Artificial            Intelligence~. It might as well mean ~Artificial Incompetence~            where Gran Turismo 3 is concerned though. Even as a humble            greenhorn, yours truly was able to take a few championships simply            by lining up cars attempting to pass in the mirror so that they            bounced harmlessly off the rear bumper. The computer controlled            cars bash into walls, they bash into each other, and they show            absolutely no stealth or cunning in overtaking you; they are            not artificially intelligent.                         Overtaking manoeuvres really get the blood pumping, but if            developer Polyphony had managed to instil some logic into the minds            of the other drivers the game would be even more exciting. Fending            off a Dodge Viper with your Corvette's rear bumper is an unlikely            scenario for a game that prides itself on its realism, and any game            that allows you to lean on that Dodge Viper to get round a corner            when you haven't braked hard enough is just taking the Mickey.            Furthermore, you cannot tell me that in a vaguely competitive field            of drivers the human player should always win, despite having a            technically inferior vehicle. Where's the logic in that? But it            happens. You can blow away rival drivers by taking the corners with            an ounce of bounce, or simply making sure they can't get up the            inside of you. They only ever use the racing line, so it's not too            difficult to avoid that. Breezing through later championships with            a car that isn't even on the same page as the other five runners is            pretty upsetting, especially when you've invested so much time in            the game.                    And given how good everything else in Gran Turismo 3 is, you will            be investing a lot of time in the game. For starters I have            to talk about the graphics, which are simply amazing. From the            start of the very first race you're mesmerized. As you sit on the            grid the heat haze wafts upward, distorting the air. As you pull            away, the textures of the road and background will look vaguely            attractive (and inexplicably unique from inch to inch), but what            really catches your eye are the reflections in the metal of the            other vehicles. The trees, sky and roadside artefacts are            painstakingly inverted and modelled onto the curves of the cars in            real time. It's enough to make PSOne Gran Turismo owners weep tears            of joy.                         As you continue the graphics become less important, and are            occasionally spoilt by one or two brief bouts of pop-up at the            extremities of the landscape, or garish Firestone billboards with            their flawless opaque reds and whites that just look wrong in such            a sumptuous environment. But these are minor defects, especially            once you move onto the replay section. As in the first two games in            the series, once you complete a race in GT3 you are whisked back to            the starting line to watch it again in the exhaustive replay mode.            You can watch from certain preset camera angles that change            TV-style as you watch yourself zoom around the track, or you can            flip to the in-car view to see how things went. Using the D-pad you            can navigate between car views, which is incredibly useful            when you're trying to establish how so-and-so in the Mazda MX-5            took that corner so perfectly, and since you're not at the controls            every detail is visualized, analysed and swooned over. A good            amount of my early hours at the reins were spent in Replay mode.                         As you move through the game the level of presentation is            exceptional, with wonderfully clear menus and instructions etched            onto the screen, and a million and one new cars to marvel over in            the Garage, the body shop and on the race screen. New conditions            like wet tracks rear their heads making the game far more            interesting and visually even more stunning. The improved Rally            tracks look dusty and gritty, with little tufts of grass that stick            up realistically from the ground and huge clouds of dust dancing            around in the haze. Huge trees overhang some areas of the course,            and driving through deciduous arches of forestry with the sun            beaming through the gaps and peppering the track is frankly            unmatched in any other game I've encountered, on the PlayStation 2            or anywhere else.                    Completing the illusion of reality are some electrifying samples.            The sound of engines roaring brought goosebumps out on my back, and            every single car has a unique engine signature which sounds            distinguishably different. Quite an achievement. If there's one            thing I enjoy about driving in real life it's the sound of the            engine, that low rumbling as you rev it before it's called into            action, the loud roar as you release the clutch and the gentle dip            as you go up a gear. I love it, and Polyphony evidently do as well.            There's passion here.                         As you zoom down the straights, the wind whistles playfully and            bobs off your bonnet or howls past you depending on your viewpoint.            In previous games there were three alternative viewpoints, but in            GT3 there's front bumper and there's up-and-behind. Both are useful            in the course of a race to judge position, corners and most of all            slipstreams. As you make your way into the wake of that Dodge Viper            GTS I mentioned earlier, you will want to make sure that you're not            losing speed because of him, and the sound of the wind is your key            here. Unfortunately GT3 boasts a stunning soundtrack to boot. I say            unfortunately, because you'll want to turn it off to improve your            chances in the race. Although there are some classy tracks from the            likes of Iggy Pop, Feeder and other groups, with the ability to            pick out your favourites and set up your own playlist, they don't            fit the atmosphere.                         Moving away from the overall aesthetic though, the most obvious            thing about Gran Turismo 3 is that it is big. To start with            there is the Arcade mode, in which you can race pretty much any car            you like on your own. This can be done as a time trial, against a            friend in split screen mode, against a friend on another            PlayStation 2, or even against five other PlayStation 2 owners            thanks to the versatility of iLink... Arcade mode at its highest            levels is almost more challenging than Gran Turismo mode.                    Gran Turismo mode is where you will spend most of your time though.            Newcomers to the series will dive into the License test area and            learn the basics of starting, gear shifting, stopping distances,            cornering, speed control, how to work in slippery conditions and so            on. There are six different licenses, and each contains eight tests            which must be passed at a minimum of Bronze level. Silver and Gold            times can also be challenged for, and you will keep coming            back for them.                        You don't need a license to get going, and Gran Turismo veterans            may take this as a good reason to go and blow some cash on a motor.            For the 18,000 nondenominational credits you start with, a decent            range of low-power vehicles are available, including a few gems            like the Mazda MX-5. There are 185 cars in Gran Turismo 3, a bit of            a dip from the last game but still a huge number, and not all of            them can be accessed simply by blowing 50,000 bucks. Some can only            be gained by winning competitions, and others are unlocked for            purchase by winning things. For instance, there are ten Formula            1 cars from the last two decades that can be raced once unlocked,            but it requires you to win about sixty championships, and each race            can be anything from ten to seventy laps.                         Once you've picked a car you can clock some performance statistics            in the Machine Test or throw it around a track in one of the            Beginner championships. Even before you get to the hidden modes,            the Beginner, Amateur and Professional leagues each feature twenty            championships made up of anything from three to ten different            races, many of them set across a huge number of laps and featuring            proper qualifying sessions. Then there is the Rally event, made up            of ten championships with three races each, which by itself puts            Colin McRae and most other dedicated rally games to shame. Beyond            that there are ten Endurance races, which are so-named for a            reason, each taking upwards of an hour to complete! It isn't just            about the racing either. You can tune your car up with new parts            bought from your winnings - new suspension and brakes, shock            absorbers, lightweight alloy bodies, all the way through to whole            new engines. And yes, they sound different to the old ones.                    Gran Turismo 3 is everything to everyone. If you're a casual racer            you can blow yourself away in Arcade mode, uncovering hundreds of            little bonuses and racing against friends. If you want a bit more            depth, there's the Gran Turismo mode where you can spend time            tuning your car, making it purr, winning championships and            unlocking more cars. If you get bored you can spend time shaving            hundredths of a second off your license test times. The feeling of            jubilation once you have Gold awards for every area of every test            is immeasurable.                         I've been playing Gran Turismo 3 solidly for a week now, doing            little else in that time, and I can't honestly say that I've done            more than scratch the surface yet. I will probably be playing this            game for months, and even then I won't finish it. It's            all-encompassing, and like its predecessors before it, teaches the            racing genre a thing or two about itself. Developers will be            copying it for years, gamers will be playing it for years. It            doesn't matter who you are, you should buy GT3. It's not perfect,            but it's very, very close."}
