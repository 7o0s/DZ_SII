A game based on the cunning            exploits of our favourite big-screen nutcase, and his intense            battles with the evil Zurg! Except, oh, it's not. It's actually a            game based on the crummy Saturday morning TV series, with all the            contorted polygons and unfinished animations that made that so            forgettable. There's no charm, no wit, no guile to our beloved Buzz            - and once again it's Traveler's Tales that is responsible, the            company that brought us such terrible bores as Captain            Blasto\u2026                         It's very hard to get excited about Buzz Lightyear of Star            Command. The films were intended to entertain everyone, and did so            admirably. This particular game seems like a cheap excuse to take a            few 5 year olds and their parents to the cleaners. Watching my            little brother rocket around the levels it was fairly clear which            age group had won, and which had lost.                         But ignoring my as-yet unsatisfied desire for an adult-orientated            Toy Story game, does the game appeal to kids? Well yes, but then            sandpits appeal to kids - I'm not giving it a stellar rating            based on that.                         The first thing to note before we go anywhere is that the            screenshots are incredibly deceptive. If you blow up one of the            images on this page and have a look at it, you could be forgiven            for thinking that it looks pretty good. Do not be fooled.            The stylistic approach and toon shading (ala Jet Set Radio) are a            complete faux - if you see it in action, animations tear up in            front of you, polygons clip all over the place and Buzz himself,            whilst outlined by a thick marker pen looks no better for it. It's            a PlayStation game on the Dreamcast, with all the hacks and blurs            to get it there that Activision could employ.                         Texturing and backgrounds look like they've been drawn up in MS            Paint, and for the most part that's probably about as much            attention as they did get. The appreciable slowdown at times            doesn't help matters either, and I have no idea where it comes            from.                    What we really needed here was a third person Buzz Lightyear does            Duke Nukem style approach, with stunning one-liners and gags so            side-splitting as to make up for the game's shoddy programming and            lacklustre visuals entirely. Unfortunately, the best we get is            Buzz's ~High ho Silver and away!~ for the 21st Century clanger, ~To            infinity and beyond!~ Every five seconds. There's no bravado, wit,            cunning or sarcasm to anything the great Buzz Lightyear says.            Throughout the game's 14 increasingly dreary levels, not once did I            get the adrenaline rush of pure enjoyment I got watching the Toy            Story films.                         Buzz's arsenal is pretty Nerf-like, with Iceguns, rockets, plasma            balls and such, but the variety is unnecessary, since as long as            you can steady the camera for a couple of seconds you can take out            most of the bad-guys on-screen in one blast. That said, their            propensity to fire first at stupidly high velocities kind of spoils            the effect. Generally speaking the best thing to do is to leap on            by, or collect a Hoverboard and whoosh past.                         Oh yes, I forgot, that's Buzz Lightyear of Star Command's one            redeeming feature - its powerups. Jet Packs and Hoverboards are the            order of the day, and they do inject a certain amount of            entertainment into proceedings. Speeding at incredible velocities            past your enemies and over lava pits whilst screaming ~To infinity            and beyond!~ is about as close to the films as the game gets. That            said, it still has none of the charm.                    The gameplay is strangely tenuous, despite the obvious templates            for control laid out by a million other third person 3D platformers            since Mario 64. The setup is awkward at times, and as you rummage            around trying to get used to it you'll wonder however kids are            supposed to enjoy this at all.                         Why oh why the companies involved here didn't make some sort of            Donkey Kong Country hybrid using Buzz and Woody is beyond me. The            scope for gaming spin-offs from Toy Story is unimaginable, and            instead of doing something to appeal to gamers of all ages and            walks of life like the films did, Activision shovel any old dross            out of the door and hope some luckless parent will stumble upon it            in time for their child's birthday.                         If only people could understand that properties like Toy Story are            gold dust. After all, games like Quake are obscenely            popular, but you can hardly sell them to everyone can you? With Toy            Story, you could make any style of spin-off appeal to every gamer            on the planet instantly if only you put a little work in. But            this? Talk about trying my patience.                         To its credit the game does take several hours to complete, which            is more than can be said for some games recently, but it's not            enough.                    At the end of the day one has to consider that the Toy Story            franchise is just that, a franchise, and that to the developers and            publishers this game is the equivalent of a lunchbox with a Toy            Story sticker on it. They took Captain Blasto and slapped some new            paint on it, just like they did with the TV series. It's a dreadful            loss, and yet it's a move twinged with inevitability.                         As long as you give up on the notion that this is a Toy Story game            and instead view it as Zurg's bizarre attempt to usurp our dearly            loved hero you might enjoy Buzz Lightyear, but otherwise in all            likelihood you will decide to avoid it completely. Opting for one            of the countless other 3D platformers currently bedazzling the            gaming sector isn't a bad idea. With little variety in its missions            and only a couple of redeeming features, the game won't do much to            hold your interest. Although the little ones might enjoy it, for            what it costs it seems like an awful waste, especially when Buzz            Lightyear toys (which are so much more fun - I can testify) are            cheaper. Get your kid a few dolls, or buy the newly released            double-disc DVD box set. Whatever you do though, don't let Buzz            Lightyear of Star Command ruin your memory of the fantastic film            duet."}
