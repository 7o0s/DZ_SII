Still,            semantic naming issues aside, it's no surprise to see a modern day            update to this classic miniature racer, although instead of            ~Codemasters~, the byline now reads ~Infogrames Sheffield~. After            some sort of licensing coup and a modest period of development, the            next generation PS2 and Xbox versions of MicroMachines have            appeared - but has the formula grown with the technology?                    Short answer: no, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.            MicroMachines retains its simple formula; pick a driver and scoot            around workbenches, living rooms, beaches, garden ponds and all            sorts of other locations in a tiny plastic car, viewed from a            quasi-overhead view that shifts and pans with the action. Ninety            per cent of the skill is in remembering the next turn in time, five            per cent is in marshalling the accelerator in the face of pitfalls,            and five per cent is in making considered use of the various            power-ups, which range from extendable boxing gloves and magnets to            speed boosts and frying pan thumpers.        There are eight            tracks to play about with to start off, and you unlock more as you            complete the various four-map rounds of the main championship mode.            Sadly, it won't take all that long to do this. Bronze championship            features some very simple tracks (scoot round once and you'll never            slip off the side again), while Silver, Gold and Platinum introduce            progressively more varied designs, which makes memorising them a            lot harder. And if you can't remember where the next turn is,            you'll need to either slow down or risk ending up off course, in            the wrong direction or worse, pitching off the side of a table. To            do so means a few lost seconds as you get back up to speed and a            lot of loud swearing.                    Cars and drivers have cute honking sounds and characteristic quips,            and you can pick from the likes of a Frankenstein's monster-esque            zombie, an '80s playboy and a cop called Callahan. Switching            drivers makes little difference, but it's a nice bonus. Each driver            gets five different vehicles, although these are pre-selected            depending on the stage - wouldn't make much sense taking a sports            car to a speedboat race, after all. The difference in handling is            slight - bikes are nippier for instance than sports cars with            smaller turning circles, while boats tend to skid out and have more            trouble accelerating.        Unsurprisingly,            MicroMachines makes its biggest strides forward in the graphical            department. Each of the game's tracks is a basic route surrounded            by luscious superficial detail. Racing through the whizzkid's lab,            you'll zoom along gauze netting, past bubbling (and exploding) test            tubes and past the guru's fingers tapping on a keyboard. In the            barn, you'll dodge under tapping feet, race across roof rafters and            bounce into piles of hay, with chickens clucking at you from the            sidelines. Take it into the garden and plants will snap their jaws            at you, rats sniff and swipe their tails across your path and            leaves flutter in the wind. The biggest triumph though is on the            water - hop into the pond and the rippling, undulating surface is a            beauty to behold, with little floating leaves denoting the track            boundaries, water lilies, belligerent frogs and guppy fish cooing            at you. Beneath the shiny surface you can make out all manner of            objects on the bottom, like discarded coins, rocks and vegetation.            Sometimes you even end up switching terrain mid-race, travelling            beneath a lightning zapper and then sliding into the water just as            your car is transformed into a speedboat.                    The environment is quite interactive in places, too. Race along a            crossbeam during the barn party and you may have to dodge balloons,            and ram-raiding the Christmas crackers dotted around the course            often reveals hidden power-ups. Then there's the chap peeping out            from the manhole cover as you race over it, turning it into a            rudimentary jump, the crow in the spooky pond taking snaps at your            boat and clamshells on the beach doing likewise, as you dash            between the sandy toes of a buried and mildly irate Dad.                    Each of the cars is neatly modelled, although obviously they're            rather indistinct for the most part. Close-ups reveal your little            drivers yanking the sticks and twiddling the wheel though, and, in            the case of water races, one little feller is always sat in a            dinghy with his hand on the tiller. The real attention to detail            with the cars though is in the sound effects - hooting horns and            that indefatigable clicking noise that plastic makes as it hits the            concrete, with various clomping noises for the power-ups and a bit            of smack talk between races. Or not so if you end up placing            fourth.        Sadly, all this graphical excitement breeds a few complaints.            First off, the camera is oddly positioned, so that if you find            yourself spun by an opponent's magnet and shunted off the track,            you could end up with your car completely obscured by a clucking            hen, at which point it's trial and error to get your car facing the            right way and back on the track. What's more, as with its            predecessors, MicroMachines frowns on shortcut-taking - deviate a            little and a green exclamation mark indicator pops up, but if the            game thinks you're really extracting the Michael, the exclamation            mark goes red and the game pops you back on the track at an earlier            point.                    Then again, frustration is something MicroMachines players will            always have to put up with. Repeating the tougher tracks four or            five times to truly get the layout and then focusing on taking all            the turns at the right time is crucial, and quite painstaking when            it comes to the Gold and Platinum championships. Fortunately, those            sick of having to guestimate the next turn can always ignore            convention and opt for the new Micro GP mode, which places the            camera in a more traditional above-and-behind position, although            this is more of a novelty than a game in its own right. Sometime            soon, you will have to spend time learning the tracks.                    However, doing so can be quite rewarding - as with good old 16-bit            MicroMachines 2 and MicroMachines V3 on the PlayStation, the time            trial mode will suck up a lot of your, ahem, time, once you get the            hang of layouts and so on.        But the biggest problem of            all is that although MicroMachines sticks to the values of old,            there really isn't enough of it for single players. There's maybe            four or five hours tops here before you've exhausted all the            options for lone players, and then the game is left either to pick            up dust or to be picked up for five minutes once every few months.                    Unless of course you can convince some friends to join in            regularly...                    Put MicroMachines in front of four people instead of one and it's a            revelation. The Bomb Tag mode, which sees you struggling not to be            the bloke with the bomb as the timer hits zero, is the most            enjoyable foursome since [oops, family publication -Ed], rivalling            the likes of Bomberman for sheer simplistic, arcade fun. Then again            vanilla racing with four players is almost equally enjoyable.                    When viewed as a whole though, MicroMachines is worse than the sum            of its parts. It looks stunning at times, and it's curiously            addictive for something so frustrating, but it's not as varied as            MicroMachines V3 and it doesn't really introduce anything to the            series apart from the Micro GP diversion. As a multiplayer game you            really can't fault it, but the chances are you own V3 already, and            \u00a340 is an awful lot of money to spend on something so plainly            derived from its unrelated (and available much cheaper)            predecessors.
