Final Fantasy II introduced SNES owners to            the glory of 16-bit graphics and Cecil's carefully woven story of            intrigue showed gamers that Square could do more than just paint            and program. Later on, Final Fantasy VII on Sony's fledgling            PlayStation ushered in a new era of jaw-dropping CG and polygonal            characters fighting in front of beautiful pre-rendered backdrops.                         Returning to its roots in many areas, Final Fantasy X is the first            of Square's PlayStation 2 RPGs, and with it the developer has            reverted to a more dynamic approach, with an emphasis on storyline,            battle strategy and emotional attachment. In the graphics            department, the firm has moved away from pre-rendered backdrops,            preferring to make use of the PS2's polygon-pushing capabilities            for the most part, with sections of CG dotted about the game.            Character design and animation is stronger than anywhere else in            the series, with only the vagaries of the conversion from Japanese            NTSC to American NTSC and then PAL giving rise to criticism.                         As with many Final Fantasies, the fundamentals of the story are            simple enough, but the depth and development of the tale is the            clinching factor. You take up the role of a young Blitzball player            called Tidus, wrenched from the clutches of stardom in his home of            Zanarkand and hurled a thousand years into the future by an            enormous sea-dwelling entity called Sin. Finding himself alone and            uncertain in the world of Spira, he gradually comes to terms with            his predicament and soon joins up with a band of characters            guarding the summoner Yuna, whose job it is to try and defeat Sin.            She is expected to give her life doing so.                    Tidus and Yuna immediately form an unlikely bond. Yuna is alone            amongst the denizens of Spira in believing Tidus' story of            Zanarkand, and the pair both know the difficulties of handling            fame. After several hours bits of the puzzle start to piece            themselves together and the various characters and their back            stories all converge to bind the group and the player on an            emotional level.                         Thanks to the high standards of their artwork, specifically facial            animation and body language, and the development of each character            and their respective relationships through dialogue and            event-driven plot revelations, this Fantasy is transformed into            more of a movie than a game at times, although the largely            substandard voice acting counts against it to a degree. Listening            to the whiny, detestable Tidus chatting to the dainty, dreamy Yuna            or the gruff, battle-hardened Auron you feel like batting the            casting director around the head with a blunt instrument, and the            lack of lip-synch just condemns it further. Final Fantasy X would            have worked better as a subtitled Japanese language game, and it's            a shame that this isn't an option.                         However, Tidus and co. do make much more dignified and believable            decisions than those made by their predecessors in other Final            Fantasy games. The story moves this way and that to the tune of            glorious sandy beaches, sunsets and beautifully animated magical            forces and traditions, and gone are the motionless, one-line-only            NPCs of previous games, often replaced by impressive bit part            characters like the wily old fellow you meet on the road to Djose            with his world-weary voice and sage advice.                    Behind the glitz and glamour of the fifty hours of story and            adventure you have the mechanics of the game. Gone are the            simplistic levelling systems of yore, and instead at the heart of            the game is the Sphere Grid. Much of the band's path through the            game is littered with sinspawn and other adversaries, and when            these are defeated your group is endowed with sphere points and            different magical spheres, and subsequently sphere levels.                        Each level lets you move one space on the enormous Sphere Grid, and            your choices here dictate what sort of abilities your character can            attain. Lulu, the dark witch, can quickly accumulate powerful            attacks, but gaining hit points is irregular by comparison, meaning            that she really needs defensive spells cast early by an accomplice            to go the distance. Auron, on the other hand, quickly collects            massive amounts of hit points to complement his arsenal of            devastating sword blows, whilst Yuna herself gathers white magical            spells. The Sphere Grid is a nice touch, but having to use it so            often it actually takes up a huge chunk of the game. And non-linear            though it may seem, thanks to the use of locking mechanisms it will            take you a very long time to get characters to deviate from their            roughly chosen paths.                        The other half of the abilities ladder is Yuna's summoning powers.            With each temple that the group visits on its way to the game's            conclusion at the top of the world, Yuna collects another creature,            or aeon. Doing this is a process of penetrating the maze of tasks            beneath the temple - something which Tidus always seems to risk            Yuna's excommunication by doing himself - but at times the bizarre            use of silly substitution puzzles to reach the other side can be            depressing and seems like superfluous padding. Once you have            collected them, the aeons fit carefully into the puzzle of Spira            and Sin, just as virtually everything else in the game does, and            take the form of huge beasts, like the winged Valefor you may have            seen in the demo. Aeons can be used to fight in the party's stead            until they run out of hit points, and because they embody a certain            type of magic they are completely insusceptible to many attacks.            But despite my concerns about the development team (who were also            responsible for Final Fantasy VIII), aeons never take over the            entire battle system as Guardian Forces once did.                    Defeating enemies is more complex than in previous Fantasies. You            can fight with a force of three characters, but you can swap in            other members of your team without being penalised, which is often            just as critical as landing a heavy blow. During one of the longest            sections of repeated fighting about ten hours into the game, you            regularly come up against mixtures of fiery floating blobs which            self-destruct after three attacks, wild horned beasts in various            sizes and floating magical spectres. There are many approaches            here. When facing a collection of fiery blobs, you could fight them            with Lulu's water spells, but they are often too strong and their            persistent flame spells can decimate the party quickly before you            can flee, so it often pays to deploy the fiery aeon Ifrit to soak            up the toasty attacks like hit points and deal out physical damage            until they all self-destruct.                         The game's opposing magical forces (lightning/ice, water/fire), of            which Lulu is a mistress of all, must be chosen carefully depending            on the foe, and other, slower brutes are better dealt with by the            swords of Tidus, Auron or the peculiar muted Ronso creature            Kimahri. Meanwhile Wakka can dispatch winged creatures with his            projectile blitzball attack. Another nuance of the battle system is            overdrive attacks. When a character's aggression bar maxes out you            can let rip with an overdrive, requiring a quick-fire button            combination at the critical moment, which massacres enemies' HP            counts.                         Final Fantasy X is an extremely epic adventure, and it will come            as little surprise that Squaresoft has padded out the world of            Spira with countless distractions. Blitzball, of which I made            mention earlier, is one of only a handful of constants between            Zanarkand and Spira, but it forms the soul of those trying to live            in fear of Sin. The spectacular intro (complete with the            series-first use of heavy metal music as a backdrop) gives you a            vague idea of the sport, but when you actually come to play it for            yourself it's a lot different, rather like the Games Workshop            oddity Blood Bowl in design. Some will like it, some won't. But            only one game is compulsory, even if eager types can form a team            and take on the entire world in a blitzball league. Other            diversions include the Al Bhed, who speak a curious language            decipherable if you manage to collect the various primers hidden            around the game world. Fortunately, it's never too late to start            playing with the game's intricate extras, and in the lull before            the climactic final battle the entire game world opens up like a            virtual playground.                    I have a few complaints as you can tell, but the good definitely            outweighs the bad and this is far and away the most intricate and            consistently enjoyable of the Final Fantasy games since the            pinnacle of 16-bit RPGs, Final Fantasy VI. The PAL conversion with            its enormous borders is a big disappointment, but the strength of            the story, the battle system and the combination of clever            dialogue, visuals and soundtrack conspire to captivate the player.            There are many, many hours of adventuring to be had here, and            plenty more mini-games beyond the items mentioned above to enjoy            (Chocobos and the Monster Arena, for example). Because it is so            enchanting, it's a very hard game to put down for just about            anybody, whilst remaining a deceptively complex and enjoyable one            for diehards. If you like fantasy, swords, sorcery and love stories            then you can't fail to enjoy Final Fantasy X."}
