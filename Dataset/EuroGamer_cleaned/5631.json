You play Marcellus Faust, an old man living in an abandoned theme            park called ~Dreamland~. It's a strange place with even stranger            inhabitants, as well as a long, and at times sordid, history.                    Under the supervision of the suave and charming demon            Mephistopheles, you have to investigate seven of the odd characters            who have lived in the park over the years, including a midget, a            pair of siamese twin sisters, and a man who dreams of being            Casanova.                    All of these characters have crossed paths with Mephisto at various            times, and it is up to you to find out what deals they have struck            with the devil.                    Whatever the details, it is generally pretty grisly...         The game itself is a Myst-style graphic adventure, split into            seven episodes - one for each of the characters you are            investigating.                    There are dozens of locations to explore, and you can rotate your            view of them through a full 360 degrees, as well as being able to            look up and down. It's hardly groundbreaking, but the            implementation is good and panning is very smooth.                    A cursor shows where you are pointing in the scene, and this            changes shape when you move it over a ~hot spot~ - an exit to            another location, an item you can pick up or use, or an object to            be examined.                    Sometimes examining or using an object will trigger a short            cinematic or a clip of speech. This is usually a flashback to fill            in more of the story, and they can also provide clues to help you            complete a puzzle.                    The voice acting is generally top notch and the cinematics are well            done, although I think Cryo are being a little overenthusiastic            when they compare them to the animation in ~A Bug's Life~...                    There's also a soundtrack of old jazz and blues music throughout            the game, including big names like John Lee Hooker and Marvin Gaye.            It all helps add to the period atmosphere, although as the same            track plays over and over again in most locations it can eventually            get a little annoying when you get stuck!         The most important part of any adventure game though are the            puzzles, and luckily Faust scores well in this department as well.                    The puzzles are fairly challenging at times, but the solutions are            always logical enough when you apply a little brain power to the            problem. There isn't much here that will stump a hardened adventure            gamer, but I found it difficult enough to keep me involved without            becoming frustrating.                    You will need sharp eyes though, as a few of the objects you need            are rather small and can be hard to see. At times I resorted to            just moving the cursor all over a location looking for any hot            spots I had missed, but luckily this didn't happen too often.                    Once you have found and picked up an item, the inventory system is            simple to use. Just right click to bring up the list of items you            have, left click on an item to select it, and then left click on            the part of the scene you want to use it on.                    Manipulating fixed objects is also very easy, using a simple click            and drag system. Rotating dials, turning handles, and connecting up            wires is all very straightforward.         Faust can hardly be accused of                 breaking any new ground on the technical side of things, but                 it is competent enough.                    The graphics are good (though not quite as good in action as            they look from the screenshots), the locations well designed, the            interface easy to use, and the puzzles logical without being too            straightforward.                    The best part of Faust though is the story telling. Because the            cast is limited to just seven main characters (plus yourself and            Mephisto), you get to know them all as you explore the park and            find out more about their lives, and the terms of their pacts with            the devil.                    The result is a more involving and enjoyable game, with a strong            story to keep things moving along."}
