He looks like the sci-fi            equivalent of King Arthur, packs more weaponry than Saddam's            so-called palaces and knows all the tricks of the trade - and his            trade is bounty hunting, which is, like the man himself,            staggeringly cool. By way of a comparison, Darth Vader was a            chamber pot-wearing bin liner with a glowstick.                    LucasArts is clearly aware of this, because one of the first            Episode II games to be announced in the aftermath of the film's            release was none other than Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, a third            person adventure promising to exploit every aspect of Fett's            arsenal and answer a few of the many questions we had about his            past. How did he come to be the template for an entire army, how            did his involvement with Count Dooku come about, and why does he            attach so much importance to siring an heir?                    The good news is that Bounty Hunter does utilise Fett's expansive            arsenal to its fullest, and does answer many of these questions.            The bad news is that Lucas has one again married the familiar            places, faces and production values of his infrequent CG cartoons            with the basic, uninspired gameplay of your typical third person            action template.        Set just after Episode One's climactic Battle of Naboo, Bounty            Hunter begins with Jango racing, jet pack-less through a space            station in search of a vicarious victim, and spans six chapters            comprising 18 reasonable length levels of basic third person            action, set in locations ranging from Coruscant to Tattooine. This            one charts Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku)'s hiring of various bounty            hunters to take out the leader of a dodgy faction called the Bando            Gora. And, unbeknownst to the hunters, the successful applicant            will be used as a template for the Republic clone army, which Darth            Sideous is hatching as part of his ongoing plan for intergalactic            domination.                    However, despite aiming to serve up a seedy slice of the Republic's            underbelly, Bounty Hunter rarely escapes the shiny and smooth yet            forcedly gritty environments evident in Episode II.                    The graphics are generally quite drab - textures and world design            change from chapter to chapter, but merely range from meshes of            dark greys and browns to light greys and unblemished whites, which            wouldn't look out of place in a sparkling Star Trek            adventure. Enemies are typically ornate alien species, but as with            all such creatures have been crammed into tight, angular polygon            jackets to questionable effect for the purposes of the game. Jango            himself looks splendid, mind, with his shiny helmet and explosive            peripherals, and the way his arms track enemies as he runs around            blasting - Twin Caliber developers Rage should take note, this is            how you avoid 'Village People syndrome' in tracking multiple            targets...                    Admittedly, we can't vouch for the game's appearance in progressive            scan mode (which is available, despite the absence of 60Hz,            widescreen or surround sound options), but we doubt it makes much            difference beyond ironing out a few of the jaggies, and we doubt            very many of you will ever use it anyway.        Jango is up against all manner of criminal scum on his trek to            find the leader of the Bando Gora, spanning many alien races and            even including rival bounty hunters (whose ruthlessness is            highlighted in inter-mission cut scenes). But the potential depth            of Jango's character has been all but ignored, with the actual            bounty hunting and any semblance of adventure virtually superfluous            to your mission objectives.                    There's still some fun to be had though. Our shiny anti-hero is            tooled up to the nines with everything you've seen in the film; the            twin blasters (which lock onto individual targets at the touch of a            button), the dart and tether gun (which caused Obi-Wan some            trouble), the gauntlet-mounted flamethrower (which Mace Windu had            to dodge) and thermal grenades (which are just plain unpleasant).            Jango even picks up heavier blasters, a grenade launcher and a            sniper rifle during the course of the game.                    Then of course there's the Mandalorian Warrior's famous jet pack,            which he regains several levels into the game. You can't fly            continuously, because the battery cells lose charge after a few            seconds, forcing you to land and leave them to replenish            themselves, but swooping through the skies whilst simultaneously            firing blasters every which-way is the reason we paid our entrance            fee - Bounty Hunter certainly does let you do all the things the            screenshots suggested.                    When you examine the control system though it's obvious why -            virtually everything has been over-simplified. Basic movement and            orientation is left to the sticks, left for movement and right for            camera, while the shoulder buttons let you auto-target one or two            enemies (R1), manually target things like explosive barrels which            somehow take out forcefields (R2) and use the jet pack (L1). You            can turn in midair using the left stick or let go to rise straight            up - it's a bit quirky to begin with but quickly becomes second            nature.        Sadly though, the effortless combat dynamic can't save you from            the tedious level design. Nor can the actual 'bounty hunting' of            the title, which fills out your secondary objectives list.                    Each level is packed with as many as 15 secondary bounties (in            addition to the main 'follow random plot device 1' or 'find person            2' objective). The idea is to grab as many bounties as you can by            exploring every nook and cranny, and the more you find, the more            hidden extras you can unlock (like a Jango Fett comic book).                    But the problem is that to ensnare a bounty, you have to perform            one of the silliest routines ever, and something which is almost            the polar opposite of the game's otherwise intuitive control            system. It works something like this: when you enter a room (e.g. a            bar where lots of people are milling about), you can press up on            the D pad to equip your scanner. This brings up a greened scanning            view, and by pressing a button to lock on, and turning yourself            gradually around, the scanner homes in on people and flashes up            details when it finds a registered bounty. You then push another            button to mark the bounty, switch to your dart gun using the D pad            again and then walk up and press another button to fire. Finally,            you can saunter up to the tightly bound, no doubt whimpering bounty            and press triangle to reap the rewards. It's like trying to make a            cup of tea with a nuclear arms programme.                    After a couple of levels, you just won't bother. The rewards for            doing so are too slight and the trouble of doing it is too great.            It does add a bit of replay value to the game - diving back in to            try and unearth all the bounties can be fun, but the levels are            arduous for the most part, and we certainly can't imagine ourselves            wanting to find all 10 bounties on the agonising multi-conveyor            belt level, for example.                    And so, with the Bando Gora threat extinguished, it's clear that            LucasArts has made another pretty and stylish foray into their            galaxy far, far away, encompassing virtually all of Jango's myriad            exciting abilities just as it said it would. Meanwhile, production            values are on a par with the likes of Jedi Starfighter and The            Clone Wars, but ultimately the familiarity of the Star Wars            characters, the injection of John Williams' ubiquitous score and            the addition of quirks like secondary bounty hunting can't mask the            shallow, unexciting gameplay from view. This is a very simple, very            brainless third person shooter for people who want to be Jango Fett            - it won't challenge for a spot on your Christmas list, but it            won't have you crossing anybody off yours if it finds its way into            your stocking.
