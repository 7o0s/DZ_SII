Whatever your allegiance, there are fundamental truths about this            series that remain as relevant today as they did way back in 1996.                    Firstly, even if you've never played a Resident Evil title before,            you'll know that it involves killing a procession of zombies, and            that horror lies around every darkened, blood-drenched corner. The            checklist for any RE title is pretty predictable; a darkened,            brooding mansion setting (tick), an endless succession of locked            doors (tick), ammo and weaponry curiously discarded (tick),            typewriters that allow you to save your progress (tick), drawn out            door/stair climbing animations (tick), delicious pre-rendered            backdrops (tick), 'suspenseful' camera angles (tick), 'spin on the            spot' control system (tick), and bastard hard (tick). Yes, playing            Resident Evil Zero is the gaming equivalent of popping on a            battered old pair of slippers. You know it's a bit holey, well past            its best, but it's got that lived in cosiness.                    It would be pointless trying to convince you that this is some kind            of wild revolutionary update. It isn't. Capcom has followed the            strict 'if it aint broke\u2026' school of thought to the letter.            While this is undeniably frustrating when there are so many areas            that could be improved, there's still a certain magic about these            games that somehow enables you to leave your cynical baggage            outside.        Given that Capcom more or less stole the concept and gameplay            mechanics wholesale from Infogrames' Alone In The Dark trilogy, you            could argue that the fundamentals of the survival horror genre            haven't moved on a great deal in over ten years. But should we be            any less excited about the latest episode in the world's favourite            horror series? Of course not. This is, after all, the first 'all            new' Resident Evil game in three years; a prequel to the very first            game in the series that goes some way to filling in the blanks            regarding the origins of some of the series' evil do-ers.                    So the story begins; it's 1998. Several bizarre murders have            occurred in Raccoon City, with groups of 'people-eating' zombies            attacking civilians. The elite S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And            Rescue Service) team have been sent to investigate, but their            helicopter is forced to make an emergency landing after            experiencing engine trouble. The game kicks off after the team            discovers an abandoned train, with the 18-year-old Rebecca Chambers            pressed into action.                    The first thing to note is the breathtakingly detailed graphics.            Anyone who saw the Resident Evil remake (released last September)            will know what to expect, and thanks to the use of static camera            angles, and some cunning trickery, the environment is easily one of            the best realised in gaming history. Every location is a festering,            dank, gloomy hellhole, and very quickly you're plunged into an            atmosphere of such fetid, rank vileness it makes your worst            nightmares seem like a welcome relief. One of the key factors is            Capcom's subtle use of animation in the static, pre-rendered            backgrounds, creating a far more believable setting than ever            before. Add in superb light/shadowing and delightfully spooky sound            effects and you've got a supremely solid set of foundations for the            game itself.        Aside            from the obvious visual enhancements, RE0 introduces a 'partner            zapping' dynamic, in which you're able to dynamically switch            between the two main characters in order to successfully progress.            Shortly after the game starts, the nubile Rebecca bumps into            vest-wearing, mulleted ex-Marine Billy Cohen, a fugitive accused of            the murder of 23 people. After initially disappearing, Cohen then            helps Chambers out of a sticky situation and from then on you're            largely working as a team.                    To begin with, your partner merely provides combat assistance in            the inevitable zombie battles, but inevitably you're forced to            split the pair up in order to overcome the many puzzles that would            otherwise be impossible on your lonesome. More so than ever before,            inventory management is all important. Sending one of the            characters out alone without the necessary object or weapon will            quickly result in failure, and a lengthy trudge back to find your            partner. In a sense, this insistence on working together is utterly            contrived, but you soon slip into the game's way of thinking. Can't            get to your partner? Why not pop an object in a handy chute that            just happens to be in the room where they're stuck?                    The puzzle solving is, for the most part, fairly logical and            straightforward - but even when you know what the solution is, the            chances are the game will throw a bunch of evil minions in your way            as a barrier to progress. And it's the combat element of the game            that will really hold you up; for a start the weapons aren't that            powerful, and ammunition is scarcer still. As veterans to the            series will bitterly recount, preserving your ammo and health is            almost the most important aspect of the game. It really is a battle            for survival, and requires you to constantly gamble on your            abilities to make it to the next section. Take too much damage and            you may find the section after impossible to get past. Do you dodge            your enemy and save your ammo, or blast them and risk not having            the tools to take out the really powerful boss that's coming up?            The trouble is, unless you're playing it with a guide, you'll never            know when the next ridiculously powerful boss is coming up. By the            time you've reached your nemesis, the chances are it's too late:            not enough health and probably not enough powerful weaponry either            - or worse, you've left the weapon you need behind. As ever, RE0            forces the player to constantly walk a tightrope, and adds a rich            element of tension thanks to its difficulty level.                    Matters aren't helped, in the main, by the age old problem of the            camera. Although the game does its bit to ensure you're given a            prime view, it doesn't always work out. When things get really            tricky you often flail around in a panic, desperately trying to get            a good lock onto your intended target. Hitting R aims the weapon at            your nearest target, but half the time you'll be firing blind, as            your target will be off screen. Also, you'll often be presented            with multiple targets. Some many be on screen, some off. Sometimes            you'll be caught totally off guard as a result, or your view will            suddenly change, and you'll end up engaged in lengthy tussle,            resulting in your health taking a major pummelling.        Of course you learn to adapt to these foibles, and as a result            take things extremely carefully, but the lasting impression is that            you're not to blame for half the things that go wrong - rather it's            the combination of the tricky control system (slow rotation            left/right with forwards and backwards), the extreme lack of health            boosts and chronic shortage of ammo. Compounding these issues is            the AI's tendency to be completely unhelpful. Not only will your            partner be utterly profligate with their ammo but, worse still, may            even end up injuring the player you're in control of - especially            if you make the mistake of arming them the utterly useless Molotov            Cocktails. In certain situations, such as tight corridors, you're            usually better off leaving them in another room where they can't be            a nuisance, and given that we've spent years duking it out on our            lonesome, this doesn't prove to be a significant disadvantage.                    With such constant overwhelming odds, you often wonder why you're            bothering. It's like part of the 'Evil' of the game is to make you            suffer wherever possible. But somehow the atmosphere, the            environments and the against the odds combat is so engrossing that            you find yourself refusing to be beaten by something as insolent as            a mere videogame. Even the rather tenuous back story starts to make            sense of a sort, and you'll find yourself exclaiming 'ahaaaas' at            various points at the background justification of some of the            game's evil henchmen that appear later on in the series.                    There really is no logic to how you score a Resident Evil game.            Your critical head says one thing; your gaming heart says another.            On a basic, technical level you're tempted to give it a kicking for            all manner of niggly reasons, which every review of every RE in the            past seven years will have picked up on each and every time. But            where it scores above other games is simply the emotions it            inspires. For every time the game pisses you off, you're straight            back in there vowing to avenge this injustice, nursing your fragile            characters through one by-the-seat-of-your-pants encounter after            another. It's not so much that the creatures are even that scary.            If you've seen one slimy, multi-tentacled beast, or staggering,            moaning creature of the undead, you've pretty much seen them all,            but their unrelenting evil is unquestionable.                    Somehow the Resident Evil experience is much more than the sum of            its parts, and the deeper you get into each episode of the game,            the more its sucks you into its macabre offering. For the            unbelievers, it's doubtful RE0 will offer anything that could            persuade you to join the series at this late stage. For the rest of            you, Zero is one of the most evil games we've ever come across.            Take that as a compliment."}
