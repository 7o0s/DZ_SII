In the intervening years we have had            numerous visits to European skies, escorting B-17s across a hostile            Germany, or pounding tanks in the Ardennes. We have abandoned our            old warbirds and conducted low-level strikes on Iraqi airfields            during Desert Storm and strafed Egyptian Migs in the Six Day War.            The Pacific Theatre even gained a jinx - it was supposedly            commercial death.                    Now Microsoft have shown us what we were missing. In a brilliant            but flawed sequel to their original Combat Flight Simulator,            Microsoft have given us a good sim that, like ~Falcon 4~, has the            capacity to become a great one. For the price of a good dinner for            two you get over a hundred hours of intense enjoyment in a box,            with the promise of many more to come thanks to the attentions of            the hordes of modellers, designers and mission builders that            support the Microsoft flight simulators as a hobby (see            CFS2 Online for some            examples).                    The game contains seven different flyable fighters - the F4F            Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F4U Corsair and P-38 Lightning for the            Americans, and the A6M2 and A6M5 Zeros and the N1K2 George for the            Japanese. Although some of these aircraft are equipped with rockets            and bombs, the clear emphasis of the game is on fighter combat. All            the single missions in the game involve shooting down other            aircraft, and so do most of the campaign missions. None of the            flyable aircraft carry torpedoes, and bombing without bombsights is            at best a nod in the direction of ground attack...                    What it does it does very well though. Flight models are good,            enhanced by several post-release fixes. Aircraft are accurately            modelled and have very noticeably individual flight models; you            will not be able to out-turn a Zero or Oscar, and you will not be            able to outrun a Corsair. This means that pilots will have to adapt            their flying to their aircraft and that of the enemy. It is            possible to down four Zeros in a Corsair, but only if you keep to            the historically accurate tactics used by the pilots of the day.            Try any fancy aerobatics and the much nimbler Zeros will be all            over you.                    The aircraft in the game are simply beautiful, and the first time            you see your plane it will take your breath away. As you start the            engine it coughs smoke and the propeller gradually fades into a            blur, although it's a blur that clearly changes with your throttle            setting. As you add power you will start to move, your landing gear            compressing as the wheels bounce over the coral surface of the            island runway. With US aircraft inbound you open your canopy in            case you have to bail out, then retract flaps and gear to gain            speed and height. As you spot the bandits you switch to the            outstanding padlock view (with working instruments) that quickly            lets you bring your guns to bear.                    In another realistic touch, your guns and cannon will fire            independently, allowing you to conserve vital cannon shells until            you can guarantee a hit. From the methanol/water emergency power            injection to the stunning flak bursts that will knock you into the            water, this game breathes realism. That isn't to say that it is            inaccessible for beginners, and Microsoft clearly hope to use the            image of sexy aircraft over the beautiful islands of the Pacific to            draw more people into flight simulators. There are a number of            optional features specifically aimed at beginners, from a simple            ~radar~ to a cone that points in the direction of the nearest            bandit for those confused by padlock views.                    Combat Flight Sim 2 was clearly built to expand beyond the shipped            product; Microsoft are well aware that the support of the flight            sim community has increased the value of their previous products            several times over. Already there are a dozen new planes and            scenery add-ons that allow you to dogfight over Crete or the Alps,            or to land on a modern carrier.                    More importantly, they allow you to fly the torpedo bombers and            dive bombers that were the true heart of the air war in the            Pacific. The ability to dive-bomb a Japanese carrier or to sink            cargo ships hiding in the lee of small islands adds a lot to the            game. Add-on scenery and aircraft clearly vary a great deal in            quality and functionality though, and while that Catalina may look            great, it still won't land in water!                    As well as aircraft and missions, the recent issue of the software            developers kit has allowed talented designers to add even more to            the game. Ship wakes have been lengthened, fires improved, flak and            gun effects updated. Flight models are constantly tweaked as            designers argue about the amount of lift a Wildcat with two bombs            and full flaps should have. Even the novice-friendly cartoon style            game interface can be replaced. All of this makes a good game very            special indeed.                    In addition to the planes ~missing~ from the shipped version of            Combat Flight Sim 2 and the need to download updated flight models            to get the most from the game, there are a few other minor issues            that prevent it from achieving the highest marks though.                    Wingman commands, though present, are few and inefficient. You            cannot use the padlock view on friendly aircraft or ships, just the            enemy, and targeting them requires flicking through all the planes            in the sky to get to the one you want - there is no way to simply            select the one right in front of your nose. Finally the yellow            targeting box has thus far resisted the best efforts of the            community clamouring for its removal.                    Multiplayer is also a source of great disappointment for hardcore            gamers. In fact there is only one mode, the free-for-all dogfight,            with the caveat that pilots can naturally team up based on their            choice to fly US or Japanese aircraft. This works well enough,            especially as the link to the MSN Gaming Zone comes pre-installed,            but while new players may be satisfied with it, experienced pilots            will search in vain for more satisfying cooperative missions.                    Microsoft have learnt a great deal from the poorly received ~Combat            Flight Simulator~, and its sequel is a polished dogfighter that is            on the cusp of achieving excellence through the many add-ons it has            already received. It manages to incorporate a good deal of realism            in a mass market framework, and deserves to do very well.                    One of the game's greatest strengths though is quite simply the            Pacific Theatre setting - there is next to no competition here, and            the game does a lot to teach you how it feels to turn in for that            critical run at the enemy carrier..."}
