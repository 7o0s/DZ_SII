With Episode            II debuting next month, the inevitable sequel Jedi Starfighter has            now been released, consisting largely of the same gameplay dynamic            that made the first game so rewarding, coupled with improved            visuals, plot, voice acting, cut scenes, and the added benefit of            Force powers.                        The bizarrely tentacled space pirate Nym returns with his ship the            Havoc, and this time is joined by Adi Gallia, the Jedi Master at            the controls of the prototype Jedi Starfighter, whose orders come            directly from Mace Windu, one of Episode II's chief protagonists.            After demoing the Jedi Starfighter in a comfortable set of training            levels, Adi turns her attention to the Trade Federation's            activities in the Karthak system and meets up with Nym and his            companions, whose trust she earns in a couple of early missions,            dogfighting both in space and on the surface of one of the planets.                        Before long they're fighting the Trade Federation and the threat of            Count Dooku's underling Cavik Toth, the game's lead bad guy. His            plan to use banned Hex weapons against civilisation must be put to            a stop, and your daring duo set out to do so over the course of            fifteen increasingly difficult levels, showcasing an impressive            array of units, many of them lifted from the two Star Wars            prequels. The Jedi Starfighter and the Havoc enjoy an equal share            of the levels, with the former's agility and Force-endowed pilot            useful for ship-to-ship combat, whilst the latter is more suited to            blowing big things up with an array of missiles.                    One of the heaviest criticisms levelled at the original Starfighter            was the incessant slowdown witnessed on the surface levels, despite            its less than impressive visuals. Jedi Starfighter has a stab at            improving this state of affairs, but unfortunately the slowdown            returns, particularly on the surface levels. And you can forget any            hopes you had for a smooth split-screen mode.                        Jedi Starfighter is a lot better looking than its predecessor, but            the team seems incapable of handling minutiae beyond hulking            spaceships packed with turrets and the ships controlled by the two            main characters and their entourage. For example, midway through            the game Adi has to chaperone Nym and his demolition crew as they            work their way between shield generators on the ground, and this            involves picking off a lot of Droids and AATs which spew forth from            nearby bunkers. I was a bit concerned that Droids might be hard to            spot against the scenery, but fortunately the ground and building            textures are so poorly detailed that I had no difficulty.            Explosions are also a bit lacklustre; in the event of a big ship            blowing up the screen flashes white, and if you're watching you'll            get to see a nice lightshow, but it's not even on the same page as            the Death Star explosion in the remastered Star Wars. On the whole            the game looks nice, but a little more variety wouldn't have gone            amiss.                        Aurally the game is much easier to enjoy. John Williams writes a            good score and it's nice to see LucasArts using his work to great            effect. In terms of sound effects Jedi Starfighter hits the mark            too, right down to the sound of Adi's lightsaber deflecting laser            blasts in one of the cutscenes. The voice acting is also            exceptional; Nym's voice is more growl than anything, but fits very            well, while Adi sounds like a school teacher, which is exactly how            she's played. Even characters from the films such as Yoda are            mimicked superbly.                    The interface remains virtually unchanged from Starfighter. In the            bottom right of the screen lurks your targeting panel, with            on-screen arrows to highlight your target as well as friendly ships            and objectives. In the bottom left of the screen is your basic            array of weapons, which in Nym's case is projectiles, while Adi            uses it to access her Force powers.                        Giving pilots control of the Force works surprisingly well, with            the four different powers revealed gradually throughout the game.            Force Shield protects your ship (creating a somewhat comical bubble            around the whole thing if you use the external view), while Force            Lightning can be used to electrify enemy ships, Sideous style. This            can be handy if a ship flies over your shoulder after taking a            couple of hits, and the lightning also jumps between craft within            range, making it perfect for striking packs of bad guys before            they've even come into blaster range.                        Force Shockwave is slightly more hit and miss, but devastating            during the game's surface missions. The best of the lot though is            Force Reflex, or Force Bullet Time as it's known around here. As            with Obi-Wan on the Xbox and Jedi Knight 2 on the PC, players can            slow down the world around them, giving you all the time in the            world to line up shots and take out those irritating plasma            turrets.                    One of the most endearing things about Jedi Starfighter is its            entertaining if clich\u00e9 ridden narrative - the reluctant hero            meets an authority figure and they bond and grow to appreciate each            other throughout the game. The storyline is peppered with the usual            tripe justifying your latest trip through an asteroid belt, but it            all gels together nicely in the end and Cavik Toth is a suitably            unpleasant fellow. Unfortunately the game does seem to reveal quite            a few details about the forthcoming Episode II in the third act, so            beware of potential spoilers.                        Missions usually involve blowing stuff up, but sometimes include            keeping specific units safe and other standard tasks. As in            Starfighter there are also bonus and hidden objectives to complete            on every level, and doing so unlocks various bonuses from the main            menu, including a Star Wars Bounty Hunter trailer (starring Jango            Fett) and a cute and surprisingly funny anime-inspired ~day in the            life of~ cartoon featuring a LucasArts employee named Amy, set to a            jazzy performance of a popular Star Wars tune. Other extras include            the ability to use X-Wings and TIE Fighters on any level, and some            handy dogfighting levels for two players.                        Speaking of which, the multiplayer side of the game is fairly            expansive too. You can play any mission in the single player game            co-operatively, with player two taking up the reigns of an AI            controlled character such as Reti. Although this suffers from            annoying levels of slowdown, it's still eminently enjoyable and            adds a lot to the overall package. In terms of longevity, Jedi            Starfighter may be over in a week or it may not be over in a month,            it all depends on how much of a perfectionist you are.                    For the most part the graphics, sound, gameplay and narrative come            together to form one of the most enjoyable Star Wars games in            recent history. There are a few loose ends, like the skyline            glitches on the penultimate level and the fairly rudimentary menu            system, but on the bright side you can fire a planetary            cannon and take an X-Wing into combat against a Sabaoth            Destroyer. Honestly, how many games let you do that convincingly?                        The best Star Wars space combat game since TIE Fighter, and more            focused and accessible than Rogue Leader.
