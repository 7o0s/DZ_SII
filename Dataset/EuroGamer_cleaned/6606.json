Nottingham, it's probably as good a time as any to dust off the All            About Eve records, apply the eye liner and indulge ourselves in            some dark Action Adventure antics. The original Devil May Cry            established itself as an instant classic on its release shortly            before Christmas 2001, with its relentless blend of sword and            gunplay, dressed up in some of the finest gothic visuals gaming has            ever seen. The prospect of a quick-fire sequel was certainly            welcomed, but it was hard to see what Capcom could do to improve            upon the original in such a short space of time.                    Then word started to filter out of Japan and the US that all was            not well with the DMC mark two. Surely not. How could Capcom make            it less appealing than the awesome, albeit tough, original.            This isn't how sequels work, is it? Certainly,            our first            impressions six weeks ago seemed to confirm these reports that            the game was almost embarrassingly easy for anyone in possession of            two functioning thumbs. But seeing as we'd only made it through            half of the Dante levels, we felt it best to at least get to grips            with Lucia's adventure before we delivered our final verdict on the            game.        To recap on the who what where when why, Dante is the 'ultimate            devil hunter'; a chisel-jawed, platinum blonde-haired half-demon            hard bastard, with more moves than a body-popping Matrix wannabe.            To cap it all, he's armed to the teeth with a giant sword and dual            pistols just to prove the point. In tow is the second playable            character, Lucia, an equally athletic sort; a kind of white, Goth            Gabrielle, with an odd tendency to wear her hair over one (dodgy?)            eye. They've got some beef with corporate ne'er do wells, and in            one of the most pointlessly constructed in-game stories of all time            it's time to work your way through 18 Dante levels, and 13 Lucia            levels - each housed on their own disc as standalone, but almost            identical games.                    If we were to mechanically list all the moves and features in DMC2,            it would probably sound like the ingredients for a stonking game.            Both characters have a long list of attacks, pulled off with            various combinations of triangle, square and directional buttons.            In practise they look pretty swish too, and you'll gasp as Dante            runs up walls and flips over high in the air, allowing you to fire            off shots as you hurtle to the ground. The list of skills goes on.            But what point is there in going through all these elaborate,            well-animated moves when all you ever need to do to defeat just            about any creature in the entire game is to double jump (X) and            then bash square as quickly as you can? In just over three hours we            managed to breeze through all 13 of Lucia's mission doing just            that, occasionally tapping triangle to bash the more lightweight            meanies (and to stop us falling asleep at the repetition).            Similarly, Dante's missions play almost exactly the same, and            despite the supposedly different moves, the net result is exactly            the same. Jump. Bash bash bash. Jump. Bash. Game completed,            goodnight.                    That's not all there is to it, of course, as we found out during            our recent            interview            with the game's producer, Tanaka-san, but it may as well be for the            vast majority of you. Ok, a hard mode unlocks, and the game becomes            more of a challenge, but the prospect of playing the whole thing            again with slightly harder enemies isn't really our definition of a            reward. Complete the game as both Dante and Lucia and play the            whole thing again as Trish from the first game? Do us a favour;            look, we're fed up with the same old same old as it is. And don't            even get us started on the ultimate 'Bloody Palace' mode. 2,000            levels of intense arcade-style combat freezes the blood in our            fingers as we type.        But it's not all            two-button tedium. Aesthetically the sequel manages to break            something that didn't need fixing, too. Although you can't help but            admire some of the detailed environments, somehow they were so much            more impressive the first time around. The levels seemed to be            intricately designed before, whereas although the engine has            supposedly been improved this time around, you'd be hard pressed to            find one single location in DMC2 that looks better. The camera work            wasn't exactly helpful last time around, but this time you barely            stand a chance of seeing what you're shooting at. But it matters            little, as the auto targeting means you can just hop around with            your eyes closed shooting blades at whatever the CPU deems is your            nearest target. You'll win in the end. Daft isn't the word. To make            matters worse, on some levels you don't even have to bother            fighting; just run straight past these endlessly respawning cannon            fodder until you meet the boss and repeat the double jump and fire            formula discussed. But at least it's in 60Hz this time, eh?                    If this was the first Devil May Cry we'd probably be reasonably            impressed with certain aspects of the game: the system of orb            collection and gradual weapon collection/upgrade is still a good            way of coaxing you through the game, and gives some incentive to            battle your way through the endless drones. Graphically it's still            impressive enough to be one of the best looking games out there,            and the range of moves available to you is a pleasing novelty            compared to most action games. Shame you hardly ever need bother to            learn them.                    The heart of the matter is that the game's original creative            driving force, Shinji Mikami, had little input into the sequel, and            whatever vision he had that made the first in the series work so            well has seemingly been overruled and diluted by Tanaka-san, an            inexperienced producer (a former games journalist, believe it or            not) who has been lumbered with a project that has been rushed            released with scant consideration for the long term benefit of the            franchise. Whoever's to blame, it's just not good enough, Capcom            knows it, the critics know it, and hopefully the public will soon,            too, before it's too late.                    Regardless of whether you've played the original, the bottom line            is that Devil May Cry 2 is a deeply flawed combat-based action game            that offers a mere fraction of the depth and the challenge of the            original. That's not to say it's completely terrible, because it's            still a reasonably enjoyable and pretty beat 'em up while it lasts,            but it's a shock to see the mighty Capcom let its standards slip in            such a dramatic fashion.
