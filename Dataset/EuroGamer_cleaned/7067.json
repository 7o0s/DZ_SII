For a start, you won't find it sitting on the shelves of your            local computer games store, it's only available from the            Freeloader website. It            won't cost you anything either, simply sign up at Freeloader and            you can download it for free. And finally, you will have to wait            another 24 weeks for the game to be completed.                    Yes, Halcyon Sun is one of the new wave of episodic games which is            causing a stir in the gaming industry at the moment. Rather than            buying a game which swallows your hard drive whole and takes weeks            to complete, you buy (or in this case download) the game a bit at a            time. Halcyon Sun goes the whole hog though by dressing itself up            to look like a twelve episode television series, right down to            scrolling credits and a ~to be continued...~ screen at the end of            each episode.                    You play the role of squadron commander Dru Avery, leading a group            of hotshot fighter pilots in the last days of a war between the            Nolledah and a coalition of Eridani and your own nation, the            Carolan Commonwealth. To make things more complicated, your            girlfriend is the Eridani liason officer on your base ship, the CSS            Halcyon Sun, and relations between the allies soon become strained.                    The plot unfolds through a series of lengthy but enjoyable in-game            cutscenes, which introduce you to the main characters and give you            an insight into what is going on in the world around you. The            animations of the various characters can be a little stilted at            times, and the voice acting (should you download the optional voice            pack) is a little subdued as well, although it get the job done and            the overall presentation is surprisingly effective. There is even a            website you can go to on completing each episode to read news about            the war effort and get the latest intelligence reports.                    Something else which came as a pleasant surprise was the quality of            the game's graphics. Although they are hardly a challenge to genre            leaders like ~Starlancer~ and ~Freespace~, given that the whole of            the first two episodes weighs in at just 12Mb and the game doesn't            cost you a penny, it certainly looks a lot better than you            might expect.                    Ships are nicely detailed and brightly coloured, although the            weapon effects and explosions are fairly functional. It all feels a            little like ~Homeworld~, but without the stunning nebulae-strewn            backdrops. The only real let down is in the sound effects            department, with some rather flat and uninspiring noises which tend            to get overwhelmed by the music in the heat of combat, instead of            grabbing you by the balls and immersing you in the game.                    Overall though, the game looks polished without overloading either            your eyes or your hardware, and the engine keeps the action going            at a fair pace even when you are in the midst of a big hairy            furball involving a couple of dozen other spacecraft, with missiles            and laser bolts whizzing around you in all directions. Combat            itself is good clean fun, harking back to the early days of the            ~Wing Commander~ series, and lacking any of the added complexities            of many more recent games. It is hardly likely to tax your brain            most of the time, making this something of a space combat sim for            Sun readers, but coming through another mission with your ship            intact and your enemies floating home in little pieces is still            strangely satisfying.                    The controls are straightforward and easy to get to grips with if            you are at all familiar with the genre, which is lucky as you are            thrown right into the action without any real tutorial missions.            The learning curve throughout the first episode is fairly gentle            though, giving you plenty of time to find your stride.                    Your ship is fast and responsive, and although the AI is rather            good compared to that found in some (much more expensive!) games            that we could name, the focus here is very much on arcade style            action rather than flight sim style tactics and memorising lots of            buttons. There is just one fire button, with another key to switch            between your various guns and missiles. And apart from a few            buttons to cycle through targets, fire your afterburners, release            decoys and so on, that's about it really.                    Missions are equally no-nonsense, with none of that ~fly to            waypoint 3 and investigate the big swirly thing~ malarky you get in            most space combat games. You start most of the missions a few            kilometers from your target and facing in roughly the right            direction, and from there it's just a case of going in and giving            the enemy a sound hiding. Most missions are based around blowing            something up, whether it is enemy fighters, a cruiser, or an            orbital defence station, although there is enough variety there to            maintain your interest.                    The second episode reaches its climax with you escorting a group of            bombers towards an enemy planet. Rather annoyingly though, if a            single one is blown up it's mission over, and given that you can            only be in one place at a time and have no control over what your            wingmen do, it's all too easy for a couple of enemy ships to slip            by you and take out one of the bombers. Luckily if you fail a            mission three times in a row the game will let you skip it,            avoiding any excessive frustration...                    Although Halcyon Sun's television show style does a good job of            immersing you in the game world and making you care about the            characters who you are flying alongside, it does have its flaws.                    For starters, most of the game is made up of cinematics. It's            entertaining stuff, and certainly much better than a lot of the            tripe that shows up on our televisions, but if you want to get            straight into the action you're likely to come away disappointed. I            reached the last mission of the second episode in just over an            hour, and much of that time was spent watching cutscenes. If you            choose to skip them, not only will you miss out on the intriguing            storyline and character development, but you will also find            yourself with rather less than half an hour of actual combat across            the two episodes.                    The cinematic nature of the game also means that the storyline is            rigidly linear, not only in general terms but in detail. None of            the main characters are allowed to die unless it is written into            the story, for example, as a result of which their ships are            invulnerable in combat to ensure that they come out of every            mission in one piece. It's a bit of a cop out, but then in the heat            of battle you don't have much time to notice that your wingman's            ship is capable of taking a lot more damage than your own...                    Halcyon Sun is hardly groundbreaking when it comes to gameplay,            with enjoyable but straightforward action, and a totally linear            single-player campaign. It can't even claim to be the first            episodic game - ~Siege of Avalon~ and ~Arabian Nights~ beat it to            that, and Origin released their own series of free downloadable            missions based on the ~Wing Commander Prophecy~ engine before the            term episodic gaming was even used.                    What does make Halcyon Sun stand out though is the polished            television series style presentation, and the remarkably small            download size for a game of such high quality - the first two            episodes total just 12Mb, and even the optional voice pack only            adds another 5-8Mb to that. For a few minutes download time you get            two half-hour episodes of a continuing story which will unfold over            the next six months. Your only problem will be finding something            else to do while you wait for the next episode to be released.                    Head over to the Freeloader            website and grab yourself a copy while it's hot!"}
