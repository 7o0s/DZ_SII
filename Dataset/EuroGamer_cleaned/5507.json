People who dress their dogs in little jackets, for example, or the sort of person who buys a deep-fried Mars Bar on the way home from the pub.Monkey Ball Mini Golf, which has its roots in the console Super Monkey Ball series, exhibits the same kind of logic - why just play golf when you can stroke balls around 18 miniature golf holes as a monkey in a ball?Witheach shot costing one banana there's nothing so pedestrian asstroke or matchplay rules here - your task is simply to finish each holewith as many yellow fruits as possible.This basic premise is rendered considerably more challenging byinventive design. Each hole is littered with obstaclesranging from banked curves to worm holes, and pinball-table stylesprings to speed boosters - with a demand for further strategy based on your choice of monkey.The four monkeys on offer are the traditional ones - AiAi, MeeMee, Baby and GonGon - and eachhas particular characteristics to bear in mind. Baby's the fastest, for example, butalso a lightweight. GonGon, meanwhile, though not very fast,is heavy and carries a lot of momentum, enabling him to get overobstacles with less difficulty than the others.Disappointingly, the visual detail in the game isn't of a highenough level to enable you to identify the monkeys by sight - instead you're left looking solely at the titular monkey ball, a red andwhite sphere. And withmusic limited to a five-second jingle for finishing the hole,it's fair to say that Monkey Ball Mini Golf won't win anyprizes for its presentation. To be fair though, the holesthemselves, floating above a bed of clouds or cratered Moonsurface, are pleasingly chunky and the overall style is undeniablyclear, direct and accessible.In many ways it's this ethos of keeping things short and sweetthat sums up Monkey Ball Mini Golf perfectly. The controlsare simple, the goals obvious and each hole takes between one andfive minutes to play. Add this all together though and you've got afair chunk of playtime, especially as the hole designs are distinctenough to enable several returns before you get bored.Whilst additional courses would have been welcome in extendingthis further, we'd have happily traded them in for a multiplayermode - even a hotseat two-player option would have sufficed. As itis though, you're left on your own which seems more than a shame.Surely it's downright unnatural considering monkeys' social nature, and the console original's strengths in group-play.Of course, if you are an especially sociable monkey, you won'tbalk at handing the phone around to your chums and playingMonkey Ball Mini Golf sure beats picking fleas out of eachothers' hair, but with a proper multiplayer option this really could have been top banana - rather than simply ana-peel-ing time-waster. Oof."}
