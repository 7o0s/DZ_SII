Having sat through an            exhibition of how great the game was by my PSX-owning mate (that's            as in ~friend~, not sexual in any way, you understand... erm...)            several thousands of times, I wasn't entirely sure how the hugeness            was going to fit into the little plastic thing. Still, wonders will            never cease with this magic box of...magic...things.                         Anyway, all my fears were soon expelled (like a big Odour-Eater            had come into the room and stamped gratuitously all over them) when            I started up the console, jumped straight into the game and was            mesmerised by what appeared to be a five minute long segment of            FMV... on the Nintendo. FMV. Nintendo. Five minutes. This was            superb, and I was amazed. Either I've been missing out on            something, seeing as I was a late starter with the Nintendo and            all, but I was truly astounded, I really didn't think this was            possible. The short movie was the same as the one placed in the PSX            version, and what the superbly rendered piece does is to set the            scene perfectly, and before you even start to play the game the            tentacles start to reach out of the screen and pull you into into            the game's sick little world. But then I realised what Capcom had            done to fit all this stuff in the cart, as I noticed quite heavy            artefacting on the video, and that familiar mp3-style ~warbling~ on            the audio samples, both the remnants of heavy compression            techniques. But without getting into the piddling technicalities, I            was still pretty excited by the time the opening in-game scene            began and I was plopped into a flaming scene surrounded by the            brain-craving living-dead.         When I started the game, I was                 given the choice of playing as either Leon or Claire (I chose                 Leon, natch, because he's a MAN. Like me) but the game (as                 well as the intro) differs a significant amount depending on                 which character you pick, aside from just a gender difference.                 There also comes the opportunity at certain points to swap                 between the two characters. Also, with the completion of the                 game, you can replay it with the other character in different                 twists on the scenario... this is a genius touch which extends                 the life of the game far beyond the one, single experience                 (which takes long enough).                         From the very start of this game, I was frankly terrified. I            suppose that's what the developers were after, but surely a game            shouldn't be scary as so to put me off even playing the damned            thing? I'm a very sensitive person to these sort of atmospheres (as            a kid, I always had my eyes scrunched shut in ghost trains and            haunted houses at amusement parks) and I had the same sort of            anxiety playing System Shock 2 and even Half-Life/Opposing Force,            so perhaps I wasn't the best person to pick for this review...            moments which genuinely made me jump out of my chair proved that I            was totally sucked into the games world. Quite an achievement,            then, considering I was sitting in a room full of people talking,            on a big cushy armchair about 8 feet from the television - the            level to which I was reluctant to go any further in the game just            seemed wrong. As did my hesitation to turn the thing on just to            play it.         The playing areas are generally                 sparse, particularly in the Racoon City police station (where                 much of the game takes place), but are punctuated by segments                 of gory zombie related violence. I still seemed to spend most                 of my time attempting to solve the numerous puzzles (several                 of which you can be attempting to conquer at the same time,                 and are not easy in themselves without being scared witless).                 Never was I bored of running back and forth through areas I'd                 seen a lot, because the game keeps you on your toes by adding                 new threats in areas you thought you'd cleared.                         The graphics aren't too shabby - definitely as good as the            PlayStation incarnation, but with the added bonus of Expansion Pak            support, it really does start to look quite pretty (as pretty as            half-decomposed walking corpses can, I suppose), however some            niggling animations have survived the port. At times the characters            ~skate~ across the floor and it really does dampen the atmosphere            sometimes. Also the BLOODY door-opening animations have stayed.            This is clearly wrong, as they were inserted so the PSX could load            the next scene, but we all know the Nintendo can load them almost            instantly, so why are they still there? There's nothing more            irritating than being made to wait for these things to finish their            run so you can actually get on with your game. Grr. In Capcom's            defence, I suppose they do heighten the air of tension a little as            you wonder what could be lurking in the next room. But still... we            could do without, thank you very much. Another little niggle were            the awkward pauses between each characters senetence during            game-engine cutscene conversations. I'm not quite sure why this was            happening, but it was enough to make me cringe a little.             As for sound and music... well, I                 could hardly fault it. Aside from the slight compression                 artefacts, the speech was nice and clear, the gunshots were                 nice and meaty, and moaning was nice and... moany. Or                 something. The music was really quite beautiful, and I                 couldn't have hoped for something more spine chilling than the                 distant pianos and brooding strings plucking at the hairs on                 the back of my neck. It did seem eerily familiar to music from                 the X-Files, actually.                    To summarise, then, the game is a fantastic piece of work, and            hasn't been done any less justice on the Nintendo 64 - it remains a            genuinely scary, thrilling and totally engaging action/adventure.            If you fancy having yourself a good month or so to finish a game in            its entirety (and I'm not talking on and off gaming, here), then            you can't go far wrong with Resident Evil 2, as long as you keep a            few spare pairs of pants handy. Not that I... oh, never mind.                        - Out Now"}
