Thoughtfully, companies like 3DO make games                 that promise to simulate the whole gambling experience, or                 ~gaming~ as they so coyly name it, as best as possible.                 ~You'll experience all the sights and sounds of Vegas in the                 comfort of your own home!~ screams the back of the box.                    These two Vegas titles (~Slots & Videos~ and ~Table Games~)            share a common interface, with the Table edition, funnily enough,            containing seven popular Vegas table games, such as Blackjack,            Roullette and Craps, while the Slots & Video collection            features five fruit machines and five variations of Video Poker.            They are sold separately (although at a mid-range price), so if you            were hoping to switch between the two at your leisure you will be            sorely disappointed.                    And curiously there is no interaction between the two packages -            the player cannot share funds between the two games; a very strange            ommission when it is painfully obvious that the architecture of the            games is nigh-on identical. It would have been interesting to amass            a small fortune on the slot machines and then move over to the big            leagues of table games with your winnings, but sadly, like so much            else, this is not permitted.         The sights and sounds of Vegas                 that were promised on the box sadly never materialise. Instead                 you choose your game from a bitmapped menu screen, and then                 are thrust straight into the ~action~, without any seeing or                 hearing of the famous Vegas atmosphere.                    This wasn't quite the ~midnight madness~ that the title promised;            it was more gambling for geeks. But what the game does, it does            pretty well. All types of poker games are recreated, the rules of            all the other games are programmed in full, and there are a few            configurable options that allow slightly different styles of play.            Using only one deck at the Blackjack table allows a certain measure            of card-counting to take place, while six packs maitains a degree            of randomness.                    The slots, sadly, are virtually identical - the joyless, methodical            ~insert 1 to 3 coins and press go~ kind so beloved by Americans.            None of the features, light-ups or other distractions that feature            in British games, just the cold, sterile possibility of less trash,            more cash. This appears to be a recurring theme throughout the game            - extract the glitz and glamour, and bow down to the almighty            dollar.         That lack of imagination                 and fun is also reflected in the graphics. Video Slots are                 given unimaginitive themes that smack of laziness and                 clich\u00e9 - you can almost see the graphic artist groaning                 at his desk and wishing he was somewhere else.                    The sound is equally boring. That ridiculous ~music~ which only            owners of large hotels and casinos deem acceptable for public            consumption is piped in throughout (until you turn it off), as are            the nasal voices of your dealers, and some ~ambience~, just to try            and fool you that you are among others and having a good time.                    It's a statisticians dream, and the manual (thoughtfully provided            in Adobe Acrobat format on the CD-Rom, as if to say ~Use your own            damn paper!~) contains several high-falutin' graphs and charts            detailing play strategies, chances of winning, and other tricks            that might be useful on the real gaming floor, but not here in the            virtual world of pixelated dollars.         You can, in theory                 at least, go on to amaze others with your gambling prowess                 over the internet using MPlayer or Microsoft software,                 although both times I checked nobody else was available for                 play. This didn't really surprise me in the least though.                    There isn't even a decent single player mode as such, just player            profiles that record your winnings on each table and your total            money. There is no chance of advance, and everything is available            to you when you start. There is little reason to bother being            careful, as if you run out of money you can just borrow $500 from            the ATM until you amass enough to pay it back. This can be done            repeatedly, with no interest or deadline - I just wish these guys            were my bank managers!                    Perhaps by including something like a mob of navvies to break your            shins if you didn't pay, 3DO could have delivered some of the            ~midnight madness~ that I was looking for, but sadly no...         There is very little to redeem this title from complete and            not undeserved obscurity. It's more like one of those budget ~Games            For Windows~ shareware collections that you see in Woolworths than            an actual game.                    Vegas Games is a painstakingly accurate recreation of six            table games, two types of Keno, slots and video poker, with a nice            GUI tacked on top, and possibly useful for brushing up your skills            on. It is not really very much fun, and certainly contains            no real ~madness~, except the one that you succumb to when you            realise that you just paid good money for this tripe. The madness            will only increase when you realise that, just like the real Vegas,            you can't win your money back."}
