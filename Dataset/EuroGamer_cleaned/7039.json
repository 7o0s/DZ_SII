Unfortunately the                 developers have run out of heroes to send into the game to                 rescue the beautiful princess Lolita Globo. That is until                 Gift, a red-coloured, overweight, big yellow-eyed slob is                 volunteered for the job.                    Armed with a simple stick he will have to brave the strange light            and dark worlds within. His task is simple, locate seven garden            gnomes to take to the heroine, who is clearly suffering from vague            Snow White delusions, and awaken her with a kiss. All of this            whilst avoiding the clutches of the Deep Black Shadow of the            Obscure Dark Night.                    As you can imagine, the world in which you control Gift is            decidedly strange, and nothing is ever straightforward. A bit like            a cartoon nightmare actually!         Gift is a 3D platformer which can be likened to Rayman 2,                 Mario 64 and games of that ilk. You move Gift around the seven                 different worlds with a combination of running, jumps, sneaks                 and pole-vaulting with the use of his stick. Unfortunately                 there is not much variety in his movements, with the ability                 to crawl, monkey climb or even walk missing.                    Our rotund hero also finds the simplest of platforms difficult to            jump upon, often necessitating a jump to a smaller platform to get            to where you want him to go. When this platform is only head-height            it becomes annoying, especially since most other games in the genre            would allow you to grab and pull yourself up. In general the camera            moves with the action nicely, being viewed from behind for the most            part. It does have a habit of deviating from this though and can            often leave you in situations where you have to constantly refresh            the view to see where you are going.                    The puzzles in the game are intriguing, and some of the most            original you will come across. A lot of them are centered around            the light and dark theme of the game. For example, you might have            to work out how to darken an area patrolled by the Little Shadows            who live off light, or shed light upon the Little Lights who thrive            off darkness. Both of these creatures will savage you if you go            anywhere near them. As you progress through the game you will meet            increasingly weird enemies, all intent on snuffing out the yellow            lights of Gift's eyes. Quite possibly the most sinister looking are            the Patrollers with light sensors beaming from their heads,            destroying any lifeform that strays into them with a concentrated            energy beam.         The staff Gift carries about with him                 is no ordinary stick. Apart from wielding it like a loon to                 bash his enemies, he can also gain special powers by walking                 past a power marker. These come in a variety of flavours, but                 the ones you will most commonly find are coloured green, red,                 yellow and purple. All the markers need to be activated to be                 used, so you will have to find the relevant switch to be able                 to harness their power.                    Walking past a yellow marker will give your staff the ability to            emit light, utterly necessary for some of the locations which are            pitch black. The staff will need to be stocked up with power cells            to use this, which are liberally dotted around the worlds. Red            markers will slow you down, but allow you to drop powder that can            then be lit, while the black markers will do the exact opposite to            the yellow and shroud you in darkness. Walking past a green marker            or through fields of green light will return your staff back to the            normal stick bashing mode.                    You will also discover the game's only other weapon, the Shadow            Gun, which will freeze an enemy or object for around ten seconds            when fired at its shadow. Time will teach you how to use this            weapon effectively, but all I will say is persevere with it.         The developers                 have certainly gone to town on the graphics, which can verge                 on being breathtaking at times. Maximum use of your graphics                 card is made with lens flared lighting, shiny metallic                 surfaces, and sparkling rays that are emitted by the green and                 red force fields. With darkness and light being such a huge                 factor in the game the changes are wonderfully depicted, with                 all characters casting their own shadow in true perspective.                    Which brings me nicely to the enemies themselves, which are some of            the weirdest, freakiest and downright odd creatures you will have            witnessed in a platformer. All are beautifully modelled and            animated, giving them a strange believable life. 'Dogs' act like a            normal canine, but any similarity ends there, and the Magic Powder            Generators look like something out of Half-Life!                    The music in the game will give a first impression of being totally            inappropriate, but as you play the game you will realise that the            songs actually blend in nicely. Sound effects range from Gift's            little blurps of confusion to the soft whimper as a Dog eats stick,            or a Little Light or Shadow screams it's little scream as it is            vaporized. Nothing too spectacular, but nothing too shoddy either.         The                 limitation of Gift's movements is a big surprise for me in a                 game that seems to have all other areas covered so well.                 Though he can do most things, little tasks like climbing on to                 a ledge would be so advantageous at times, along with the                 ability to walk up to a platform edge and then view your                 surroundings without risking falling off it. The tendency for                 the camera angle to wander can also cause much annoyance,                 particularly when trying to judge an inch perfect jump, or                 simply to face in the right direction!                    Whether or not Gift will go on to become a mascot in the flooded            world of cutesy 3D platformers remains to be seen, as despite his            cute bug-eyes he is actually quite repulsive! The game does deserve            to do well though on the strength of it's well worked puzzles            alone. But remember - a Gift is for life, not just for Christmas ..            or something!"}
