Surely it could only be as good as 1080 on wheels and dry land,            right? Wrong. The level of variety, excitement and just sheer            quality of the gameplay available here is utterly astonishing. No            word of a lie, myself and a friend spent six hours straight playing            the various 2 player battle modes and attempting challenges in            single player... he left my house at 2am.                         Controlling the game is simpler than I would have expected. The            moves you can pull off are extremely simple to execute, because            what counts is getting enough air in order to pull of huge            combinations of moves which really rakes the points in. No one move            is more complicated than a combination of a direction and two            button presses or vice versa, and each character has a specific set            of unique moves, including a main special stunt and other hidden            specials. What this means is that there is a fair amount of value            in trying out different characters, instead of the only difference            between the players being their costumes.         The single player game is quite                 strange, and it's not immediately obvious what you're supposed                 to be doing in order to progress to subsequent levels, but the                 basic premise is this: on each level you have ways to obtain                 video cassettes, be it by performing tricks to reach a minimum                 score, finding a hidden tape or attaining a set number of                 targets (like grinding 5 park benches, or smashing a series of                 sign posts) and other such miscellany.                         When you manage to collect the required number of tapes, you can            unlock extra boards and levels, and also increase your characters            skills stats. At the beginning it's quite easy to fulfil            objectives, but as you progress the tasks get increasingly harder            until you realise that you're retrying over and over again to try            and reach that elusive hidden tape. Eventually, it can get so            frustrating you'll leave the console in a huff, but I guarantee            you'll be back again.         There are nine levels in all,                 comprising of six freestyle levels and three competition                 arenas. The freestyle locations vary from deserted warehouses                 to a converted waterworks, and all are replete with ramps,                 rails, half/quarter-pipes and all sorts of obstacles with                 which to throw your chosen baggy trousered hero at, the idea                 being to try and grind and jump off of anything and everything                 - this includes moving vehicles in the street levels.                         The competitions involve gaining enough points in a freestyle            competition against a gaggle of other contenders, progression            depending on coming in at least third place. Getting stuck in a            competition, however, halts a lot of your progression through the            game. You can keep going back and collecting as many tapes as you            like, but some levels refuse to unlock unless you pick up the            necessary medals. This can prove an extremely difficult task in the            later levels, and I was desperately restarting the competition over            and over to try and get a decent amount of points. Variety and            difficulty of the stunts you perform are what woos the judges, and            even if you fall over once, you can wave goodbye to your chances of            winning.                         There are also various interesting 2-player modes available for            your perusal, which includes a regular trick attack mode, a tag            mode (each player performs stunts off pieces of the scenery to            ~tag~ them your colour, and you can steal tagged objects from your            opponent by scoring higher on the same obstacles) and the curious            HORSE game, where one player goes on a trick run, and their            opponent must try to beat that score - the first person to fail            gets a letter to a specified word (the default being ~HORSE~)            ~branded~ on them. You must try to keep ahead to avoid being            branded with the word and the game ending with ~PLAYER IS A HORSE~.            As you can imagine, more obscene phrases were explored...         Graphics-wise, the game clearly                 makes use of the expansion pak, and each player model is                 wonderfully rendered, animated and sharp. The levels are                 staggeringly detailed and some surprisingly large, taking a                 good while to fully explore in their entirety. Overall the                 graphics are crisp, smooth and very, very hard to fault... the                 only little niggles being the occasional jerk between                 animation transitions, heavy fogging on the outdoor levels and                 somewhat smeared textures at times.                         The music has been a point that many of my skater friends were            raving about, featuring all your favourite bands you've never heard            of. To be honest, the music suffers at the hands of the compression            needed to get it all into the cart, as roughly only half of each            song is included the resulting looped music quickly becomes            incredibly annoying, especially as the quality is particularly poor            anyway. You're better off turning the music off all together just            to hear the fantastic sound effects as your board rolls, grinds,            jumps and clunks on the ground - it is astoundingly realistic.                    This kind of game is exactly what the Nintendo needs to rejuvenate            faith from the public and hardcore fans alike. The challenging            single player and unremittingly joyous multi-player experience will            have you playing for not days or weeks, but literally months. It is            a true stayer, and I can't see anything being a true contender to            it in the near future. Truly one of the most inspirational,            addictive and utterly triumphant games ever, which can only just be            improved upon.                        - Out Now"}
