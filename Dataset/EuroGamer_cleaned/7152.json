The cheapest way to ensure good stability and juicy clock speeds is            to simply promote good airflow within your case. The addition of            even just a single 80mm case fan can slice over 10 C off your            temperatures. The next stage is the basic ~one-in / one-out~            principle to keep the air inside your case nice and fresh. Some            even go to extreme lengths and add 3, 4 or even 6 large fans to            help keep temperatures down. Both                        Overclockers.co.uk and            PowerComputing            sell such cases here in the UK.                    Unfortunately, as one adds more and more fans, the noise they            collectively generate increases. Hush for a minute, and listen to            the sound coming from your PC. For many readers, there is just a            faint background hum of the fan inside your power supply, and a            distant rumble from your CPU fan.                    Add a pair of 80mm fans though, and the noise level rises. You find            it hard to concentrate, and often resort to playing MP3s while you            work in order to drown out the noise from the fans. As soon as you            start messing with 120mm fans things start to get very loud            indeed.                    The solution is to only have the fans switched on when they are            needed. For the electronically inclined, you can order a            FanBus from Cliff, or even            attempt to make one yourself based on the numerous DIY guides            floating around the Net. But as cool as it looks, with its blue            LEDs and everything, the FanBus is still a manual solution. It is            up to you to monitor your temperatures using            Motherboard            Monitor, and switch your fans on and off to suit.         For those people with a little                 more money to splash around looking for a more autonomous                 solution, I recently stumbled on to a product that should suit                 you down to the ground...                    Introducing the Dragon-Direct DDE8, or Dragon Cooler as I call it.            Designed and built in Wales of all places, it's a fully automated            thermal monitoring and fan management system, which monitors the            temperature of your CPU, graphics card, hard drive, or whatever you            choose, and then switches your fans on and off according to your            preset temperature range.                    The unit comes as a complete kit - you get two motherboard-type            thermal probes, power leads, a pass-through cable, even four screws            to mount it in a spare 5.25~ drive bay. Build quality is impressive            - a pressed sheet steel cage houses the electronics, and the front            plastic bezel is solid enough.                    The model I received can take two separate thermal probes, but            there is an eight-probe version if required. There are two 40mm            fans incorporated into the unit which can blow or suck depending on            your requirements, and they are filtered either way, which makes a            handy addition for those with dusty houses, or pets. The clever            bods at Dragon Direct have also specified the unit to drive one            external fan.                    For such a simple principle, it's amazing how much excitement is            generated when I show the Dragon Cooler to friends. The fan is off.            Pinch probe with fingers. The fan switches on. Ooohh. Release the            probe. The fans switches off. The crowd goes wild!!!                    Having lived with the constant hum of three 80mm case fans for            nearly a year now, the asking price of \u00a329.99 is a small            amount compared with the peace I now enjoy with the fans switched            off most of the time. They stay silent when I'm word processing,            but then kick in when I get down to some heavy-duty deathmatching            and the temperatures start to rise. When I quit Quake 3 the fans            keep running until the temperature is down to normal, and then            switch themselves off again. Heavenly.                    Oh, and did I forget to mention that the LCD screen is backlit?            Yes, it glows an eerie blue when powered, making the display easy            to read even in low light conditions, and it looks dead impressive            at LAN parties.                    While it probably seemed like a good idea at the time, and was a            necessary addition for non-hardcore customers, the two 40mm fans            inside the unit are pathetic. They might be silent, but they shift            so little air it really isn't worth bothering.                    The good news is that these fans are not hard-wired into the PCB -            they use tiny 2-pin connectors on to jumper-type pins on the board.            So of course the first thing that a hardcore user will want to do            is to unplug them. When Phil from Dragon-Direct said ~Sure, try it,            but it will invalidate your warranty~, that was like a red rag to a            bull.                    The personality ~flaw~ of the true overclocker is to never be            satisfied with the normal spec of anything. Celeron II 566            guaranteed to 850MHz?            Gotta            run at 875Mhz! My            Elsa            Erazor X is cooking along at 165Mhz core and 185Mhz memory. The            DDE8 was designed and is sold to drive the two 40mm fans and a            single 80mm fan only, but that wasn't about to stop me...                    So, having removed those pitiful weenie fans, I proceeded to wire            the Dragon cooler up to all three of my 80mm case fans. No problem.            Determined to push the boundaries a little further, I whipped out            my brand new YS-Tech 120mm fan. This bad boy is rated for 120 cfm,            and pulls so much current that you will blow the fan header if you            attach it to your motherboard for power. So in it goes, and guess            what? No problem!                    This is the reason why I bought the DDE8 - I wanted to get my case            temperature close to ambient air temperature without the constant            ear-bashing from fans capable of shifting more hot air than your            average politician.                    Despite the two thermal channels, and capacity for up to eight, the            fans will switch on when either probe exceeds the set            temperature. And since there is only one channel for power, it's a            case of all or nothing when it comes to fans - they are either all            on or all off.                    In an ideal world (and possibly something that Dragon-Direct could            work on in future) you would be able to power separate fans from            separate probes, allowing you to zone your case and cool it            appropriately. If this wasn't possible, I would really like a            dual-stage monitoring system, where a set fan would engage when you            reach a certain temperature, but if the level continues to rise,            another fan would kick in.                    In the meantime, I have a single 80mm fan on all the time, and then            I have my remaining two fans switching on and off as the            temperature fluctuates.                    The DDE8 is the only unit of its kind available in the UK that I am            aware of, let alone at the stonking price of just \u00a330. While            it does not allow the individual fan control of a FanBus, its            autonomous nature allows you to concentrate on your work (or play),            and leave the temperature monitoring to the experts.                    For anyone with more than two fans in their case, and certainly            anyone who is annoyed by the constant rumbling this causes, I            highly recommend this product to the point of labelling it as an            essential purchase.                    Temperature freaks rejoice, for there is a God .. and he lives in            Wales.                        -                            Overclocking the Celeron II 566MHz                    Overclocking the Celeron II 566MHzEpox                    7KXA Athlon motherboardEpox                    7KXA Athlon motherboard"}
