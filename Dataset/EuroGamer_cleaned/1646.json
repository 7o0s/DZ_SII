At heart it is a turn-based strategy game, with screen after screen            of mind-numbing stats to wade through as you decide how much of            your land to assign for crops and grazing, how many farmers,            warriors and craftsmen you want in your village, and which gods to            sacrifice to. You can explore distant lands to discover new tribes            and treasures, raid or trade with other clans, carry out diplomacy,            and choose which advisors to put on your Clan Ring. At first sight            it's all a bit overwhelming, although there is a comprehensive            manual provided if you need some help.                    The sheer number of options on offer and the depth of the gameplay            is also daunting. Even starting a new game results in a lengthy            multiple choice quiz which lays down the history of your clan and            sets up the starting and victory conditions accordingly, although            thankfully you can skip this if you just want to get started.            Battles are just as complicated, with a choice of initial tactics            (skirmish, evade, charge etc) and objectives (such as pillage, kill            or capture land), as well as the possibility of sacrificing to the            gods, using any magical items you possess, or assigning some of            your clan magic to aid your warriors.                    Once you have chosen how you want the battle to be fought the            outcome is in the lap of the gods - the computer goes away and            calculates the result, and it's not always immediately obvious how            your choice of tactics has effected this. Sometimes though you will            have to make further decisions before the battle ends, such as            whether the leader of the raid should take on an enemy hero            single-handed or lead the fighting from the rear.                    These kinds of interlude are common, and every turn you will face a            decision of some kind. Your warriors might complain about the way            they are treated and need to be dealt with, members of your clan            will get into trouble, curses must be lifted and spirits appeased,            friends and allies will ask for aid, mysterious items and races are            discovered, and strangers will come to your court requesting            sanctuary. Each problem comes with a wide range of possible            solutions, and depending on which course of action you choose the            effects on your clan's morale, health, reputation and relations            with other settlements can be drastic. Luckily the members of your            Clan Ring will provide you with advice if you need a helping hand.                    You can also carry out mystical quests which bring blessings on            your clan in the form of magical items, hidden knowledge, increased            stats for your clan leaders and other benefits. Completing a quest            involves answering another lengthy series of multiple choice            questions as you guide your chosen hero through his trials and            select which approach you want him to take at each stage. Mistakes            can lead to injury or even death for the character carrying out the            quest.                    King of Dragon Pass is obviously not going to appeal to everyone.            The painted graphics are attractive but static and the music can            soon get annoying if the cod medieval soundtrack isn't to your            taste. The game also insists on running full-screen for some            reason, which means that if you're using a high desktop resolution            the game will appear as a 640x480 box in the middle of a big black            screen.                    The gameplay is complex and slow paced, requiring a lot of time and            effort to get anywhere. But if you have the necessary patience            there is a strangely addictive turn-based strategy game hiding in            there, with a dose of adventure and role-playing elements for good            measure. The range of options on offer is positively bewildering,            giving almost limitless replay value.                    King of Dragon Pass can be bought from the                        developer's online store for $29.95 plus postage, and a 67Mb            demo version is available to download which will you give you one            year (five turns) to get a taste of what's in store. We certainly            recommend you give it a try for yourself before buying, as this is            likely to be one of those games that you either love or hate.
