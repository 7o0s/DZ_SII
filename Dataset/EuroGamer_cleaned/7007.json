There are no less than a dozen                 of them coming out of the back of my machine, ranging from                 power lines and serial cables to audio leads and USB wires.                 And in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics, which state                 that the amount of entropy in any closed system will rise over                 time, so you can be sure that left to themselves those pesky                 wires will tangle themselves up into an impenetrable maze.                    The problem comes when one of those wires is connected to your            mouse, which is the primary controller for most games, from            real-time strategy and first person shooters to adventure and            role-playing games. Companies have long tried to perfect wireless            rodents and keyboards, but these are still far from reliable.            Trying to play Quake 3 Arena with wireless peripherals at the ECTS            trade show a few months ago proved to be an unmitigated disaster,            with the countless mobile phones and laptop computers in the area            providing so much interference that key presses were missed and the            mouse froze up completely at random intervals.                    And so we come back to the humble mouse, chained to the back of            your PC by a rubber coated tail. If your desk is as untidy as mine,            you have no doubt had your fragging interrupted by that wire            getting tangled up in other wires, or snagging on piles of papers            and CD cases. Then there is the constant threat of it somehow            managing to wrap itself around a cup and spilling the contents into            your keyboard.         Now Everglide think they have the answer to                 this age-old conundrum, in the form of the Mouse Bungee. When                 you first see it the doohickey looks vaguely ridiculous, made                 up of a plastic base with a steel ball embedded in it, with a                 pair of flexible steel springs emerging like antennae from the                 top of it.                    Installation is simple. You work out how much wire you need            (usually six to twelve inches is enough), then press down on the            plastic clips at the top of the springs to open them up and slip            the wire in at the appropriate point. Finally push the wire into            the other clips further down the neck to keep it in place, and            position the Mouse Bungee on your desk. And that's it.                    What the Mouse Bungee does is to hold the short length of mouse            cord between its tip and the back of your mouse above your desktop,            preventing the cable from snagging on anything. The springs that            form the neck of the device give you enough freedom of movement in            all directions to keep all but the most violent of rodent abusers            satisfied, and because the wire is clipped in place it doesn't            matter what happens to the rest of the length from the base of the            Bungee to the rear of your case. Meanwhile the steel counterweight            makes sure that the device stays relatively steady.                         Although it can be a little disconcerting at first having your                 mouse's tail dangling in the air, within a couple of days you                 won't even notice the Mouse Bungee and having it there becomes                 so natural that you will wonder how you ever survived without                 one for so long.                    A rather drastic stress test involving a magazine, a laptop            computer, several press releases, a dozen CD cases and a DVD failed            to interrupt my gaming, and it is only when the piles of kipple on            your desk get so close to the back of your mouse that the stiff            base of the tail starts to hit things that you will have any real            problems. Even stacking rubbish around the Mouse Bungee itself had            surprisingly little effect on the movement of my mouse, and if your            PC is surrounded by junk this could prove to be a real life-saver.                    The style conscious will also be happy to hear that the device            comes in a wide range of colours. As well as the standard solid            black and white models, there are also iMac-friendly translucent            red, blue, green, purple and orange versions. Fruity.         The real                 question is, do I need a Mouse Bungee? And the answer is,                 probably not. At \u00a315.99 it's a rather expensive                 alternative to keeping your desk tidy, though the freedom of                 movement you get from using it is certainly impressive.                    But if you are serious about your gaming and already have a            precision mouse and a space-age surface to run it over, there's no            point in compromising your performance by letting your wires get            tangled in the middle of a vital game. The Mouse Bungee does its            job perfectly, and although it won't improve your gaming, it should            prevent those annoying moments when you try to move your mouse only            to discover that the cord has become stuck under a magazine or            somehow wrapped itself around your joystick.                    At the end of the day it comes down to priorities - is your peace            of mind worth \u00a315.99, or would you rather risk the occasional            mouse cord snagging incident? If you're still undecided, Everglide            also offer a range of ~Total Solution~ packages for under \u00a340,            which include a colour co-ordinated set of mouse mat, wrist rest            and Mouse Bungee for the ultimate in rodent luxury.                    -        Mat-Trix                    mouse mats reviewMat-Trix                    mouse mats reviewEverglide                    Large Attack Pad reviewEverglide                    Large Attack Pad reviewRatpad vs                    Giganta comparisonRatpad vs                    Giganta comparisonRazer                    Boomslang 2000 mouse reviewRazer                    Boomslang 2000 mouse review"}
