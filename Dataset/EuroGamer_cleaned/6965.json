I can't that there are people in our audience who have not            played it, or who have not at least heard of it, but lets be            gentle.                         Worms is a two-dimensional turn-based action game. At the start of            any given level the game produces two to four teams of            invertebrates on a randomly formed battlefield, and each team            receives a whole shedload of weaponry to use in the elimination of            the others. It's a turn-based action title where (by default)            players have a set amount of time to manoeuvre one worm per turn            into position and fire off a weapon. Some weapons allow only one            blast per turn (e.g. bazooka), while smaller weapons (handguns,            shotguns etc) allow for two or even three smaller pot shots. Also            inventoried are a number of scaling implements, including the            legendary ninja and bungee ropes. Things like pneumatic drills,            girders and the like can be deployed, and the entire landscape            after a number of turns on each side is often literally a hollow            crater of its former self.                         So those are the basics. More experienced players will tell you            about your Worms' ability to swing Tarzan-like across a            roofed-level using the ninja rope, or drop sticks of dynamite off            the edge of a cliff directly onto an enemy. Or the legendary Sheep            weapons, joined by a mole weapon in the last adventure. Sheep can            be let off the leash to bound along bleating and then remotely            detonated if they reach their target. Moles on the other hand            tunnel all over the shop and then explode. It's a bizarre mix of            the fantastic and the almost real.                    Although it smacks of the sort of game that could do with an            isometric or perhaps even fully three-dimensional conversion,            developers Team 17 have never felt the need to change tack, and we            agree with them. Worms World Party is one of a scant few new games            still coming out with a default 2D perspective and it's refreshing            to see. The game is all about the excitement and the gameplay, and            the sheer joy of pulling off an amazing ninja-rope-dynamite move,            or landing a cluster bomb two feet from your enemy's feet with one            second left on the fuse. Visually then World Party is nothing new -            it looks just as Worms always has looked, and the Dreamcast does it            plenty of justice. Thanks to the various zoom and view commands,            you can alter the distance away from the action the camera is and            such to your own specifications too, so no complaints there.                         Moving on from which, the control system itself is pretty basic,            although if you don't take in the manual before you start you might            run into difficulties. In all honesty though, there is            nothing like you and a vaguely competent mate huddled round            a machine playing Worms World Party, be it a Dreamcast, a PC or            whatever.                    World Party does the sensible thing you see - it makes additions            but it doesn't change anything. This could be viewed as lazy, but            the additions are 20 much-needed advanced training missions, a full            40 single player missions using exotic backgrounds including            tributes to some big games of the past amongst them, and a refined            Deathmatch mode.                         As previously mentioned, Worms World Party on the Dreamcast also            introduces a wonderful Internet-play option, which is the only            thing in a long while other than Phantasy Star Online that has            given me cause to plug in my Dreamcast modem. Since the game is            turn-based, latency is a non-issue and network play against someone            else on the Internet is perfect. Four players together in the same            game - that's even more impressive. If Sega or Team17 don't run            some sort of online tournament this writer will be most upset.            Instant messaging is available in the lobby if you have a keyboard            or dare to attempt it on your joypad, and despite the facelessness            of playing a game like Worms against a stranger, there is no joy            like knowing that he just fired a bazooka at the wall right next            to him, bounced 40 feet into the water and is now screaming            four-letter words at the lampshade. Oh baby.                    The usual options return for customizing your Worms team and saving            them to VMU. Custom sound schemes are available, as are custom            gravestones for when they bite the dust, although we would have            enjoyed an option to download new sound schemes from the Internet            if possible. Granted it would have been difficult to ensure that            all players had the same schemes and VMU data storage would have            gone through the roof, but there simply aren't that many currently            available, and dammit I wanted an Obi-Wan Kenobi worm!                         It's hard to think of anything in the Worms World Party formula            that deserves criticism, but I suppose one thing is the music.            Although subtle and unassuming as it probably should be, there are            very few themes and they all seem to be rumbling with a bit of drum            work. Some sort of jovial ambient nonsense would have filled the            gap. Elsewhere the sound effects are superb of course. Boom, bang,            crash, clatter, thwack etc. A good spread.                         Ah, the other problem (in my opinion) is the price. Okay, so all            Dreamcast games generally launch at \u00a329.99 these days, but by            reading this review you demonstrate your ownership of a PC, and you            don't need a beast of a machine to play it on the PC either. At            \u00a314.99 in many places, you have to seriously consider just how            important Worms on the Dreamcast is to you. The online play options            are included in the PC version and there'll be a darn sight more            customisation available to you no doubt. If you can handle being            sat at your desk while you castrate some spineless pinkies, then go            for the PC version, but if you need to be flopped drunkenly on the            couch with a few mates, the Dreamcast it is.                    I'm really fond of Worms World Party. It's a top quality game, and            the jewel in the crown on the Worms series. The only thing in the            Dreamcast version that lets it down is the price tag compared to            the PC release. You can't fault it as a game though, and that's why            we're here. If you've never owned a Worms game, you have no excuse,            and even if you have, the Internet play is worth the asking price            in itself."}
