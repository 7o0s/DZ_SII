One of the best was            Tecmo's fabulous Dead or Alive, preferred by many to Virtua Fighter            2 and Namco's Tekken 3, regarded as the epitome of fighting style            elsewhere. As such when Sega announced that the follow-up was            winging its way over here, it could be said that a lot of people            were a bit chuffed. Quite a while later, and despite the rather            risqu\u00e9 advertising campaigns surrounding it, it's here, in all            its effervescent glory.                         Playing DOA2 for the first time is a bit like entering an arcade            with bleary eyes and an unhealthy dosage of mind-altering drugs.            It's fast, frenetic beat-em-up action with a simplistic control            system and a disproportionately large quantity of moves per            character. Due to the speed of the game and concise controls (you            have a punch, kick and block/hold button, each instantaneously            responsive), winning against decent opponents is very much down to            the timing, which makes a pleasant change after the thumb pounding            of some recent titles.                         Specialist moves like tagging and throwing can be bound to            specific buttons, although as the DC controller has a paltry six            this can be somewhat limited in its effectiveness and you'll have            to experiment before deciding upon which moves are most potent in            the majority of situations.                    DOA2's combat system is very original compared to most fighters,            which play themselves out in a very back-and-forth style. With DOA2            you can turn aside incoming attacks and even use the other            fighter's over-extension to your advantage, grabbing a limb and            using it to inflict pain upon your opponent. The controls are            thankfully utterly intuitive, so if you pick up the title not            really knowing to expect as a veteran of Soul Calibur or perhaps            the Street Fighter series, it won't take you long to adapt.                         Defending and attacking is almost as blurred as some of the most            frenetic attacks, which seem to move faster than you can keep track            of at times, despite the consistent 60 frames per second. Every            defensive move can be the start of a vicious offence, and if you're            caught out, the chances are your attack will revert to defence; and            so it alternates until you're really unconvinced by the distinction            and happy to carry on ignorant of it.                         Lamentably though there's not enough to keep you going. Although            there are plenty of dressed up game modes such as story, time            attack and tournament, once you've gone through them (and thanks to            the almost horizontal learning curve this isn't too difficult)            there's not much else left beyond the bare bones fighter. Soul            Calibur by comparison is a veritable treasure chest of longevity.            Unless you have some equally addicted friends who spend 90% of the            day at your house, DOA2 will quickly become a game to pull out on            post-pub occasions and little else, which is a shame.                    Although it's not going to keep you coming back for as long as Soul            Calibur did, it's still one of the most beautiful and playable            games on the console. In terms of visuals, there aren't enough            effectual adjectives to satisfy my taste for them. The character            models are stunning, especially the women, although more from a            technical standpoint than anything else. The curves and contours of            all the characters' bodies, not least the women are very realistic,            and the way in which they move is lifelike to the last.                         Incidentally, whatever Sega may tell you, the magazines across            which Tina, Kasumi and co. have been draped are only a slide of the            eyes away from the glamorous lads mags and their more endearing            full-page spreads; People will stick to the real stuff guys, so            give up!                         One of the things that was given a lot of attention in Soul            Calibur was its sumptuously detailed backdrops. At closer            inspection however it became apparent that that is all they            were, backgrounds. DOA2 ups the ante a little with truly            interactive locations, such as a Tibetan Palace with four whole            floors of lavishness to be thrown about on. A far cry from a few            nice landscapes wrapped around an arena.                    Ultimately, Dead or Alive 2 is a top beat-em-up, but it isn't going            to last. The real shame here is that the reasons for this are so            plain and obvious that it's truly despairing that it didn't occur            to Tecmo to do something about them. In effect what they've done is            to taken the arcade incarnation of the game and allowed Dreamcast            owners unrestricted access to all of it. There's no progressive            release of extras; no new costumes for fighters (which kept DOA            fans ticking over for many months), no secret characters, no            nothing, and with the average character's single player game taking            about 10-15 minutes to complete you'll be through it quicker than            is comfortable.                         And what's left beyond the single player game? Multiplayer. This            is utterly brilliant and frankly how the game should be            played, but it does rather limit the game to multiple player            situations, and although this might even be fine if you could play            over the net or modem, those options aren't at your disposal, so            it's a case of finding a willing and similarly skilled friend or            sibling to battle against. Sigh.                    When the chips are down, Dead or Alive 2 is one of the best            beat-em-ups on the Dreamcast, and rather amusingly, a lot of people            whose opinions count rate it more so than they do the PlayStation 2            version, but without the added longevity of games like Powerstone            and Soul Calibur, it'll be warming the shelf within a week or two."}
