Indeed, its recent DVD release broke sales records, while            the forthcoming follow up, The Two Towers, is guaranteed to be            another cinema blockbuster.                    Strangely, Electronic Arts passed up the opportunity to rush            release a Fellowship Of The Rings cash in videogame, and instead            held back the game to incorporate the best bits of the first two            movies. But when you're the world's biggest games company, you can            afford to make these kinds of decisions - and it is perhaps a sign            that EA is no longer prepared to fob off gamers with half-baked            cash in releases, as it used to with monotonous regularity.        And if you're expecting a half            baked cash in piece of 'interactive merchandise' then think again.            The Two Towers has been lavished with the kind of polish and            attention to detail that EA has become famous for.                    Playable as three different characters; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli            (and other movie characters pop up at various points to give you a            hand) and across 16 levels, the game is ostensibly an all out hack            and slash action game in the tradition of Golden Axe, albeit hung            convincingly onto an already lavish movie scenario. Throw in            elements from modern slasher classics like Devil May Cry and            Dynasty Warriors, and you'll have some idea of what kind of            gameplay prospect to expect.                    Early forays into the game immediately show off the quality of the            game engine, the animation and the huge amount of simultaneous on            screen action. Sets from the movie have been recreated with            impressive results, and the dark, foggy atmosphere utilised is spot            on. A roving camera system has been employed to give you the best            view of the action at all times, although your freedom to explore            the environment is restricted to preset boundaries, which can feel            a little artificial at times, but are necessary to conform with the            tightly scripted events that unfold..                    And talking of scripts, each scene is bookended by film footage            borrowed from the movie, which cunningly blends into FMV, although            the quality of these recreated scenes isn't always as good as it            could be, thanks to some less than cutting edge rendering. That            said, it's still a nice way of introducing a new scene, rather than            just randomly dumping the player into a battle sequence.        While admiring the graphical polish, you'll be invited to try            out the game's control system, which for the early part consists of            a few key manoeuvres: X is a quick attack to dispatch unshielded            foe, triangle a more forceful lunge to break through shields,            square is a basic slash, while circle kicks opponents away.            Shoulder buttons come into play too, with L1 enabling the bow (fire            with X), L2 performs a quick retreat, while R2 stabs the sword into            the ground (or floored enemy). It's all fairly basic stuff for the            first four or five levels, and in fact progress can be made by            mainly stabbing triangle. It's hardly a challenge - even on normal            difficulty - with only the various fearsome bosses providing a            serious obstacle. Sometimes the sheer amount of carnage on the            screen at once is the major challenge - picking out yourself among            the lunacy can be a challenge in itself, although it does add            somewhat to the illusion of a massed battle going on.                    One area The Two Towers gets absolutely spot on is the audio.            Replete with splendid surround sound, a dramatic score, and            correctly voiced samples, the developers have done a great job of            heightening the atmosphere. If you've got the kit, this game really            does deliver in this department.                    In between each level players are awarded points for how well they            have executed their manoeuvres (borrowed liberally from Devil May            Cry's combat system) ranging from Perfect to Fair. If you manage to            impress the game enough, you'll be able to use the points as            currency to buy yourself new combat moves and combos, which go some            way to making the game more than a triangle pressing marathon.        As you work your way up the experience ladder, more complicated            and powerful moves will be revealed, which you'll have to use as            the going gets tougher. As we mentioned, you'll happily get through            just using the triangle attack for the first third of the game,            especially as worrying about health isn't too much of an issue - as            soon as you get close to the point of death, your thoughtful            enemies will drop green health vials. This renders a lots of The            Two Tower's challenge redundant, and in certain sections it's            actually possible to ignore the enemy hoards and simply run onto            the next area.                    However, once you're expected to dispatch bosses, the challenge ups            dramatically. The first is a kind of Loch Ness monster, and only            chopping off its tentacles prevents a very quick death. Following            that, the Cave Troll is a pretty fearsome adversary, especially            once you find you've got to fire off about 50 arrows to get rid of            the blighter - and all that while he's furiously whipping a chain            in your direction. Sadly the camera behaviour tends to make these            sequences harder than they strictly need to be, and you'll often            also get caught out by odd path decisions that seem to 'snag' the            player just at the crucial moment.        Still, a careful            aim and observation of a boss' attack pattern, and it's onto the            next beautifully recreated section, but what you get is ultimately            more of the same. The enemies do get more challenging, and time            restricted levels come into play, but ultimately it's a case of            hacking through a few minutes worth of endless hordes, before you            get to do battle with a boss. Experienced gamers will probably            finish the game within 10 hours, although there is the temptation            to replay the game as one of the other two characters.                    One of the more pleasing factors is the way it integrates the 'DVD            extras' into the level select system. Finishing a level will more            often than not result in an interview extra becoming available, or            some photos, and so on, and gives a certain amount of incentive to            carry on. Also, given that the game incorporates the            as-yet-unreleased second movie into the footage, you also get a            sneak preview of key moments - something that die hard fans will            undoubtedly kill for at this point in time.                    But whether you'll want to invest \u00a340 of your hard earned cash            into the game of the movie comes down to a few key factors: how            much of a Lord Of The Rings nut you are, whether you like            relentless Final Fight/Double Dragon style gameplay, and just how            much cash you have to spare. It's fun while it lasts, but requires            relatively little skill - just an iron will and determination to            progress through 16 lavish, on rails, scripted levels. And once            you've finished it, we doubt whether you'll be coming back for            more.
