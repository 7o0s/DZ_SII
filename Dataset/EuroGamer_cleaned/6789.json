A peculiar hybrid of real-time strategy, platform            and puzzle games, even in its unfinished state Wizards is starting            to look magical\u2026                    Taking up the role of Arch Wizard, the player is plunged into a            world of fantastical armies of the undead and a quest to free the            land of Talismania from the clutches of the evil sorceress            Kun-Mara. Players build armies of magical warriors to be sent to            war against AI-controlled enemies or up to three other players via            link-up, as well as beating fiendish puzzles and mastering a            multitude of magical attacks. It's really quite compelling.                         The game kicks off with a training mode to get players used to the            controls, tasking them with unlocking the Arch Wizard from one of            Kun-Mara's prisons and escaping an undead castle, defeating archers            and watch towers on the way out of the compound. Meanwhile a wily            white-bearded Wizard in a purple outfit briefs players on what to            do via a smooth-scrolling speech bubble screen.                         Units are controlled by selecting them with a cursor arrow and            pressing A on the spot you want them to move towards, clicking on            individuals or holding down A and dragging a net over them to            select greater numbers. The mechanics of multiple selections are a            little awkward at the moment, but the effect is delightful. The            quirky overhead cartoon view of the game with small character            sprites means that huge bands of wizards can be held under your            thumb and directed to sling wave after wave of (bouncing) fireballs            all over the place using the B button, and large scale battles can            end up looking like something out of Gradius. Other neat touches            include a very literal fog of war, like a bank of dark grey cloud            obscuring your path until you approach it.                    Fireballs are one thing, but the action really seems to heat up            when the Arch Wizard starts wielding his repertoire of real            spells. By holding the left shoulder button you can select a target            and attack with nothing short of a Meteor to begin with, unlocking            greater and more devastating attacks as you recover them from the            various treasure chests littered about the levels. Apart from            spells, you'll find chests containing gold coins and potions to            replenish your magic bar, and levels are also home to various            parchments strewn about to direct you in avoiding timed spike            traps, defeating guard towers without being seen, and more.                         The single player mode is a thirty level story-driven quest            through Talismania, from the warm southern lands to a climactic            showdown on the slopes of the Daggerfall Mountains. The main            campaign mode was not in place in our version of the game, but            there was a placeholder map with lots of levels open to try out,            and objectives (laid bare by the purple Wizard from the training            session) include stealthily sneaking into fortresses, freeing more            prisoners, storming keeps and defeating armies of the undead on the            plains of Talismania. Plenty of variation in level design and            objectives could well sustain a very agreeable (and quite lengthy)            adventure, but that remains to be seen. There are also said to be            multiple routes through the game, with lots of sub-quests to            complete, which seems realistic based on the scattering of blips            representing tasks on the world map in our preview code.                         Rounding off the package are several link-up modes for up to four            players - Capture The Flag, Gladiators, Domination and Wizzball.            Given the crazy tactics we've managed to use so far, there's a lot            of scope for enjoyable multiplayer battles on top of the compelling            single player campaign.                    Like Jet Riders, Wizards is currently under development without a            publisher, and it's not as close to release as its sibling. But            from what we've seen it's an extremely adventurous little hybrid of            several popular genres, and more than a worthy sequel to Warlocked.            Expect to see Wizards on the market this summer."}
