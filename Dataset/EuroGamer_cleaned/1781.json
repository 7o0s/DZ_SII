But was this just                 initial over-reaction or does she still feel suitably                 impressed. ~Well it is for the first time, innit?~.                         The Smurfs features two sections, the pre-school sub-games part            and the proper single player game. The pre-school section includes            several small and overly easy games where you playing as Hefty            Smurf have to complete a variety of challenges, such as skiing down            a slope to collect food, floating about on air currents to collect            food and all sorts of other food-gathering alternatives. The food            of course, is for a little baby Smurf that the stork left on your            front porch. I'm not making this up.                         ~I liked the river one and I liked how they actually got the game            set out, as in they produced the pictures and it seemed like it was            really good fun for the little ones to play, the 4 year-olds.~ But            did she think that these little sub-games (which made up about a            quarter of the game) were the sorts of things that anyone else            would play more than once? ~They were okay the first time but they            got boring quickly and I wanted to play something else after I had            played them. I don't really want to play them again.~ When she            accidentally loaded them up instead of the main single player game            she openly cursed\u2026 ~Arrggh God!~ Now that's no way to talk            for a 10 year old.         Anyway, while they were amusing                 distractions she quickly moved on to the real game, where                 Hefty Smurf has to rescue the other smurfs and baby smurf from                 Gargamel. Riveting stuff. One good thing about a simple plot                 in a game like this is that it gives the kids something easy                 to understand that they can cling onto. I don't think Sasha                 really cared all that much about the plot though. Did she even                 know what the plot was about? ~Yes you're supposed to be                 getting things that are healthy for the Smurfs.~ And she's 10                 years old, Heliogame Productions, not your 4 year old                 demographic.                         However in spite of the, uh, plot complexities that outwit the            audience, she really enjoyed the game for the most part. I actually            can't watch TV right now because she's still playing it. It wasn't            devoid of flaws, as was pointed out to me at length. Aside from the            plot issues and lack of interest in the pre-school sub-games,            Sasha's other main problem was that the single player game was            pretty tough after such a muted introduction. She would repeatedly            run out of hearts and end up with a 'game over' even before she'd            accomplished victory over the first two levels, although she can            get about three or four levels in on occasion now. Does she think            it's overly tough though, or doesn't she really mind? ~No, because            I know my controlling of the keys and I know where to put my            fingers and the Smurf is running a lot and it's not hard to control            him.~ Although she did have a couple of concerns. ~And like this            green and yellow creature I can't get past it very well, I can if I            jump over him or go behind and jump over him. When he dies his neck            goes up and he falls over.~         Speaking of the death animations (she                 was, just for the record) brings me neatly onto the topic of                 graphics. For the Playstation these are fairly impressive and                 although technically a 2d side-on platformer, the game has a                 very 3d outlook, with the camera panning from side to side and                 around the main character on occasion. The main character,                 Hefty Smurf, is a little angular, but is quite clearly a Smurf                 and no mistake. The other Smurfs and the various creatures                 inhabiting their forest are all faithfully reproduced                 throughout the game and Sasha happily bopped on their heads                 and threw boxes at them to vanquish their souls.                 (Language-check, this is ~The Smurfs~, not Soul Calibur -Ed).                 The framerate dropped worryingly every so often (although                 Sasha didn't make an issue of it) due to more than a few                 baddies appearing on screen, but on the whole remained                 consistently acceptable.                         The main concern I had looking on was that a lot of the characters            and backgrounds looked a little bit too jagged around the edges. I            would have thought that a little more work could have been done to            avoid that and make it seem more obviously akin to its cartoon            inspiration.                    The sound effects throughout were suitably cute and cartoony, but            the voices of the various Smurfs seemed fuzzy to the point where I            had to listen carefully to understand properly. Sasha concurred.            ~It was jumbly, didn't make sense.~ The musical accompaniment was            actually quite impressive and reminded me of a slightly more            sinister and catchy version of the theme tune to the series. I            liked. Sasha did too, ~Yes I do, it very amusing and calm.~ Well,            you know, she'd cottoned onto the fact that I was writing down what            she said at this point, so she was trying to sound more mature, it            certainly wasn't ~amusing and calm~. Bah.         To tell the truth, I enjoyed The                 Smurfs a fair bit, but two things should be considered when                 taking that into account.                    If you're a young adult or a late teenager, you won't benefit much            from laying out \u00a330 for this, but an overnight rental from            your local video or games shop might be in order if you enjoy stout            platformers or have a couple of children at the 10 year old or just            above mark. There's certainly nothing new here for platform-game            fans that you haven't seen done better in the likes of Rayman or            Crash Bandicoot, both of which are available on the budget label.            You might just as well grab both for the same price as this and get            twice the fun.                    Finally, I ought to mention the cut-scenes. I was having spasms of            joy over these (real Smurf-based footage! Aw!) but frankly they            were a bit boring after a while. What did Sasha think of them? ~I            just press the button to ignore them.~ That's my girl.
