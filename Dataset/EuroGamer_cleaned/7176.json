The game's mission pack, London 1969, is now available on budget            for \u00a39.99 from Sold Out            Software, and as the game was released before EuroGamer was            even in a twinkle in anybody's eye, we thought now was as good a            time as any to review it...                    With GTA London you get thirty new vehicles to pilfer, and thirty            new missions to get through. And this time around, instead of the            yellow taxi filled roads of America, you get to cause merry havoc            around the black cab stuffed streets of London. ~Gawd blimey guv!~                    Well, it's not quite as easy as that. The more crimes you commit,            the more interested the police will be in making your acquaintance.            Their Panda cars also happen to be the fastest cars in the game!                    Once you have a mission to undertake, a little white arrow will            point in the direction you have to go. Simply follow this arrow,            and once you are near your target it will home in. All missions            have two or more stages to them, which can range from meeting            someone who has a juicy slice of information, to picking up a            suitcase full of cash.                    Failure to complete certain missions will result in you having to            locate another phone booth to take on a new mission. And a mission            can be failed for a variety of reasons. Failing to complete a task            in a set time, killing a key person, or getting caught by the            Police - these are just some of the sticky ends your walking crime            machine will meet.                    Fail the crime bosses too many times though, and you will soon be a            freelancer on the roads, with no guidance whatsoever. Not the best            scenario in the world, I can assure you.         As you're tearing                 around London, it is inevitable that you will get a few bumps                 and scratches along the way.                    Damage resistance varies from car to car. For example, steal a bus            and this will endure a huge dose of punishment. Get inside a VW            Beetle on the other hand and you will find it hard to keep it            roadworthy unless particular care is taken.                    If the heat from the police is getting too much, you can visit one            of the few garages dotted around the map for a new lick of paint!            Particularly useful if you've just used a Copper as a speed bump!                    You will also notice wooden crates dotted throughout the map. Smash            these by punching them, as they usually contain weapons. Yes my            friends, you can even go pedestrian bashing with a machine gun!            Sometimes you will need to locate a particular crate containing a            more violent weapon, a rocket launcher for example. Joy!                         GTA London adopts a top down view of everything. For the most                 part this isn't really too much of a problem. In fact, the way                 the camera pans back at high speeds, revealing more road, can                 be quite hair raising.                    There are moments where it can be utterly infuriating though.            Street obstructions such as lampposts, fences and signposts can be            very difficult to distinguish at times. This results in you going            from 90mph to stop in a flash, which not only serves to be highly            annoying, but can also make you an easy arrest for the police.                    The instant stop annoyance doesn't stop there though. You only need            to slightly glance off another car or edge of a building for your            car to stop dead. Fine if you've slammed into the back of            something, but a mere glance shouldn't hinder your Police evasion.                    The handling of the cars is very good, but with no attempt to be a            driving simulation by any means. This is raw arcade we're talking            here. Just get in a car and screech round those corners. Not a care            in the world!         ~Minces                 and Gears~?!? That's ~eyes and ears~ to those non-cockney                 speaking people!                    It has to be said that GTA London, like the original game, is not a            great looker. The graphics are highly pixelated and scrolling isn't            the smoothest. You are hard pushed to see what the fuss was all            about to be honest.                    However, this aside, the representation of the cars and locations            are very recognisable. The Union Jack painted E-Type Jaguar, for            example, is particularly cool to mow down pedestrians in. Also some            of the locations are easy to spot - Big Ben has never looked so            pixelated .. I mean good!                    What makes the game tick though is the superb music. Each car you            get in will be tuned to its own radio station. This means that            one-minute you will be driving along to a reggae beat, and the next            some real 60's style funk. It all adds to the dodgy atmosphere of            the game.                    Couple the music with unrelenting arcade style play, and the            graphical limitations pale into insignificance.         You can't go far wrong if you buy                 both GTA and the mission pack in one hit, as \u00a320 will get                 you hours of fun. You can even link up via IPX on a LAN and                 duel it out with friends if the mood takes you.                    A special note should also be made here on the rather excellent            packaging the Sold-Out range provides you with. The game comes in a            swanky cardboard outer box, which houses a Playstation style opaque            blue case containing the CD and game catalogue. Budget in this case            doesn't mean skimping on quality. A refreshing change.                    GTA:London won't win any prizes for graphical excellence. Yes, it            is unbelievably frustrating at times to come to a full stop, having            not seen a lamp post looming. It can also be annoying to smash into            a car you haven't been able to see due to the top-down nature of            the game obscuring your view.                    However, with an absolutely stonking soundtrack pumping along to            the beat of super smooth arcade style gameplay, you simply have to            love this game. It's old school gameplay come back to visit .. and            it's wild wild fun!"}
