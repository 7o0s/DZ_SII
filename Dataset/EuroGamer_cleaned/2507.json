I can't even pretend to be ashamed of this. In fact, after I've concluded this ~article~, I'm probably going to wade back in and finish off a few more. Can you blame me? It's great to see trust fund percussionists winging through the air, launched from those stupid plastic drum kits, and it's a pleasure to knock human statues off their wonky-apple-box perches.Most of all, it just feels right to blast the saxophone from a jazzman's wretched saxophone-caressing hands. The only problem, actually, is that inFamous 2's developer Sucker Punch awards evil, rather than good, karma points for doing all this. Hopefully that will be fixed with a patch.So ignore the big changes for a second: forget the new setting, the new characters, and the inevitable range of new abilities. Pummelling community theatre folk may be one of the more basic missions available in inFamous 2 - but it feels like an emblem of the game's single greatest shift in direction.Sucker Punch's first open-worlder provided a promising superhero template, but it locked players into a dour backstory where the fizziness suggested by your newfound electrical powers was lost beneath the grim rubble of a destroyed Empire City. Despite the fact that the sequel kicks off with Cole MacGrath's defeat by the Beast (the cherry-flavoured Dr Manhattan-alike he had been created to ward off) and a subsequent retreat south, the game that follows refuses to brood over failures and disappointments.Instead, it's cheerful, energetic and colourful, and it casts Cole as a kind of loose-limbed, white-trash avenger: an ornery hero in a wife-beater who lamps the baddies with a pair of motorbike forks and then turns off his phone to grab a bit of downtime watching a Western on TV. What's inFamous 2's biggest surprise? It's that the protagonist seems to enjoy his super powers a little more on this outing - and so will you.Sucker Punch certainly does. The team's latest begins by letting you hang onto some of the best electrical trinkets from the first game - the grenade, the blast, and the aerial boost for starters - and then it starts to pile on entirely new goodies.You can expect a range of different bolt attacks, a series of strange tweaks to those grenades, and standout ionic powers that can send a super-charged twister sailing down the street or trigger lightning storms and crushing waves of ice. Beyond that, depending on whether you've chosen the good or evil karmic pathway, you can look forward to messing around with things like Freeze Rockets and Frost Shields or the demented pleasures of the Firebird Strike, which turns you into a nasty short-range homing missile.Either choice promises plenty of kinetic fun, and there are easy ways to power up good or evil karma to unlock the options you're after. Most story missions and side quests carry an - often interesting - moral flourish, while the map itself is filled with randomly placed robberies to halt and bombs to defuse if you're feeling kind, or cops to supress, protests to quash, and all those innocent street performers if you aren't. Both of the game's karmic paths will push you towards weighty and genuinely satisfying conclusions, and the overarching storyline of the inFamous games, which perhaps didn't make as much of an impact as it could on the first outing, starts to get pretty interesting.Meanwhile, if you measure an open world by its power to distract you from what you're actually meant to be doing, New Marais is every bit as good at its job as Empire City was. Its streets are littered with icons promising side missions, while collectable blast shards are stuck into almost every surface: good for extending your energy meter but also fun to hunt for in and of themselves. Dead drops have been replaced by carrier pigeons holding SIM cards and, if you want to, you can spend a pleasant afternoon just rattling around town, shooting birds out of the sky and piecing the game's backstory together.A little southern charm doesn't go amiss, either. New Marais has everything a good Deep South stereotype could need: rotting plantation manors, misty swamps that hide evil things and awful secrets, plenty of rococo churches to climb, and a rampaging gang of supremacists on the loose. Later areas include rail yards, a huge, Crackdown-style gas works and Flood Town: a first, for me at least, in video games, as its take on the apocalypse channels Katrina rather than the World Trade Centre."}
