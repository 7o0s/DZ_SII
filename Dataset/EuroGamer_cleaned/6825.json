{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-dungeonsiege", "date": "23 Apr 2002", "game_name": "Dungeon Siege", "text": "Falling somewhere between the party-based antics of Baldur's Gate            and the rapid fire click-fest that is Diablo, Dungeon Siege is a            role-playing game for people who don't like to think. Characters,            controls, stats-crunching and storyline are all pared down to the            bare minimum, making way for an endless succession of increasingly            brutal fights.                        There is a token plot, but it comes in uneven lumps and dull tomes,            serving merely to keep you moving along in the right general            direction, pushing you from one battle to the next. As the game            begins the lead character is just a humble peasant, but a hammy            voice-over assures you that you will soon be changing history,            saving your kingdom from ruin, and all that jazz. Along the way you            can gather up to seven companions, and in a novel twist this number            can include pack mules to help lug your loot around, as well as the            more usual warriors, wizards and archers.                        In the early stages of the game you won't be needing much direction            from the plot though, because most of the world of Dungeon Siege is            made up of slopes which are just that little bit too steep            to clamber up, with long narrow valleys and claustrophobia inducing            mines keeping you locked on a linear path. Later on in the game            there are a few open areas, and if you hunt around there are some            small hidden areas to uncover, but most of the time you don't have            any opportunities for sight seeing. Instead you are neatly shuffled            along a conveyor belt of restrictive caves and canyons, punctuated            by towns where you can offload some of your ill gotten gains and            pick up fresh supplies and additional characters...                    This rather simplistic game structure would be fine if there was a            dramatic storyline and involving characters to pull you into the            game. Unfortunately the characters are all cardboard cut-outs with            barely a line of dialogue to their name, and the plot is thin on            the ground at the best of times. What little voice acting there is            ranges from poor to downright insulting - whoever provided the            voices for the miners should be rounded up and strapped to an            electric chair for his troubles.                        Instead the game world takes center stage, and what a wonderful            world it is. Dense forests, snow-shrouded mountains, eerily lit            caves, misty swamps, and of course the eponymous dungeons are all            lovingly rendered in real-time 3D, along with the nicely detailed            and often bizarre looking monsters which inhabit them. Most            impressive of all is the fact that this world is virtually            seamless. There are no loading screens, and although occasionally            when you arrive at a town the game will lock up for a second as            data is pulled from your hard drive, most of the time the loading            is done in the background without interrupting the flow. This            allows you to move smoothly across a forest clearing, down a flight            of stairs and into the dank crypt below, with the ground fading            from view as you descend into the darkness. It's a neat trick, and            helps to suck you into the world.                        The bad news is that the camera doesn't really let you zoom far            enough out to fully appreciate this splendour, but you can get            right up close to the action to see each swing of your sword and            every drop of arterial spray that results from it. Sometimes the            scenery gets a little overwhelming as well, and you can't see the            forest (let alone your enemies) for the trees, but the foliage does            at least fade out when it gets between your characters and the            camera. An ugly overhead map can also be used to direct the battle            if you can't see what your men are fighting behind all that            shrubbery.                    More often than not you won't need to do any directing though.            Simply set all the AI options which govern how freely your            characters should attack and chase enemies to maximum and the game            will pretty much play itself.                        In the tougher battles you might want to switch your mages between            healing and combat spells from time to time, while hammering on the            H and M keys will order anyone in your party whose health or mana            bar has dropped too low to quaff the appropriate potion. Otherwise            you can cruise through 90% of the game on autopilot without having            to actually do anything. You don't even need to spend your            experience points, as Dungeon Siege uses a skill-based system            whereby your characters get better at tasks as they carry them out.            So if you spend all your time in melee, your melee combat and            strength attributes rise automatically. Cast spells and your magic            and intelligence stats gradually improve.                        While it's nice to see the developers automate tedious functions            such as picking up loot and introduce decent AI and a novel            character development system, in a game which is solely focused on            combat this doesn't leave much for the player to do for themselves.            Of course, you can manage your battles by hand, disabling the AI            and pausing the game to give orders by hand, but this tends to be            pretty futile and tactical possibilities are limited. Enemies run            right through your men as if they were ghosts, so you can't defend            your mages and archers by moving your heavy warriors up front.            Instead battles tend to turn into chaotic brawls, with characters            and monsters chasing each other around in circles and desperately            healing their allies as enemies swarm over you, charging in from            all directions.                    It doesn't help that you can't split up your group. The camera is            always locked on the character(s) you currently have selected, so            if your party gets seperated you won't be able to see what they're            all doing except via the hideous ~megamap~ view.                        Even this doesn't work properly though, judging which parts of the            map you have uncovered by where the camera is placed. So again, if            one character chases after a monster he can end up disappearing            into the fog of war. All you can do then is select the errant            character and give the camera a couple of seconds to move to him.            This doesn't work while the game is paused, so in the meantime the            rest of your party will decide that you have selected the wayward            wanderer as their group leader, and drop whatever they were doing            to run towards him. Not very clever.                        Multiplayer leaves you with just one character to keep track of,            but this doesn't really hit the spot either. Thanks to the wonders            of DirectPlay you can only have up to eight people in a game at            once. Given that you're free to roam across a few square miles of            terrain, even finding the rest of the players can take a couple of            minutes if you join a game which is already underway. It doesn't            help that you have no way of knowing exactly where they are until            after you have chosen where to spawn into the game. Which is about            par for the course really, as Dungeon Siege's online support is            downright primitive. The server browser doesn't even list ping            times, so joining a game is a bit like playing Russian Roulette -            you have no way of knowing whether the game will be playable until            after you have connected to the server. What a great idea that was.                    Dungeon Siege can be fairly entertaining in short bursts, but given            the total lack of plot and character development there's little to            keep you playing in the long run except the promise of more pretty            graphics, new trinkets and more powerful enemies to kill. That            might be enough for some people, but given the repetitive and            brutal nature of combat it wore thin for me after a while.                        -        Dungeon                    Siege screenshotsDungeon                    Siege screenshots"}
