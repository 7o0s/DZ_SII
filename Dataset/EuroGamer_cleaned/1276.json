Eurogamer's launch editor John ~Gestalt~ Bye (we all had nicknames back then) penned this famous critique of Halo: Combat Evolved way back in the day, which left us with a legacy of ~Better than Halo?~ comments directed at any other review with a high score forever after. Always with the wit.Read on to see what John made of Halo when he published this review on 13th March 2002, the eve of the original Xbox's European launch. Having worked with John in the early days of the site, I'd like to apologise to him should he happen upon this relic for going through and adding a few more hyphens than he would have liked, but I will preserve his strange love of incomplete ellipses floating in space. -Tom B            Of all the games in the Xbox's European launch line-up, Halo is            perhaps the nearest the console comes to having a killer app. It's            the biggest-selling Xbox title to date in America, and the press on            the other side of the pond have been raving about it for months.            Now that it's finally arrived here in Europe, the question is, can            it live up to the hype? And the answer is yes .. and no.            Halo puts you in the boots of a futuristic cyborg soldier known            only as the Master Chief, and as the game begins you are being            defrosted from cryogenic storage aboard a warship pursued by an            alliance of alien religious fanatics called the Covenant. Luckily            there's time for the engineers to power up your mobile armour suit            and run you through some diagnostic tests first though, which gives            you a chance to get to grips with the game's controls. Although I            normally have difficulties with console shooters, Halo proved to be            surprisingly easy to control, and the cinematic introductory            sequences mean that you have several minutes to just run around            admiring the scenery before having to actually shoot anything.            Indeed, the opening sections of Halo come across as the bastard            offspring of Unreal and Half-Life. Having completed your test run            you must make your way to the bridge to talk to the captain,            without the benefit of a weapon and getting only glimpses of the            enemy as battles rage in side corridors and behind doors which are            wedged half open. Even when you finally get hold of a weapon and            join in the action for yourself, the atmosphere doesn't let up as            you make a dash for the last remaining lifepod, fighting alongside            scattered squads of human marines as Covenant boarders try to block            your escape route.            All of this pales into insignificance when you finally touch down            on the mysterious ring which gives the game its title. With the            surface of the vast orbiting Halo arcing into the sky above your            head and grass-covered mountains towering all around you, the            scenery is spectacular to say the least.            Not that you'll have long to stand gawping at the view, as the            Covenant are soon joining you on the surface to search for            survivors. Guided by the soothing voice of the ship's female AI,            entrusted to your protection by the captain, you soon find yourself            roped into tracking down the other lifepods that escaped your ship            and helping the marines to fight off Covenant forces long enough            for a dropship to arrive and evacuate them. We won't spoil the rest            of the game for you, but suffice to say that there are plenty of            plot twists and dramatic in-game cut-scenes to keep you amused over            the course of Halo's 10 missions.            The one downside to this heavily scripted story-led malarkey is            that the game is depressingly linear at times, shuffling you from            one encounter to the next and rarely giving you any real choice in            where to go or what to do. While running around space ships and            Halo's interior you will find an amazing wealth of locked doors            which keep you from straying from the one true path, with            occasional neon arrows conveniently painted on the floor to point            you in the right direction in case there was any doubt. The outdoor            settings look fairly open at first sight, but although there's more            freedom of movement there are still only one or two paths open to            you most of the time thanks to steep-sided canyons and the            occasional rock fall.                    It's easy to forgive Halo these shortcomings for the first few            hours though as it sucks you into a gorgeously rendered sci-fi            world of bizarre aliens, curvaceous architecture and gaudy weapon            effects. Halo is one of the most visually impressive games we've            seen to date, and the only real problem on the eye candy front is            an over-reliance on shiny metallic surfaces, giving it a slightly            fake CG look in places.            The AI is equally strong, with the Covenant using cover and            grenades to full effect, while groups of marines work together to            cut them down, calling out directions as they track down            stragglers. It's not perfect, and the enemy is a little passive at            times, often allowing you to duck back behind cover and wait for            your shields to recharge instead of pressing the attack. We were            also a little alarmed at the frequency of friendly fire incidents            in confined areas, although your men do at least apologise if they            shoot one of their own. This constant chatter from both sides all            adds to the atmosphere, and there's something undeniably satisfying            about seeing a panicked Covenant grunt running away from you with            his arms waving frantically in the air, shouting ~he's unstoppable~            and ~they're everywhere~.            If you want to do some screaming of your own, Halo features a full            co-operative mode, allowing you and a friend to fight your way            through the campaign side by side. It's a rare luxury these days,            but one which adds a lot to the game's replay value. Naturally the            game also includes the usual deathmatch and capture the flag modes,            as well as king of the hill, checkpoint races and ~oddball~, where            you get points for holding on to a ball for as long as possible.            Apart from co-op (which only works with two players) all of these            modes support up to four players, either on one Xbox with a            split-screen view or with multiple Xboxes networked together using            the built-in ethernet adapter. Things can get a little choppy at            times with more than one player sharing the same screen, but            overall it works well. If you're feeling really adventurous, it's            even possible to play over the internet by hooking your Xbox up to            a PC running some (very unofficial) third-party software.                    Halo isn't without its faults though. For starters, those of us            weened on PC shooters may find it a little frustrating that you can            only carry two guns at a time. As the game uses a checkpoint-based            autosave system, if you find you have the wrong weapon for the job            your only choices are either to run back to wherever you dropped            the gun you really need now, or to muddle through as best you can.            And while most of the game is spent fighting on foot, often alone            behind enemy lines, the small selection of vehicles which you get            to drive from time to time aren't quite as satisfying. A            combination of slightly awkward controls, low gravity and            incredibly soft suspension makes the buggy in particular a real pig            to drive on uneven surfaces. Maybe I just need more practice, but            the single-player game doesn't really offer much opportunity to get            the hang of driving and flying the various vehicles, except when            you're in a hurry to get somewhere and getting shot from all            directions.    Where Halo really falls down though is the pacing. The first few            hours of the game is a work of unadulterated genius, constantly            throwing new sights, enemies and weapons at you. But things go            rapidly downhill from there on in. Suddenly you find yourself            spending more time beneath the surface of Halo than above it, and            most of these underground facilities are made up of a handful of            drab prefab rooms repeated over and over again, with different            combinations of monsters thrown in to block your way, and big            glowing plot arrows in every room to point you through the one and            only exit. Needless to say, clearing level after utterly linear            level of near identical rooms soon gets tedious in some of these            missions, especially when you find yourself forced to backtrack            across a couple of miles of terrain that you've already explored at            one point, with only a change of inhabitants to keep you            interested. The game does at least pick up again at the end for an            exciting finale, but by this point finishing the game may have            become more of a chore than a delight for you.                    Halo is very much a game of two halves. The first half is fast,            exciting, beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises.            The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great            cinematics but let down by repetitive, paint-by-numbers level            design. Bungie could quite comfortably have cut several overly            lengthy sections from this second half and still ended up with a            respectably time-consuming game while maintaining the            adrenaline-pumping pace of the first few hours. As it is Halo is a            flawed masterpiece, one which is well worth owning but which may            start to grate after a while."}
