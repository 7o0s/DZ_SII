No such            thing as pre-installed software in those days! Many hours were            misspent at the back of the room playing an old DOS golf game,            boasting some of the most gorgeous graphics to date.                    That game was ~Links 386~, where each scene took anything from            twenty seconds to over a minute to render, and caused huge            frustration if you happened to get a view you were not happy with!            Back then it did not matter one jot though, simply being spellbound            by the beauty of the graphics and the accuracy of the simulation            was enough. Now, over a decade on, the Links series is still alive            and kicking, and keeping up its tradition of being a solid golfing            simulation, staged upon lush graphical environments. Once more unto            the green dear friend...         Links 2001 begins with            a dramatic opening video sequence accompanied by a racing heavy            metal style theme which, when considering the calm nature of golf,            seems a touch inappropriate. Once in the game itself you can go for            a quick putt about, or head straight for the virtual tour.                    Before this you might want to browse through the numerous lessons            available to you though, which will teach you everything you can            possibly think of. Here is where you can also learn about the three            different control methods you can use within the game, namely Easy,            Classic and PowerStroke swings. Once armed with the rudimentary            knowledge you need to at least look vaguely competent on the            fairway, you can go out for a practice round.                    Taking the shot with the Classic control system is simple,            especially as the best club is automatically selected for you. All            you have to do is set the power as close to the 12 o'clock marker            on the swing gauge as possible, and then close to the snap 6            o'clock marker. If you get these bang on your shot should go            straight ahead, depending on any wind that may be present. You will            be surprised at how quickly the game grows on you, and how easy it            is to achieve your first Birdie or keep a respectable par for the            full eighteen-hole course. If you find that things are getting too            easy though, do not worry - the skill level increases steeply as            you challenge the pros or, dare you risk it, the champs!                    The game doesn't have its own set of internal tournaments, instead            you are given the license to create your own in the Virtual tour            section. Here you can choose which of the six provided courses will            be used, how many players will be involved, and many other options            besides. Add to that the excellent course designer and this            provides endless possibilities for your competitive side.                    Ball physics are excellently represented, with realistic inertia on            gradients and proper slow-down when rolling through the rough. You            can enable the grid at any point, which will show you all the            gradients you need to be wary of, which becomes a necessity for the            green shots. Believe me, some of the greens have been really            cruelly designed!                    When you manage to pull off a stunning shot that defies all your            own beliefs you really would like to see it again, yes? The            unfortunate thing is that because Links has to render each and            every scene, such neat extras as ball-cams and roving cameras are            simply not possible. Instead you are limited to watching the            previous shot from the original vantage point or from the flag            view.                    The rendering nature of the game becomes even more annoying when            you want to simply look around your environment, or 'walk the hole'            like you can in other golfing simulations. You can alter your            initial stance if you wish, but this brings about another screen            render...         As always            the graphics are excellent and have an almost photo realistic            quality, with lush fairways, widely varying vegetation, and            excellent surroundings complete with buildings and spectators. You            really can sit back and admire the scenes as they unfold before            your eyes, being further enhanced by subtle animations such as            flocks of birds in the sky.                    The golfers' animations are also superbly done, with actual photo            captured imaging used to digitally recreate the swings, jubilation            and disappointment of various real-life players. Although these            look great, they can appear a little false and fuzzy around the            edges when set against some of the course backgrounds.                    Sound is really not something you look for within a golf game, but            what sound there is in Links 2001 does the job quite nicely. A neat            touch is the crowd murmuring right up until you go to play your            shot, at which point they quieten to near silence. The golfers also            make the odd comment, usually in appreciation of a shot you have            managed, or disgust at your ineptitude, but these can get on your            nerves very quickly.         If you like golf you simply have to have            Links 2001 in your collection; it plays a rockin' good round of            golf, and looks simply stunning into the bargain. The lack of free            movement in both setting up shots and camera views is very            frustrating at times, and goes some way to spoiling an otherwise            flawless game.                    With PC technology now becoming obscenely quick, it shouldn't be            too long before we're walking around Links style fairways in real            time using a proper first or third person view. Until then though,            Links 2001 should satisfy any golfing addict."}
