Still revered today for its insane twitch gameplay, it was            only a matter of time that those nostalgic types at Midway would            see the commercial potential in producing an update.                    Its transition from basic 2D scroller to a bells and whistles 3D            aerial combat game hasn't stopped it from retaining all the key            elements of the original, with the main core of the game still            revolving around fighting a horde of bug like alien invaders,            rescuing stranded humans.                    If said humans get captured, you get a brief chance to wrench them            back from their evil clutches by shooting the craft and collecting            them before they fall to their death, but otherwise they mutate            with the alien bug to become supercharged foes, intent on your            destruction.        But just doing that in waves of increasing difficulty (as in            the arcade) would be fundamentally dull and repetitive in this more            demanding age, so Midway has introduced a host of other sub            objectives to liven up the blastathon, including escorting drop            ships to their destination unharmed, deploying tanks to defend your            base and ensuring tank convoys make it to their destination.                    If you can imagine it, it's a bit like a defending a base in            Command & Conquer with a space ship (played in third person)            while under attack from swarms of alien ~buggers~ (we kid you not)            so if key pieces of your base get destroyed, it's Game Over.            Likewise, if aliens destroy your convoy's escape route (such as a            bridge, for example) then you will also fail. There are lots of            ways to fail. Make no mistake, Defender is a challenging little            pup, not unlike its grey bearded Arcade Dad, which if it were            released today would prompt howls of pain from wounded gamers            wondering why they get killed with one shot and have no continues.                    Predictably, in this day and age there's the usual pointless            introductory story, and even more pointless pieces of FMV to            justify why it is you're on some alien planet shooting giant            insectoids. Ehhhhh, when I were a lad, you just got on with            shooting stuff, as fast and furiously as possible. None of this            story telling lark. None of these gruff, butch American voiceovers            giving you orders. But to be fair, in ~my day~, the graphics were            utter utter rubbish, and the DVD extras give newbies a chance to            laugh at just how bad.        Which brings us neatly onto the subject of how well 2002's            version fairs in the visual grace department. Learned readers will            recall that in early 1998, Rage did a little show off non-game            called Incoming, which was (in all but name) a graphical demo for            the Voodoo 2. It's more or less on that quality level, and as such            does a tidy job of representing what you'd imagine it would be like            to pilot a spaceship around a rocky alien planet.                    And predictably, Midway has pinched a few of the good ideas that            were bolted onto its original template (by the likes of Konami with            its Nemesis series) and included not only multiple ships (each with            their own strengths and weaknesses), but multiple weapons (over 30            in total) and upgrades. Each mission scores you on how many rescues            you have performed, how many kills, deducts the mutations/deaths            and then you end up with credits which you can use to buy said            upgrades, as well as extra craft - for this is one of those rare            games that features that long forgotten concept: lives.                    As you progress you are rewarded with faster, stronger, more            manoeuvrable craft, and each comes fitted with its own unique            weapons by default, as well as a special weapon, e.g. hyperspace,            shields and the like, although sadly they soon run out, so sparse            usage is the order of the day.        With just three craft at your            disposal, you have to watch your shields a fair bit, although there            are handily placed health kits dotted around. Quite thoughtful            really, when you think about it. Shame they never thought of that            concept 22 years ago.                    Controls are fairly easy to get to grips with, employing a system            that mainly uses the left analog stick for movement, right stick            for 'stunts' (kind of a barrel roll evasive manoeuvre), R2 for            acceleration, L2 for brake, L1 and R1 for strafing, X for fire,            Square for weapon select, circle for ~special~, with various others            for map, target select and so on.                    The most alarming thing about your initial experiences of Defender            is that even with all the chances to stay alive (the health, the            shield, better weapons, etc) it's by no means an easy game. Playing            on the default 'Veteran' level and the average gamer would struggle            to find their way past level three. Dropping down to the more sane            'Rookie' level (as much as it pains us), is far more realistic, and            anyone attempting to play this for the first time would be well            advised not to try and be a hero - anything above Rookie will            result in repeated deaths.                    Even in Rookie mode it's a fair challenge, and will take a good            chunk your time to plough through - with 20 levels (more on the            Xbox and GameCube, so we hear) providing decent value for money            versus the more sparse and easy to romp through Star Wars:            Starfighter - its nearest competitor, genre wise.                    Throw in nice additions such as the two player mode, allowing for            some deathmatch action as well as some co-op, which admittedly            untested for the purposes of this review, has the potential to get            you through some of the tougher missions far more effectively.        However,            unlike the still excellent Starfighter it didn't really grab us to            any great extent, and doesn't strike us as the kind of game we            could be bothered to slog all the way to the end of. Visually it's            far superior, with a consistently busy frame rate, vastly improved            texturing, and some nice bug like character models (complemented by            some great boss monsters). Also the unintentional inclusion of the            word bugger, with no hint of irony, is something you'd have assumed            the localisation team would have, ahem, removed fairly early on in            testing. But then given that Defender has just slipped, we wouldn't            be surprised to find out that these alien critters are, in fact,            not rogering our backsides any longer in the European version.                    Defender is a fair stab at the aerial combat genre, but in the            context of the super-successful original, this update has only a            fleeting amount in common with its hardcore original, and certainly            will have none of the impact. After some of the incredibly diverse            and engaging games we've played recently, Defender feels fairly            old-skool and limp in comparison. It's doesn't have the adrenaline            fuelled action of the original, nor any neat new ideas to make it            feel like a progression. Defender is merely a few borrowed ideas            cobbled together and repackaged in new, but not especially sexy            clothes. It's the Marks & Spencer of shooters; it's good            quality, reliable, but entirely lacking innovation and just not            very exciting.
