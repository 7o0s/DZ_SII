{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-2-case-west-review", "date": "6 Jan 2011", "game_name": "Dead Rising 2: Case West", "text": "Dead Rising 2\u2019s playable prologue, Case Zero, was released at the end of August for 400 Microsoft Points, selling half a million copies by the end of September. Just four months later, its epilogue, Case West, arrives exclusively on 360 for double that cost. Austerity be damned: that\u2019s the price of progress, folks. I\u2019m only half-joking \u2013 because, while at roughly three hours for a single playthrough, Case West may only be the same size as Zero, it\u2019s also a step forward for the series; an add-on whose improvements to the zombie-splatting formula might well have bumped up its predecessor\u2019s Metacritic rating a few notches.It starts with a surprise \u2013 at least for those who got the \u2018best\u2019 ending for Dead Rising 2, as evidently Capcom is treating that game\u2019s Ending A (rather than the proper Overtime denouement) as canon. Professional Thomas Jane impersonator Chuck Greene is rescued from a future of moaning, shuffling and unusually protein-heavy dietary requirements by original protagonist Frank West, and the two set out to infiltrate a facility belonging to evil pharmaceutical nutjobs Umbrell- sorry, Phenotrans.Naturally, the factory setting isn\u2019t as visually interesting as the dilapidated Americana of Case Zero\u2019s Still Creek, but it\u2019s more fun to explore, not least because of the new weapons you\u2019ll find lying around. The sickle makes a welcome reappearance after its conspicuous absence from the second game, and it\u2019s just one of several new ingredients which Chuck can use to build a handful of fresh combo weapons. Dead Rising\u2019s combat system may seem inelegant at times, but when one swing of a deadly sickle/katana combo leaves an average of 12 bloody body parts scattered around your feet, you won\u2019t really care. And that\u2019s before we get onto Chuck\u2019s constructive (if medically inadvisable) use of a set of defibrillators and a metal tray.Despite being made available as a standalone release rather than DLC, Case West\u2019s story won\u2019t necessarily mean much to anyone who hasn\u2019t played the previous games. Case Zero\u2019s plot worked as a self-contained story as well as an intriguing lead-in to the events of Dead Rising 2, but here the significance of certain revelations \u2013 one in particular \u2013 requires a bit of foreknowledge. If you missed the first game, a quick Wiki flick is recommended. That said, there\u2019s some nice interplay between Chuck and Frank after their initial uneasy alliance. Again, the barmy plot is played totally straight-faced, which makes it all the more enjoyable to subvert. Chuck shaking his head at a particularly inept bluff from Frank is much funnier when one of our less-than-dynamic duo is wearing a shower cap and the other a mad scientist\u2019s hairdo. As an AI partner, Frank\u2019s almost a little too handy in the fight, steaming into kills with relish and providing more than ample backup when you\u2019re surrounded. Give him a half-decent weapon at the start and he\u2019s set for the rest of the game. Frank\u2019s return also means a return to the photography element of the original, though it\u2019s a little undercooked here, used purely to earn bonus Prestige Points by snapping special areas or objects within the facility."}
