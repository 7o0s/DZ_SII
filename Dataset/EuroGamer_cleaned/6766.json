Looking, sounding and feeling like            a bigger and better version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Inline will            be instantly familiar to both hardcore and casual fans of            Neversoft's extreme sports franchise. Like Street Fighter and Doom            before it, Tony Hawk has bred plenty of imitators, but will it be            able to maintain its position at the top of the pile by shrugging            off Z-Axis' latest contender, or is Mr. Hawk about to have his            wings clipped? Well, I'm hardly going to spill the beans in the            first paragraph, am I?                         Ignoring the team sheet of real-life inline skaters, because quite            frankly, no-one cares, I discovered that Aggressive Inline elbows            aside the laws of physics and lets you grind, jump and manual your            way through sprawling levels which make Tony Hawk's complement seem            puny. Although all the terminology has been switched around            (~fakie~ becomes ~cess slide~, for instance), the game was still            cast from the same mould - it's the tweaks and level design which            have made the difference. In a way, Aggressive Inline is what I            wanted from Tony Hawk 4.                         As usual there's a main Career mode alongside Freeskate and            multiplayer modes, and this kicks off with an arduous tutorial            level. The tutorial introduces you to a lot of Z-Axis' adjustments,            like the ability to right yourself in mid-air if you fly off the            end of a half-pipe and the ability to swing around poles, not to            mention my favourite: the chance somersault from low walls to keep            your momentum and trick tally going.                    Graphically Inline is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 taken to its obvious            conclusion, and Z-Axis' barefaced cheek extends to motion captured            breasts on the fictional females and half-inched male models with            their dumpy postures and trousers hanging down to their knees as            usual. The behaviour of garments is quite impressive, with shirts            and shorts flapping in the wind as you sail along. It's a shame            that the developer didn't concentrate on facial features and less            angular limbs at the expense of said bouncy bosoms and flapping            shirt tails, although the trade-off seems to have left the game            running at a high framerate, which is always appreciated.                         Levels are full of the same sort of geometry and texturing            witnessed in Tony Hawk's, although they are a lot larger, and a lot            more dynamic. By grinding a couple of chains in the first level you            knock down a boulder, which rolls around and destroys a bridge and            wall, opening up more grinding opportunities, and later on you'll            perform similar feats to let loose the likes of a propane tank,            which cannons around until it blows the ceiling off a nearby            factory. The game's seven main levels scale upwards as well, with            multiple platforms to traverse and plenty of aerial grinds, but            even without exploring the rafters they are by no means small.                         In fact the first level, which is pretty standard, is about five            times the size of the average Tony Hawk level. I was impressed by            the size of the city venue, but after a while I tired of grinding            flowerbeds and railings and went off in search of something else.            Before long I had unlocked a door and wandered onto a full-blown            movie set, which occupied about the same sort of space as two            regular Hawk levels, with half-pipes, ramps by the dozen and a set            packed with crooked trees, the banks of an artificial stream and            lighting rigs to grind.                    Levels aren't just big, either; they are designed with a healthy            serving of wit and intelligence. Throughout the game, I don't think            I encountered anything I would describe as wasted space. You can            almost always find a way to link your grinds and tricks to            something else, without fluking eternal manuals and other tenets of            big-scoring Tony Hawk combos, and there's more variety to the            spectacle, with flips, pole-swinging and other tricks spicing up            the typical grinds. Furthermore, you can actually trigger things in            some levels which unlock previously inaccessible areas earlier in            the game - a clever way of increasing replay value and adding yet            more to levels which already seem to stretch out into the distance.                         The usual laundry list of objectives awaits career skaters, but            in-keeping with the game's proportional advantage over the Hawk,            there are about five times as many as you might expect, and as            usual they all demand a certain skill to complete. Although they            don't vary too much - usually just requiring some audacious grind            or trick in a certain area - I certainly didn't mind. Aggressive            Inline is suitably addictive that you don't really pay attention to            what you're doing; completion becomes something of an            obsession. And those determined to explore every nook and cranny            will be going at it for weeks, because even when you have polished            off a level's various set tasks, there are tokens and other items            to collect to bring your level score up to 100 percent.                    Another gap in Tony Hawk's genetic make-up buffed over by Z-Axis is            the puzzling lack of reward for people who get really good at it.            Beyond high score objectives, the Tony Hawk series has thus far            offered little to those who could grind an entire level with their            eyes closed and pull off every trick in the book while they were at            it. As you get good at Aggressive Inline, pulling off more and more            tricks, grinds and so on, your stats for individual elements            improve, increasing your character's competency and allowing you to            concentrate on the more demanding aspects of a combination. This            progressive reward structure means that you will always be doing            yourself a favour by skating around, grinding this and that without            any real objective beyond playing the game, and I like that.                         While you won't spend forever unlocking the likes of Darth Maul            here, the longevity dwarfs the humble Birdman. With a better reward            structure and a sense of never really finishing the game, this is            likely to last you for a very long time. And that's before I get            onto the two-player split-screen modes, which feature numerous            activities ranging from best score and best trick contests to the            more obscure animal rescue and twenty-one-card pursuits. And if,            years down the line when you've polished the whole thing off, you            still feel a little cheated, why not fire up the park editor and            use the relatively simple toolset to build more arenas?                         The only area of Aggressive Inline which falls slightly short of            Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the soundtrack, and that's perhaps the            most subjective area of all. With the usual crop of samey American            alternative rock, hip hop and so on, you'll find nothing            surprising, although I was quite pleased to hear Sublime ringing            around my ears.                    I've mentioned Tony Hawk more than I've mentioned Aggressive Inline            today, and that's a mark of respect against the awesome            genre-domination of Neversoft's series. But the style has always            been distinctly imitable, and with Aggressive Inline, Z-Axis has            proved that there is still more fun, more depth and more            entertainment to be had out of the skating game template. Waiting            for Tony Hawk 4? Don't. Buy this, now."}
