Ever since the            enormous success of Rollercoaster Tycoon, many have jumped on the            strategy management bandwagon with a paraphrased moniker in an            attempt to get a piece of the action. Microsoft, never being one to            miss an opportunity, has skipped on board with Zoo Tycoon.                         Everything about Zoo Tycoon is familiar. From its feature list            down to the interface, this is cut-and-paste game development at            its most heinous. If you've played Rollercoaster Tycoon, you will            know what to expect in the way of park building and management            here. Simply replace the thrill rides and awe-inspiring custom            coasters with meandering animal sprites and piles of poop in your            mind's eye and you'll get the idea in a flash.                         Freeform mode gives you a fresh plot of land and a whole wad of            cash to do pretty much with as you please and construct your ideal            manure-scented world. Construction and item placement are simple            enough, and the chunky toy-town interface leaves the user with            little doubt as to what they are doing. However, to learn the true            nuances of keeping your animals and customers happy, you're better            off going the scenario route.                    The game's scenario mode kicks off with three tutorials to hold            your hand through navigating the park, placing amenities, adopting            animals, building paths and fences and so forth. Where the tutorial            is genuinely helpful is in teaching you how to make the animals            happy. The zoo will pretty much fail to function properly as a            business if the animals are unhappy, as this effect tends to rub            off on your customers and consequentially your reputation and            profits. The game contains an impressive wealth of information on            each of the animals so that you can customise their environments            down to a tee, and this generally forms the majority of tasks in            the game.                         Moving on from the tutorials you are given proper scenarios to            take on. In order to move on to the more advanced tasks and            subsequently unlock more animals, park amenities and tools for            creating ideal animal habitats, you have a list of objectives to            fulfil within a set time limit. The demands become increasingly            steep, but rarely stray from the routine of ~adopt animals, make            nice enclosures, keep them happy~. The early tasks are extremely            easy to complete, and the pace is generally less frantic than in            Zoo Tycoon's brethren.                         Unfortunately catering to the animals' tastes is usually a            tiresome regime of trial-and-error. Upon adopting an animal you can            consult a keeper on what the animal would like in its environment.            From there it's simply a case of fulfilling the items on his            checklist and balancing each of the items (such as more or less of            certain types of flooring or shrubbery) until the animal in            question is satisfied. This is fine to start with, but after a            while the routine begins to grind, and there's nothing more to            really grasp your interest. Constructing an awe-inspiring vista or            stunning safari range for your animals to roam and crap in hardly            compares to constructing your dream rollercoaster and grinning with            demented glee as the hapless punters are flung from their seats.                    Zoo Tycoon is such an innocent little game, it's practically            begging at me all doe-eyed to not say a bad word against it.            However, there are a few annoyances that make this startlingly            bland and simplistic experience a little more grating to play. The            first and most obvious niggle is with the viewpoint; there are two            zoom levels in the game, and both of them are really too far away            from the action. This makes the sprites extremely hard to see at            times, particularly at resolutions higher than the default.                         This is made worse by the bulky interface, which thinks nothing of            filling up your screen with unmovable windows, and in low            resolutions particularly you will run out of space far too quickly.            You can't scroll the viewing window when the interface is active            either, and a lot of time is wasted opening and closing the same            windows over and over again to perform a simple task. Combine this            with the trial-and-error nature of creating suitable habitats, and            what should be a simple task becomes an unwelcome chore.                         I don't think you're going to need convincing that Zoo Tycoon            looks extremely tired. Modern computer technology can obviously do            better than the isometric sprite-based engine used here, and why            Blue Fang decided to shoot themselves in the foot like this is            anyones guess. Because of the distanced viewpoint and            two-dimensional environment you never really feel like you care            about the animals or want to watch them play, especially since you            can't see them properly half the time.                    The audio lends little to the atmosphere either. The main offering            is a looping generic crowd noise which quickly becomes hypnotic,            and this is interspersed with the odd flushing portaloo or            breathless ~Wow!~ from a satisfied customer as he stands watching a            polar bear swim about aimlessly.                         Once you're through with the scenarios, there's really very little            reason for you to come back and play Zoo Tycoon. The free            construction mode can wear thin extremely quickly once you run out            of space - research into new toys for your captives to prod and            staring at them crapping up a tree doesn't really appeal to the            majority of gamers I should imagine. Not even the monkeys provide            as much entertainment as they should, and I mean .. come on,            they're monkeys! Updates via the web will provide new            scenarios, animals and kit to drop into your zoos, but that is            likely to offer limited appeal in the long-run.                         While initially charming, Zoo Tycoon finds it extremely hard to            maintain your interest for more than a few hours, due to its            unrelenting focus on micro-management and interface problems. It            could well be a good Christmas diversion for your kids, but the            average gamer expecting frantic Rollercoaster Tycoon-style            management will be sorely disappointed."}
