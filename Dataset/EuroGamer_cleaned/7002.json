Enter ~Quake III : Team Arena~, an extravagant new add-on            pack from id which is designed to do for teamplay what Quake III            did for deathmatch, while giving the game a much needed overhaul.                    The first improvement you will spot on loading the game is the new            interface, replacing the traditionally primitive id menus of yore            with a new all-singing all-dancing video-laden system for the 21st            century. It takes a few seconds to load up, but it certainly looks            a whole lot prettier than the old menus and makes the game that bit            easier to use. There is also a new in-game drop-down menu system            which allows you to change many settings and give orders to other            players without needing to memorise a lengthy list of undocumented            console commands. Even the drab old heads-up display has been            drastically redesigned. Which is nice.                    Not so welcome are the new player models - ~Janet~ and ~James~ -            which are every bit as exciting as their names imply. Each comes            with a selection of interchangeable heads and different team skins            for each of the five ~clans~ in the game, but as almost every            server in the world is using the default settings you will only            ever see a handful of the possible combinations. The other two            (rather more interesting) new models, Fritzkrieg and Pi, are only            available in one-on-one matches, which is a wasted opportunity. All            of the models are also accompanied by new vocal taunts, which are            even less amusing than the already pretty dire ones included in the            original game, and sound like they were recorded by the staff and            their friends after a few beers.                    The real meat is in the four new gameplay modes, which can all be            played on any of the sixteen teamplay maps included in the pack. As            well as your basic Capture The Flag there is a ~One Flag CTF~ mode            which involves capturing a lone flag from the center of the map and            carrying it to the enemy base to score.                    A variation on this is ~Harvester~ mode, which is strangely            reminiscent of the ~Headhunter~ mod. Whenever a player is killed an            appropriately coloured translucent skull pops up at the goal area            in the middle of the map. If you run over an enemy skull you pick            it up, while any friendly skulls you touch will instantly            disappear, making controlling this area vital. Once you have one or            more skulls in tow you simply carry them to the goal point in the            enemy base to capture. Small games are essentially futile, but with            enough players this can be quite fun.                    Finally there is ~Overload~, in which you must blow up an obelisk            located in the enemy base to score. This is harder than it sounds,            as the obelisk can take a ridiculous amount of damage and gradually            regenerates health. Again, small games are really a waste of time            as both teams simply stand in their opponent's base seeing who can            blow up the obelisk fastest, but with enough players it is the most            interesting mode on offer.                    All of the modes support a range of four runes, but these tend to            unbalance the game. The Doubler rune doubles the amount of damage            you cause, meaning that a single glancing rocket blow is enough to            kill most people. At the other extreme Guard regenerates your            health, making you almost impossible for a lone player to kill.            Ammo Regen does exactly what it says on the tin, while Scout makes            you run and fire incredibly fast but prevents you from using            armour. Needless to say, if you don't manage to grab one of your            team's supply of runes when you spawn you will find yourself            struggling to survive in an increasingly violent world.                    Accompanying these new modes are a selection of new items, weapons            and maps. The chaingun from Doom and Quake II makes a return,            ripping through flesh up close but chewing up ammo rapidly and            making little impact at long range. The nailgun is also back, but            in the form of a rehashed shotgun rather than the rapid firing            weapon from Quake. Finally there is the nasty proximity mine            launcher, which allows you to leave mines splattered all over your            base, ready to detonate as soon as an enemy strays nearby. Highly            annoying, although they do at least blow themselves up after a            while to prevent a player with an ammo regen rune from smothering            the entire map in the damn things.                    On the power-up side there is a new ~invulnerability~ item, which            freezes you to the spot when activated but surrounds you with an            impenetrable barrier, essentially turning you into a human turret            for a short time. Also included is the kamikaze, which creates a            massive spectacular explosion when used, blowing you up but taking            anybody else in the neighbourhood with you. Often you will see            people run into the enemy base and detonate it, killing all of the            defenders instantly. Obviously rather irritating if you are on the            receiving end of one, but strangely satisfying to use.                    The maps themselves are a mixed bunch, and four of the sixteen            teamplay maps on offer are simply revamped versions of the old            Q3CTF maps, with new items added along with extra bounce pads and            tunnels to accommodate more players. There is even a remixed            teamplay version of the horrible Q3Tourney6. At the other end of            the scale are three vast outdoors maps using id's new terrain            technology to great effect, almost getting into ~Tribes~ territory.            Even the eight brand new indoors maps are large and labyrinthine            compared to the old ones, and id are obviously trying to support            larger games.                    And this is the game's biggest problem at the moment. The sad truth            is that a week after its European release and a month after its            American debut nobody is playing Team Arena online. Even on a            fairly good day you will find around 500 players scattered across            150 servers, and when you look closely you will discover that many            of these players are actually bots left by the server ops to pad            out the numbers when there aren't enough humans around.                    Only a handful of servers have more than half a dozen players on            them at any one time, and the new maps are so huge that you can            easily go for an entire minute without even seeing a member of the            enemy team. Then when you do find one the chances are that one of            you will be dead within a matter of seconds. Needless to say this            isn't much fun, and the fact that most of the gameplay modes            completely break down when there are less than three players on            each team just makes things even worse. The sheer scale of the maps            also means that the system requirements have shot up. I used to get            a steady 60 frames per second in even the wildest Quake 3            deathmatch, but with the same settings my frame rate languishes at            around 20fps on some of the new Team Arena maps, even when they are            virtually empty.                    Although bots are included, and the AI has supposedly been given an            overhaul to improve team work, a quick session with some bots on            the ~hurt me plenty~ difficulty level proved disappointing. In a            ten minute game I only died once, and that was due to an            unfortunate accident involving a rocket launcher and a brick wall.            In that time I captured the flag five times, and never once did I            see any of my opponents even trying to chase me and recover their            flag. Meanwhile your team mates completely ignore orders (whinging            that ~I want to attack~ all the time and leaving the flag            undefended) and are totally uncoordinated (running into the enemy            base one after the other when trying to recover the flag, and            getting gunned down en masse in the process). Bot play is no            substitute for the real thing, and even the unremarkable            championship mode included in Quake III has been stripped out for            Team Arena - you simply pick any map and mode, load it with bots            and hit the big red button. Deeply uninspiring.                    Team Arena is something of a mixed bag. The graphics are great but            come at a high cost, the new weapons and items are amusing but            encourage random kills, and the maps are stunning but far too big            for the number of people playing the game at the moment. As the            single player mode is such a dead loss it's hard to recommend Team            Arena until more people are playing it online, which is something            of a Catch 22 situation.                    Things are particularly bad for Europeans, as the most heavily            populated servers are all based in the USA, leaving us stuck in            nearly empty servers or facing higher trans-Atlantic pings. Team            Arena certainly has potential and it can be a lot of fun at times,            but right now it's just not worth the rather excessive \u00a320            asking price.                        -        Quake III :                    Arena reviewQuake III :                    Arena review"}
