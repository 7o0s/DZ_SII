So, before I get started, I            would like to rub the slate clean here and declare that Zelda isn't            cel-shaded in the traditional sense. It's an interactive cartoon.            For a start, one fairly regular feature of cel-shaded games is a            thick, black line surrounding just about everything, and I didn't            spot any such black lines. Secondly, the character design and            environments are very much like those from Zelda III, except in            three dimensions, and viewed from above and behind.                        Link is back to his childish self, with big eyes and pupils, floppy            hair and childish behaviour, like hopping up and down in the manner            of an excited school kid after defeating a boss character. NPCs are            also well designed; in particular the old timer who teaches Link            how to fight. As Link lands horizontal, vertical and downward            thrusting blows the old bloke measures and blocks them clearly and            precisely. Everything seems incredibly solid, and collision            detection is of the utmost importance in sustaining a cartoon            world, as any designer will tell you.                         Starting my session with the game knee-deep in blades of grass and            slashing through them, I could imagine viewing the thing from above            on my SNES all those years ago. Grass sways back and forth here            though, water splashes and froths, dust is kicked up and haze rises            from fiery craters. The transition to GameCube coupled with the            decision to use this cartoon approach has given Shigeru Miyamoto's            team the opportunity to play to the hardware instead of fighting            for framerate. As such, boss characters are enormous, huge rolling            vistas stretch for as far as the eye can see and ships bob            frantically in the deep blue of the ocean, with details on islands            and in the water visible from hundreds of metres away.                    The presentation and animation means that far from just looking            like a cartoon in still shots, The Legend of Zelda is very much a            Saturday morning cartoon in feel. The scene in our demo, with Link            arriving at a mysterious island in a pirate ship, is a good            example. His two accomplices encourage him to step into a barrel            and be hurled from a cannon into the complex to avoid detection,            and you get to see a nervous Link flinch as the fuse is lit, grit            his teeth as the countdown begins, gawp as he leaves his friends            miles behind him, and then frown wearily as the barrel hits a tower            and he falls into the dock.                         Other touches which add to the game's cartoon credentials include            a clever three-tone darkness and shadow effect, leaving Link's            tunic bright in the foreground, shady in the middle and dark away            from camera. Of course, shadows can be cast across him too, which            is doubtless to be used to dramatic effect in typical Miyamoto            fashion later on. And as the GameCube is a fairly powerful little            box, it's given Miyamoto and his team the chance to play with new            effects. The aforementioned heat haze is wonderful, most noticeable            in the demo's boss fight, but there are also explosions, with            streams of light issuing forth like spotlights and big circular            waves of fire expanding from the centre, and all manner of other            buzzwordable concoctions born of somebody's creative imagination.                         However, at this stage I really want to tell you about the boss            fight. Zelda fans are used to big bosses, but this chap is easily            more than a hundred times your size, occupying a lake of fire in a            cavern. Curiously, a dragon's tail can be seen above him, belonging            unsurprisingly to the dragon sunning itself atop the mountain - and            who can blame him on such a hot day? The chap below seems to like            the heat though. In fact, he's almost entirely composed of fire by            the looks of things. His exoskeleton makes attack pointless, but            you can see his hot, throbbing lava innards in a couple of places,            and sure enough, by ticking off the dragon above (swinging from his            tail does the trick), you can cause huge slabs of rock to drop down            and gradually flakes of exoskeleton will disappear, until he's            almost completely exposed. At this point he gets angry, slapping            down his pincers and breathing fire at you, leaving just enough            time for you to roll hastily beneath his arm and escape. It's such            a wonderful encounter, but it's over in less than five minutes once            you get the hang of it, suggesting to us at least that this isn't            even a major boss. And that bodes very well indeed.                    Naturally The Legend of Zelda has to be far more than just a pretty            picture. The story behind the game is quite sensibly shrouded in            mystery at this stage, but we do know that Link is on a mission to            rescue his sister Arilla, who was plucked from him by a bird as the            game begins. Some sections of the press have even suggested that            Arilla could be the friend alluded to in the tale of Majora's Mask,            Link's second N64 adventure, but despite ties to Majora, his first            outing on the GameCube is very much in the style of Ocarina of            Time.                         The most obvious parallels lie in the combat system. Link can            still make horizontal and vertical slashes and perform his            signature downward thrust, and automatic jumping and so on are back            as well, but on top of that Link can now sidle up against walls,            peep round corners like a wannabe Solid Snake, and much more. In            the full game, we're promised a number of sword techniques to be            learnt throughout (and even some spells), but most of this is            absent at this stage. However, Miyamoto was good enough to give us            a go with Link's charging attack, particularly useful in his role            as an eco-warrior, which, despite what you might think, means that            he wants to hack down trees, bushes, grass and just about            everything else from the plant kingdom.                        Once Link's sword glows bright orange he can unleash a devastating            tornado-style attack, sword outstretched, completely under your            control, and take out anything in his path and about a metre on any            side of him. This being Zelda though, it isn't long before you spot            the balance, and in this case, once halted, this            spinning-top-of-pure-destruction is so puffed out he has to stop            and catch his breath, leaving him exposed to retaliation. Although            not from plants, obviously.                    The control system is typically intuitive and intelligently            designed. The Z-lock is replaced by essentially similar            L-targeting, while the R trigger handles your shield and the A            button is used for swiping people with your sword. The B button's            functionality changes depending on the situation though; in battle,            Link can often jump out of the way of attacks or roll beneath            sharpened pincers, whereas in other situations (for instance, if            you fancy pushing a block around) you can sheath your sword with            it, or talk to an NPC, or something along those lines. The Y button            also has a set task - the hookshot. Your eyes just lit up, I can            tell. Yes, the hookshot is back, and of course you can swing across            lava pits and latch onto anything, as long as it has what can only            be described as a ~POW!~ box over it. You tap Y once to target,            then once again to fire. Simplicity itself.                         In another nice touch, you can also now pick up weapons dropped by            your recently deceased enemies. Having spent some time playing            Drakan lately, that one really cheered me up. Cleverly, weapons            dropped are only limited-use, so when you knock down a nasty fellow            with a big club, you have just enough blows at your disposal to            carve your way through a heavy-set wooden door - something you            otherwise wouldn't be able to accomplish.                         Rounding off our experience with The Legend of Zelda, it seems            worth mentioning Epona's spiritual successor: Link's boat. This            cute little sailing boat shows up in a mini-game, where you have to            race around the beautifully realised ocean collecting as many            Rupees as possible. Typical Zelda, typically enjoyable, and typical            in its execution of the quality of the experience, even at this            early stage.                    It seems clear that Shigeru Miyamoto has stayed true to the            principles of the Zelda series instead of attempting to            revolutionise it with throwaway gimmicks. Some people will still            complain about the cartoon approach, but to be blunt, once you've            seen it in motion you would have to want to not like it to            find it disagreeable. Furthermore, although some people will            complain that the story (Link living happily, life disrupted by the            abduction of his sister, etc) is rather shallow, clich\u00e9d and            unbecoming of the series, this is a work in progress, and you just            have to look at all these journalists backtracking on their            outraged editorials about cel-shading to see why I've got every            faith in Nintendo to produce something worthy of the Zelda name.            Based on my experience with Legend Of Zelda, we won't be            disappointed."}
