I can't stand it anymore:the guilt, the lies, the anxious covering up. You see I've had anaffair... with Paris Hilton.It started out simply enough. She caught my eye, I got her on myphone, we spent a little time together. Then it got more serious.She asked me to join her on a jaunt around the world - to NewYork, Rio, London, Sydney, Tokyo, all her favourite party towns.Truth is, I never even got to see any of the cities inquestion.It was all thanks to Paris' insatiable desire for gems. Shejust adores the glitter: diamonds, emeralds, topaz, sapphires, andone is never enough. I had to line up at least three in a row tomake her happy, swapping them around on a huge grid until thosethat had lined up would disappear into her bag, only to be replacedby another handful from the top of the screen.I didn't mind doing it to be honest. The basic task seemedpretty simple and the experience was as fun as it was hectic.Combination chains, special power-ups for connecting four or moreand plenty of flashing lights added a real glitzy feel to the jewelsorting cocktail and the gems kept on flowing like the Moet Chandonon a night out with Nicci.Besides, each level only took a couple of minutes. At first,anyway - the further we went, the more demanding Paris becameand the more jewels were required to satisfy her.I suppose I should have seen the warning signs, but I couldn'tstop. She'd got me hooked on gem collecting and whenever I startedto flag she'd lead me on with flirty remarks, smiling pictures andpromises of rewards. She'd even try different things to keep thegem collecting interesting, such as memory tests, puzzles, orhiding the letters of her name behind certain tiles. There musthave been about six different types of challenge she'd set me onour trip, with another four styles unlocked and awaiting me when wegot back home.My friends tried to help. They said I was being ridiculous, thatshe was too young for me, that our relationship was just a casualthing. They argued that Paris was too simple, that she couldn'toffer me a sustained challenge. To an extent they were right.Whilst other girls play more complex and unforgiving games (myfling with i-Play's Jewel Quest was far more taxing), it was almost impossible to lose at Diamond Quest. Paris was never particularly tough with hertime limits, and even when I ran out of possible tiles to swap, shewould just shuffle the board.What's more, with just six different colours of gems and noperceivable increase in difficulty between levels (other thanhaving to collect more) the test became one of endurance ratherthan intelligence.But for a week or so, Paris was just such good fun I didn't care- she'd hooked me and I couldn't give up. Once I'd finishedher tasks the first time, I completed them all again to ensure I'dcollect extra tokens of her affection. Heck, I even dedicated threetube journeys to finishing the bonus game 'Diamonds are Forever',collecting 10,000 gems.By this stage, though, the white heat of passion had burned out.The last few encounters were very much a case of going through themotions, and I knew the affair was over. I pledged to stay intouch, and maybe I will spend the odd five minutes on a trainedging towards the final remaining goal of collecting 5,000 of eachgem.Then again, maybe I won't.I've moved on, but I'll never forget the intense week we spenttogether. She was everything I wanted in a mobile encounter -fun, bubbly, easy to get into - and when we were together thetime just flew by."}
