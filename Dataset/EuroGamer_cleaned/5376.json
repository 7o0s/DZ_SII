Set over the course of three days in an area called            Rokkotsu Pass, the player is cast as a ronin, a wandering samurai            without a master on a quest for adventure and, well, profit.        It all kicks off as            your afro-endowed ronin happens across a few nasty fellows shaking            down a young lady on a bridge. Your choices here are endless -            interject and frighten off the lunatics and you may find yourself            invited round for tea, but kill a couple of the varmints and she'll            be frightened witless. Of course, if you have a mean streak, you            can always join in and make some friends on the wrong side of the            law, but that's probably ill-advised - you'll be spending three            days in Rokkotsu Pass, and fighting the valiant cause will yield            more treats.                    This is a theme which runs throughout the game. Each situation can            be treated in any way you choose, which is a breath of fresh air in            itself - most PS2 games set you on the straight and narrow and            scold you for deviating in the slightest - and your moral alignment            affects not only the things you'll do, but also the way you're            treated, the people you meet and even the things they'll do for            you. You have to treat it as you might treat real life, (but            handily without the toilet breaks). For example, your trusty blade            needs tempering now and then, which the local blacksmith is only            too happy to do, but if you can't pay him he'll pick a fight and            will probably end up dead, cutting off your various weapon upgrade            paths completely. So, just as you wouldn't order a pizza if you            didn't have any cash, you shouldn't ask for something in WotS if            you can't pay for it.                    Graphically Way of the Samurai could be a lot better, even on the            PS2, and at times it looks very much like it belongs on Sony's last            console. The character models are unpleasantly chunky, and since            they all wear floppy robes from ankle to ear the distinct lack of            animation is quite disconcerting, even if the combat animations are            uniformly excellent. The environment suffers from the same old            school feel. Rokkotsu Pass isn't too large a place, and the fields,            hills and trees are all fairly blocky and the textures of quite a            low quality. That said, certain objects are suitably rugged and            well drawn - the bridge at the start of the game, for example,            could quite easily be made of wood, and, credit to the designers,            the matte of glaringly aliased grass matter does look sufficiently            rough. Whether or not that's deliberate is debatable, but it does            help.        Combat is a central element            of the game, and as you might expect from the team that brought you            Tenchu II, it's pretty well realised. You need to quickly master            blocking, parrying and offensive attacks, and there are hundreds to            pick from and utilise. You get better with each successful blow,            but mashing the same button over and over renders you both            predictable and out of moves before you know it. After all, you            can't expect to thrust your sword twenty times in succession            without running out of ways to better your technique. Using a            varied arsenal of attacks will not only dispatch enemies quicker,            but also better your overall technique.                    Way of the Samurai does suffer from one glaring flaw though, and it            will probably be enough to put a lot of you off your hacking and            slashing. Sadly, the control system is unforgivably cumbersome, and            although you'll play the game several times through without really            repeating your steps too often, it's that first time which should            be most memorable, and you spend the whole of the three or so hours            simply arguing with the game's mechanics. Targeting a large number            of enemies is far too much like hard work, and with groups as large            as five or six, that's going to take its toll quickly. The camera            doesn't help, seemingly ducking into objects whenever it can, and            although you do get the hang of it and learn to avoid close            encounters in tight spaces, that shouldn't be the way it works.                    The rest of the game is also let down by some truly hopeless            dialogue and compounded by diabolical voice acting, which feels a            little awkward at times. Head into battle after a long monologue            from a thug or corrupt government official and they'll yelp            incoherently as you slice and dice their worthless hind -            satisfying in itself, but a bit puzzling. The audio side of things            is quite memorable however, with a nice blend of ambient music to            accompany the constant wandering from spot to spot, and a pleasant            battle theme borne of traditional Japanese instruments rather than            rock heavy guitar riffs or wannabe marching anthems.                    Way of the Samurai is a short game, but it boasts a lot of replay            value. If your goal is simply to clear it, then you might as well            pick something else up off the shelf, but if you can stomach a few            loose ends and some sub-cartoon dialogue, you'll find a decent            amount of value and entertainment in the latest Fresh Games title            from Eidos. And unlike the last pair, this one really is fresh, and            really is worth owning in most respects."}
