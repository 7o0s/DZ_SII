What with This is Football 2002 in Sony's corner and EA's            massive FIFA Football 2002, Konami have their work cut out for them            this Christmas. But they really shouldn't worry - Pro Evolution            Soccer is without a doubt the best football game on any console.            Ever.                         (Okay, maybe not better than Sensi, but give me a break.)                         Ignore the less than authoritative database of player names, team            names and strips, the lack of player endorsements and other            paraphernalia, and the silly little oversights like the 'Europian            Cup': PES is the only game out there that actually feels            like football at the moment, and not some sort of bizarre            combination of ballet and opera. Yes we're looking at you now, EA.            PES captures the spirit of the game, and by the time you're passing            the ball about in midfield and threading dainty through-balls            between defenders, the lacklustre presentation will be long since            forgotten.                         There are a number of things that set PES apart from the likes of            FIFA in its approach to the beautiful game. FIFA has long been the            home of extravagant trick moves like Cruyff turns, overhead kicks            and ridiculous shimmies. PES has a close control mode, activated by            R2, that lets you perform trick moves but they require split-second            timing to execute. In other words, you need skills. Another thing            that sets the game apart from its competition is its approach to            goalscoring. In games like FIFA it's pretty damn easy to score from            any position goalside of the centre circle by hammering the sprint            key and twiddling your player every which way past opponents, but            if you score in PES it's because you deserved to score. Slotting a            through-ball into empty space demands that you have created some            empty space ahead of time, and shooting is completely unassisted -            you have to get the angle, height and power behind the shot            absolutely right. Other games may have dabbled with power bars, but            I defy you to name even one that offers as much control over your            actions as Pro Evolution Soccer.                    The problem with games like FIFA is that the goalscoring and            general play is completely unrealistic. The ball never travels in a            straight line, and seems to move on a network of curved ramps in            the air, particularly when you hit one from the edge of the box.            PES asks that you fight for every ball, jostling for position and            that if you want your striker to get on the end of a cross, you do            not simply hold the directional pad goalwards and hit shoot when            the ball arrives, you have to wait calmly in position and judge            when and where to direct the ball. All in a split-second.                         The control system is definitely the best of any footy title this            writer has played. The analogue stick controls movement, with L1            switching to the nearest player to the ball and R1 initiating the            sprint mode. Sprinting obviously gives you a better chance of            getting away from opponents, but it also makes it more difficult to            keep control of the ball. Defying convention, PES also has a button            for tracking back. If a player on the opposing team gets the ball,            you need not spend the next two minutes flustering over you            inability to direct an appropriate offscreen player in his            direction, a simple button press has you following your opponent at            full pace so you can concentrate on a sensible challenge for            possession. Giving an opposition player a hard time is often enough            to force an error - one of my favourites is forcing a player to the            by-line then watching them fall in an attempt to cross the ball,            instead slicing it into the stands.                         PES also has more advanced techniques - I'm still trying to get            the hang of a lot of them - you can play lofted through-balls,            bring your keeper out to deal with an onrushing striker and plenty            more. You are unlikely to run out of things to do and see.                    While the game is packed with play modes, the interface is pretty            dire. It's the usual black screen affair with functional menus and            none of the rockstar glitz of FIFA or TIF 2002. You can customize            your players if their names really get on your nerves, but there            are a certain amount of licensed players in the game anyway,            including the all-important England team (with apologies to our            continental readers.) As you may recall, Konami had access to            Sports Interactive's Championship Manager player database to sort            out player statistics, so if the game's depiction of the            fleet-footed David Beckham or the lumbering Emile Heskey seems            surprising accurate, you have SI to thank. You can also customize            cups, leagues and other tournaments within the interface, although            several are already built in, including the aforementioned            'Europian Cup'. Ugh.                         As I mentioned at the beginning of the review, it's the game's            presentation overall which lets it down. The interface is only one            aspect, with the in-game commentary another. The choice of Chris            James and Terry Butcher is an odd one to begin with, but the number            of broken sentences and mistakes they tot up between them would be            comical if it weren't so sad. Chris James often just seems to yell            out a random team name enthusiastically, and then stop for a few            seconds before carrying on with ~'s throw!~ I had to turn it off to            preserve my sanity.                         Another issue I have with the game is Konami's decision to            implement a sort of luck factor. When you pick up a ball, there is            a chance that you will mess up your first touch, which is fair            enough on paper and pretty realistic, but in practice it's            extremely annoying. The referee and linesmen (sorry, referee's            assistants) also make a lot of unlikely decisions, with my outrage            often vindicated by the action replay.                    Visually Pro Evolution Soccer is a bit of a mixed bag. It looks            pretty good from a distance, but up close it's clear that the game            lacks a lot of the clarity and finesse of its main competitor, FIFA            Football 2002. The nets don't really bulge realistically, the            player models and skins are average, the advertising boards look            cheap and the crowd is pretty cartoonish. FIFA isn't much better in            that respect, but still. On the whole I was fairly nonplussed by            the presentation and visuals in PES, which are passable in my            opinion, with a few noteworthy exceptions. Firstly, the game's            complement of stadia are all lavishly detailed, so that in the run            up to a game as you watch the incessant parades and flag-waving you            get a decent eyeful. Beyond that, I would class the players'            animation as a real triumph. The fact that you will be able to            distinguish players by their body language is truly remarkable, and            players really lunge for the ball and hurdle challenges            realistically. It's something FIFA has tried to achieve            unsuccessfully for the last several revisions, however pretty            everything looks.                         Gameplay is definitely king with Pro Evolution Soccer, so it's            unsurprising to see a healthy complement of multiplayer options.            Ideally you will want to encourage a like-minded chum to pick this            up at about the same time, because proper two player games are            completely gripping. This is a game where a nil-nil draw can be a            hair-raising experience... in single-player. Nothing gets            the blood pumping quite as much as a two player bout of Pro Evo.            For me, it's like watching England vs. Scotland in a small room            with a Scotland fan.                         Pro Evolution Soccer is definitely a football fan's game. While            FIFA may be enjoyable, it lacks the realism of PES, which despite            its flaws is undoubtedly the superior title. If you can put up with            the shifty interface, somewhat uninspiring visuals and dire            commentary, you're in for a treat. Beneath the surface, PES is the            best football there is, and deserves a place in any gamer's            collection."}
