But unlike the fiery            wrath of a deity, this is something that the average Joe or Theo            looks forward to. With a rich pedigree in the strategy-building            field, Impressions' titles usually pick up much critical acclaim,            and thankfully Zeus is no exception.                    Anyone familiar with the strategy titles of the last few years will            recognise Zeus very quickly; its isometric display and city-based            strategy mirror the earlier games of the series such as ~Caesar~            and ~Pharaoh~. This is, of course, no bad thing, the previous games            being amongst the leaders in their chosen field. But while Zeus            retains the city building and management elements of the previous            games, it replaces the elaborate temple and pyramid building of            Pharoah with hero-driven campaigns and mythological encounters,            with a little bit of armed combat for good measure.                    But while games like the ~Age of Empires~ series are            combat-centric, with economic facets included as an afterthought,            Zeus definitely takes the opposite approach. The combat can be            described as cumbersome at best, and maddening at worst. Since            there is no drag selection option or any decent hotkey setup for            combat, you find yourself furiously clicking between your unit's            standard at the palace - the only way to reliably select troops -            and where you want them to gather. After a period of deliberation,            the little soldiers comply, by which time the opposing army is            probably already halfway down the road with your amphorae...                    Thoughtfully Impressions have included an auto-combat feature this            time round, which offers the chance to let the AI control your            various battalions, but sadly it is fairly unreliable. The first            time I tried it I found my troops mooching around the southern wall            of my city discussing the relative merits of Cypriot olives over            mainland ones, as the invaders let themselves in around 500 paces            away to the right, slaying little water-carriers and philosophers            left, right and kentron.                    Then again, Zeus never set out to win any awards for its combat            features - it's the city management where this game really shines.            And shine it does. Like the most complex of Greek wines, it's an            expert blend of styles and flavours.                    Your people desire a large array of merchandise; food, wine,            fleece, pottery, sculptures and weapons can all be sold at your            city's Agoras. Of course, these valuable commodities don't come out            of thin air, you will need to either produce or import them. The            number of possibilities for keeping the resources balanced is            staggering. Find some decent farmland and you can plant olive            groves or grapes for wine, rear goats for cheese and sheep for            wool, or grow root vegetables or corn.                    Water has to be extracted from fountains and then distributed            accordingly, and clay and marble can be manufactured into pottery            and sculptures, while bronze and silver mines must be constructed            to keep your mints and armouries in business. If your surroundings            are rocky and don't lend themselves to farming, trade routes can be            established by land and sea to import and export as you see fit,            swelling or depleting your city's drachma reserves. It's imperative            to keep your little Hellenic people stocked with all the materials            they need for a happy, healthy life, so that they can serve as            workers or soldiers. The task of building, managing and maintaining            is thoroughly engrossing, and although the missions are hard and            time consuming, you will barely notice the hours fly past.                    But tangible objects alone can't keep your city satisfied. Pursuits            of the body, soul and mind are needed if your city wants to rank            top dog in ancient Greece. Drama schools and colleges must be built            to supply your Theatres and Podiums with budding thespians and            philosophers, to keep the intelligence of your populace high.                    For the more physically-minded, Gymnasiums can be built to supply            your arenas with competitors to run around and wrestle naked. The            elite of Greek society can be entered into annual tournaments for            any of the three artistic disciplines, and of course the main event            of the year will judge your city in all three. Winning these            tournaments rewards your city with obelisks that can be erected            anywhere in town, boosting the appeal of the local area. These            staples of Greek society lend a feeling of authenticity to the game            that is both refreshing and impressive.                    In keeping with the spirit of Ancient Greece, all of the campaigns            available are based upon events from Greek mythology. You can            follow eight different campaigns through Greek history, varying            from the adventures of Jason and his Argonauts to the construction            of Athens. Furthermore, a lot of the missions involve the summoning            of a Greek hero such as Hercules to aid you in battle. The hero            will only help you if you meet various criteria, like getting            enough resources, winning Olympic games, or acheiving a certain            population. However, upon completing these goals, the hero will            proceed to smite any Minotaur, Harpy or whatever it is that has            been making your city's life a living Hades for the last few            months, and everyone goes home happy with a crate of Athenian wine.                    The whole game has a most polished feel to it, with the isometric            2D view suiting the game very well. Resisting the common trend of            switching to a 3D engine, Impressions persevered with a similar            interface to the previous games in the series, with great results.                    Guards stroll, actors stride, and all the other people in the city            move and interact with buildings with great detail. Each building            has its own animations, such as the stomping of olive pressers or            the exertion of gladiators. Warehouses and granaries raise and            deplete stock levels, their wares visible for a quick check on            resources. Above all, it is strangely uncluttered for a 2D game,            and if you are having trouble finding something you can rotate the            camera four ways, enabling those hard-to-reach ghettoes of the city            to get the care they deserve.                    The sound is yet another great feature. Right click on a worker on            the street and you will get a little soundbite of what he or she            thinks of your city. My personal favourite is clicking a guard            during quiet times. He says, in a cool-as-a-cucumber American cop            accent, ~Unrest in my city? Shut yo' mouth! Things are peaceful            here!~. The various little bits of local colour had me actively            seeking out citizens to hear what they had to say. The only let            down in the audio department is the music during menu scenes and so            on, which is for the most part generic strategy fare, although            tolerable. But with such an excellent game to backup the            superficial, it's not a big deal.                    As is to be expected from this series, Impressions have struck gold            yet again with an updated strategy classic. If you are not a            strategy fan by nature you will probably still love the city            building aspect in Sandbox mode, where you can build to your            heart's content. And for the genre enthusiast, there is more than            enough to keep you entertained for the long haul.                    If you are looking for a festive thinker to play in between            consuming copious amounts of booze, this will be ideal, although I            wouldn't recommend playing it with a hangover. A thoroughly            addictive, engrossing game that ranks among my top five for this            year.                        -        Pharaoh                    reviewPharaoh                    review"}
