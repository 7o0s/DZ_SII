Exient, the Oxford based developer of            FIFA 2003 GBA got in touch and asked: ~ah, but have you played our            rather lovely game?~ to which we replied ~No! EA never got around            to sending us that~, and two days later - as if by some kind of            strange devil magic - said game was winging its way through our            letterbox with a \u00a350 note attached to the box*. Nice touch.                    * Not really.                    Yes, we know FIFA's been out for a couple of months now, but we're            quite sure that very few of you know whether it's any good. And the            reason we're so sure is that the normally noisy EA slipped out its            first ever FIFA GBA title with absolutely no fanfare at all, and as            of a month ago, it had sold a meagre 15,000 copies, which when you            consider there are 1.5 million GBA owners in the UK is precisely            sod all. However, this is hardly surprising while Nintendo insists            on charging up to \u00a335 for the games, when the ~real thing~ is            often standing on a shelf three feet away for roughly the same            price. Or often less, as in this case.                    Even so, you can understand Exient's slight indignation that its            labour of love isn't even being presented for review - especially a            title as big as this. The more cynically minded might perceive this            as a ~turkey tactic~, but after countless hours in the company of            FIFA, we're scratching our flea ridden heads in confusion. It's not            bad at all - but first a quick run down of what you get for your            shekels: all the major European leagues, all the major national            teams (except Holland, as usual), and all the correct player names            - which is a very welcome addition after the rather rubbish made up            national teams you get with ISS GBA. In typical EA style, the front            end and general presentation is as slick as oil, and the graphics            are equally impressive, featuring fast, flowing, well animated            players that are taller and skinnier than the more chunky            equivalents found in the very first 16-bit versions ten or so years            ago. Technically, FIFA 2003 is very impressive, will lots of nice            features that have passers-by going ~ooh~ when they see it, (if            they can see it from that angle), such as the ability to pull off            instant replays by merely tapping select during the action. A            sideline viewpoint is adopted during the match, so don't expect the            isometric approach of the original - this is an all-new version            that has little in common with the ~good old days~.                    What it does have in common with every FIFA title is the ease in            which you can score goals. Lots of them. In fact, on beginner and            amateur levels, it was hard not to score, and four minute            games regularly ended 10-1, with upwards of 25 shots possible per            game. The CPU may have only had two or three shots, but the            tendency is for your keeper to pretend he's having a nap, and thus            any penetration of your defence almost always leads to a goal. To            give you a clue, on our very first go, we were 3-0 down within            about one minute - from the CPU's first three shots. Damn and,            indeed, blast. But practise very quickly makes perfect - at least            on Beginner and Amateur levels. If you want any semblance of            challenge, the best thing is to up both the difficulty and            Goalkeeper levels to Professional - at which point FIFA then            becomes similar to ISS in terms of a challenge. Knock down the            'keeper difficulty lower than Pro and it's hardly worth playing -            it's just too easy.        Part of the            reason such high scores are possible is the fact that the men seem            too big for the pitch - or the pitch is too small; one or the            other. The time it takes to get from one end to the other feels way            to small. Something's amiss. Also of slight concern is the ease in            which it's possible to pass to one another. Just tap the B button            in the vague direction of one of your team mates, and it almost            always goes straight to their feet, allowing the player to build up            some mightily impressive moves. Trouble is, it once again errs far            too much towards the arcade style of play, and is not only            unrealistic, but makes the game feel too easy. Likewise,            dispossessing players is unnaturally easy too, with rarely any need            to resort to tapping L for a sliding tackle. A quick few taps of            the A button almost always does the trick - and seems to double up            as a sprint button if you keep tapping away - while the actual            Sprint button (R trigger) turns your player into Linford Christie,            with no loss of stamina, unlike the more strategic ISS.                    In its favour, if you ban yourself from ever playing the game on            anything less than Professional level, and maybe with a lesser            team, you'll find FIFA 2003 a rewarding, slick and very playable            footy attempt, with all the nice ~real team~ elements and Club            Championship/EFA Trophy competitions that the poverty stricken ISS            lacks (although there's no commentary, sadly - we do hanker after a            bit of Motty). It just suffers from the same FIFA syndrome that            winds every discerning footy fan about the franchise - i.e it's            pinball football, with too many goals/not even a hint of realism,            and it'll take you no time at all to master it. We suspect this may            not be Exient's fault, though - after all, EA has demanded the same            brief for almost every FIFA ever made. Oh well, there's always this            year's version. In summary, then, ISS - still the best footy game            we've played on the GBA. Sorry Exient.
