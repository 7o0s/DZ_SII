The game is set in a world where Hitler was ~removed~ by the            actions of Albert Einstein, using a device known as a Chronosphere.            This prevented World War 2 from taking place, but in the original            Red Alert a new conflict arose between Russia and the USA and her            European allies. Now Russia is ruled by Premier Romanov, a puppet            put in place by the allies to ensure that the country could never            again pose a threat. But Romanov has plans of his own and, with the            assistance of a powerful psychic called Yuri, he has secretly built            up extensive military forces which he plans to use to invade the            United States itself.                    The story opens with the Russian forces landing on the shores of            the USA, and there the action begins. As with the previous games            there are two single player campaigns, one for each side, and both            armies are available in the multiplayer mode. For anyone unfamiliar            with the Command & Conquer series, or the real-time strategy            genre in general, the idea is to ~harvest~ or collect resources            (ore and gems in the case of Red Alert), which can then be used to            build structures to form your base. These structures can either be            defensive (such as turrets), unit-producing (such as barracks) or            ancillary (such as radar installations). With the unit-producing            structures you can build troops, tanks, aircraft and other forces            to wage war on your enemies with.                    As with all the other games in the series, the story in Red Alert 2            is told through a series of FMV cutscenes. The video quality has            been vastly improved though, with not only fewer codec artifacts,            but also much better CG effects. The acting is still just as bad as            before, although since the game seems to have its tongue firmly            planted in its cheek as far as the plot goes, this is not too much            of a problem - the B-movie style acting seems to fit the bill quite            nicely.                    One trick which was sadly under-used in Tiberian Sun is the ability            to run videos in-game in the small window normally used for the            radar display. Red Alert 2 uses this frequently to give updates            ~from the ground~ during battles, which adds very nicely to the            atmosphere, and makes the 16-pixel high troops seem much more real.            The in-game graphics are also a big improvement, both over the            first Red Alert game and also over Tiberian Sun. Whilst some of the            inherent engine problems are still present (such as the tendency            for small units to merge into a single blur when standing            together), the models are much better designed and the overall look            of the game is much brighter and more distinct than in Tiberian            Sun.                    Amongst the other graphical improvements are the ability to            increase the resolution up to 1024x768 (which was only possible in            Tiberian Sun by editing the INI files manually), and numerous small            changes like an option to show icons for units hidden behind            buildings. The maps have also been given a massive overhaul - there            are now sprawling cities (many of which have recognizable            landmarks), as well as the previously-seen icy wastelands and            verdant farmland. These improvements are more than just cosmetic,            however - troops can now be garrisoned in buildings, which affords            them a degree of protection from enemy fire, and ~tech buildings~            scattered around the levels can be captured to provide benefits to            their owner. For example, oil derricks provide a steady stream of            income without requiring ore collectors or refineries. Just about            every structure on the maps can be destroyed as well, with bonuses            given in some cases for creative destruction (or rebuilding) of key            facilities.                    The sound is almost exactly what you would expect. The effects are            spot-on, and the remarks made by the various units are both amusing            and relevant. The music is a combination of new tunes and remixes            of themes from the original, and it works well. It's certainly a            step up from the uninspiring Tiberian Sun music...                    The single player campaigns in Red Alert 2 are extremely well            though-out and balanced. The mission objectives vary a lot from            mission to mission, and whilst they are all generally along the            lines of ~kill everything~ the methods by which you do this vary.            For example, one level involves using the Eiffel Tower as a giant            Tesla coil, whilst another forces you to take command of a series            of scattered groups of troops and mount an offensive on multiple            fronts.                    The enemy AI is still not as good as it could be, but it is a vast            improvement over the last game, and it can use some of the more            advanced strategies (such as effective deployment of the Iron            Curtain weapon to make attacking units invincible). Interestingly,            there are also a small number of multiplayer campaigns which can be            played by two human players against computer opponents. While these            are nowhere near as well-polished as the main campaigns (feeling            more like preset skirmishes than ~proper~ missions), they are a            thoughtful inclusion and well worth playing through, as joining            forces against the AI with other human players can a lot of fun.                    The new units introduced in Red Alert 2 are also a varied bunch,            and again Westwood demonstrate how much they have learnt about play            balancing during the development of the Command & Conquer            series. Each of the units serves a unique purpose, and the            scissors-paper-stone relationships between them means that there is            no strategy that cannot be somehow countered. My personal favorite            is ~Crazy Ivan~, the Russian demolitions expert who can put            explosives on anything. Yes, anything - buildings, vehicles,            people, and even dogs and cows aren't safe! This leads to some            interesting tactics, such as building a pack of dogs, attaching            bombs to them, and then running them into enemy units...                    Then, just to prove that they can break the rules and still get            away with it, the developers introduced the ~super weapons~. These            are roughly the same as in the other games in the series, with            familiar favorites such as the nuclear missile launcher and            chronosphere, joined by newcomers like a weather control device.            These are all ridiculously overpowered (the weather control device            can level a small base in seconds), but they are balanced by the            fact they take a long time to charge (up to ten minutes in some            cases), and when a player builds one every other player in the game            gets a warning (and on-screen countdown to activation), as well as            having the location of the device revealed to them!                    This is a brilliantly executed bit of game design, causing a mad            rush as the other players all gang up on the owner of the device in            order to destroy it before it can be fired. This is very much in            keeping with the general spirit of the game, as it has been            ~balanced high~ (that is, in favor of more destructive units),            which results in much faster, bloodier battles.                    The super-weapons frequently force the ending of a game one way or            another - either the owner fires one and virtually annihilates an            opponent with it, or they themselves are wiped out in the rush to            avoid the devestating effects of the device. This is a massive help            in preventing the long, drawn-out endgames which were commonplace            in previous installments of the series.                    The multiplayer component of Red Alert 2 is the focus of the game            though, and rightly so. The balance of the two sides is almost            spot-on, with neither the Allies nor the Russians having an            overwhelming advantage in any particular scenario, unlike in the            first game, where the Allies could almost inevitably win on any map            with water thanks to their Cruisers, while the Russian tanks would            take out any ground forces elsewhere. In addition to this, each            side is broken up into a number of separate countries, such as            England, France and America. Each country has its own special unit            - the English get snipers, for example, whilst the French get a            huge defensive cannon. This adds an extra edge to the gameplay, and            gives individual players a chance to pick their favorite side.                    There are lots of small multiplayer tweaks to improve gameplay,            such as the ability to set beacons which can be seen by your allies            to co-ordinate your attacks, and the option to build structures on            to your allies' bases. There are a number of different multiplayer            modes, including the ~World Domination~ campaign system seen in            Tiberian Sun, and the ability to use Westwood's other on-line            matching services. The only real disappointments with the            multiplayer are that the game still has the odd connection problem            (and still uses the outdated IPX protocol for LAN games), and that            it is impossible for more than one player to play online at the            same time through a shared Internet connection - a bit of a            downside in days where shared cable and ADSL connections are            becoming commonplace.                    Red Alert 2 is definitely the best game to date in the Command            & Conquer series, and Westwood have shown considerable merit in            learning from (and correcting) the mistakes of their previous            games. The single player campaigns are great fun, and multiplayer            has been very well balanced and improved so that most of the rough            edges have been smoothed out, resulting in a game that is simply            great fun to play.                    There are still a few areas that could do with polishing (mainly            the network code), but apart from that the biggest criticism I can            think of is that the cardboard inset used for the second CD in the            DVD-style box feels cheap and likely to break after a few months            use..."}
