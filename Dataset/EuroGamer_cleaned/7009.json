There            was no sense of scale, of going anywhere. All that and more is set            to change in CM Mk. 2.0, the sequel and arguably the best Rally            driving game out there.                         For starters, the game has one of the most streamlined controller            calibration systems I've yet encountered. Ever since playing Grand            Prix 3 with a steering wheel and foot pedals I've tried to do the            same with every driving game I pick up, and unlike many others            (notably 1nsane, the Codies' other recent racing release), sorting            this out took about five seconds.                         Once I was set up and ready to go, I fired up the game proper and            jumped into one of the full championship modes. The full season            features loads of locations and stages for each of them, against 16            drivers in total. Messrs McRae and Grist (Nicky), his pace notes            partner are of course the centre of attention and it makes perfect            sense to pick up with them and a lovely looking Ford Focus,            faithfully bedecked with all manner of advertising.                         You can also choose to go at it using a tight-looking Peugeot 206,            or a Toyota Corolla WRC amongst others. FIA rules have been            followed to a letter and each car shares the same power,            transmission type and approximate weight to keep performance levels            in check.                    It's not all about gunning round dust bowls at 60mph though; before            you hit the track you can play around with all sorts of options            beneath the bonnet, including variable gear ratios, breaking power            and other more obvious things like tyres. This is all very            important for people who intend to play the game properly (i.e.            without any of that Automatic gearbox rubbish). For the            tinker-happy there's even the option to adjust the ride height and            other vanity-orientated features of the car.                         Somewhat unfortunately though, when you get onto the track, it's            far too easy to stay on the road. Admittedly I was using the tips            of my fingers on the wheel to flick gears, but even if I was            wrestling with a gearstick I wouldn't expect the nose of my car to            magically swing back towards the centre of the track whenever I            veered slightly under pressure. Niggling.                         Aside from this though, it's a very faithful drive. I had my            headphones on for the duration, and honestly felt rather like I was            in the cab with Nicky Grist reading me the pace notes.            Incidentally, the notes themselves have been adapted to the method            Colin favours, of suggested gear. As you approach a sharp left            turn, Grist may yell ~third hard left~ or somesuch, indicating that            you should switch to third gear for this particular door breaker.            Slight corners often get a ~six right~ or similar.                    Other things you need to watch out for when playing are the weather            reports prior to the race (which can be very important in            determining your approach), which camera angle you prefer (I like            front bumper, but then I'm slightly mad), and the texture of the            track. The trademark gravel and dirt is kicked up behind you, so if            you're low down in an external camera point, make damned sure you            watch what's being kicked up or just ahead. The difference between            slidey mudbanks and grit is immeasurable.                         After plenty of practice, you'll likely be posting some good            times. It didn't take me long - but during my drive, I never really            felt all that threatened by my surroundings. You do occasionally            come unstuck and head off into the undergrowth, but the trackside            objects don't exactly stop you dead, they just slow your path. I            often had to track back quite a way when I missed a turn, and            particularly in the snow, this can be a killer.                         Speaking of snowy Finland, it's but one of eight different types            of terrain, joining the aforementioned dustbowls of Australia, the            sunny south of France as well as locations in Kenya, Italy and            elsewhere. After a few stages of one type it's quickly onto the            next, and I rarely got bored with one. Concentrating on the road is            quite enough to keep your heart racing!                    One of the things that met with some puzzled frowns when I            mentioned it to my friends is CM2.0's arcade modes. They're            actually really good fun! You can race rallycross-style with two            drivers split-screen or online using Codemasters' new online            service. A hotseating type of mode is also possible.                         Elsewhere, the sound effects, graphics et cetera have all been            improved. The car models crease and crack as you hurl them around,            and your front and rear bumpers are very eager to part company with            the chassis. The glass smashes, the tyres flatten; on the whole            it's a thoroughly realistic portrayal, and it goes beyond visuals            too, with big thumps having a genuine effect on your ability to            continue racing. The tunnel problem mentioned at the outset is            negligible too, and although at times the sounds seem a little            repetitive, they can't be faulted for authenticity. It's as if            someone literally sat in a car with McRae and stuck a recorder out            of the window!                         Beyond the arcade and championship modes there are the familiar            time trials and whatnot, and if you finish those, you unlock new            cars, including a rather splendid Mini Cooper! The difficulty            levels are judged to perfection too, so it'll have you coming back            time and again to take the harder approach.                    For a game I once classed as an arcade game trying to be something            else, Colin McRae Rally 2.0 has come a long way. Much-improved this            time around, the only things I can hold against it are the car's            questionable propensity to stick to the track even when you steer            it markedly off-course, and the rather sizeable learning curve for            newcomers. All-in-all though, there's plenty to do here and it's            well worth your money!            Related Features:-                        \u00a0Colin McRae Rally 2.0            Screenshots"}
