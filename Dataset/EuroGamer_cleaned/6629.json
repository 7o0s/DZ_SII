Their all-seeing eyes were enough to            pierce the backs of their own heads, pools of water, wooden doors,            metal constructions and even time as they annoyed the hell            out of cautious players and exhibited 'artificial intelligence' to            frighten even GM crops. But whichever boot camp it was that pissed            forth these furious vesicles of world domination, banana theft or            whathaveyou, it must have been shut down oh so long ago, because            these days the average grunt makes no effort to sprint, all guns            blazing into the jaws of my sword, preferring instead to flail            about uselessly in the dark until mercifully dispatched.        Tenchu is            built on the principle of stupid, logic-defying guards with            attention spans a three-year-old would be ashamed of. Much of the            game is spent evading their gaze, but even if you happen to make it            into their sights, you can avoid most battles by grappling your            crooked way to the rooftops, or simply running out of sight. Upon            doing so, your little 'worry meter' in the bottom left will go from            red alert to a vague question mark, before returning to its numeric            threat measurement as the latest porky, robed stick-wielder snaps            ~ah, forget it!~ Only boss encounters truly bind you to combat.                    Of course, the reason you want to stay out of sight is because it's            better to kill them by surprise. While it's true that you can run            up to the average guard and chop away at him with a sword, knife,            stick or even bare-fist combo, the idea is to stay out of sight,            creep up on the oblivious automaton and then perform a stealth            kill; slitting his throat, chopping his head off, disembowelling            him, snapping his neck, brutally eviscerating him whichever way is            convenient, cracking his skull or even jamming pins into his head.            Upon doing so, the game rewards you with a kanji symbol in the            bottom left - the idea being to collect nine for each level to            unlock some new ability, like a shoulder charge.                    And the more stealth kills you can manage and the fewer times            you're seen, the higher your eventual score and rank will be - can            you become a Grand Master? What's more, you can play any of the            game's levels (nine each for the two central characters Rikimaru            and Ayame, and six for unlockable Tesshu) with two further guard            layouts, unlocked depending on your rank at the end of your first            go.        Your activities in this first PS2 Tenchu are hugely varied.            You'll face one of three narratives, in the roles of Rikimaru, the            freshly woken ninja on a quest to rid the land of evil, Ayame, a            knife-flashing lady assassin, or Tesshu, doctor by day and cold,            methodical assassin by night. Each has various in-game cut            sequences, similar levels and confrontations, but enough variation            to keep you interested. Indeed, the first open-plan, roof-hopping            level, which has you fighting to assassinate a dodgy minister and            his kiddy-fiddling nobleman friend, can be played a total of nine            different ways, taking into account the different guard layouts            available to each player and the subtle changes made between            campaigns.                    It's a decent setup, augmented by various abilities and pieces of            equipment, like the aforementioned grappling hook - devilishly            useful where rooftop reconnaissance and attacks from above are            possible. Other aspects of your assassin's arsenal include various            spiked distractions, like poisoned rice balls, grenades of every            kind, the odd blow dart for those situations you can't quite get            to, a number of throwing knives (which were throwing stars to begin            with, but were stripped away in line with European law - still            useful for taking out dogs which threaten to bark your            whereabouts), strength and health potions, rice beads to mark your            progress on the map like Hansel and Grettle, and even a            Scorpion-from-Mortal Kombat style device for pulling enemies into            reach of your sword. It's a goodly mix, and you can pick up far            more - including single-use weapons pinched from dead guards.            Cleverly though, you can't take everything into battle - the game            will limit your selections, and in Tesshu's case you have to find            money to keep buying them. There's no cushy government perks in his            job.        All of this is helped immensely by a simple, manageable control            system. The lack of a proper (playable) tutorial is a bit of a            pain, but the video segments available from the main menu should            tell you all you need to know - it's a two stick (left control,            right camera) system, with the usual options; jump (X), block            (circle), attack (square), use (triangle), inventory cycle (L2),            first person camera (L1), lock on to enemy (R2), map (select) and            pause (start). However, there's a wildcard in the shape of the            ~stealth button~, R1. Holding this crouches you down, allowing you            to perform a stealth kill with square when you get near an enemy            (this is true of aerial proximity too), various rolls (X), special            attacks (circle) and so on. It is the key to progress.                    Sadly though you will be regularly thwarted by a typically            unhelpful camera. Unlike The Mark of Kri, released on Friday,            Tenchu's camera will not swing into a helpful overhead viewpoint            when an enemy is below you, or find a comfortable position in any            case. It sticks to your arse most of the time, but it has a habit            of forcing you to twiddle the right stick far too much, and using            the L1 mode to have a snoop around requires very precise control of            your ninja. Fortunately you can't easily be seen with the stealth            button depressed, nor can you stumble from rooftops, so you can            squirm your way right to the edge to get a good look - but why            should you have to? A bit of thoughtful design here might have done            wonders - equally so in combat situations, which you'll avoid            partly to kill stealthily and partly because the camera is totally            unwieldy.        However, on the whole, Tenchu is a varied, enjoyable and            exciting game then, with a few flaws to speak of. Our only other            two were the occasional black pit ending your progress            (unbelievably annoying midway through a level if you've no ~Ninja            Rebirth~ item), and the presence of ghosts. Why do we need spectral            enemies in every game ever, now? Eh? Those issues aside, you            certainly can't fault the visuals, though, which offer up            beautifully crafted main characters with an abundance of different,            slaughterous animations, many different environments from the            sharply featured temples and ornamental gardens to the snowy bamboo            forests and intricate paper-walled confines of various houses,            castles and retreats. Nor can you fault the plot, which is            different in each case - Rikimaru and Ayame fight mostly the same            battle, culminating in a showdown with Tenrai, but Ayame is trying            to recover the Jewels of Power, and Tesshu has an altogether            different finale ahead of him in Ronin Village. It's ~short~ in            single-minded terms, but any gamer with enough might to defeat one            campaign will quickly set upon the next.                    Not content with that, either, K2 has thrown in a saucy            co-operative mode. This is a real blast, as you control two ninjas            in various specially generated levels that demand protection,            retrieval and other combined skills. One of you may need to cause a            distraction while the other ghosts in for the kill, and given a few            hours this is a great mode to play. You can even dress up as a lot            of unlockable characters, like guards, ninjas, dogs and even a            suited fellow with a mechanical arm\u2026 Our only gripe is that            you can't take on the plot missions collaboratively, although we            can understand why. Next time though, folks, let's have a proper            co-operative campaign thrown in, eh?                    It all sounds jolly good, doesn't it? Nice plot, well designed            characters, good control system, lots of variety, decent length and            a wonderful co-operative mode, not to mention stealth kills, which            bang any game's credentials into shape with a flick of the spine.            However, existing fans may be concerned that the Wrath of Heaven            doesn't really take the series forward to any great extent - and            they'd be right. This is all fairly familiar, but the key thing is            that it's new content, there are new challenges, it all looks            spectacular and it'll last you for ages. Assuming those things            matter to you, as well they should, Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven is a            very good buy.
