OH PLEASE STOP! I\u2019m just trying to make a cup of coffee! It doesn\u2019t need to be this hard.Seamless link to review: Dynasty Warriors Advance seems to believe that it can replicate the enormous volumes of action in its bigger brothers if it throws enough lists at you with as little explanation as possible. Present the player with enough choice, and surely she\u2019ll feel involved? But no, of course not. In the end, you\u2019re doing nothing more than frantically hitting the A and B buttons until all the enemies are dead. The frenetic RAWK music plaguing you throughout this does little to help.The Dynasty Warriors series, now in its four-thousandth year, holds its place in people\u2019s hearts for one thing alone: massive battles. While they purport to be historically accurate representations of Chinese history, this is of course nonsense, and really nothing more than pinning real-life battle names to their cartoon violence. You may as well label Bubble Bobble with ~Invasion of Stalingrad~, and claim it to be a historically accurate representation of the events of World War 2. (Which, come to think of it, is possibly the only gaming permutation of World War 2 yet to be pursued - I call dibs). Take away the screaming madness of ~7 X COMBO!!!~, while dozens of enemies are purged by your mystical Musou lightning displays, and you\u2019re left with, well, the background. Which is a generous way of describing the GBA incarnation.Before we go any further, let\u2019s get the ~But the GBA isn\u2019t capable of rendering dozens of enemies at once, or storing a wide variety of maps, so it\u2019s not fair to complain,~ out of the way. A Lilo isn\u2019t capable of surfing down a volcanic lava stream, and as such, is probably best NOT USED FOR SURFING DOWN VOLCANIC LAVA STREAMS. Inside a ping-pong ball would probably not be the ideal place to raise a family. SO DON\u2019T RAISE A FAMILY INSIDE A PING-PONG BALL. If the GBA isn\u2019t capable of running this game, then, well you can probably guess.And it really isn\u2019t. Where Dynasty Warriors CXVIII: Absnt Vwls provides you with a crazed cacophony of slaughter and vast battles of explosive intensity, DW: Advance has five sprites who stand still while you hit them.Actually, that\u2019s not quite true. They stand still until you hit them, and then slide madly across the ground, as if wearing casters made of ice. On an ice rink. On a particularly freezing cold day.An extensive and bewildering series of tutorials explain the game\u2019s structure, but frustratingly by a peculiarly detached means, not allowing you to participate in the barrage of instructions, but instead merely A buttoning your way through the pages and pages of illustrated text.You\u2019re told about how the game works in two sections: the RTS and the action, the movement and the combat. The former consists of a board game that makes Snakes & Ladders look rich with detail, in which you move your single character from blob to blob, advancing on enemies. This might possibly have offered a measure of tactics if there weren\u2019t about twenty of them, and one of you. You have two other AI-controlled units on your side, but with no ability to dictate their path it\u2019s hard to recognise them as a part of your game. They get on with their thing, independently and invisibly.Your allies' movements, and in turn the enemy moves, happen out of your vision, occasionally perceptible on the mini-map, but with no ability to monitor their progress. Instead you\u2019re sat staring at the small section of the map you\u2019re currently in, while the screen generously informs you that it\u2019s the ~Enemy Move~. Tap, tap, tap, wait your turn, bang your head to the JUGGA-JUGGA guitar that legendarily accompanied the second century Chinese into battle.When your path crosses one of the enemy units, things switch over to the action screen in which, just like in real Chinese history I\u2019m sure, your single character must defeat between about 20 and 50 enemies, with bonuses for finishing as quickly as possible. Unlike life. Fighting is conducted by mashing a very limited number of combos, built from alternately hitting A and B. Left shoulder offers a block, and, when your \u2018Musou\u2019 meter is full, combined with A unleashes an apparently super-attack mode, but only ever appeared to make the character even more slidey and uncontrollable, lasting for approximately two seconds. Right shoulder releases any of the six power-ups your frantic fighting might have earned, confusingly ranked and with minimal effect.Battles with significant foes drop new weapons to add to your collection, and there really are an enormous number of these. Each has three pages of stats, categorised into about a dozen different classes, and augmented with one of six different coloured elements (such as lavender for ~Blast~ and purple for ~Vorpal~, apparently). This daunting level of detail translates into absolutely bugger all in the battle. So long as the metal stick you\u2019re waving makes the baddies fall over, there\u2019s little else to consider.In order to attempt to replicate the scale of the series\u2019 battles, the limited power of the GBA forces the enemies to appear in waves of five or six at a time. Any more and the poor thing would emit smoke and have a little cry. But this means there\u2019s never any sense of an epic fight - which you\u2019ll remember is the only thing the series has going for it. In fact, another wave of bads won\u2019t be released until you\u2019ve killed the last surviving member of the current squad, meaning the action comes in peculiar pulses, far more trough than peak. Success within various time limits rewards you with various meaningless bonuses (like a health boost - not the most fantastic gift when the battlefield is strewn with them. Talking of which, there are about two field maps per location, meaning that no matter where you are on the main map, it looks exactly the same, with the health and Musou bonuses in the exact same place each time).There are 13 generals to play as, each with their own apparent roll of skills (some feel a bit slower than others, but of course detailed over pages and pages of lists), through the three different game modes. There\u2019s Musou Mode, which is the game proper, telling the story. Then there\u2019s Free Mode which is exactly the same as Musou, but you can tackle the missions in any order once they\u2019ve been completed in Musou. And then there\u2019s Challenge, which at least offers some variety - a sort of mix of mini-games, testing stamina, kill counts, and so forth. The score is somewhat rescued by this section, as it at least cuts out the pointless movement phase and lets you get on with challenging yourself against the limited potential of action. Trouble is, there\u2019s only one save slot, and so much as playing a different mode will wipe out your current save.Pages of information do not translate to in-depth play, especially when the apparent information has little perceivable bearing on your experience. And when that experience is as repetitive as that in Dynasty Warriors Advance, it appears to be simply mocking you. The game provides a fairly tough challenge, with high difficulty from the very beginning, and certainly there are lots of augmentations you can pretend you\u2019re making to your character, and certainly thirteen different characters to do this with. But in the end, despite all the options, and all the pages and pages of stats, you\u2019re doing little other than clicking through the gibberish story and hammering at A and B until everyone\u2019s dead. Over and over.I was trying to think of a similarly idiotic title to attempt to render on extremely limited hardware, and I was going with some sort of dancemat-based game. But then I realised, dancemat game for the DS, played with your fingers on the screen! It would be incredible. So while this review has now provided me with two brilliant new game ideas, and hence my future life of riches, that\u2019s not enough to win me over. It wasn\u2019t appropriate to make a GBA Dynasty Warriors, and the inevitable disappointment of an already extremely tired series has been fully realised."}
