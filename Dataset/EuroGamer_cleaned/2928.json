The floor is theirs, to do with as they please. A stuffed Felyne and immaculately dressed-up girls greet the patient players who've made it to the front of the hours-long queues that snake around the play space \u2013 a specially constructed, elaborate mini-village made out of paper and wood. The triumphant brass of the theme music booms out across the halls, drawing yet more attendees. Battles are broadcast on a huge screen, tantalising those still at the back of the endless queues with epic four-player face-offs against fantastical beasts. Don't let the tiny system fool you \u2013 this is the biggest game of the show.It sold more than a million copies in Japan, but by series standards Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii was only a moderate success. The PSP and Monster Hunter are practically synonymous in Japan. Portable 3rd emphatically isn't a PSP port of Tri, but all the monsters that made their debut there have been adapted for the small screen \u2013 which would be better news if I hadn't already killed enough Royal Ludroths to qualify me as a major cause of the species' pending extinction.But there's also plenty that's new. Portable 3rd is the best-looking game in the series by far \u2013 the detail and sense of scale that Capcom manages to squeeze out of the PSP is consistently astounding. Its setting is a touch more Japanese than previous hunting villages, with fluttering cherry-blossoms and kimono-adorned inhabitants (and of course their cat servants). More importantly, there are new beasts, two of which were the centrepieces of Portable 3rd's TGS demo.The single-player demo had three quests on offer \u2013 a face-off against the Royal Ludroth, a magnificent aqualion who'll be familiar to Wii hunters, a hard-as-nails fight against a black Tigrex, an even more deadly version of the aggressive monster that's been killing me for years, and a double-hunt against the Aoashira and the Jinouga, two entirely new monsters (they'll be renamed to something more pronounceable for the West). It's an obvious choice.The demo seems to include all the weapons in the game, unless there's a new one that Capcom is holding back as a surprise. The choice is between hammer, lance, gunlance (yay!), greatsword, longsword, sword and shield, dual blades, bow, bowgun and switch axe \u2013 a healthy and balanced mix of favourites from Freedom Unite and Tri. It's like Monster Hunter Special K.Reunited at last with my beloved gunlance, I'm given a choice of Felyne Fighters, the little cat warriors that you can take with you on a quest to heal you occasionally and divert attention away from you and your pointy objects. You can bring two of them along, now, which changes the game quite significantly, making single-player feel more like playing with friends and taking the bitterest edge off the challenge. They come in bomber, scrapper and support flavours.The demo drops me straight into the quest, dressed in a full set of matching armour and armed with bombs, traps and various ability-boosting potions. After more than 100 hours of Monster Hunter Tri, playing Portable 3rd on a PSP feels like coming home \u2013 home to a rubbish bedsit that only has sporadic hot water and smells vaguely of cats. It says a lot about a control system when you have to redesign the console to make a game comfortably playable. But if five million Japanese people are willing to put up with it, it's hardly going to change."}
