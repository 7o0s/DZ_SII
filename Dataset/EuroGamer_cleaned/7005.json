It arrives at a time when four            wheel drive games are more regular than service stations on the M1,            and with next to no fanfare surrounding it. Moreover, it boasts            superb handling and to coin a phrase from that fox in the Citroen            advert, impeccable road-manners, as well as a varied race structure            and on the whole just about everything a good 4WD simulation could            possibly require.                         For starters it isn't a race in the classic sense. Screamer is            more like orienteering for cars - which I am led to believe is            fairly indicative of the real thing. You are given a tough, gritty            off-road vehicle, pointed in the direction of the first checkpoint            and told to navigate your way to the end of the road. To progress            to the next stage, you have to get yourself into the top three.                         Unfortunately for you, this is damnably difficult. Not content            with dropping you off in the great unknown, the terrain is like a            bad day at the crash clinic. Twists, turns, bumps, rivers, ponds,            cliffs, bushes, trees\u2026 it's as if nature has taken up            picketing against off-road sports and wants to shove the sign down            your throat. Racing across uneven ground at high speeds isn't            always the answer, and that is, in a way, Screamer's attraction, it            actually forces you to act as if you are in a 4WD car.                    Visually Screamer 4x4 is very sharp. The terrain is fairly            remarkable, with gorgeous angled landscapes, and there's none of            the affected unreality of other 4WD games; each vehicle is very            realistically portrayed, with some cracking textures. And of course            so they should be, with licenses for the Jeep Cherokee, Jeep C17,            Jeep Wrangler, Land Rover Defender, Toyota Land Cruiser and more.            The game features some 60 courses to sling these monsters around,            with plenty of variation in the type of landscape.                         Weather affects too, can pay dividends. If it's raining and you're            doing 90mph through a mud slick, you're as good as dead anyway. The            physics in 4x4 are as close to reality as you are likely to get,            and having driven briefly in a 4WD I can testify to that. You had            better keep your eye on the road and your speedometer in reasonable            bounds or it'll be curtains. And you can't rely on your co-pilot to            aid you that much either. Beyond ~This bit's tricky~ and a few            other choice one-liners he doesn't offer much to punctuate your            insanity.                         In terms of audio, 4x4 gives as good as it gets. The gritty sound            effects might as well have been scientifically sampled from the            rear mudguard of a Wrangler, with some eerie creaks and vicious            roars. You don't half wonder whether fans of this ~sport~ know what            they are letting themselves in for\u2026                    Gaming on your own or in packs, there are Tutorial, Free Drive,            Championship, Trophy and Pathfinder Championship Modes to contend            with. The first two are fairly obvious and concern your getting            used to the game, while the three competitive modes thrust you out            onto the course and tell you where to go, so to speak.                         This style of play does take time to get accustomed to, but            ultimately it proves varied and entertaining enough to keep you            going for quite some time. Learning to choose the right gear for            the right situation, as well as gear ratios, and trying to control            your vehicle's momentum as you ease it over peaks and along ridges            provides some of the most determined gameplay I have seen in any            racer for quite a while - playing 4x4 is an intensely satisfying            experience.                         Thankfully, multiple players needn't sit, awestruck and leaning            over one another's shoulders. The options for more than one gamer            are instantly accessible and darned fun.                    There are five modes of competitive action on offer, including the            obvious circuit racing Off-Road Rally style, as well as Catch Up,            which is what it sounds like, First to Point, King of the Hill and            Destruction. The latter is the 4WD equivalent of a derby, with            grinding metal and misshapen cars battering one another for            survival.                         Playing with friends, the game was enough to keep us going for            some hours, with its multiple play modes, and even then, we still            wanted to try a bit of hot-seating in the single player game. If            you are limited to playing on your own, Screamer is brilliant, but            if you can handle 1-4 players on a LAN or via the Internet, you're            cooking with gas.                         At the end of the day though, Screamer 4x4 does enter an already            packed arena, and despite its charm, in multiplayer terms it does            come unstuck, to 1nsane from Codemasters. The Codies' game is            brimming with options, and puts even 4x4 to shame in this respect.            Might be one to consider before you part with your readies.                    For a game to win me over in the 4WD category these days it has to            do something pretty special, and it can safely be said that yes,            Screamer 4x4 does. Through its precise handling and varied course            structure, it pulls you in and keeps you going. The multiplayer            modes are a welcome bonus. This is probably the best 4WD game yet."}
