Based on a storyline that runs parallel to The            Phantom Menace, it draws on the adventures of three new characters,            pilots Rhys Dallows, Vana Sage and Nym. Thanks to the freedom            afforded to the development team at Lucasarts, Starfighter proves            itself as one of the most satisfying console titles ever to come            out of the company's doors.                         Borrowing elements of previous titles like X-Wing / TIE Fighter            and gelling them together with The Phantom Menace assets has            allowed Lucasarts to craft quite an adventure. The most important            part of Starfighter though is its controls. Complex, yet            responsive, they take only a few short missions to really get to            grips with. Everything on the Dual Shock 2 controller has a            function, making the craft highly manoeuvrable, whatever the            situation.                         The classic cyclic targeting system is handled by the triangle            button, allowing you to pick ships up all over the clock, while the            square button allows you to target whatever appears nearest the            centre of your screen. The addition of a zoom mode is invaluable,            allowing you to focus in closely on far-off vessels. Why this            wasn't in games like Freespace 2 is beyond us - it totally            eliminates the tedium of firing randomly at pixels in the distance.            Until someone can offer us a better way of doing this, we say all            power to Lucasarts.                    You control any of three craft, each with slightly different            movement attributes to one another, as well as exclusive arsenals.            Rhys' Starfighter is the basic Naboo fighter, with laser cannons            and proton torpedoes. As Anakin Skywalker discovered in the film,            it's also the nippiest of the bunch.                         Vana's ship, the Guardian Mantis visually has more in common with            Boba Fett's ship from The Empire Strikes Back than anything from            The Phantom Menace, but can turn on a sixpence in the heat of the            action, and benefits from guided nano missiles and Ion-enabled            sensor tags to complement them.                         Finally, Nym's Havoc is the slowest and clumsiest of the ships,            requiring a cool head to operate, but is packed out with weapons,            including dual triple-laser cannons, energy bombs and a Plasma            Scourge.                         Each of the ships is gorgeous with high levels of texture detail.            The enemy ship are also refreshingly designed - the whole game is            very attractive in general. It really demonstrates what can be done            with the PlayStation 2 hardware. Special effects are explosive,            with rippling water and overpowering Naboo architecture, in-keeping            with the breathtaking CG scenes in the film.                         The framerate drops occasionally in heavy action, but this is            confined more to the built-up ground-based scenarios than outer            space. I never once found it a noticeable annoyance either, even if            it is quite easy to spot.                    The single player game has 14 missions, split between ground and            space levels, ala the film. The missions aren't all that            imaginative - there's nothing as provocative as, for instance, the            AT-AT walker section at the start of The Empire Strikes Back, but            the level design is usually fun, and certainly challenging, even if            it limits itself to capture and hold, seek and destroy and just            plain defensive missions.                         Something that the developers have done that previous Star Wars            titles didn't always manage is to build up the sensation of being            part of a war, and not just Doomguy in space. The sense of scale            coupled with the challenge makes it very intense at times. I really            got caught up in the whole Star Wars universe whilst playing it.                         The soundtrack certainly helps, with a classic John Williams score            borrowed and modified slightly from the film, complementing some            intense action. The electric mood of the game is emphasized by            every imaginable explosion and laser fire sound effect. The            atmosphere is just so, and must have been one of the more trying            aspects of the game's development.                    The only issue that really had us scratching our heads in actual            fact was the game's length. Unlike some other Star Wars titles,            your actions have absolutely no carry-on effect on anything later            in the game. Starfighter is totally linear. I actually managed to            beat the single player story mode (which I have deliberately tried            not to reveal too much about) in just over 10 hours, leaving me            with the choice of playing it over again or messing around with the            various multiplayer features I had unlocked during my time.                         In Starfighter's defence though, I explored both of those options            thoroughly. Playing the game over and over again was, as I            justified to my editor, the best way for me to discover whether it            had any real life to it. Similarly, pulling in punters from the            street and forcibly restraining them for the duration of lengthy            multiplayer bouts was just the best way.                         Two-player missions are included, as well as X-Wing Versus TIE            Fighter-style head-to-heads and latterly, capture the flag. These            have to be unlocked before you can get to them, but they add so            much to the game it's worth persevering. Capture the Flag is quite            tricky, but (especially with Vana's craft) immensely good fun. The            head-to-heads can also be entertaining if you have an opponent of            similar skill level.                         What is unquestionable is that Starfighter has scope above and            beyond itself. It's a remarkable achievement.                    The developers of Starfighter must have been acutely aware of The            Phantom Menace's pitfalls, and have marginalized them. This game            takes elements of popular Star Wars titles like Rogue Squadron and            X-Wing Alliance and melds them into a brilliant adventure using the            best parts of Episode 1. I have no hesitation in recommending this            game to anybody, including ardent Star Wars fans who like their            universe to be just so. If only the film had been this good.                        #"}
