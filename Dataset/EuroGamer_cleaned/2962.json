It looks a bit like an entry-level Wacom unit, and a bit like Apple's iPad - if Apple's iPad had been designed by the top men at Fisher Price rather than a bunch of SoCal billionaires in turtlenecks who like to abuse the word ~magical~.Annoying capitalisation trends aside, it's a nice peripheral. The Wii's Remote clips snugly into a little slot on the left; the writing pen that comes with it can be stowed safely around the back and has a decent durability to it. Finally \u2013 this being a Nintendo-approved peripheral \u2013 there's even somewhere to stick the wrist strap you will never have attached in the first place.Taking a leaf from Moses' book, THQ has high hopes for this tablet. Although it will come with a considerable piece of software bundled, and has a few other games primed to go at launch, the publisher is planning to support it well into 2013. Clearly, nobody's taken its management aside and told them what Roland Emmerich thinks is going to happen to us all in 2012, but that's neither here nor there. With $69 as a US launch price, uDraw isn't going to be cheap, but it's not a cheap ploy, either \u2013 it's a device THQ reckons people are going to want to hang onto for a while.At first, THQ hopes people will want to hang onto it as a creativity tool. Powered by the attached Wii Remote and sturdy enough that it won't take too much damage if kids fling it around a bit, uDraw comes with an art package called uDraw Studio ready to go. I've been trying to work out just who this is aimed at, and I'm guessing it's pitched at creative children who are too clumsy to be let loose on a Wacom, or arty seniors who think a Wacom is a kind of biscuit. Either way, it's an accomplished set of tools.Presenting you with a blank canvas and a series of themed backdrops \u2013 artist's lodgings, street scenes, and that sort of thing \u2013 Studio is very easy to get to grips with. Pushing down on the pen makes it draw (elsewhere, when you're using it as a pointing device, this is also how you select things), you can delete your scribbles one by one with the remote's minus button, and a squeeze of the B trigger pulls up an art palette where you can select from standard paint package tools, choose your colours, brushes, and nibs, and apply special effects like mirroring, sharpening, and sepia-ification. And sepia-ification is definitely a real word that real artists like Damien Hurst, JMW Turner, and Sylvester Stallone might use. I think I heard Mark Lawson use it on Radio 4 a few days ago, actually."}
