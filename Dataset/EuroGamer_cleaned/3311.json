You wait four years for a decent PSP platformer and two come along at once. First there was LittleBigPlanet, an almost perfect example of a great game made miniature. Now here comes Jak & Daxter: The Lost Frontier, another good-looking, highly playable platform game. And this one's got guns. Like LBP PSP the game has not been designed by the series' creators. The Lost Frontier is the work of High Impact Games, previously responsible for the enjoyable Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters and the less impressive Secret Agent Clank.Now the studio has turned its attentions to Naughty Dog's mascots (or so they were until Nathan Drake turned up, all lost Baldwin in a Gillette advert). The good news for veteran Jak fans is High Impact has done its history homework, taking elements and influences from the best instalments in the series - i.e. not Jak X. Just like the old classics, The Lost Frontier has a silly plot, which may be some kind of metaphor for environmental destruction but is probably best just ignored. Put simply, supplies of Eco are running out and Jak and Keira must seek out some ancient Precursor machinery which could save the world. Along the way they meet characters like Generic Wacky Old Inventor and Smarmy Romantic Rival (possibly not their real names). There are lots of nicely animated cut-scenes where characters spout endless wisecracks and have long conversations which could be summarised as, ~Now we need to go there to get that thing.~ So far, so familiar. The gameplay will be recognisable too, especially if you can remember all the way back first Jak game. The ~& Daxter~ bit of the title was dropped for the second and third instalments, which had a free-roaming setup and a darker, more brooding tone. High Impact has shoved it back in for The Lost Frontier and the change is reflected in more than just the name. The emphasis here is on good old-fashioned platforming. Jak runs and jumps his way around linear environments, dealing with tricksy customers such as moving ledges and disappearing bridges. There's even a lava level. Many areas have a pretty, natural look more reminiscent of The Precursor Legacy than Jaks II and 3 (their stylistic inconsistency, not ours), though there are also plenty of industrial and mechanical elements. In fact this game looks and feels more Ratchet & Clanky than any of the previous Jak titles, perhaps because of High Impact's previous experience.The R&C influence is also apparent in the way Jak's character develops and the weapons he has at his disposal. He's lost his Dark Jak ability but Keira has discovered different colours of Eco can give him special powers - which you discover in stages as the game progresses. Red Eco, for example, allows Jak to produce a red fireball which explodes into a giant sphere of energy when shot. Green Eco enables Jak to generate Kryptonite-style crystal pillars from the ground, Yellow boosts his ability to jump, Blue is used to temporarily slow down time... Without wishing to spoil them all, there's a good range of special powers to discover. There are moments when it's obvious how you're supposed to use your powers - to create a crystal bridge across a pool of lava, for example. But as the game goes on you'll come across puzzles which require you to use two or more powers together, and which really make you think. You'll also find yourself coming up with combos which just make life easier, such as slowing down a boss with your blue Eco power before lobbing one of those red fireballs at him. In other words the Eco powers are useful, varied and well-integrated into the gameplay, and using them makes you feel clever.Jak also has a new weapon called the Gunstaff, which as the name suggests is basically a gun on a stick. You can whack different upgrades on the end though, turning it into a machinegun, adding a laser scope and so on. The range of upgrades is small compared to what you'd find in an R&C game but there's a decent selection. The problem is there's no lock-on or auto-targeting system."}
