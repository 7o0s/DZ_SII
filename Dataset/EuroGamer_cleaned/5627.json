Can't take them anywhere. Spreading disease, war, starvation                 and environmental degredation wherever they go...                    The world of Age Of Wonders is just one victim of this plague,            thrown into chaos by the arrival of humanity in a haven where            elves, halflings, faeries, dwarves, and other pointy-eared types            used to live in harmony.                    The Elven Court which once ruled the land has been destroyed by the            humans, and the Lord Inioch killed. His people have split into two            main factions, each led by one of his children.                    The Keepers are a bunch of tree-huggers, willing to forgive the            humans and build a new land in peace. Fight for them and you will            lead an army of dwarves, halflings, and elves.                    The Cult Of Storms on the other hand want revenge, and are            determined to wipe out both the humans and the Keepers. Their            armies are made up of dark elves, goblins and orcs.                    Here ends the history lesson.         Age Of Wonders is a turn-based                 strategy game, something of a rariety these days. It might not                 have the fast action of its real time brethren, but the more                 sedate pace allows it to be far deeper and more involving.                    Cities can be occupied and put to work building more units for your            army. You can fortify them, upgrade them, or even replace their            inhabitants with members of another race if you are having problems            keeping them in line.                    Mines and farms are scattered across the map, and capturing them            can increase your flow of income. There are also watch towers to            give you a better view of your surroundings, monster-plagued ruins            to loot, and dungeons which you can rescue prisoners from.                    When two hostile armies meet you can choose to let the computer            work out the result, or control your army in person. Battles are            fairly small scale, as each army can only contain up to eight            units, and each battle can only have up to four armies in it.                    But with a wide range of units there is still plenty of room for            cunning tactics. Archers are good at long range, but are useless in            close combat. Spell casters can be very powerful, but leave them            out in the open and enemy cavalry can rip them to shreds.                    Unfortunately the AI tends to just send its entire force streaming            towards you at full speed, meaning that units often arrive in a            steady dribble according to how fast they can move, rather than            appearing in a nice formation.                    Still, as the game goes on the scenarios get much more challenging,            and although the AI never seems to master basic tactics it does            become a more proficient strategist, raiding undefended mines and            cities, robbing you of much needed resources.         And there's more...                    Spells can be researched during a scenario, giving you access to            more powerful magic. But you generate a limited amount of mana            (boosted by capturing power nodes), and you have to balance that            between researching new spells and ensuring that your spellcasters            have enough mana to use their existing spells in battle.                    Some of your units can be kept from one scenario to the next, but            you only have a limited number of points to spend on this. You have            to pick which units you really want, and balance them against the            possibility of carrying more gold or mana into the next scenario            instead.                    When doing this you have to remember that you are often short on            money, and you will need it to pay your units. If you start a            scenario with too many units and run out of money, you will start            to see your men deserting you as their wages go unpaid for days on            end. A bit like the Russian army, really...                    Each side can recruit a small cast of heroes, which you develop as            you would a character in a role playing game. Every time one goes            up a level you are given points to spend on buying the hero new            skills, or adding extra points to their stats.                    You can also find magical items, armour and weapons to equip your            heroes with, making them even more powerful. Again, these can be            carried from one scenario to the next, but it will cost you.                    By the end of the game your own character can be a one man (or            woman) slaughterhouse, capable of scything through entire armies            single handedly. You still have to be careful though, because if            you lose your leader the game is over.                    In fact the whole game is intricately balanced, and no single unit            or strategy can triumph in every situation. It is a real tribute to            the developers that it works so well.         Turn                 based strategy games aren't exactly known for their visuals,                 but Age Of Wonders looks absolutely gorgeous... The graphics                 are colourful and detailed, and if you have the hardware to                 handle it you can play the game at ridiculously high                 resolutions.                    My own lowly P2-300 (armed with an ageing RivaTNT graphics card)            could run the game smoothly at 800x600, and even at that resolution            the game looks great. If I put up with five second delays waiting            for units to move and a mouse cursor that moved slower than a            glacier, I could even reach 1600x1200.                    Each race has its own unique graphics and units, and despite being            represented by tiny little animated sprites they still manage to be            full of character and easy to identify. Spell effects are also            spectacular, with huge clouds of brightly coloured particles            spraying across the battlefield as units unleash magic on each            other.                    The game also has a strong sense of humour. For example, there is a            ~Geyser~ spell which creates a fountain of water under an enemy            unit, lifting it high into the air. The water flow then stops, and            for a moment the unit hangs in mid air, Wily Coyote style, before            plummeting earthwards.                    This game is not for children though. Take the Goblin bombers,            which carry huge black bombs around on their backs and hop from            foot to foot as they move. They might look cute, but let one get            too close to your units and it will blow itself up, causing a vast            amount of damage as it disintegrates into a little pool of blood.                    Battlefields often end up soaked with blood and covered in corpses,            as the little sprites run around hacking each other up with axes            and swords, lobbing boulders at their enemies, and firing off            spectacular spells.         Age Of Wonders proves that there is still life                 in turn based strategy games. The graphics are beautiful, the                 gameplay is addictive, and everything is balanced almost to                 perfection.                    And with the ability to go back and play through scenarios in            control of any of the main races, as well as multiplayer over            Heat.net, LANs, and internet, and even a play by e-mail option, the            game certainly has plenty of replay potential.                    Well worth a look for all but the most hardened adrenaline junkies.                        Try before you buy! Download the Age Of Wonders                        demo (44Mb) now!"}
