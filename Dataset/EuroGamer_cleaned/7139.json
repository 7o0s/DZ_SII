Probably nobody outside of 3dfx will ever know why it took them so            long, but thankfully they have now been released. The real question            is whether it was worth the wait, and will it push 3dfx back on to            the top of the performance pile?                    All of 3dfx's hard work has gone into producing the VSA-100 chip,            formerly code-named Napalm. The VSA stands for Voodoo Scaleable            Architecture, with the 100 probably indicating that it is the first            generation of the chip - I wouldn't be surprised to see VSA-150 and            200 at some point...                    So what does 3dfx's new chip offer? Well, it offers everything that            was found on the old Voodoo 3, but also adds 32 bit colour            rendering, Full Scene Anti-Aliasing, T-Buffer effects, and texture            compression support through FXT1 and DXTC.                    Perhaps the most interesting fact about the VSA-100 chip is that it            is possible to put several chips on a single board to increase            performance, and the Voodoo 5 5500 features two of them. This is            reminiscent of running two Voodoo 2 boards in what was termed SLI,            and seeing that such a rig offered the best performance of its day,            it is no surprise that 3dfx have labelled their Voodoo 5 5500 as a            ~64Mb Dual-Chip SLI 2D/3D Accelerator~.                    Briefly, SLI (Scan Line Interleave) makes it possible to virtually            double performance by simply adding an extra chip. The basic            premise behind SLI is that one chip will draw the odd lines on the            screen (1,3,5,7 etc) and the other will draw the even lines            (2,4,6,8 etc). This leads to a doubling of the card's fill rate,            which is directly linked to the maximum achievable frame rate, and            hence in-game performance.         If there was a prize            for the most ludicrous graphics card design, 3dfx would probably            win it - the Voodoo 5 5500 is truly a monster.                    With its two VSA-100 chips, 64Mb of memory, two fans, and a power            supply which requires a seperate connector to fulfil its needs, the            whole card measures 9 1/2 inches (or 24.5cm if you prefer). The            last quarter of the board has a few hefty components on it that            help to regulate the power supply to the board, most likely for the            two fans that keep the VSA-100's cool.                    On the hardware side of things, the two VSA-100 chips are supported            by 64Mb of SDRAM. The clock speed of the board is 166MHz, which            provides a fill rate of 333Mtexel/sec per chip. In the case of the            5500 board with its dual chips, this gives a total fill rate of            667Mtexel/sec.                    This is quite impressive when compared to the 480Mtexels/sec of the            original GeForce, but when compared to the new GeForce 2 GTS card's            1600Mtexels/sec it seems somewhat lacking. But then, that's why            3dfx are also creating a four chip Voodoo 5 6000...         One of the major selling points of the VSA-100                 is its support for full scene anti aliasing (FSAA). 3dfx                 utilise a two or four sample method, which causes the scene to                 be rendered either two or four times (according to how you set                 it up), with each rendered frame being slightly 'jittered'                 compared to the rest.                    The idea is that by using a slightly offset group of images for the            same frame, it is possible to lay them on top of each other to            calculate the best anti-aliasing, reducing jagged lines and other            rendering artifacts. There is one significant drawback to this            though - it eats fill rate, and the card's performance can easily            and quickly be consumed by the needs of FSAA.                    Without FSAA the card's fill rate is 667Mtexels/sec, but with a two            sample anti-alias this is effectively halved to 333Mtexels/sec, as            you are rendering two seperate scenes and then combining them.            Utilising four samples reduces this to a very disappointing            166Mtexels/sec.                    As a result of this massive performance hit, 3dfx have said that            FSAA is not something that players of 'twitch' style games such as            Quake 3 Arena would want. But FSAA is appropriate for games where            super-high frame rates are not required but visual detail is            important, as 3dfx have shown with their many shots of Homeworld.                    Full scene anti-aliasing is done in the T-buffer, which also allows            for effects such as soft shadows, depth of field and motion blur,            which 3dfx place under the broad title of ~digital cinematic            effects~. Having seen demonstrations of the T-buffer effects one            can't help but be impressed, although I'm not sure whether I            actually want any of them in the games I play, especially if            they're going to create a serious performance hit.                    And, unlike FSAA, the other T-buffer effects must be added to games            by the developers. As no other card currently supports them, they            are unlikely to be widely used.                    Performance wise the Voodoo 5 5500 is a little disappointing. It is            certainly a great deal better than 3dfx's previous outings, but            compared to today's fastest performers such as the GeForce 2 it is            looking somewhat slow. Perhaps 3dfx will be able to do something            about this with more efficient drivers.                    One thing that is impressive is 3dfx's shiny new OpenGL ICD. In the            past there was some trouble with games that relied on OpenGL, such            as Quake 3 Arena, and it would take a little bit of tweaking to            obtain acceptable results. Thankfully the new drivers are perfect            and run without problems.         The Voodoo 5 5500 is an interesting product. It                 is certainly a world better than the Voodoo 3, and 32 bit                 colour is a rather overdue but gladly received addition.                    Sadly though it is still suffering from sluggish performance            (relatively speaking), and if you activate FSAA performance will            only get worse. The card itself is quite a beast, but it looks            tougher than it really is. At the current prices it is hard to            justify spending so much on the Voodoo 5 5500 when one could            purchase a GeForce 2 GTS based card for the same price, if not            less.                    I can certainly see the Voodoo 5 5500 finding some fans, especially            amongst players of games that run better under 3dfx's old Glide            API, such as Unreal Tournament, Starsiege Tribes and Quake 2.            Likewise for games where fill rate isn't so important, such as 3D            adventure, role-playing and strategy games, where the extra visual            quality that the Voodoo 5 5500 and its full-scene anti-aliasing can            offer will be welcome.                    My biggest hope is that 3dfx will improve their drivers and lower            prices to make the Voodoo 5 5500 even more competitive, as until            they do it is a little under-performing and over-priced compared to            other company's offerings.                        -                            Voodoo 3 3000 PCI review                    Voodoo 3 3000 PCI review                    Spring 2000 Graphics Card round-up                    Spring 2000 Graphics Card round-up                    Graphics Card Jargon Guide                    Graphics Card Jargon Guide"}
