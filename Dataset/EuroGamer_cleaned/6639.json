I've been a            plumber, a hedgehog, a bandicoot, a ninja, a Shaolin monk, a bounty            hunter, every flavour of wizard, mage and magician you can envisage            and a bouncy, big-breasted gun-toting animal rights dissenter            called Lara. I've been around. But it wasn't until a couple of            weeks ago that I took my first steps as a hamster, ladies and            gentlemen.                    This is because Hamtaro is a craze yet to penetrate pre-pubescent            youth culture here in the UK, and across Europe. Apparently            Hamtaro: Little Hamsters Big Adventures has started screening in            the US - and may even be on some of our fringier digital screens            over here for all I know - but it hasn't built up the same            sensational momentum that Pok\u00e9mon achieved at its height. Not            yet anyway. But with Nintendo at the helm of the first unashamedly            Pok\u00e9mon-esque GBC adventure, and strong marketing rhetoric            coming out of the unusually lively publisher, we felt the need to            ride the spinning wheel and see if the hamster's still kicking.                    Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! enjoys the questionable distinction of            being the first GBC game we've reviewed this year, but if this is            the quality we can expect from the other two or three titles we end            up with then, well, the kids are all right! Hamtaro is a very            lubby-dubby game made for youngsters and the young at heart. It's a            very simple RPG, really, starring a little Hamster with a name of            your choosing, (Mugrat for me), whose job it is to guide all the            other little hamsters back to the newly constructed clubhouse,            where the hamster boss wants to make the grand unveiling. On the            way, Mugrat will have to learn the 85 words of the Hamspeak            language, which, when used via the A button's pop-up menu, perform            particular actions used to unearth seeds (currency), solve puzzles,            open doors and, most obviously, converse with other hamsters.        The language            is everything from amusing (~Hamsolo~) and obvious (~Digdig~) to            childish (~Go-P~) and bespoke (~Tack-Q~?), but you won't get            anywhere if you don't speak to every hamster you encounter to pick            up more dialogue. Generally, if you run into a puzzle, yapping to            the other hamsters in the vicinity (by trying various words on            them, from your ~Hamha!~ greeting to ~Tack-Q~ which smacks 'em with            a rolling attack) will unearth some new word appropriate to the            situation. When you hit A and your options for Hamspeaking include            question marks, that's a sure-fire hint that you need to find            another word nearby to plug the gap and solve this particular            problem.                    Other than that, the graphics are simple, line-drawn cartoons            reminiscent of Pok\u00e9mon with a palette of greens, browns and            beiges, animations consist of walking, running and performing            Hamspeak actions, it takes over 10 hours to collect together all            the Ham-Hams (which is goodly length, although perhaps a bit much            for the kids), and Nintendo has been sure to offer a few            distractions along the way. Obviously your principle goal is to            collect all 85 words for your Hamspeak dictionary (accessed by            Start at any time), but there are also several hidden stars to            collect, a few mini-games to unlock (Ham-Jam, a sort of dance game            based on Hamspeak and Tack-Q Bowling to name but two), and a            30-item wardrobe to fill with items from the Boutique Ham burrows            located around the game world. Buying items like chef hats and so            on with your sunflower seeds here enables you to dress up in front            of the mirror and take pictures of yourself - which can be used to            replace the graphic on the title screen.        When all's nibbled and done, Hamtaro is a            very childish game which isn't meant for adults, but which could            happily occupy a few hours on a tedious plane flight or car journey            for someone of any age. Admittedly it was made for the GBC - as            evidenced by how rubbish it looks stretched to fit our GBA screens,            and the need for the GBC's IR function to swap clothing items with            your Hamtaro-ing buddies - but I doubt the kids will mind, and            Nintendo deserves a bit of commendation for translating the game so            superbly - as a 10-plus-hour-long Japanese original based around a            language barrier, this must have been pretty daunting!                    I guess what I'm trying to do is confess that I enjoyed Hamtaro a            lot more than someone of my age really should have. It's a silly,            childish little game made for kids which I really shouldn't have            spent a whole Sunday afternoon playing - at the expense of            you-don't-even-want-to-know-what, but despite sweetness to rival a            pulse-quickening, heart-threatening Starbucks concoction and a            challenge akin to shuffling a deck of cards, Nintendo's abilities            as a child's developer shine through here. And whatever the legions            of Cube-bashers say, it's not something they should be ashamed to            embrace."}
