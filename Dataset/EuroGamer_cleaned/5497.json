They've been knocking around for whatseems like donkey's years but the core of the game hasn't changed ajot: you control a little man who has to run around a maze that'sbeen filled in with explodable blocks, nuke the opposition and finda way out.As far as ideas for games go, it's up there with kicking a ballaround in terms of simplicity. And Bomberman Deluxe, the latest in a long line of mobileversions, is probably the least sophisticated of the lot,employing retro visuals and sounds and controls so simple even anadult could pick it up.In fact, discerning exactly what the 'Deluxe' part of the game's title refers to is beyondus.Maybe it's the two game modes, comprising Normal and Vs. play.The former finds you trapped in a series of levels that you mustblow your way out of using your handy pyrotechnics. Somewherehidden among the explodable blocks is a set of stairs leading tofreedom, but you'll need to avoid or blow up the wandering beastiesthat populate the levels first.It's quite a challenge, though the difficulty comes less fromthe monsters that are inevitably set free by your explosive workthan from the danger you pose to yourself. The first half-hour orso that you play the game will be spent in a state of fumingfrustration, as you repeatedly blow yourself up by mistake.The second game mode, Vs., puts you in a level along with threecomputer-controlled Bombermen and it's literally a free-for-all asyou all try to immolate the others. It's a much more hectic game asthere's very little time to think, only to react, and it's thismode that's the most enjoyable aspect of Bomberman Deluxe.It would have been even more entertaining had there been amultiplayer mode that enabled you to blow up your chums, too, butsadly that's absent. Anyone who's played Bomberman on home console or computer will know how big aloss that is, but there's still enough fun on offer to make thismobile version worth considering.For instance, the power-ups that are so crucial to Bomberman'sprogress through the game are present and correct, helping youspeed up, increase the explosive power of your bombs, drop multiplebombs at once and more. If you've never played Bomberman before, discovering these power-ups and whatthey're capable of is very rewarding.They're cumulative, too, which means that there's an extraincentive to carry on playing through the less exciting Normalmode. Whatever you pick up on one level can be carried over to thenext so that before long you're a whirling vortex of combustivedestruction.Whether this is enough to keep you coming back depends largelyon your gaming tastes. If you want something that's cerebrallychallenging then you will tire of Bomberman's antics in shortorder.But if you want an extremely polished slice of arcade action,there are few titles we can think of that come close to matching Bomberman Deluxe. Granted, it's not rocket science butthere's something that (to a certain kind of mind, at least) isdeeply satisfying about blowing things up.So enjoy it before the thought police come to take you away: itmight be your last chance."}
