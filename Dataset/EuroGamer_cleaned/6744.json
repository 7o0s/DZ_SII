Many of            the courses included in the game are based on real world circuits            or designed by model race club experts, and the resulting races can            end up looking like a shrunken TOCA event, with eight brightly            coloured cars going wheel to wheel around twisty tracks, hopping            over the kerbs and spinning off into the grass.                        Like any good motor racing game, Big Scale features a range of            modes and options to keep you occupied, from quick races and            training sessions in which you race against a ghost car to the            traditional championship mode. Actually, this is something of a            misnomer - the game includes no less than eleven championships for            you to work your way through, with a top three finish in one            opening your way to the next.                        As you rise through the ranks of radio control enthusiasts you'll            get your hands on ever lighter and more powerful vehicles, starting            out with relatively sluggish Standard Class cars and gradually            working yourself up to the amusingly named Hopped Class. These            really come into their own in the Open Championship, where drivers            are free to race with any car they choose.                    Our demonstrator helpfully started us out in the lowest levels of            the game to lull us into a false sense of security, before notching            us up to the top class for our second race. The result was            predictably embarrassing, with our car slithering all over the            course, missing corners and spinning off at the slightest            encouragement. The difference between classes is very            noticeable, with speed, acceleration and handling all changing            radically as you move between tiers of car.                        You'll also have to watch out for rival ~drivers~, as Big Scale            Racing features some 240 AI characters, each with their own unique            attributes and aggression levels. Quite how marked these            differences will be in practice was hard to judge from such a short            time with the game, but the competition was certainly fairly            fierce, and some cars weren't above nudging their way past us given            the opportunity.                        On the graphics front, cars and circuits alike are nicely detailed,            with plenty of track-side clutter and advertising. The game also            sports a variety of attractive weather and lighting conditions to            add some spice to your races, forcing you to deal with slippery            rain-sodden tracks and less than ideal lighting. The only real            disappointment is the group of spectators found on some tracks,            which looks like a line of flat cardboard cut-outs and seems pretty            goofy propped up next to such a lovely looking piece of tarmac.                    Big Scale Racing might be a fairly serious simulation of RC racing,            but it's also a lot of fun and perfectly playable even on a            keyboard. The variety of cars and championships should keep you            busy for some time, and we can imagine the eight player LAN support            proving a hit as well. Best of all, the game should only cost            around \u00a320 when it arrives in the UK at the end of September.            At that price you'd be daft not to give it a try."}
