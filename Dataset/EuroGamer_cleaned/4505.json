None more so,            however, than Blizzard's WarCraft series - and its futuristic            spin-off, StarCraft - a series of RTS games which have honed to            perfection a formula which balances relatively simple gameplay with            surprisingly complex mechanics, innovative graphics and a healthy            dollop of bizarre humour. It's a long time since the last game in            the series grabbed the attention of the strategy gamer, making            WarCraft III one of the most anticipated PC titles ever; can it            possibly live up to the legacy of its forebears?                         Set years after the conclusion of WarCraft II, with orcs and            humans living in an uneasy co-existence, much has changed in the            lands of WarCraft. For a start, they're entirely rendered in 3D            now; from the intricately animated menu screens to the often            stunning battlegrounds, every element of the game has been given a            polygonal, texture-mapped makeover. The interface, which will be            immediately familiar to fans of StarCraft, even features animated            3D portraits of each character you select - right down to the            bored-looking sheep who occasionally wander through the map.                         Purists need not worry, however, as nothing has been lost in the            conversion to 3D. The basic gameplay of the series remains intact            and, perhaps more importantly, the character and humour of the art            in the original WarCraft games has been moved seamlessly into the            third dimension. Blizzard were perhaps wise to wait until 3D was            quite mature before releasing this latest game in the series;            uninspiring, badly textured models would have ruined the feel of            the title, but the quirky and beautifully animated models and            portraits seen here carry the classic feel of the title admirably.                    Those running low-spec systems will also be pleased to hear that,            despite the graphical splendour of the game, it won't cripple even            the most basic of systems. Playing four-player games on a network -            usually the type of play most likely to bring an RTS title's            framerate to its knees - saw smooth and perfectly acceptable            framerates even on our lowest spec system, a Duron 800 with a            GeForce 2. With a little tweaking, the game is undoubtedly playable            on systems even less well endowed than that. Real time strategy            titles have never been the most demanding games on the market in            terms of system spec, and it's good to see Blizzard continuing this            tradition and resisting the urge to add curves, bump mapping and            all manner of other widgets which would rule out much of their            audience unnecessarily.                         But while little has been lost in the conversion to 3D, little has            been gained either, although admittedly the move is nowhere near as            disappointing as Command & Conquer's abortive foray into            voxels. The switch to 3D has opened up significant scope for            in-game cutscenes, but for the purposes of pure gameplay WarCraft            may as well have remained in two dimensions. Camera rotation and            movement is shockingly limited; you can't zoom out (and the default            camera is very tight indeed, often making it impossible to see an            entire skirmish on screen at once) and the 3D terrain is very            obviously a polygonal sheet draped over a resolutely 2D map.                         Aside from the updated technology underlying the game, the ~big            idea~ behind WarCraft III is the inclusion of hero characters, with            three distinct types for each race. These form the focus of the            single player campaign and add a role-playing element to the            gameplay by gaining experience through involvement in battle, with            players earning a point to spend on upgrading their abilities every            time they go up a level. Heroes are remarkably powerful and            flexible characters, and their presence changes the mechanics of            the game dramatically. Some have automatic status effects on all            units within their range, others can cure units in their group, and            most possess powerful physical or magical special attacks.                    Elsewhere, the gameplay of the series remains almost untouched, bar            various tweaks. There are four races to play as now, with Dark            Elves and the Undead being added to the traditional line-up of Orcs            and Humans, and the influences of StarCraft are very obvious - the            Undead are effectively a clone of the Zerg, complete with blighted            land to build bases on. Each race is nicely balanced in terms of            strengths and weaknesses, with the interesting addition of resource            gathering abilities to the mix of differences. The Undead, for            example, gather resources far more quickly and efficiently than            other races, making it far easier for them to expand earlier in the            game than the other races.                         Frustratingly though, the unit control and production foibles of            StarCraft have also made their way into WarCraft III. Many aspects            of the control and grouping system are superb - the ability to            select all units of a single type by double clicking on one of them            should be enforced as law for every RTS game, and the            ~sub-grouping~ system which allows you to press tab to move between            unit types in your current group, enabling you to access all their            various special abilities, is another excellent addition. However,            the crippling inability to select more than a dozen units at any            given time is every bit as annoying here as it was in StarCraft,            and is seemingly arbitrary; the only explanation we can find for            this unit limit is that that's the number of icons which would fit            in the group panel at the bottom of the screen.                         Much more frustrating, however, is the absolute food limit in the            game. Each player is restricted to 90 food units total, and once            you hit that limit you can build as many farms (or equivalent            food-producing buildings) as you like, but the limit won't budge.            Not only that, but many high-level creatures and units take up            several food units apiece. Micromanagement near the food limit is            astonishingly annoying - RTS should be about battles, not trying to            get some low-level units killed so that you can afford to fit in            another high-level unit! Food also quickly becomes the most            important resource in the game, much more so than gold or wood,            which is a ridiculous situation. The limit may be there for balance            purposes, but if so it's a clumsy and cack-handed way to balance            the game, and possibly the single most negative factor about the            title as a whole.                    These issues aside, there's a hell of a lot to enjoy in WarCraft            III. As mentioned, the sense of humour of the previous games is            retained, naturally including the ability to repeatedly click units            for a variety of amusing speech clips, some of which are            fantastically funny. There's a massive single player campaign which            is entertaining and varied, even if the difficulty curve could have            done with a little tweaking in some places, while multiplayer is            perfectly balanced and a lot of fun, either on a LAN or through the            superb Battle.net system. This performs excellently and makes            playing on even a humble modem possible. Our only complaint about            multiplayer is that many units pop up in the single player game            which aren't available in multiplayer - a somewhat frustrating            oversight.                         One element of the game worth special mention is the cinematic            clips that punctuate the single player game. These are, in a word,            superb; possibly the most impressive examples of rendered video            we've ever seen. While much of this splendour is purely technical            progress - cloth, leather, fur and feathers all look excellent -            quite a bit of it is down to first-class direction and animation,            and the game's classical score contributes in no small measure as            well. While these sumptuous cutscenes aren't quite up to the            standard set by Final Fantasy X in terms of facial animation, in            every other respect Blizzard has leapfrogged Square's video            department - an impressive feat indeed.                         So does WarCraft III live up to our high expectations? Yes. It's            not perfect by any means - the food limit and unit selection limit            will drive you nuts after a bit of play, and the ~Upkeep~ tax on            your gold mines when you have more than a certain number of units            is frankly daft, since it encourages you to build as few units as            you possibly can. It is a worthy update to the series though, and            makes the transition to 3D with flying colours while adding some            interesting new gameplay elements to an already hugely enjoyable            title. No fan of real-time strategy should be without WarCraft III,            and many RPG fans will want to take a peek as well."}
