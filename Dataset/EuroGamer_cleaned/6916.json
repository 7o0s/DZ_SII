Often the path taken by a            designer trying to push the boundaries is to set the game in the            future, enabling the concoction of fantastical weaponry and a            mediocre sci-fi storyline. Russian developers Buka are the latest            to conjure up such a title, in the form of Echelon.                         The storyline is a standard fare George Lucas rehash job which is            set, according to the publishers, in the ~near distant future~.            Yes, that one confused even us... The Galactic Federation is            defending a planet under attack by a rebel race known as the            Velians, who are hoping to overpower the Federation with their            massively advanced technology, and thus conquer the surrounding            worlds. Cue your entry into the game as a young recruit thrown            straight into training to prepare for epic dogfights, bombing runs            and defence campaigns.                         Upon loading Echelon you are presented with a simple interface            from where you can launch into the single player career mode, the            multiplayer mode, or plump for Instant Action. Opting for the            latter gives you a choice of missions to partake in which seem to            run on indefinitely, getting progressively harder until you get fed            up or shot down. These missions range from bombing runs and            dogfighting to Rebel Assault-style canyon chases. It's clear from            the first ten minutes of play that the emphasis is on arcade-style            action, and less on using the entire keyboard as a controller,            which in itself is a relief.                    Heading into the single player game you are treated to an admirably            produced FMV which briefly outlines the story so far, after which            you are tossed into training. This short section of lessons is very            effective in detailing the intuitive interface and HUD, and despite            the many functions of your craft, there really are only a few            essential details that need remembering. This refreshingly enables            the player to relax and enjoy flying instead of fumbling through            the pages of a huge manual whilst careening into the side of a            mountain.                         Once training is out of the way you will embark on a ~career~            which develops throughout the course of the game. Often a mission            will start out relatively sedately - escorting tank columns and            freighters becomes a familiar theme - and for these often lengthy            periods of lonesome cruising, you can employ the skills of a            particularly adept autopilot function. If you get really            bored, you can toggle the accelerated time option, halving your            flight time. However, a mission rarely goes without some kind of            action, and before you know it you're battling it out alone against            three enemy fighters with one wing left. This constantly shifting            pace is one of Echelon's true strengths. It can be very            unpredictable. Some missions will see you leaving a base with two            wingmen for a fight with some incoming fighters and leaving the            battle on your own, rendering the rest of the mission extremely            tricky. But play again and the same battle could be a whitewash,            obviously depending on the performance of your buddies, leaving the            rest of the mission open to an easy victory with your additional            reinforcements.                         The action in Echelon is rarely short of frantic, and some of the            faster paced sections really do get your pulse pounding. You can            also find yourself entering some literally huge battles            occasionally, and there's nothing more exhilarating here than            swooping over the crest of a mountain to spot masses of craft            engaging each other in the distance, bathed in the ever-present            glare of the sun. The fact that you're meant to involve yourself in            these massive battles is a daunting notion, and you feel truly            insignificant in the mess of radio chatter and showers of exploding            aircraft. Moments like this can be rare, but it's worth the effort            to trudge through the earlier, rather lacklustre missions in order            to experience them.                    An interesting part of the player's progression through Echelon            comes in the form of route-taking decisions. After successful            completion of a mission, you are usually presented with more than            one option for your next assignment. Once you have chosen you're            not able to retrace your steps without reloading the game, meaning            you can play right to the end of the campaign without actually            finishing all of the missions. This helps to add a certain degree            of replayability to the game, and it's an admirable move. There are            also mission editors and extra units available for the game now, so            the longevity should be extended further still.                         Throughout your career you are given the option to pilot an            increasingly wide range of different air-based units, which offers            a nice level of variety and also serves as a kind of reward system.            You can customise each craft with a choice of different weaponry,            with different combinations of machine guns and plasma cannons in            primary and secondary weapon slots, plus the option of adding            missiles into your armoury. This admittedly limited level of            customisation enables you to form a new strategy for a mission            should you fail first time out, and certain situations can force            you to become resourceful in your choice of weapons. For example,            the enemy often employs a ~suppression field~ which has an            electro-magnetic pulse effect on your HUD and plasma weapons and            forces you to employ more traditional weapons, such as machine guns            and rockets.                         With 52 missions in total, you would think there was plenty of            scope for plot and character development. However, after the            initial introductions and mission briefings, you are reminded of            what's going on once more part way through the game, and then hear            nothing more about it until the intriguing end sequence. The lack            of depth isn't helped by the faceless, nameless nature of your            cohorts throughout the missions. Radio chatter is composed from            words spoken by a generic voice and rearranged to form sentences,            which has the effect of making everyone sound robotic.                    For all of its innocent arcade-style antics, Echelon has a few            glaring faults which really dampen the experience. The intelligence            of your co-fighters and enemy are more often than not extremely            impressive but this can occasionally lapse, resulting in the end of            your mission. Several times I was forced to restart a mission            because a wingman took an evasive turn into my face, and other            times I have observed in amusement an enemy fighter veering off            course and flying straight into the side of a mountain a few            hundred yards away. Your autopilot system can also suffer a lapse            of concentration and send you bouncing across the ground, or            perform a startlingly late climb and, you guessed it, land you in a            vertical face of rock.                         Another niggle involves the radio command system. What could have            been a superb Tribes 2-style command interface enabling you to            conduct battles from your cockpit whilst your autopilot takes care            of the piloting has instead turned out to be a sadly under-used,            clumsy and bulky menu of useless options. The problem is that it's            rarely context sensitive, so instead of being able to call for            cover during a particularly tricky mission, your only option is to            set the autopilot to send you back to base. It just isn't useful            unless it's been hard-coded into the mission that you have            to use it.                         Finally, the huge gaping hole that is the multiplayer option. I            haven't even been able to review this aspect of the game simply            because there were no servers to play on. Finding one would involve            hanging around the official website's forums all day waiting for            someone to announce an IP address, since there's no server browser            to speak of. Buka haven't even thought to include some kind of            web-based match-making affair, which would have been better than            what you get, which is essentially nothing. This is a crying shame,            as you could imagine the multiplayer battles and co-operative            missions being one of Echelon's true shining points.                    It's easy to be wooed by Echelon's glorious graphics and its            sometimes epic atmosphere, but the game is marred by a few problems            which could sadly bring it down with a disappointing thud for many.            It's also disappointing that Buka haven't exploited the potential            of the multiplayer support on the back of the strong single-player            experience. What is essentially a very good stab at Wing Commander            for the 21st Century ends up as a title that will unfortunately be            forgotten in six months time."}
