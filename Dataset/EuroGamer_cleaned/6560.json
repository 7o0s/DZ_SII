You're also permitted to wearily acknowledge that this is, indeed,            another run, jump and collect platform game. By our calculations,            about the tenth game in the genre we've played in the last three            months. That's nearly one a week; surely more than even the most            obsessive kleptomaniacs can cope with. But, wait! This one's got            monkeys in it, and if there's one thing that guarantees a game's            quality it's the presence of our banana eating friends.        Seeing as it's a platform game, you can probably guess that            there's an evil do-er that needs to be put in his place. In this            instance, it's the scowling 'white monkey' Specter, who has decided            to wage war on all humans and create new world order where monkeys            rule. The simians in question wander around the levels with            flashing helmets on and colour coded pants, and it's your job to            round up these pesky primates with an assortment of gadgets, while            picking up gotcha tokens and generally taking out anything that            dares to get in your way - including Specter's minions of doom, the            Freaky Monkey Five.                    The early levels act as more of a simple tutorial to get you into            the swing of things, and give the player ample opportunity to learn            about the various type of monkey (identifiable by the colour of            their pants!) the different strategies involved in catching them,            the basics of object collection, the controls, and mastery of the            various tools at your disposal via the gadget trainer.                    The controls are fairly simple and easy to get the hang of. Each of            the symbol buttons on the pad represents one of your gadgets, and            can be reassigned at any time by hitting select, which takes you            into a gadget menu. Moving the right stick in the required            direction activates the gadget (although you sometimes use the left            stick as well), while the left stick controls your movement/camera            movement. R1 or R2 is used for jump, L2 activates free look/aim            mode, while L1 centres the camera behind you.        Catching monkeys is the name of the game here, and it's by no            means an easy task. To begin with, the most resistance they offer            is feebly running away, and a swift swipe is usually enough to bag            them, but you're soon faced with more guile and cunning; first of            all they'll outrun you, requiring a more stealthy approach (click            down L3 to go prone and shuffle up to them unnoticed), then they            get weapons, and it's here that the game really starts to test your            mettle. With pistols, bombs, machine guns, flamethrowers, RPGs and            even kisses at their disposal, these cheeky monkeys seem to always            have the jump on you.                    Fortunately for you, the game evens the odds by presenting the            player with an increasingly powerful set of gadgets to ensnare            them. First of all you get the all important Monkey Net as well as            a Stun Club. As the game progresses you'll get the Dash Hoop (for            quick bursts of speed), the Monkey Radar (to detect where they're            hiding), the Catapult (to pick off enemies from afar), the Sky            Flyer (to reach previously inaccessible platforms) the Bananarang            (long distance weapon and monkey coaxer), the R.C car (to guide            into small gaps) and three others. It's easy to compare Ape Escape            2 in this respect to Ratchet & Clank, but the fact is R&C            wins hands down for constant variety.        Object collection is all important in Ape Escape 2, with Gotcha            tokens left discarded all over the place, as well as health            restoring cookies, and the occasional explosive missile (for your            catapult), or the odd extra 'jacket' or life. At the end of each            level, there's an opportunity to cash in your winnings at the            Gotcha Box; for every 10 tokens you receive a prize, which ranges            from the sublime to the ridiculous: including pointless            'Secret/Concept' art, pointless Monkey Fables, pointless plinky            plonky soundtracks, extra lives and missiles, or - if you're lucky            - a bonus mini game, which could be Dance Monkey Dance (rhythm            action with Monkeys), Monkey Tightrope or Monkey Football, all of            which are superb additions to an already sound package. We could've            done without the other completely pointless collectibles,            but we're sure there's an audience that appreciates gratuitous nick            nack nonsense. Probably the kind of people that delighted in            collecting all that guff in Shenmue.                    The game itself has 20 levels, plus interspersed boss encounters            with the Freaky Monkey Five; the majority of which you'll have            cracked within the first couple of hours play. Beyond the third            boss, however, the difficulty cranks up quite significantly and            this won't be a game you'll breeze through. On the latter stages            you'll curse those damned monkeys, and a serious amount of luck,            thought and a fair degree of skill will be required to progress,            and the monkey catching antics start to vary, with the chance to            board a Mech, or a Submarine. The boss encounters are a little            lightweight though, and you'll suss out their attack patterns very            quickly and knock them out with relatively few blows with your Stun            Club.                    Completing the game once rewards the player by allowing you to play            as Spike, the hero of the original, with even more new gadgets            available (which we haven't unlocked yet) and the chance to clear            levels more thoroughly, and hence buy yourself more extras from the            Gotcha Box. Then there's the two-player mode, where you can show            off your monkey catching skills, and of course, Time Attack, adding            a simple against the clock dynamic to the gameplay. To unlock            everything will take a fair amounts of dedication, but we do wonder            once you've unlocked the three mini games and seen all the levels            whether you'll really be bothered to buy up the overwhelming amount            of objects from the Gotcha Box.        In terms of visual excitement, Ape Escape 2 offers plenty of            nice effects, but stood next to the best in the genre doesn't            challenge a great deal. There's nothing really wrong with it            as such; for example the scenery is uniformly pretty, and the            locations are varied. Each of the levels is distinct from the last,            with sunny beach resorts, a moon base, Shaolin temple, and Egyptian            ruins, among the best. The characters, however, barely push the PS2            in any special way. They're cute, well drawn, full of expression,            but pretty basic. In many respects, it looks like the kind of game            that would have gone down a storm a couple of years back, but            against more heavyweight competition it just looks a tad old school            and doesn't stretch the boundaries in any way.                    But if you could actually see the game properly it would help. With            no direct control over the camera, (except in the fairly redundant            and tricky free look mode) you're left at the mercy of the game to            give you the most sympathetic viewpoint. By and large it does its            job well, but you'll often encounter plenty of frustrating            occasions when you're completely blind to what's going on around            you, thanks to some random obstruction, or the game's decision to            arbitrarily offer a totally unhelpful viewpoint. When you            experience sublime dynamic camera control in other games (notably            Sly Racoon), it is frustrating when other games fail to nail this            fairly basic and fundamental requirement.                    It's fortunate that this kind of problem occurs relatively rarely            that it doesn't detract too much from the otherwise refreshingly            different gameplay, but a bit more ambition in the visuals and the            camera department would have garnered a more enthusiastic response            from us battle-scarred platform veterans. Many areas in which            platform games have improved in, such as storyline, visuals, camera            work, gameplay variation, 'no load' technology and soundtrack            ultimately feel somewhat lacking here. That's not to say it's a bad            game, as it most certainly isn't, but it just hasn't kept pace with            the progress elsewhere.                    Bearing in mind its PS2 exclusivity, Ape Escape 2 really is            competing in a very crowded market, albeit one with a massive            installed base. Sony has at least attempted to approach the genre            from a quirky and strategic angle, but our lasting impression of            the game is one that mostly entertains, but rarely inspires.
