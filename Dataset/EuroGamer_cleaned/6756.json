The centerpiece of TD overdrive (simply known as Test            Drive in America) is the Underground mode, although sadly this            doesn't involve riding around on the Tube all day, something that            would have been infinitely more entertaining.                        No, instead you are thrown into the world of illegal street racing,            a world inhabited by stereotypical characters ranging from the            dangerous sex kitten and the spaced out surf dude to the arrogant            German and uptight Englishman. Voice acting and dialogue throughout            vary from awful to downright insulting, and although you can skip            this pre-race blabber by hitting the Start button, the bad news is            that the drivers continue their inane whittering during the races.            Each driver only has about three (really annoying) things to say,            and they'll repeat these constantly. Given that the sound effects            are utterly uninspiring, you can at least safely mute the whole            thing and be done with it. On the music front, the soundtrack            includes such appropriately titled songs as ~Lackluster~ and title            track ~Ugly~. Maybe somebody in Infogrames' licensing department            has a sense of humour.                        The racing itself is just as bad. You have four vaguely            recognisable cities to drive around - San Francisco, London, Tokyo            and Monte Carlo - but, this being an illegal activity, many of the            races take place at night. Sadly Pitbull don't seem to have fully            grasped the concept of street lighting, and as a result most of the            game's early races are virtually pitch black, leaving you            struggling to make out cars that aren't using their headlights as            you carve your way through the traffic at 150mph. The resulting            collisons are nowhere near as spectacular as those found in            Burnout, and you have to find your own way out of the wreckage when            they're over, a process which will usually drop you to the back of            the pack. Luckily the only thing you have to worry about is making            it to the next checkpoint before your time runs out, because if you            fall too far behind, the other drivers will helpfully slow down to            a crawl to let you catch up again. There are a variety of quick            race and multiplayer modes on offer as well, covering linear (A to            B), circuit, drag race and police chase events, but most of these            courses must be unlocked in the Underground mode first, which is a            tedious soul-destroying experience.                    The writing was on the wall for TD overdrive from the moment we            began our first race and noticed the loading screen features a game            of Pong. Unfortunately Pitbull have made the ball move so fast that            it's utterly unplayable. Let's face it, if you can screw up Pong,            the single most basic videogame in the history of mankind, you            don't have much chance of getting anything else right. It's amazing            that Infogrames have the cheek to even release a festering pile of            junk like this when the Xbox already has a great street racing game            in the form of Project Gotham. Do yourself a favour and steer well            clear."}
