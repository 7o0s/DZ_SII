It's perhaps unsurprising then that Sony has made Zipper Interactive's SOCOM: US Navy Seals its flagship online gaming title, and that in its first few days on sale the game sold out Sony's first run of network adapters without breaking a sweat.            SOCOM (which stands for Special Operations Command) puts gamers in            a number of unsupported high-risk positions and demands sneaky            tactics and teamwork to oust various terrorist opponents. In the            single player game, there are 12 missions, which involve scuttling            ships, retrieving hostages and destroying hostile forces, with more            sub-objectives than a weekend in Amsterdam. Turning to the            multiplayer aspect, you'll find three types of online game;            demolition, extraction and suppression. In demolition the objective            is to find a bomb and plant it in your opponent's base, while            extraction is a fairly typical hostage rescue scenario (ala            Counter-Strike) and suppression is straightforward team deathmatch            with no distractions.                           That's not to say SOCOM lacks distractions though - the game ships            with a microphone and earpiece headset to bark orders to your            friends online and, ingeniously, to your AI-controlled teammates in            the single player game. Assuming the voice recognition picks up on            it, which it does, most of the time. As team leader, you are            responsible for instructing your team-mates, telling them to hold            their ground, come along and join you, assault a particular area or            innumerable variations on the above. All of this done via an            in-game command selection menu - not unlike the one seen in Unreal            Tournament or Counter-Strike - or via your headset. Barking an            instruction and hearing ~yes, sir~ in your ear is quite a buzz.                    The single player game is really just a starter serving, but in            itself it's not a bad little game, although it does fail in a few            respects. After a short and not altogether strategic briefing,            where you find out what the mission objectives are, pore over a            schematic of the area and choose your team's weapons loadout,            you're deposited at the start in two-man teams and instructed            occasionally via radio - and more often, if you like, thanks to the            toggleable in-game help system.                           Your adventures take you across a number of fairly contrived            locations, including, unsurprisingly, a tanker, an oilrig, the            Antarctic and several others. Mission objectives are available for            perusal in-game, and as you sneak around silently popping enemies            with your suppressed pistol or throwing stealth to the wind and            blowing seven shades of crap out of everything, you'll gradually            complete them. Fortunately, only the primary objectives are            obligatory, and you'll progress even if you don't complete every            secondary objective - although you won't receive the top ranking.                           The biggest problem with the single player game is the AI. From            our experiences so far, the balance is fine, but it's more that            your team-mates and your mutual opposition are all equally stupid.            SOCOM isn't a game your friends will understand - if they witness a            couple of fellows facing off with loaded weapons, and instead of            firing, switching to rifles and clubbing one another into            submission, they will snarl and mutter something about an            experience on de_dust involving a lagged out modem user.                    Head online though and you can engage in battles with up to 16            players total, eight SEALs and eight terrorists, and they aren't            all morons. Getting online in the US is a cinch - you plug your            network adapter in, plug it into a network socket, hit a few            buttons on the PS2 interface and in a few seconds you're browsing            servers, creating or joining clans, viewing rankings and more.            Let's hope it ends up like this in Europe. At the moment a couple            of options are disabled due to the heavy load, but you can            certainly engage in hundreds of demolition, extraction and            suppression scenarios with thousands of your fellow men. It's just            that for the moment, they're all American, so even if you could get            online from the UK (which, to the best of my knowledge, you can't),            you probably wouldn't want to. Judging from the reception we got,            they're quite patriotic about their beloved SEALs.                           The tone was generally fine though, with a lot of reasonable            individuals working steadily together towards the common goal. Each            game is a number of games in sequence, like a clan match, with the            total number of rounds totted up at the end. After it's all shot            and blown, the team with the most points wins and an MVP is named.            The MVP is probably our least favourite aspect at the moment,            because it really discourages teamplay. In the same way that            everyone wants to score the goal in a playground kickabout,            everybody playing SOCOM charges around attempting death-defying            feats of Schwarzenegger-esque lunacy in pursuit of the MVP            accolade. Of course most of them fail miserably, and it costs you            dearly as a team.                    SOCOM's visuals are on a par with the same sort of games on PS2.            Level design is quite chunky and the locations textured with a            distinct lack of imagination, but the character models are            beautifully animated. Instead of just radioing a SEAL to sneak up            and chuck a grenade through a doorway, your man may raise an arm            and signal to his compatriot with a series of ludicrous wrist            actions. One feels that the third person view was selected to            really emphasize this quality of animation, because in first person            (through a sniper scope) the game looks otherwise quite bland. That            said, lighting effects are around in abundance, and the weapon            designs and reload animations are spot on. Another aspect we're            quite fond of is the way a SEAL holsters his pistol and slings his            rifle on his back instead of disappearing them into the ether as            with Counter-Strike or, well, every shooter in history.                           The audio side of the game is another victory, with a lot of            ambience in place of a stomping soundtrack, and you'll want to pay            attention to feet thudding in snow (not to mention footprints) and            other audio clues in dealing with situations. Particularly online.                    SOCOM: US Navy Seals is still quite some way off in the UK and            Europe, thanks largely to Sony's indistinct plan for online gaming.            Expect to learn more about PS2 online during October, and with any            luck, SOCOM. One good thing about our position in Europe however,            is that with the delay between NTSC and PAL releases, we can almost            certainly avoid bugs and exploits sneaking into the equation. When            SOCOM appears in Europe, it'll have been tested to perfection by a            superpower's worth of eager shooters."}
