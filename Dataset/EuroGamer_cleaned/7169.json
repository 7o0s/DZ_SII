I'm not the world's biggest golfing fan. In fact,                 I'd go as far to say that I would much rather redecorate an                 entire house, than sit and watch it on TV. I can't even stand                 playing the real game itself. That could be down an inability                 to actually hit the ball though!                    So why, you may be asking, am I reviewing a golf game on the            PlayStation. It's purely for the simple reason that I absolutely            love computerised golf games!                    Why waste all that money on expensive clubs and fancy cardigans,            when you can simply shell out \u00a339.99 instead. Dump yourself in            an armchair, grab a controller, and set those balls flying down the            fairways.                    European PGA Tour Golf is the latest offering from Infogrames,            attempting to nestle itself in an already bloated market of golfing            games.                    Have you got what it takes to conquer all in the European Tour?         The game is officially supported by the                 European Tour itself. All the player names you'd expect to see                 in their respectively skilled tournament are included. It'll                 take a little work to get to meet the likes of Nick Faldo in                 the professional world.                    EPGA has six authentic courses, including Druid's Glen in Ireland,            The Islands in Italy and Hanbury Manor in England. I can only take            their word for it that they are indeed authentic, not having seen            or played on any!                    In addition to the serious tournaments, you also have five fun            variants too. These are Clock, Hazard, Island, Night and Super            Shootout golf. More importantly, for the amateurs amongst you,            there is a set of practice modes too.                    To further the atmosphere and authenticity of the game, commentary            comes to you from Peter Alliss and Alex Hay.         Once at                 the menu, you can either go for a quick match, enter the main                 tournaments, practice, or choose a fun game. Unless you're                 skilled already, you're better off heading for the practice                 options and get yourselves used to the way the game works.                    When ready, head for the tournaments. You begin with the two-day            AMA Season tournament, consisting of 24 golfers over 36 holes. You            need to have achieved a handicap of 0 (zero) at the end of the            season, to enable you to progress through to the Challenge Tour            tournament. Easier said than done.                    With your golfer ready to take the putt, you have a number of            pre-shot options. One of the most important of all is to actually            know the fairway you're about to play on! You can do this in two            ways; firstly before selecting to play the shot you can use the            game's Walk or Fly-By hole. The latter option will give you a neat            panoramic view of the fairway ahead, preceded by a handy dotted            indicator showing you the ideal path to take.                    Secondly, and after you have opted to play the shot, you can switch            the camera view at any time from golfer to fairway centre and to            the flag. This isn't the best way of seeking out the best path, but            can be useful sometimes.         Once you                 are ready to tee-off, a green arrow appears indicating the                 altitude and direction the ball will take. You can adjust this                 to putt further or nearer, depending on the situation. You may                 also opt to change the club selected for you. Quite often an                 Iron club will be selected when the Driver club would do a far                 better job.                    Wind must also be taken into consideration. An indicator in the            bottom left hand corner shows both the direction and speed the wind            is blowing in. Careful analysis of this can be crucial.                    The green arrow will flash red if the path is blocked by something,            yellow if it isn't in line with the flag and orange if the shot is            blocked but clearance can be attained by selection of the correct            shot-type.                    The shot accuracy and power are governed by the Swingometer.            Pressing the 'X' key will initiate the shot, and set the power bar            moving. Press it again when the power level reaches the recommended            level. The bar will then go back down, and you then press it again            to select the accuracy. For a perfect shot with no sidespin, you            need to stop the indicator bang on the thicker accuracy mark.                    The Iron clubs are easy to judge both power and accuracy, but the            Driver is a lot harder to judge with the bar indicator rising and            dipping a whole lot faster. This makes for some really quite            hilarious mishits if you don't get anywhere near the main accuracy            mark!         With the luscious                 green fairways and scenery from the real life locations, you                 already have yourself a perfect opportunity for ~eye candy                 central~. Not that EPGA takes advantage of this.                    Graphically the game is rather dull. The courses are represented            well enough for sure, but there's a real washed out look about it            all. The background graphics don't seem to sit well with the            foreground most of the time, nullifying the illusion of depth            completely. The player graphics are quite awful, and lack variety.            No attempt has been made to make each player look different to the            other.                    The actual courses are all very well done though despite their            washed out look. Hills and inclines are all very easy to spot, and            rough areas clearly visible.                    As you'd expect, sound really isn't the main focus of a golf game.            Commentary from Peter Alliss and Alex Hay is very good, with some            classic statements. The crowd, though not actually graphically            depicted, cheer the good shots, birds chirp and the wind blows            against microphone wind booms. It does the job.         Let's face it, EPGA plays a good round of golf. There are                 no real complaints about the gameplay itself, with Birdie and                 Par shots being reasonably easy to achieve, even for a golf                 luddite like me.                    Unfortunately, it's the graphics that ultimately let the game down.            After 36 holes of the same bland looking fairways, it becomes            fairly tiresome to play. Move to the next course, and there's no            real indication that you're playing in an entirely different            location.                    I'm not asking for people to come out dancing in sombrero hats in            Spain, or for there to be tea and biscuits laid on in England; just            for there to be a little variety to soothe the eyes.                    An opportunity missed has to be the Night Golf option. I was            expecting fluorescent strips on the golfers, flag and ball, but            otherwise pitch black - Like the real night golf. Alas no,            the background is darkened, but the game still looks like it's            playing in twilight!                    I love a good round of computerised golf me, but sadly the 19th            hole was to switch this off and play something else.                        - Out Now"}
