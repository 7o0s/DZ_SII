It's the first thing I did when I played the Sims for the first time in 2000, sitting in front of the family computer.It really used to freak out my Dad when he walked past. ~What are you doing?~ he'd ask, horrified, taking in the frighteningly perfect miniatures of our family pottering about on the monitor I honestly couldn't tell him.10 years later, I'm still doing it. There sits Sim-me, up at 3am playing videogames whilst the rest of the household is asleep and there are dishes to do, whilst I sit in my flat playing The Sims 3 on low volume at 3am and ignoring the mounting stack of plates. But when my Sim wandered over to the stereo in the middle of a Sunday afternoon and turned on a 22-20s song ten minutes after that exact same track popped up on my iTunes playlist in real life, it all got a bit weird and I had to turn it off.The Sims has always been a gentle combination of life and fantasy. Sims might eat, sleep, wee, fall in love and waste hours on videogames like we do, but we generally don't get to become mad scientists or master thieves or world-renowned surgeons in the space of two weeks, or wrestle burglars to the ground whilst our housemates look on, clapping in glee (unless we live in certain bits of North London). Life takes Sims in more exciting and unpredictable directions than ever before in The Sims 3, and it's irresistibly compelling.There are a few necessary compromises for the console versions. You can only control one household with a maximum of six Sims, so if you want to create yourself and your friends you all have to live in the same house, like an ill-advised sitcom. Everyone else in the world is a Maxis-made character \u2013 you can't populate the city with your own creations and have them run into each other at the beach or at each others' parties.Loading times also verge on the ridiculous at times, though it helps a lot if you follow the game's advice and install it to your hard drive. Considering how much the game has to deal with, it's hardly surprising. The Sims 3 on consoles still has the full open world of the PC version, with a whole town full of caf\u00e9s, museums, libraries and public swimming pools where Sims can go to socialise. It sometimes takes a few seconds for buildings and textures to load in, but these issues aren't any worse than they are on the average non-supercharged PC.Incredibly, house-building and landscaping tools are as fully-featured as they were before, as are character creation, item customisation and pattern-making. The Sims 3 on consoles has all the customisation and sharing of the PC version built right into the character creation and item catalogue menus. And wow, people have no taste when it comes to redesigning household objects. There are abominations in there from inexpressibly hideous blue-and-white-striped toilets to duck-adorned, vomit-green acoustic guitars.The Exchange, the hub for user-created content, can be accessed separately from the menu at any time and searched for specific items. Uploading things to The Exchange is easy, but browsing is naturally slower than it is on the PC, and you have to have a lot of patience to bother sorting through the orange televisions and 45 variations of Ugg boot to find something you want."}
