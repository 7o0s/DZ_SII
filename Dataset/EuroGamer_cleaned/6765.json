Playing Lost            Kingdoms for a couple of hours on the evening I received it, I fell            in love with the subtle complexity of the card-battling system, and            this brief love affair continued for a fortnight or so. However,            before long things started to fall apart for this cute little            card-carrier, and in the end I was quite pleased to see the back of            Princess Katia and the threat of the black mist.                         Why? In short, a lack of depth was to blame. The story behind Lost            Kingdoms is weak, starring the aforementioned Red Riding Hood            look-a-like of noble descent on a quest to find her father and            defeat the black mist, which has smothered the various kingdoms of            the world and destroyed the lives and livelihoods of their            occupants. In order to do this, Katia must first master the art of            the magic cards. She receives her first shock in her very own            castle, having to take down a couple of skeletons with a single            magic card, before venturing out into the world and learning from a            seasoned old hag.                         The biggest change to the traditional RPG formula is From            Software's decision to limit character development in favour of            building up decks of cards. You travel across a map screen taking            on various levels with up to 30 cards of your choosing in a            prearranged deck, and you have to clear ruins, fields and towns by            wielding them in random battles. Apart from a couple of regular            stop-offs to deposit rescued magical sprite things and to visit the            old crone who tutored her, Katia takes on each level repeatedly            until she gets through to the other side without dying or running            out of cards.                    When Katia encounters an enemy (or multiple adversaries) the game            switches to a battle view, trapping you in a small area with your            enemies and an irritating battle theme which becomes almost            intolerable after a couple of hours. You then dash about using the            analogue stick to evade their attacks, and the face buttons to use            your cards. The game shuffles the top four cards as you chose them            before the level began and places them onto the face buttons, the            idea being to hit buttons to wield the corresponding cards.                         The strategy is in choosing the right card for the right enemy.            The game splits things up into four elements: fire, water, wood and            earth, with a separate neutral category, and the idea is to choose            the opposing element to the enemy's to achieve maximum effect.            Before long your deck consists of most of the enemies you have            defeated, and it becomes simpler to work out which card to use in            the heat of battle, but you also have to consider what the card            actually does. Some conjure up monsters to fight on your behalf,            whilst others transform you completely. Others still work as melee            attacks, swiping ethereally from within Katia or swooping down from            behind her and ploughing into whatever lies directly ahead.                         When struck, enemies drop jewels, which in turn power the cards            further. After a while though, cards run out and you move onto the            next in the pack. What's frustrating about this is that often            jewels are hurled away and obscured by the scenery, or are simply            too hard to pick out against a particular piece of shiny stone, and            by not grabbing them you limit your chances of being able to stay            on the offensive. Luckily, if you do take a hit you can employ some            healing spells, which is why it pays to design your decks after            you've worked out how effective you are in battle, but ultimately            luck plays just as important a part as strategy.                    The trouble with Lost Kingdoms is that beyond the strategy of            building a deck to match the conditions and opposing elements there            isn't a lot to do. The card system has been included almost            entirely at the expense of character development, and the story is            pretty clich\u00e9d and tedious fantasy tripe - nowhere near as            twisted and adventurous as those witnessed in the Final Fantasy            games and elsewhere.                         Level design also falls on the wrong side of the fence, with too            many winding, skeletal ruined houses hiding secret cards in chests,            and having to race around these little mazes because Katia is            apparently incapable of stepping over a two foot wall proves a            little much. What's worse is that the random battle system means            that you just slope around looking for the way out and hoping to            escape conflict, and almost every encounter is met with a groan.            Puzzles which unlock doors are simple, often requiring Katia to            wander over to a pump and drain a fountain to fetch a key, or            something equally preposterous, and in some cases the developer has            resorted to simple substitution conundrums.                         One of my least favourite sections was a puzzle prior to a boss            fight, which had me touching the graves of four former kings in an            effort to guess the right order and unlock a gate. Failure at any            given step was met with a horde of skeletons to defeat. Unpleasant.            Getting killed in the subsequent boss fight and having to replay            the entire level didn't do much for my temper either. Mid-level            shuffling points go some way to redressing the balance, and once            you've learnt to retreat to these now and then things become a deal            easier, but you will find yourself repeating levels more often than            not after a few hours.                    Continuing the trend of missed opportunities we have the graphics            engine. Lost Kingdoms doesn't look bad, per se, but it could have            been a lot better. Katia herself is poorly detailed, spinning            around like a top and running like a weary gazelle, and NPCs are as            soulless as the undead she conquers. Although some of the enemies            are fun to see in action, and as a result some of her summonings            and battle effects, they too become repetitive, lacking variation            in behaviour and animation. The sound effects are so-so, and            there's no voice acting to speak of - the whole story is told via            text. Presentation is acceptable enough, but when some battles drag            the framerate down and you aren't even all that pleased with the            spectacle to begin with, you don't really appreciate the finer            details.                         The final nail in Katia's coffin is the camera system. It's too            static by far, with only four positions which always seem to leave            you working at a diagonal. The sad thing is that the camera            smoothly sweeps between these, suggesting that a free camera            wouldn't have been too much extra effort to implement. Ah well,            perhaps things will improve in the recently announced sequel.                         I was prepared to give Lost Kingdoms a proper slating for a while,            but it did have one final surprise left in store for me. The            two-player arena mode, which has you facing off against another            player using pre-chosen decks, can be a lot more entertaining than            your average beat 'em up, and the main adventure often plays second            fiddle, because the multiplayer aspect can last you for hours at a            time. Sadly though, it probably isn't enough to rescue Lost            Kingdoms. After 15 hours I wasn't too sad to see the back of the            single player game, and with games like Smash Bros available on the            Cube there wasn't much incentive to drag my usual Friday night            gaming party back to this.                    Lost Kingdoms could have been a big success, and it's obvious that            Activision anticipated this in snatching it up and releasing it as            the Cube's first RPG, but From's Cube debut is a bit short on            substance, even if it does employ the best card-battling system            I've seen in a videogame. If you can stomach the repetition and            reckon the card-battling and multiplayer elements sound like your            kind of thing, then it might be worth picking your way through this            until the big Cube releases turn up later this year, but otherwise,            I would give this a miss and see what From does with the sequel."}
