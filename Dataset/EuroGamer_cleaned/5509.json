Putting a new spin onthe move-crosshairs-and-fire genre, Siege finds you manning the ramparts of a castle as anarcher.The various nobles of a fragmenting fantasy kingdom have takensanctuary in their massive stone fortifications, as civil war anddark forces roam the land. The demonic Lord Vesel is the hoodlum onthe prowl 'round your neck of the woods, and it's up to you, with alittle help from your friends, to repel the attack.It's a pretty lonely position to be in, too, at least to startwith. It's you against the entire monster horde (a smallish horde,granted, but a horde all the same), and all you've got is a bow andarrow.Aiming by moving the pointer left and right along the bottom ofthe screen, you fire off your shots by pressing '5' or down on yourhandset's thumbpad. It's quick, intuitive and simple enough so thatwhen events take a turn for the frantic, you're not left cursingthe target for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The arrow then sails into the air before arcing down into yourintended victim. Or, until you get used to the timing required, theground just a few steps behind him. You see, the attackers you'reshooting at - zombies, ghost archers,battering rams and the like - are marchingconfidently towards you, and so you'll need to aim at a point wherethey're going to be, not where they actually are as you releaseyour bow.Add to this the fact that it takes a couple of seconds to reloadyour bow and that some attackers take two arrows to go down, andyou've got a shooting game that borders on being a puzzle.But you do have a few tricks up your sleeve. As you withstandeach day of the siege, you get money for the attackers you fell.This enables you to repair the damage that the attackers do to yourcastle; conversely, let the 'health' points of your castle run outand it's game over.More importantly, with money you can buy swanky new weapons andtroops. These range from the epic 'Raining Arrows', where the skyliterally fills with sharp pointy sticks, to the dependable Knight,who'll sally forth from the castle gates to do combat with anyattackers he meets onscreen. These special attacks are one-offs, sochoosing when to use them is crucial; you'll soon find yourselfwith more attackers than you alone can see off and it's then thatyou'll be glad of some back-up.This adds a lot of tension and you'll find that Siege engenders a great deal of determination in you duringplay. One nice visual touch among many is the rise and fall of thesun in the background as it marks the passage of each day; it'ssomething you'll find yourself glancing at as the enemy forcesstart to fill your castle's front garden.Balancing your expenditure between repairing damage, reinforcingyour castle's walls and stocking up on special attacks adds anotherelement to the sense of desperation that your besieged soldiersmust be feeling.It's this will you/won't you make it through the day edginessthat is Siege's greatest weapon, and one that'll ensure that any wetweekend confinement that you might encounter in the future won't beso bad after all."}
