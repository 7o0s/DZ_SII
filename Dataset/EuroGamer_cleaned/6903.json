You would have been hard            pressed to justify the original as a killer application though, and            in Hostile Territory the excitement is only a bit more feverish,            the graphics are only a touch improved, and the FMV and storyline            elements are fairly uninspired.                        The improvements made since the original are hardly groundbreaking,            and the game is still ostensibly the same. But since last year the            PlayStation 2 has found its way into several million homes in            Europe alone, and there are better games on the market, including            Rockstar's magnum opus Grand Theft Auto III. The sum of the game's            parts is thoroughly enjoyable, but it's still not a killer            application.                        Once again players take control of an anonymous smuggler who is            learning the ropes from a grizzled veteran, and are employed to            collect packages, make drops and elude law enforcement in all sorts            of conditions and all over the world. The general narrative is            sustained through a collection of average-to-amusing cutscenes            deliberately filmed in a grainy B-movie style, and focus on your            smuggling band's financial interests and the jobs they take. At the            beck and call of your principal, your group has to infuse itself            into various situations both civil and military and escape            scot-free. Your adventures take you through exotic locations            including Vietnam and southern Russia (instead of the previously            proposed Afghanistan, for obvious reasons).                    Developer Angel Studios clearly had fun at the top of their agenda,            so the game mixes realistic (and occasionally startling) physics            with excellent visuals and simple objectives. Your job is usually            to collect a package by running over it in your vehicle, then to            beat the clock to the drop-off point where the package is usually            surrendered. Depending on the difficulty of the level (and it's a            reasonable learning curve), you may or may not then have to lose            your police and army pursuers.                        And that's basically it! Sometimes your team consists of more than            one smuggler, and you can pick the vehicles for your AI            counterparts. Often the missions consist of multiple objectives            with time allowances increased with each drop or pick-up, but            Hostile Territory is very evenly paced - there have been scant few            levels where I have run into a brick wall due to the difficulty -            and thanks to the physics, the unique car handling and the            persistent AI of the police and armed forces, the game can be            extremely exciting.                        Situations often arise where you tear across the countryside with            your package and chance a sneak peek through your rear-view only to            recoil in horror at the enormous number of people on your tail, and            how close they are. If you're not extremely careful with your            drop-offs and the paths you pick through the foliage and other            environmental hazards you can lose valuable time regaining control            and composure amidst furious police interest, or come unstuck            completely and wreck your car or get busted.                    Even when your cars are falling apart though they have an            unrealistic smoothness to them, and rarely cease to function or put            you in jeopardy until they are completely gone. These are design            decisions made in the interests of gameplay though, and are            perfectly reasonable. The fact that your door has flown off and            that you are plainly visible fighting at the steering wheel while a            police truck rams your legs is completely irrelevant in the context            of the situation, which calls for panic-stricken manoeuvring as            opposed to nit-picking!                        The locations in the game are beautifully sculpted out of the            landscape, often dotted with trees and bushes, some of which are            impregnable while others are just there for show. The bushy foliage            doesn't act like a forest of lampposts to a speeding saloon, but            does make it impossible to see more than two steps ahead.            There are also nightvision-style missions, and the game makes good            use of weather effects and day and night looks. The water effects            and landscapes do leave a little to be desired, certainly compared            to games like Gran Turismo 3, but you can literally see for miles,            and all the while the game maintains a reasonable framerate. Apart            from a few nosedives it's more than acceptable, although the game            does not seem to feature a 60Hz mode, which worryingly seems to be            Rockstar's de facto standard for European PS2 games.                        The game's soundtrack and sound effects on the other hand are            somewhat anonymous. Compared once again to the incredible variety            of tunes and sound effects in GTA3, it's annoying. The boppy techno            beats are simply not my thing, and the lack of variety is            appalling. A chum of mine tells me it's very good as techno / house            / trance / whatever-the-hell-it-is goes, but it doesn't seem to fit            the game terribly well. Smuggler's Run 2 really needed a furious            soundtrack.                    When it comes to the gameplay though Hostile Territory suffers for            one reason; the repetition. Not in the sense that we all played            this a year ago, but the way that you come unstuck, listen to your            stupid gravel-toned boss whinging through the radio speaker at your            busted ass and then have to pick up the controls and try the exact            same thing over again.                        There are only so many routes from A to B. Perhaps some of them            won't take you through muddy fields where the car slides as though            its on a sheet of ice, and perhaps the cops won't swerve away from            that tree you skimmed, but ultimately it's just a slog once you            know the score. You just want the next mission, the next cutscene            .. something new. A new car maybe - the game is quite rewarding,            with new vehicles added to the roster regularly and spruced up            parts and weapons to help evade the cops, but the premise never            changes. It's almost always a mission to pick-up and then drop-off            something.                        Even the game's other modes, such as capture the flag and            checkpoint races, become joyless after a while. The multiplayer            element holds some charm, but relatively little. Playing Bomb Tag            (hot potato on wheels) gets old very quickly, and when so much of            the outcome relies on pot luck thanks to the huge array of            environmental, physics and AI factors, is it really any wonder that            things get boring? There is little or no skill involved, and after            a while it all just becomes repetitive. That's where I am now,            about 20 hours of gameplay later.                        Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory is a good PlayStation 2 game,            and in the present climate it makes a nice diversion. But with so            many truly excellent games coming out on the PS2 now, and so many            more in the immediate offing, does anybody have a spare \u00a340-50            for a game that's merely good?                        -        Smuggler's                    Run 2: Hostile Territory screenshotsSmuggler's                    Run 2: Hostile Territory screenshotsSmuggler's                    Run reviewSmuggler's                    Run review"}
