There's no room forsentiment - it's kill or be killed out there, and unlessyou're careful you'll soon be overrun by enemy troops spreadingthrough your lines like wildfire.But before you think you're reading a review of the new Call Of Duty game, let us stop for a second and explain toyou that the war we speak of isn't being fought on the battlefieldsof the Somme or the beaches of Normandy, but rather it's ragingacross roundabouts, car parks, and other everyday settings. This is, after all, no ordinary war. This is Bubble Revolt.Makers Herocraft describe Bubble Revolt as a cross between a puzzle game and areal-time strategy battle, and we're inclined to agree. Playing as a team of blue bubbles, your objective is to colonisea battlefield made of squares with as many bubbles of your colouras possible. With a style of gameplay that's reminiscent of Reversi, you canmultiply your forces by splitting a bubble in two and occupying theadjacent square with the offspring, or remaining whole and jumpingto a square that's further away. Either way, opposing colouredbubbles on adjacent squares are turned to your colour, thusincreasing your army as you try to take over the board.Unlike Reversi, though, the levels are of varying shapes andsizes, and the number of opponents ranges from one to three, eachgetting as many turns as you to try to take over the screen. The game has a total of 50 levels, or so we're told - ifwe'd more time we'd have made it past level 34, honest. But Bubble Revolt is so accessible that anyone can have a go- and probably do better than us to boot - and have agreat time playing.Crucially, you won't be able to resist playing levels again andagain until you conquer them, and, believe us, it's oh sosatisfying when you finally do. The great thing about the level design is that tactics that workon one level can be completely useless on the next, so you have toconstantly reassess your surroundings and strategy every time youplay.The visuals and audio are equally well-executed for a simplepuzzle game. All of the levels are fresh and brightly coloured, andthe animation of the bubbles as they jump, multiply, or indeed justget bored when you take too long to move is quite impressive. Thecutesy graphical style may not be to everyone's taste, but we thinkit does a good job of making this game appealing to fans of severaldifferent genres.The ability to record a replay of your triumph is a novelinclusion, and it's particularly useful if a friend is strugglingon a level, just to rub salt into his wounds by showing them howyou pulled off a stunning majority victory in under threeminutes.It would be better still if you could somehow send that video totheir phone as an MMS message, but seeing as that's our one majorsuggestion for improving Bubble Revolt, we're not going to complain. Vive le revolution!"}
