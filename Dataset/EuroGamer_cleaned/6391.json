It can be            absolutely brilliant, when it wants to be. Mario Kart, Mario 64,            Ocarina of Time, Metroid Prime - all games which shine brightest in            the genres they inhabit, nurture or just plain created. But there            are times when you have to wonder what in God's name the Sloth From            Kyoto is up to. The GBA software situation, for example, is a            colossal farce. A million and one SNES ports are hurting the            console in the eyes of both players and publishers, and instead of            fighting the tide with classic, original content, Nintendo is            practically leading them off the cliff! Mario Advance? Much as we            like games like Yoshi's Island and Super Mario World, we yearn for            something new.                    Sega, meanwhile, has become quite shrewd in its old age. It knows            how badly consoles can fail, and these days aims for the gaps and            exploits the obvious flaws in any console's make-up. Panzer Dragoon            Orta answered the call for classic shoot 'em ups in 3D, Super            Monkey Ball gave us an addictive and varied 3D puzzle game worth            its salt, and now Sonic Advance 2 gives 2D platform fans something            new. Not just another goddamn re-release.                    So here we go again, and we love it.        Sonic Advance 2            uses the same engine as the original Sonic Advance, recycling a            handful of art assets and introducing a boatload more, and although            the classic elements remain - the race against the clock feel, the            ring-collection, the two-hit (plus power-ups) health system, the            spike traps, the block traps, loop-the-loops and so on - the game            is faster and smoother, the level design is new and more expansive            than ever, heading in every direction quite unabashedly, and the            game has been given more replay value than a waterproof jazz mag.                    Right. Changes. It's not just Sonic and Tails, or Sonic, Tails,            Knuckles and Amy like last time: it's Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy            and Cream. You start off as the blue blur, racing through more than            a dozen levels and half a dozen boss fights trying to save the            world from Dr. Robotnik (he just never quits, does he?), but as you            continue to clobber the ageing, ginger-moustachioed super-villain            and his various contraptions, you unlock Sonic's captured chums and            chumettes, starting with Cream - who Martin fancies.                    Cream deserves the most attention as she's the new lass in town.            She's a bunny rabbit with a little chao hovering round her shoulder            called Cheese (oh God), and she can hover for a short while and lob            Cheese at enemies - which is bloody useful in boss battles, without            being advantageous enough to render the game too easy. As ever, all            the characters' abilities are specific to their design. Sonic's as            blue, blurry and fast as ever, and could be described as the least            frilly character, while Tails the fox can hover and climb through            the air for a short amount of time thanks to his spinning,            rotary-blade-style twin tails, and so on. But we can't tell you            about Amy this time; because we haven't completed the game with            each of the other four characters yet - which is what you need to            do to unlock her.        Completing            the game four times over shouldn't be too difficult though, because            although the levels are huge, and there are quite a number of them,            you can probably complete the game itself with Sonic in a few            hours. Getting 100 per cent though is very difficult, because that            involves collecting all the chaos emeralds - and you can't even            start doing that until you've claimed each of the seven special            rings spread around each stage. And they're harder to find than a            hedgehog in a hayfield. Unless it's blue.                    But despite hiding treats right at the end of the game, you can            gradually unlock bits and pieces as you go. The regular addition of            a new character opens the game up to an entirely different style of            gameplay. You'll breeze through the game like a knife through            butter under the guise of Sonic, but the chopper-like Tails allows            you to explore a bit more, seeking out those special rings, and            Cream lets you focus on your ring-collecting or points-scoring by            moving at a sensible pace and taking enemies out at a distance.                    Slightly disappointing, though, is that you only get the basic            single player game, a Time Attack mode and the basic multiplayer            mode returning from Sonic Advance to start with. It's not until you            finish the game with Sonic (or whoever) the first time, collecting            all the chaos emeralds, that you're able to head into the Chao            Garden - which can allegedly link up with both Sonic Adventure            titles on the Cube (although we weren't able to test this as Sonic            Adventure DX Director's Cut isn't out yet and we didn't receive our            copy of Sonic Adventure 2 last year - maybe we should have bought            one of the second hand copies that flooded CEX shortly after May            3rd\u2026) But the Chao Garden itself is a nice touch, allowing            you to nurture your little fellows like Tamagotchi without having            to pull a beeping, egg-shaped case out of your pocket and field            looks of disdain and pity from passengers on the 3:20 to Margate.            It should be unlocked from the start.        That            said, it's difficult to be cross with Sonic Advance 2 for this sort            of lunacy, because you genuinely will want to play it thoroughly -            and certainly beyond the extent needed to unlock the Chao Garden.            Each level is a treasure trove of hidden paths, and you'll miss            probably 75 per cent of the game if you just race from one end to            the other and then plonk the game down again for a refund. Pick up            Tails or Knuckles and venture back in, or pay more attention to            your surroundings, and you can pick out the special rings (which            are often 'hidden' on that platform you didn't bother to check            out), and you can enjoy with fanboyistic delight the various            pleasures Sega has lined up for you - like the bouncy,            tune-spilling keyboards which plonk you back and forth in the music            zone, or the way Sonic slides on his rump in the ice zone. Each            zone is lovingly crafted and so very ornate - we're trying to            finish this review quickly to get back in and play around with them            some more. [Tom's new year's resolution is to stop putting reviews            off for six months while he plays everything else out that week            -Ed]                    The boss fights, too, are varied, but rely on a central principle            which makes a nice change - you're always running. Instead of            merely having Robotnik swoop around the sky dropping bombs or            something like that, or shooting spinning spike platforms at you,            each boss battle has you trying to manage your pursuit speed so you            can jump up between attacks and score a hit. You have to be careful            not to get caught without rings, or within striking distance of            that boss's main weapon, because having to pull back on the            directional pad means heading back to the far left of the screen.            We very much enjoyed these encounters, and it's nice to see Sega            trying something new in 2D platformers all the way up here in 2003.        Visually,            Sonic Advance 2 is lush - so much so that we were actually quite            taken aback. OK, it's just Sonic Advance with bells on, but they            are very pretty bells, and coming here after spending so            much time with Sonic Mega Collection on the Cube, it's like I'm            Marty McFly. Characters are minutely detailed - from the way Tails            flips like a skateboarder when he bounces between pads to the            different ways the characters salute the player at the end of each            stage. The stages, too, are beautiful. Sega's done the Green            Hill/Leaf Zone type stage about fifteen million times, but it still            looks nice, and the ice zone is full of detailed touches like the            aforementioned rump-surfing and ran-too-far-one-way, icy            back-pedalling. The further you get, the better it looks, too - the            music zone is like Zool 2003. Speaking of music, the soundtrack            rocks. Turn it up [as much as a GBA allows - Ed].                    And the framerate is never less than superb - even when scenery is            flying past like sports cars in the opposite lane. When you go            really fast, you even get speed trails, and the various power-ups            each render an improved effect - the shield looks shinier and more            ethereal than ever, rather than a big silver bubble popping out of            the screen, and the invincibility power-up turns Sonic into a            sparkler, near enough.                    It's not just spit and polish either. Mixed in with the various            old, rehashed ideas like grinding rails are new, stage-specific            ideas, like windmills which sling the balled up character in a            particular direction like a revolving door, depending on the angle            they're approached; and the wind instruments which let the little            scamps levitate above the ground collecting rings. There's not a            pixel out of place.                    That said, there are some pixels we'd like to move, like            some of the spike traps, and the bottomless pits. We know the            series thrives on its challenge, but the first three or four zones            are a breeze, really, with only the boss challenges causing minor            headaches, before the difficulty curve turns into a difficulty            mountain - it took us about an hour to conquer the first few zones,            and about the same or more to conquer each individual one after            that. Not because the design was clever, or we were missing            something, but because spikes would pop up beneath our feet,            enemies would fly up like missiles from beneath the ground and we'd            be unable to get Sonic or whoever aligned to grind the next rail.            It's not enough to just fall in the right direction these days, and            it can be frustrating when you don't understand why you just            missed that rail and fell to your death - particularly when you're            past the checkpoint on the second stage of the zone and the Game            Boy's response is Game Over.                    That said; Sega has been very fair about recording your progress,            storing all your times, scores and level progress to the nearest            zone - with each character, too. Although technically it's            only one, effectively this means a whole five save slots,            which is quite impressive. Limit yourself and your flatmate,            sibling or spouse (yeah right) to one specific character, and            you're all set.                    So would we buy it? Already have. This is the sort of game we need            to encourage. It takes a tried, tested, and thoroughly flogged old            genre and injects some more speed and ingenuity into it, and            there's a heck of lot of replay value here, even if the game's            levels can probably be beaten in a few hours. Granted it's not            Mario 64 to what's come before it, but it's a darn sight better and            more original than 99 per cent of platformers on the GBA, and it's            probably the best 2D Sonic since the days of 16-bit.                    Beat that, Nintendo; it's about time you tried.
