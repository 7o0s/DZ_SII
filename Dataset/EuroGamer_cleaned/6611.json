It's like a subtle blend of Powerstone and            Rampage, inspired by 50s and 60s drive-in monster movies - and at            times it's unlike any other beat 'em up we've played.        The action takes place in huge cityscapes, military bases and            so on - each far from abandoned - and the player controls one of a            dozen or so eight-storey-high behemoths, from giant insects and            gorillas to lightning-based humanoids and saucer-headed robots. The            idea is to conquer your enemies, using the subtleties of each            monstrous environment to your advantage, impaling them with spikes,            avoiding their laser gunfire amongst skyscrapers and dive-bombing            craters to cause volcanic eruptions.                    You control the action with the directional pad or left analogue            stick, stomping around the environment, strafing with L1 and R1,            jumping (whether rocket/wing-assisted or not) with X, climbing            buildings or picking up and throwing objects with a tap of circle,            lashing out or firing weapons with square or triangle, and blocking            with R2. Square and X pressed together perform a short-range            special attack, which sends out a metaphysical bubble, thrusting            enemies away (useful for getting out of tight spots and repeated            beatings), while triangle and circle pressed together perform the            long-rage special attack. All of this comes remarkably naturally,            as do the game's various built-in combos - specific to each            creature - and you can also lock onto a target by pressing L1/R1            together - a vital skill, particularly as the camera has designs on            annoying you from the start.        For single players, there are adventure, free-for-all and            endurance modes, but adventure is where single players will            probably spend most of their time to begin with, as the other two            are skirmish modes of sorts. Adventure takes you through the game's            ~story~, in which Earth is invaded by aliens, B-movie style, who            are defeated by an ultimate weapon of sorts, only for their saucers            to crash to earth and cover the world in beastie-expanding            radioactive green ooze, propelling gorillas, insects, robots,            castles and even molten rock into monstrous form. Meanwhile, the            aliens regroup and continue their invasion, as the US army (who            else?) and their chums struggle to mop up the monster menace.                    Each level involves overcoming a monster or series of monsters,            with various hazards like the armed forces, sentry guns and            electric fences to contend with. You do this by attacking with your            basic attacks and objects (cars, buses, small planes, water towers,            bits of crumbling masonry, boulders, etc), and stringing together            combos which send them crashing into walls, buildings (which start            to crumble and eventually fall - something you can tend to yourself            if you like), and the aforementioned environmental hazards. Pointed            objects like radio antennae can be used to impale enemies,            rendering them dizzy for a short period of time, and a particularly            intense clobbering will often have the same effect.                    Apart from various arrays of enemies from the selectable roster,            you also face three rather nasty bosses, which vary in difficulty -            the final boss took plenty of attempts, but handily the game lets            you continue trying a level without restarting it a number of            times, before you eventually run out of lives and have to start it            afresh. Or not so handily - the adventure mode took us roughly two            hours to polish off with the Joe Young-derived gorilla, and            although you amass plenty of 'Battle Points' to unlock new            costumes, levels for multiplayer, and mini-games, and get to see a            character-specific end sequence, it isn't something you're likely            to do regularly enough to justify \u00a340.        Fortunately there's plenty more to the game if you can find a            likeminded PS2 fan willing to engage in some two-player. Although            limiting the game to two-player multiplayer is an obvious oversight            (particularly with firewire and online networks available or nearly            available), it's relationship-threateningly addictive and pretty            well handled. Because the nature of the game often has enemies at            complete opposite ends of the map, the game camera tries to keep            you both on-screen where possible, and splits it off into two            sections if you drift too far apart, like Incog's previous efforts            in Twisted Metal Black. It's a much better alternative to having            the camera zoom into outer space, and although occasionally the two            overlap, and you can't help feel a little more tweaking is needed            here and there, it's a good system.                    The multiplayer is worryingly addictive too. Rounds last anything            from minutes to hours depending on the quality of the players            involved, and things can get very strategic. Say you're low on            health - do you scamper around looking for green health pick-ups,            and risk straying into the path of your robotic adversary's            staccato laser volleys? Do you rip down the nearest building for            the pick-ups within, thus flattening the landscape and giving your            enemy a better shot at you? Or do you keep your distance and wait            for some to respawn? There are a million and one things to keep            track of, not least of all your own health and energy bars, which            need regular attention.                    Even if you're on your own and can't be bothered with the adventure            mode though, there's still plenty of fun to be had - a testament to            the quality of the computer AI. Enemies don't just chase after you            until they're pummelled; they seek cover, go after health pick-ups            just as frequently as you, and even team up with their mates.            What's more, they will often wait on the sidelines until you're            under attack and then jump in to catch you at a disadvantage. It's            refreshing to actually come across enemies with a bit of skill and            guile, even if it's frustrating to have one scamper away and            rejuvenate itself after a tough battle.        Of course, a game            like War of the Monsters wouldn't be much fun without visuals to            match, and fortunately Incog has managed just that. Each level is            brimming with detail. The Las Vegas level, for example, is an orgy            of flickering neon, with casinos, skyscrapers, traffic zigzagging            all over the place in chaos, and even a giant, replica Excalibur            sword to rip out of the grounds of a hotel and pulverise one            another with. Even simpler levels like the Area 51-inspired            military installation - venue of the first boss fight - with its            giant ant's nest (no, the boss isn't an ant), canyon-like            surroundings and hulking great boulders are ornate enough to keep            you entertained for hours. The arenas bask in a superfluity of            elements, and virtually everything contributes to the battle in            some way, with only a handful of pixels wasted - and usually wasted            to some grin-worthy effect.                    You could argue that the textures and geometry aren't much to shout            about, but buildings disintegrate to leave a huge variety of            scattered remains, the dioramas are always vividly imagined and            never look shabby, the draw distance is great, the framerate is            almost uniformly solid and there's great variety throughout. There            were only a couple of stages we didn't get on with, one set on a            UFO and one in a volcano - but the rest we loved. Incidentally, our            only real concern with the graphics at all was the character            animations, which seem less varied than their surroundings. That's            not to knock the characters themselves though, which would look            totally at home in a drive-in, black and white stompy monster            movie, and is probably just a product of our playing the same            characters for hours on end and getting used to them. We can hardly            complain about the mighty gorilla, who swings his arms around and            roars just like the real, eight-storey-tall version when            celebrating victory. Or something.                    The sounds, too, are equally good, with screams, gurgles and plenty            of crash, bang and wallop-worthy noises, and the soundtrack is            almost perfect in its rendition of the dun-dun-daaaan wannabe            grandiosity of B-movie intensity.                    War of the Monsters is, like Powerstone before it, a beat 'em up            which does enough to be new. It's not a new concept really, but            it's very well executed, and everybody will enjoy its monster movie            stylings. It's a shame that there isn't more variety in the single            player adventure mode, with only the end sequence changing for each            character, that there aren't more characters, and that the (very            expensive) unlockable mini-games are less endearing than the barrel            and car slapping antics of Street Fighter II a decade ago, but most            of our criticisms are because we've spent hour after hour wearing            it all thin. If you want a serious complaint, then we'd like the            combo system to be more accessible - this is definitely one of            those engaging but restrictive games, which demands endless hours            from players, perhaps even beyond what's genuinely entertaining.            All the same, we want another War of the Monsters, and we want you            all to seriously consider buying this one in the meantime. Roar!"}
