Before that            though you were a famous wizard, imbued with magical powers as a            child by your stepmum, who just happened to be a dragon. So it's            not entirely a surprise to find yourself resurrected to face a new            menace which is threatening your former homeland and robbing            the underworld of fresh souls. Welcome to the decidely odd world of            Gorasul...                        Firing up Gorasul for the first time you are faced by an outraged            sounding man demanding to know if ~you think this is a game~. At            this point you will no doubt start to wonder what you've let            yourself in for. Perplexity will rapidly give way to worry as he            follows up this challenge by questioning whether this is ~a tale            told by humans, a game designed by humans~, or actually the result            of some kind of transdimensional portal. Veteran gamers may start            to suffer flashbacks of Omikron : The Nomad Soul, and you may even            find your hand subconsciously reaching for the uninstall option in            an attempt to save you from further mental scarring. This            temptation you should resist.                        Yes, the game loses a little in the translation from its native            German, and at first the opening cinematics may sound somewhat            pretentious .. or just plain embarrassing, depending on your            mindset. The lengthy voice-over which continues to ramble on about            dragons and the undead as you fumble your way around the obscure            low resolution menu system is a tad goofy, and it gets            increasingly annoying once you realise that you will have to put up            with it every time you load the game. But once you get past these            initial niggles the game hiding behind the clunky exterior is            actually rather entertaining.                    The first piece of good news is that Gorasul doesn't always take            itself very seriously, a fact which you will be left in absolutely            no doubt of should you reach the frankly bizarre final scene. Some            of the humour is misplaced (it is German, after all) but enough of            the jokes hit the mark to raise a smile and lift the otherwise            rather oppressive atmosphere of doom and gloom pervading            throughout.                        The world of Gorasul is a dismal place at the best of times, and            this is far from its finest hour. Undead are crawling out of the            ground everywhere, the dwarves are at war with the giants, the ice            elves are freezing thanks to a broken doohickey and a boy has            fallen down a well. Naturally it's up to you to solve all of these            problems, while simultaneously trying to track down an evil wizard            and assemble a circle of powerful magicians to break his spell and            save the world. Or something.                        Along the way you'll find a village overrun by hell hounds, bandits            smuggling weapons, elven architects squabbling over blueprints for            a new school, and wizards' apprentices breaking any number of            health and safety regulations by dumping poisonous chemicals in an            abandoned mine, contaminating the local water supply in the            process. Quests vary from exploring a ruined temple and defending a            village of surprisingly enterprising kobolds to recovering some            overdue library books. It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do            it.                    At the heart of this adventure is Roszondas, a human raised by            dragons, but in true role-playing tradition several other            characters are scattered around the world, and up to three of them            may accompany you at any one time. Some will stay with you for as            long as you want them to, others will abandon you once you've            helped them to complete a specific task.                        Your characters are surprisingly autonomous, casting spells and            bravely running away from enemies without any prompting from            yourself, although they are unable to use items from their            inventory such as healing potions without a direct order. These            actions can be controlled to some extent by discussing ~combat            tactics~ with each of the characters in turn, telling them whether            to focus on offensive or defensive magic, whether to hold any mana            in reserve or to let the particle effects fly free, and whether            they should close in for hand-to-hand combat, stay at a safe            distance or try to escape if their health falls below a set level.                        Unfortunately your companions don't always seem to pay much            attention to your choice of tactics, particularly when it comes to            which spells to cast and when, but it does take some of the load            off your back and avoids the game turning into a point-and-click            fest. Combat is fairly fast and furious and battles can involve a            dozen or more enemies, which sometimes seems a little unfair,            especially in the early stages of the game when your characters are            relatively weak and too poor to support their burgeoning addiction            to healing potions.                    Evening up the odds are a wide range of magical items, weapons,            armour and skills. Having chosen Rossie's character class at the            start of the game and applied spare points to his various            attributes (the usual strength, dexterity, constitution, charisma            et al) you will discover two of Gorasul's little extras.                        First up are dragon skills, a range of sadly uncontrollable            abilities which Rossie has inherited from his stepmum which can            prove handy in a tough spot. Dragon Strength will give you a            temporary boost in combat when you most need it, while near death            experiences can kick off Dragon Breath, which does exactly what it            says on the can. Dragon Fear encourages your enemies to flee when            their health drops, and finally increasing your Dragon Eye skill            will allow you to see further and spot useful items on the            mini-map.                        Secondly you have an intelligent weapon which will accompany you            throughout the game, with a choice of anything from an axe or            warhammer to a dagger or bow. Like characters, your weapon gains            experience from any fight it's used in and its abilities rise            throughout the game, giving Rossie bonuses to his dexterity,            increasing the chance of critical hits or reducing the frequency of            your trips to the local blacksmith to get it fixed. You can even            make it smarter, resulting in more sarcastic comments and the            occasional useful tip. Sadly this isn't fully exploited, as helpful            suggestions tend to be few and far between, but it's an interesting            idea that adds character (and an extra layer of stats) to the game.                    Gorasul may not be the prettiest role-playing game we've ever seen            and it's not likely to win any prizes for its dialogue either,            although a recent patch improves the quality of the English            translation somewhat. It's also not quite as epic as the four CDs            and 2.5Gb full install option may suggest - although I didn't            complete every little side quest, I did make my way through the            game's main storyline and saw most of the sights in under a week.            It's no Baldur's Gate, but Gorasul is an enjoyable if comparatively            short-lived adventure which is well worth delving into.                        -        Gorasul                    screenshotsGorasul                    screenshots"}
