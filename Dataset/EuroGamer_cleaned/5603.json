If the adventure was heavily loaded                 with statistics and featured armour-clad knights stomping                 around saying ~verily~ a lot, you could be certain it was a                 western developed RPG running on the PC.                    If, however, you where faced with large milky-eyed characters with            blue spikey hair, an emotional tear jerking plot, and days of            leveling your character up, then you would know you were deeply            involved with a Japanese RPG, and you would probably be playing it            on a console.                    Unsurprisingly, since the massive success of Final Fantasy VII on            the PC we are starting to see these two styles cross-fertilizing,            with western developed but Japanese styled creations like Silver            and now Septerra Core throwing traditional RPG categories out of            the window. Unfortunately the flawed Silver showed that, while the            visuals and style of the Japanese masters can be replicated, the            soul of the characters and the intricate storytelling of our            eastern cousins is a tougher nut to crack.                    Septerra Core's bizarre setting is a promising start, the world of            Septerra being made up of seven separate continents stacked up            above one another, and all orbiting the central living computer            core which gives the game its title. These independent zones offer            some fantastic varieties to the locations, with each layer            distinctively different from the last as you travel on your way to            this mysterious core at the center of the world.                    An ancient prophecy that the core will one day be unlocked,            bestowing great powers on the one who finds the key. A rich and            greedy faction known as the Chosen who reside on the continent            farthest from the core believe it is their destiny to unlock the            core, and so begin their journey to the center of the world.                    Our hero is a young scavenger girl named Maya who lives off the            cast aside refuse that falls from the Chosen's shell on to her own            land orbiting below. Maya witnesses the Chosen fleets travelling            towards the core, and from that moment is drawn unwittingly into            the prophecy...         While all this                 talk of prophecy and keys draws on fantasy ethics, Septerra                 leans more towards science fiction and cyberpunk, with                 traditional magic and spells sitting alongside spaceships and                 big guns. Most of these extended abilities and weapons draw on                 an essence known as ~Core Power~, and it is the distribution                 of this resource that is the most unique part of this game.                    As you travel through the lands you will come across characters            willing to join up and assist you in your quest. These new members            will bring in more of the Core Power, and crucially these extra            points can be utilised by the whole party, opening up stronger            attacks for everyone.                    Many of these special attacks are in the form of magic spells,            learned from the fate cards that are scattered along your quest.            There are over twenty of these cards to discover, including a            summon spell similar to Final Fantasy VII's awesome range of            summoning materia.         This special attack system                 works very well indeed, but unfortunately the rest of combat                 fails to keep up the pace. Unlike many games of this style, in                 Septerra Core your enemies are visible on screen before you                 encounter them. It's often possible to avoid them, and this                 becomes a god send after enduring only the first few battles.                    Once engaged your party and the creature(s) will move into a set            combat stance and start pasting each other in timed attack rounds.            You are given the choice to make frequent but weak attacks, or to            wait exposed for several turns to make a more powerful strike at            the enemy.                    While it may sound more engaging than battles in other role playing            games, it makes the flow of combat sadly jilted, and fights are            predictable and excruciatingly slow. Even worse are the limited and            repetitive animations that your members perform throughout combat -            it is utterly painful to watch, and there is no way of speeding the            action up.                    You will soon find yourself desperately trying to avoid combat just            to spare yourself the nail-pulling torture of the badly animated            encounter.                         Everything else about the game follows traditional console RPG                 rules.                    You must ask questions from everyone you meet that isn't hostile.            You also make friends who will join the quest, though some of these            don't get on with each other, and the infighting can be a welcome            relief. Time must also be spent repeatedly attacking weaker foes in            order to ~level up~ to be able to tackle a stronger enemy you must            fight to progress the plot.                    Communication with the denizens of Septerra is voiced rather than            presented in text, and while this might appeal to lazier players it            really does limit the number of dialog options available. You will            only ever get two or three options when talking to a new character,            you will most likely ask each in turn, and that's your lot.                    There is none of the deep and complex inquiries found in recent            roleplayers like Planescape Torment, and that really limits the            credibility and depth of character of the personalities you meet on            your travels.         These limitations aren't just                 annoyances unfortunately - a strong plot is fundamental to                 this kind of adventure, and while the background world and                 accompanying visuals are vivid, well constructed and                 imaginative, they aren't supported by believable characters                 and an interesting plot.                    The spoken dialog is at times so badly acted, and the story so            complex, that in the end you simply stop caring about the            uninteresting characters under your control.                    It seems that western developers can almost match the visual style            and splendour of the Japanese old hands, but they simply can't            follow it all through and provide a gripping story and intuitive            play system.                    If Final Fantasy VII and VIII are happy memories for you, do            yourself a favour and give Septerra Core a miss.                        -                            Gunlok preview                    Gunlok preview                    Odium review                    Odium review                    Planescape Torment review                    Planescape Torment review"}
