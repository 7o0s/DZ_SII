It was hard to see how Vicarious Visions might overcome            these troubles. The forced perspective was a thorn in the side of            THPS2, an otherwise fantastic title, and has duly reappeared in the            inevitable sequel.                         Trouble is, the problem has gotten a whole lot worse in Tony            Hawk's Pro Skater 3, as the levels are enormous by comparison.            Getting hopelessly lost is easy when you can't see where you're            going, and the sheer amount to explore and discover in each of the            game's seven levels will be daunting to even the most seasoned of            THPS masters.                         This is bad, but deceptively so. Nobody could have expected            Vicarious Visions to completely alleviate the perspective problems,            and so casting that aside we have a wonderfully competent port,            which explores the original's features admirably. In fact, if you            already own or have played THPS3 you might be pleasantly surprised            to find out the sections and objectives Vicarious have adjusted in            order to make the GBA version more suited to the platform.                    The complexities of the larger levels are particularly well            realised in maps with varying surface heights to explore, such as            the Foundry. Instead of drawing the upper gantries over the already            confusing floor layout, access to this area is granted through the            completion of a certain objective, giving you access to a lift and            subsequently new areas to explore.                         Graphically, THPS3 is a stunning achievement. The levels            practically bustle with colour and effects like coloured lighting            tinting your player as he rolls by, and particles of sparks and            grass flying from surfaces. The detail of each intricately modelled            skater has also increased. Not only are the characters bigger, but            the fully 3D rendered models are also texture-mapped down to the            very last detail. If you don't like the way your board-bound buddy            looks, you can customise not only clothes, but skin and hair colour            too, and even add tattoos and change their face in the Create A            Skater menu.                         Controlling your skater and pulling off miraculous acrobatics is            as intuitive as we have come to expect from the series, though the            challenge is again increased in the handheld port, as lining up for            vert ramps and rails and jumping for icons (like the S-K-A-T-E            letters or extra statistic points for customising your character            skills) is a great deal trickier from an isometric perspective.            However, the handling and feel of the game is slick, and new            additions to the control of your character such as the Revert            (allowing you to link tricks from a vertical ramp to other            ground-based methods of point grabbing), fit in seamlessly.                    Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is again a splendid port. The problem of            getting used to the perspective is something that the player must            overcome personally, as the game itself is not to be missed. This            is an addictive, engaging and downright impressive title, ideal for            a quick burn on the tube or bus, and exploring the fabulously            designed levels at length adds untold longevity to the equation."}
