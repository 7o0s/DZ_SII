Well, eight months later I've finally got            around to playing through the game again, but this time round it            was on an Xbox.                        Max Payne could almost have been made with the Xbox in mind. A            triumph of style over substance with gorgeous graphics shown off to            maximum effect thanks to the introduction of Matrix-style bullet            time\u2122 sequences, it was a fun but ultimately shallow and at            times frustrating action game. The bad news is that the recently            released Xbox version of the game is a half-hearted affair, a            virtually straight port which fails to correct any of Max's            shortcomings while adding a couple of new problems all of its own.                        As before you step into the boots of one of New York's finest, a            bizarrely named undercover agent for the DEA caught in a web of            double crosses, drug dealing mobsters and sinister corporations.            Within the first hour the game has run through almost every            clich\u00e9 of Hong Kong cinema and classic Film Noir; Max is now            on his own, seeking revenge for the death of his wife and child,            with both the police and the mafia on his tail.                    Throughout the game your story is told by short comic book style            cutscenes which you will either love or hate, with cringe-inducing            Raymond Chandler inspired dialogue, flat monotone voice acting, and            artwork derived from photographs of the developers and their            friends goofing around pulling funny faces and pointing guns at            each other.                        Between these plot dumps the focus is very much on run and gun            action, and this is where the game works best. Max has an array of            semi-realistic weapons at his disposal, from Beretta and Desert            Eagle pistols through pump action shotguns to assault rifles and            grenade launchers, and the results are inevitably spectacular as            you unleash a hail of lead on your enemies. Mafia hitmen, special            forces types, corporate security guards and sinister suits all            stand in your way, and their AI is generally fairly good, apart            from having a habit of occasionally blowing themselves up with            grenades, shooting at you through pipes, or merrily            wandering single file through a doorway and into your swinging            baseball bat.                        What sets Max apart from the swarm of bland shooters out there            though is the inclusion of a bullet time meter, which gradually            builds up as you kill more and more bad guys. Once activated it            slows down time, allowing you to make like Chow Yun Fat or Keanu            Reeves, dodging bullets as they make their lazy way through the            air, and allowing you more time to aim your own shots, making every            round count. By pressing the appropriate button and moving at the            same time you can also pull off John Woo style leaps, flying            through the air backwards, forwards or sideways in slow motion,            guns blazing as the expended rounds clink off the floor one after            another. During these slo-mo sessions even the audio changes, a            nice touch which gives the battle a surreal muffled sound.                    Unfortunately Remedy's other attempts at being different are rather            hit and miss. Take the nightmare sequences, for example, where you            find yourself running around inside Max Payne's subconscious. These            make an interesting change of pace and are certainly a very arty            way of portraying Max's guilt over his wife's death, but part of            the recurring dream is following a maze of blood trails above a            bottomless pit, with the crying of a baby looping over and over            again in the background as you try to avoid stumbling from the            narrow tightrope of gore into the nothingness below. Needless to            say this soon gets bloody irritating.                        Another scene sees you trapped in a restaurant rigged with            incendiary devices, but for the most part the game gives you no            visual cues to show you where the gasoline trails are on the ground            or where the flames will appear next. Because of this the whole            level becomes quick load city as you desperately try to make it            across a room without being burnt to a crisp, then quick save, run            down a corridor, get blown up for no discernable good reason,            reload, continue and repeat. It's less about skill and reactions            than trial and error, and again it can become frustrating.                        Death frequently comes with little warning in Max Payne, which can            leave you feeling cheated at times. You can be blown up by a            grenade thrown by a hidden enemy, with only the slightest tinkling            as it hits the ground a second before it detonates to warn you that            you're about to be sent flying across the room in a shower of            debris. Getting out of the blast radius in time is often            impossible, especially if you can't even see where the grenade has            landed. Laser tripwires are another menace, as they can be            virtually invisible from certain angles. Even cutscenes can prove            fatal, with enemies jumping you from behind as a cinematic comes to            an end, leaving you flailing to turn round before Max is peppered            with bullets. Meanwhile black clad enemies can lurk in black            corners of black lit levels, blasting you with black shotguns. Some            sections are so dark that I had to reach for the remote to turn up            the brightness on my TV set to compensate.                    Which brings us nicely to the problems which are unique to the Xbox            version of Max Payne. These can be summed up by one word - memory.            Or rather lack thereof. The developers were apparently unable or            simply unwilling to cram the requisite data into the Xbox's 64Mb of            unified memory, as a result of which most levels are cut up into            two or three smaller console-friendly chunks.                        Max was already a very linear experience on the PC, but on the Xbox            (and the PS2 for that matter) you are practically on rails. You can            walk through a door and be whisked away to a new section of the map            without any warning whatsoever, and when the loading screen            vanishes you will find that the door has conveniently locked itself            behind you. Not only does this prevent you from backtracking to            recover additional supplies, it also overwrites your one and only            quick save position, which can leave you floundering with low            health or ammunition. On the harder difficulty levels this could            easily prove fatal.                        In fact very little effort seems to have gone into porting Max            Payne to the Xbox, with the sliced up levels the only obvious            change. The graphics which wowed us a year ago aren't quite so            remarkable alongside the likes of Halo, the drab box-like cars and            endless rooms full of crates a bit bland by comparison. Despite            this a few of the levels still suffer from slack framerates, which            is pretty disappointing given that the Xbox's hardware is much more            capable than the PCs we were playing Max on last summer. Perhaps            most embarrassing of all, there are even second-long pauses during            the comic book cutscenes as the Xbox loads data off the DVD,            interrupting the background music and temporarily blanking the            screen. I guess the developers never thought of caching this data            before it was needed?                    Sadly the translation from PC to console hasn't been entirely            smooth for Max Payne, and although the fully customisable controls            are surprisingly easy to use on the standard Xbox gamepad, the rest            of the conversion has been rather sloppy. Max lacks the necessary            polish to stand out on the Xbox, and the passing of time hasn't            been kind to his bullet-riddled good looks. If your PC can't take            the heat then this is the next best way to experience the Payne,            but it doesn't fare so well on its own merits.                        Note : the screenshots in this review are actually taken from the            PC version of the game, but you'll be hard pressed to spot any            difference.
