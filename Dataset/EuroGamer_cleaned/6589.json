Guiding all manner of tiny racing vehicles around            increasingly improbable locales may look a bit old school in this            more demanding era, but releasing a spangly version on the GBA            makes perfect sense.                    Given that it's been released on just about every platform over the            past 10 years since its Mega Drive debut, the chances are you'll            already be very familiar with how the game works; a selection of            modes (Race, MicroMachines, Time Trial, and Bomb Tag), a bunch of            characters, and five classes of vehicle (Car, Bike, 4x4, Boat,            Sports Car). Quick Race allows you to jump into any mode and any of            the tracks you've unlocked (only the one to start with, which is a            tad tight) and drive with one of the five initially available            characters.                    Race Mode, as the name suggests, is a swift five lap race around            the miniature courses, with four cars battling it out for the            finish line, which can be against a mixture of human or CPU            opponents, depending on whether you have the required kit.            MicroMachines mode is the traditional version of the game whereby            you have to score the most points (up to a maximum of eight) within            the five lap limit - either knocking your opponent off the track to            their doom, or getting a whole screen ahead of them. Meanwhile, the            one player Time Trial mode is a great way of hotting up on            individual tracks, giving you a tough time limit to adhere to,            while the rather superfluous Bomb Tag mode is another one-to-four            player battle, which starts with one player 'tagged' Hot Potato            style, with the goal to get rid of the bomb by crashing into other            players before the time elapses.                    With only one track available in any of the various Quick Race            modes, you're forced to indulge in the Championship Mode in order            to unlock the other 15 available. The same four flavours of racing            are available, but this time with various punishments and rewards            depending on how you fare. Failure in MicroMachines is almost a            given to begin with, and to unlock more than a couple of tracks            requires a serious amount of patience and no small amount of skill.            With just four lives to last you the entire 16 race, four cup            championship, there's very little chance to practise the next            tracks before you're swiftly booted out. Whatever you do unlock            will become available in the Quick Race mode, so you can (and will)            go back to this mode in order to practise. After the fourth race,            you're then deemed to have moved out of the Bronze Cup category and            onto the Silver, before eventually working your way through Gold            and - if you're lucky - Platinum.                    To begin with, you can't help but be tremendously impressed with            MicroMachines, especially with the benefit of the really rather            wonderful GBA SP [where's my GBA SP, Kristan? -Tom]. Everything            just suits the handheld so well; the controls are slick and            responsive, and the graphics are crisp, clear, colourful - and            other words beginning with C. It's no lazy port, either, with 3D            backgrounds that put to shame most other titles we've seen on the            system. Developer Infinite Dreams has clearly put a lot of effort            into the project and your early impressions are that this could be            one of the machine's essential games.                    Veterans of the series will also recall that destructive power-ups            litter the track; such as the Fireball, Electric Shock or the            Boxing Glove, which predictably allow you to fry your opponent or            knock them off the track, thus giving you a few crucial seconds            advantage. Letters lay on the track, which if picked up give you            access to some temporary power-ups, such as improved steering,            speed or grip. The cocksure driver can even bet the letters they            have accumulated before the race in order to gain even more letters            - failure, however, will not only lose you a life, but the currency            too, so it's a risky business.        It's around about this            point that you find out that the game has been made prohibitively            difficult to allow for any frivolous activities. Not only is it            outrageously hard but, crime of crimes, it has a ridiculously            restrictive password save system to rub sulphuric acid into            the gaping wounds. Obviously the expense of a battery back-up            system was deemed too costly, and your chances of enjoying the game            disappear with this baffling decision. As a result, if you do make            the fatal mistake of losing/forgetting the code given to you after            the fourth race you will be forced to unlock everything all over            again. Although the races are very short, often taking just            over a minute, the CPU skill level is stupendously tough beyond the            first few stages.                    Through iron will and determination you might just get luck enough,            but the margin for error is Rizla paper thin; make one tiny mistake            (most likely a forced error caused by the cheating,            Schumacher-esque CPU drivers) and you lose a life for daring not to            finish first, and with just four lives at your disposal, it won't            be long before you're desperately practising the problem tracks to            get some kind of competitive advantage, but it's mostly in vain            thanks to the inability of the developer to recognise that the CPU            AI is way too hard. Believe it or not, there is no skill level            modifier. Bizarre. If you can find cheats and have three other            mates willing to buy this, then you've got yourself one of the            GBA's finest multiplayer games, but as a single player game you're            in for one hell of a rough ride.                    How something as fundamental as a decent save game mechanic and a            skill level modifier can be overlooked is beyond us, but they help            ruin a superb game that would've otherwise been one of the            machine's finest, most compulsive games. In the words of Richard            Wilson, I don't believe it.                            MicroMachines screenshots (GBA)                                    MicroMachines screenshots (GBA)"}
