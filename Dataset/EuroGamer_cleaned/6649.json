Now Empire has entered the            diesel-guzzling arena with ~Big Mutha Truckers~, an arcade racer            with strategic trading elements. Armed with just a half-melted            Yorkie bar, I jumped into my rig to find out just what in tarnation            the fuss is all about.        Poor old Ma Jackson is getting too old to                 operate the family business - the aptly named 'Big Mutha                 Truckers'. She gathers her four young'uns together and gives                 them sixty days to terrorise Hick State County, doing whatever                 it takes to make a buck. Whoever earns the most money will                 take over the business. You have to pick from the unlikeliest                 of challengers; Cletus, Rawkus, Earl and the obligatory                 over-breasted female character Bobbie-Sue. There is no real                 advantage to picking one character over another; you just get                 different cabin d\u00e9cor and differing views from the                 natives.                    There are two game modes in BMT, the central one being the 'Trial            By Truckin' mode, but there is also the 'Mission' mode, which            simply allows you to play through the various missions given to you            in the main game. The inclusion of a straight racing mode or time            challenge would have been nice, but you do get to race against            other trucks in the main game anyway.                    Once you've chosen your alter-ego, you are briefed by Ma Jackson            herself, and you're off! You begin the game with cargo already on            board, and it is up to you where you go from BMT HQ to sell it.            There are only a handful of towns to go to, but the overall map is            impressively large. Once at a town you not only get the chance to            buy and sell goods, you can also upgrade your rig at the garage            with more efficient brakes, turbo boosters etc, etc. A bar can be            visited where you can play on the fruit machine to foolishly            fritter your money, or pick up a loan from the local sharks. You            also get handy tips from the bar workers of which towns are lacking            what product, and pick up special missions too.        To upgrade your rig quickly, you're best off                 going for the loan option, but as you'd expect you have to pay                 this back fairly pronto so you'd better hope to be earning                 some money and soon. Failure to repay will result in your rig                 being hit for home runs by the local baseball bat crew, until                 finally it gets repossessed and the game is over. A far more                 sensible approach is to simply trade from the very start. The                 trading system is a little simplistic, but effective, and                 you'll be raking in the dosh in no time. Be warned though,                 each visit to a town constitutes one whole day, so you really                 need to find out which towns are selling which goods early to                 make full use of your time.                    It's not just about trading though - you also get hefty rewards for            winning the various race challenges set by other truckers, and the            missions pay well too. In addition to this you can find yourself            sparring with the local police, (you actually have to blow them up            to get any peace), and if you annoy the bikers they will come after            you too. You have to shake these dudes off before they climb onto            your truck and jack your cargo if allowed to get to your cabin.                    Graphically, BMT is hard to fault with the towns and connecting            road scenery all looking extremely nice. There are big frame-rate            dips, but thankfully this is infrequent and certainly not enough to            spoil the game. The only really disappointing thing is that with            all the nice scenery whizzing past you can't really see enough of            it due to the camera's questionable vantage point. You do have four            modes to pick from, but while the default third person mode is the            best to use, it is also somewhat oddly the most restrictive.            Switching to in-cabin view is a hopelessly unplayable option, but            amusing when you see the various states of untidiness of all four            rigs. But they key reason for using the default third person view            is simply the size of your rear end.        Controlling the trucks is a little bit                 cumbersome at first, but soon becomes a breeze; you just have                 to get that car driving thought out of your head! It is                 actually quite fun once you get the hang of it, but when you                 steer hard you've got a whole lot of rear to keep under                 control. It is by no means a simulation, but is convincing                 enough to require a different mindset to your normal racer. It                 can be quite amusing when you get yourself in what I call The                 Pendulum Situation, where your cargo is swinging crazily from                 left to right as you try to correct the steering. What isn't                 amusing is that when you crash, the time it takes to get                 yourself facing forwards again can be excruciatingly                 frustrating, and the cause of many mission failures.                    All this hard truckin' wouldn't be any fun without some foot            stomping music, and this is one area where BMT scores highly with a            GTA3 style selectable radio. This plays anything from Deep Purple's            'Smoke on the Water' to your typical bluegrass style. There is a            fair amount of bleeped out hick swearing on one of the stations,            which may upset some people, but it tickled me pink for some            reason. Which reminds me of the voice acting - overall, it's very            nicely done, with lots of good humoured stereotyping going on. But            what is going on with the lack of mouth movement when the            characters speak? That's just plain weird Cletus!                    Sadly, victory is a long ways off for budding truckers, and I often            found myself thinking I was doing really well only to visit Ma            Jackson and discover I was in last place. What's more, though the            game is initially good fun, there just isn't enough variety to            sustain interest for too long, and I can't see myself picking it up            again anytime soon for another blast. With a little more content            this could well have been a winner, but ultimately this one is            bound for the shelf of doom. It's certainly worth a rental, but I            would find it hard to recommend a purchase.        Big Mutha                    Truckers screenshotsBig Mutha                    Truckers screenshots"}
