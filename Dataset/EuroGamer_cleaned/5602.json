Initial observations would            indicate some sort of Tomb Raider / X-Files hybrid, but things are            far less brazen and much more fantastical than those two titles.                    In fact, one of Nocturne's biggest virtues is that it can't be            nailed to the post of a specific genre. The game uses a very            tongue-in-cheek attitude to present an action-orientated adventure            through gothic mansions and the shadowy countryside, starring a            lead character with more depth than most. Communicating the things            that make Nocturne such an exceptional title in but a few            paragraphs amounts to a pretty big task.                    The game is akin to a serial television series, to which            comparisons will be drawn with the X-Files. The game offers you a            speculative story to enter into and lets you play through four            episodes of action, each of which could quite happily constitute an            entire game in itself - you won't complete any of them in a day.                    Your character, Stranger, works for a group called The Spookhouse,            a super-secret government agency that deals with all matters            supernatural. Things like vampires, werewolves and the ilk. The            premise is that this foundation has existed since the early 1900s            as a preventative group for dealing with and establishing amiable            links with the supernatural. If you can't conquer, destroy, or            something not dissimilar.                    Each episode starts off with an in-game explanation of the plot.            The peculiarities of your own character's name are the least of            your concerns, as from thereon in things get increasingly            bizarre...         Guiding your man (with or without a companion) through the            episodes is easy going at first - you are moving Tomb Raider-like            through a sumptuously detailed landscape and fighting off hoards of            nasties.                    I certainly do mean sumptuous - Nocturne's graphics are some of the            best that I saw in 1999, and they give anything this side of the            big 2K a run for its money as well.                    The patented techniques used to depict your character's dynamically            folding and rippling cape are impressive enough attractions in            themselves, and each rendered environment is truly impressive. The            game is definitely aimed at the Film Noir buffs with its dark plot            and shadowy characters.                    Sonically too, Nocturne excels. Bubbling brooks, rustling leaves,            the clinking of metal bullet cases hitting the floor, everything            adds to the psuedo-realism. The gravely masculine voice of the            Stranger is very morbid too; Ghostbusters this most certainly            isn't.                    The dialogue between characters mid-game is pleasant and provides a            lot more plot advancement than the usual level, cutscene, level,            cutscene formula. Like any good adventure game, such segregation of            plot and gameplay is blasphemy, and rightly so.                    The air of unpredictability keeps you on the edge of your seat.            Nocturne is more of an adventure game with integrated action            segments really. These sequences are complemented by your armoury,            which can include anything from Silver-Bullet revolvers to            Light-Guns for vampire disposal, and a lot of other unusual            concoctions depending on the mission you are faced with.                    Stranger's movement is smooth, but as with earlier incarnations of            Tomb Raider, the responsiveness is a little touchy. I would have            liked for him to fire the instant I pressed Ctrl, but instead I            could feel a slight gap between cause and effect. Almost like a            bump in the game.         The encounters are tough ones - hordes of Werewolves beset you            in the first episode's German forest, and can quite easily            overpower you.                    Once you've run out of Silver Bullets, you had better hope that            your counterpart, the half-Vampire, can soak up a little of the            damage; your frailty is a hindrance in those situations.                    The difficulty level can become very frustrating at times, even            erring on the side of the unachievable. I don't mind the occasional            repeated frustration and lengthy overcoming of problems, but I'm            always disappointed when the solution never presents itself within            a sensible timescale, or just consists of firing until you hit the            right spot.                    Thankfully there's little anticlimax, quite an achievement for such            a fantastical backdrop. The game lives up to its own grandeur, with            enormous set pieces and moments of sheer awe. The sinister            undertones of conspiracy that made the X-Files so depressing are            also pleasingly absent. You do what you do and accept it, however            unusual your line of work seems.                    Complaints about Nocturne are few and far between. There's the odd            technicality, and if you intend to do a full install it will take            up over a gigabyte of space! Aside from that it's a surprisingly            compelling title.                    For the most part Nocturne is an entertaining single player            adventure title with sinister undertones. That it sometimes resorts            to pistol slinging is something of a disappointment, but for a            title of its originality and flair, such irritations can be            forgiven."}
