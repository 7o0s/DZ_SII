As a result of Sega's state of flux in Europe since its withdrawal            from the hardware market, it has seen its games handled by all            manner of industry players including Sony, Bigben, Infogrames and            Acclaim. Suffice to say that its games have not received the focus            they deserve, and in some cases - as with Virtua Tennis 2 - caused            a conflict of interest, with Sony washing its hands of distribution            duties while it fulfilled its duties on Namco's vastly inferior            Smash Court Tennis.                    Luckily for the millions of PS2 owners out there, Acclaim has            managed to pluck this gem from Sega's vaults as part of a multiple            title deal, also encompassing Virtua Cop Elite and Sega Bass            Fishing Duel.                    Unlike Acclaim's other PS2 Sega titles (Crazy Taxi, 18 Wheeler),            the porting duties have been handled by the original developer - in            this case Hitmaker. Thus, we have a totally faithful conversion            that proves, yet again, that the Dreamcast was a machine well and            truly ahead of its time.                    All the elements of the original are intact with nothing added or            taken away. So, we get 16 'top ranked' male and female pros,            including Venus and Serena Williams, 'Tiger' Tim Henman, Pat            Rafter, Yuvgeny Kafelnikov and so on, but lacking some of the            obvious stars - not that it actually matters.                    Support for up to four players has mercifully been retained, so            Multitap owners need not worry, enabling gamers to have almost            illegal amounts of multiplayer fun in singles or doubles contests.        But even the lone tennis player is            in for a treat, with a ridiculously entertaining single player            'World Tour' campaign mode that has you battling for the number one            world ranking across a variety of singles, doubles and training            matches - some of which are incredibly addictive, and for the most            part actually help improve your game, testing you in how accurate            you can place the ball, reaction times and so on. The really            committed player will eventually unlock a host of extra stadia, and            even hidden players that will become deadly weapons in multiplayer            contests.                    We've undoubtedly said it before, and we'll say it again. Virtua            Tennis 2 is one of the best games ever made, on any system, for            combining fantastic graphics, brilliant camera angles/action            replays, and instant playability with a beautifully simple and            intuitive control system.                    How good you'll be at the game is mainly down to you - your timing,            the direction you put on the shot, and how you react to your            opponent. You genuinely feel in control, a sensation so many high            gloss sports titles can't claim to offer, and as a result the more            you play, the more you get out of the game. Whereas the wonderful            Pro Evolution Soccer titles require inordinate amounts of practise            before you can stop looking like an idiot, Virtua Tennis 2 is the            kind of game that non gamers can pick up, understand, and give you            a decent game at within a few minutes.                    The presence of female players adds a whole new dimension versus            the original Virtua Tennis, with the speed of the men noticeably            quicker. Throw in the array of surfaces, and players with their own            strengths and weaknesses, and you have depth and subtlety that            becomes enormously apparent with repeated play.                    While the PS2 version plays identically, and if anything is nicer            to play thanks to the superior joypad, in the looks department it            doesn't quite hit the heights of the Dreamcast original. Jaggies            are all too apparent, and the sheen is lost. A certain coarseness            shows through as a result, although to be fair this will only be            truly apparent on top notch TVs through RGB out. In all other            aspects Hitmaker has done a sound job of converting this remarkable            tennis title to the PS2.                    Many potential purchasers who aren't into tennis will wonder why            they need a tennis title in their collection. But the proof of just            how good Virtua Tennis 2 is, is that you'll actually want to play            the real thing after a few weeks playing this (no, really!). And if            you're actually a big fan of the sport, there really is no excuse            not to play this game - it renders all other tennis games            redundant. It really is one of those titles that will capture your            life, and reminds you of the days when games were purer, more            immediate, and insanely addictive. Buy this game, you won't regret            it.
