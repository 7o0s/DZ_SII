Some three years ago the original burst into            the arcades, and its Dreamcast port was one of the must have titles            for the console in the early part of its life, delivering an            instantly playable twist on the tired driving genre. It was a            breath of fresh air, and at the time was one of the first arcade to            console ports that was functionally identical to the coin-op.                    While the thrill of bombing around San Francisco picking up fares            and dropping them off at their destination was great fun at first,            it was one of those games that most people tired of within a matter            of a couple of days. No one would question that it was fun, and            looked great for its time, with dayglo visuals and a rip roaring            frame rate, but the desire to come back to it just wasn't there.                    The sequel featured the curious 'Crazy Jump' ability, which for            reasons not properly explained gave your car the unlimited power to            vault spontaneously over other vehicles. Also, you could pick up            multiple passengers, each with their own drop off points, while the            city itself was based on New York. Whoop de doo. If you had played            the first version, there really was very little extra to justify            the \u00a340.        And            so here we are with version three, an Xbox exclusive that slipped            out to little fanfare recently and therefore was treated as ~one to            review when things quieten down~, hence our unusual delay in            popping it into our big black box.                    Rather than call it Crazy Taxi 3, Hitmaker would have been more            honest if it had dubbed it 'Crazy Taxi - The Dead Horse version'.            This time around you get all the moves of the previous games, one            new city to drive around in 'Glitter Oasis', based on Las Vegas,            and 'revised' versions of West Coast and Small Apple; the two            cities featured in the previous incarnations. And that's not all,            you lucky, spoiled people. You even get four new drivers, and            all eight of the previous drivers.                    But in reality, the game could have 80 drivers and 20 cities - it            wouldn't make up for the fact that there's just not enough variety            in the gameplay to hold your interest for long enough. After            driving around the three cities, picking up fare after fare and            learning your best routes and so on, there's really very little the            game can offer you that Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City doesn't do            far better with its throwaway Taxi missions.        And to make matters much, much worse, Hitmaker's understanding            of the Xbox appears to be less than satisfactory, managing to win            the ~Worst Slowdown We've Seen In A Videogame in 2002~ award.            Particularly on the Glitter Oasis level, the game regularly and            unforgivably slows to a snails pace - and with visuals that have            not moved on one tiny bit from those on show back in 1999. It's all            low res textures, pop up galore, and bad character animation, and            for Xbox owners you'll be shaking your head wondering how Hitmaker            could make such a pig's ear of such a straightforward game. Even            the loading times are chronic, and somehow the benefit of a hard            drive hasn't helped, making this just about the most unoptimised            gaming experience we've had in a long time.                    Even the control system hasn't been tweaked, so we get the totally            unnecessary situation of having to put your car in reverse before            you can go backwards, and then again into drive before you can go            forwards again, which costs you vital seconds when you're            attempting to spin around and go in the opposite direction after            dropping off a fare.                    The music quota has been improved, but anyone who cares little for            American 'Punk' will be reaching for the volume control within            seconds - so yet again we have The Offspring (four tracks), Bad            Religion (five), Citizen Bird (three), Methods Of Mayhem (two), and            Brian Setzer, oh he of Stray Cats (in)fame (two). If this choice of            music is supposed to make us feel 'pumped' during the game then it            fails miserably. Oh Sega, what the hell happened?                    At least the 25 mini games lend the package some extra curricular            charm, but most of them you'll only play a couple of times. The            likes of Crazy Jump and Crazy Tornado can probably be finished on            your first go, while Crazy football and Crazy Chasm at least            present some kind of challenge.                    But no amount of mini game fun can ultimately save Crazy Taxi 3            from being a shallow experience that doesn't remotely justify the            asking price. It may be exclusive to the Xbox, but did you notice            Microsoft bragging about that much in the run up to Christmas?                    That said, there is one positive outcome to all this negativity -            if you find Crazy Taxi 3 in a High Street store, it's bound to be            cheap.
