You have a team of three mercenaries - Hana Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas            and Jakob ~Dekes~ Decourt. These three feel there's a pretty penny            to be earned in getting to Wee Ming before the Protectorate.                    The girl's father is hell-bent on stopping you from reaching her            first. In an alternate reality China where nothing is as it seems,            you have to prepare yourselves for some truly sinister beings also.                    You must discover the truth behind the terrible secret that Wee            Ming holds. Many will die before this little gem is revealed.                    How will you cope with the Fear Effect?         Fear Effect begins with a short introductory            movie, narrated by Wee Ming herself. It serves well to set the            scene for the decidedly supernatural goings on further on into the            game itself .. One can also gather Wee Ming likes a bit of pain            too!                    Once at the menu, you have a simple choice of loading a previous            save or starting fresh. The usual options to change subtitles            on/off, controller key config and difficulty level are also            included.                    Choosing a new game will kick off a cut-scene showing Hana and Glas            arriving in a helicopter, and landing on a heli-pad atop a            skyscraper. You begin the game controlling Hana, armed with a            simple pistol and knife. Glas takes off again, to meet again later            in the adventure. Navigating your inventory and using the items can            be a little confusing at first, but becomes natural in a fairly            quick time.                    If an object within the game can be used, the 'Use' panel will pop            up. Similarly if you reach what seems to be a void, there may be            some way down .. If so, the 'Climb' panel will flash into view.            This also applies to taking items, equipping, looking and saving            your game. At certain points in the game, the save icon will light            up and your mobile phone rings. Save locations are excellently            distributed throughout the entire game, never leaving you having to            play over huge chunks of the game again .. Unless of course you            didn't save!                    A little heart monitor pulses in the top left-hand corner of the            screen, whenever any of the three characters are in danger. The            Fear Effect. This pulses a nice green colour if you're healthy,            through to deep red when you're approaching your death! A watchful            eye on your ammunition level is quite prudent too. The pistol isn't            unlimited, and fighting purely with the knife is both a hazardous            and foolhardy tactic.         It's a mere five screens            in that you first meet a couple of Wee Ming's father's henchmen.            All weapons are auto-targeted to the nearest enemy. A green            crosshair appears in the top-middle of the screen to show that your            aim is locked in. If the enemy has their back to you, use the            'sneak' key to creep up on them. A red crosshair will mean you are            close enough to perform an instant kill, with whatever weapon you            choose.                    Care has to be taken to disguise your presence. Footsteps can be            easily heard by the enemy, as too can gunfire. I have often found            that even if you use a gun in a room with three guys, the other two            don't always catch on! A gunshot is not the most difficult of            sounds to hear.                    The battle system works reasonably well, but there are times where            you really could do with someone other than your current target to            be selected. Far too often you are fired upon by enemy off screen            also. This can make for some blind firing in a vain hope you're            making contact, and hence using up your precious ammo.                    Weaponry isn't really that varied. Apart from the differing default            weapons of the three characters, the only other weapons to come            into the game are Machine Guns, and heavy weapons like Assault            Rifles and Heavy Machine Guns. Glas by default carries a Smak-Jack            (basically a metal bar), and Deke totes a fine pair of Brass            Knuckles. Deke also has the nicer default weapon, the Hand Cannons;            a bit like shotguns but fatter!                    There's never a moment where you really feel like a kick ass            mercenary though. The weapons are just far too weak both in sound            and feel.                    The pre-rendered backgrounds remind me a huge amount of what was            trying to be achieved in the big Commodore Amiga smash 'Bat'.            Obviously being based in Hong Kong, the Chinese influence is            evident. The Blade Runner feel to it all is also quite strong. What            sets Fear Effect apart from other games of this ilk is that the            backgrounds aren't totally static. Little things are going on, like            the flash of car headlights on a highway, or the movements of            shadows.                    The main characters are done in a cartoon style, which is both very            pleasing to the eye and also sits well with the background. Facial            close-ups are particularly impressive, with mouth and eye movement            looking good. Character movement is also nicely done, except for            when they run .. Running makes them look like they're desperate for            the toilet, and running at 45 degrees!                    Sometimes the angles of the backgrounds can make it a real headache            to judge where dropped ammo and/or items are. You can find yourself            walking to the front of the screen, when the item is in actual fact            further away.                    The game is accompanied by good background music. I particularly            liked the Vangelis like sound to the first level. Each song matches            the mood of the setting quite nicely, and in the underground gives            it that extra sinister edge.                    The spot effects such as weapons are a little weak sounding,            lacking the crisp punch needed. The voice acting ranges from the            good to the really bad. Good being the actress who plays Hana, and            bad being the lousy Australian accent of Dekes. I'm assuming it's            supposed to be Australian anyway!         Of course no 3D            action adventure would be complete without a set of puzzles            throughout the game. Fear Effect's puzzles I have to say are            ludicrously easy. There wasn't one single puzzle that stumped me.            Far too linear and just left me with an average shoot 'em up to            play. I don't consider myself a gaming genius by any means, but I            like to at least have to scratch my head once in a while during a            game.                    Which brings me to the game itself. For a game that comes on four            CDs, it is amazingly short. Let me define short - Completed in one            three hour session. Finito! Not only this, but I found myself            asking thin air 'is that it?' after the end credits began!            Apparently if you play the game on the 'hard' setting, there's a            different ending, but there's just not enough pull to the game to            make me want to do it.                    The plot also had some amazingly bad mistakes in it. Two of which I            must highlight as near criminal, both involving Glas. One time he's            bounding along weaponless, then moves to a cut-scene where he            rescues Hana .. Not with bare fists, but with twin pistols! Even            worse is the fact that he loses his other arm late on in the game,            only for the last sequences to have him restored back to one!                    I know there's magical powers going on here, but magically            self-stitching arms is pushing my realm of fantasy!         Fear Effect is undeniably a good-looking game.            The pre-rendered backdrops have the nice bonus of extra little            animations going on, giving a more believable feel to locations.            Everything is viewed in wide-screen, which looks fine and dandy,            but an option to switch would've be nice.                    Music helps to bolster the look of the game with added atmosphere,            getting more grim and sinister as the game progresses. Sound used            within the game is a little lacking, particularly with the weapon            sounds. Most importantly though, the voice acting is on the whole            good, as long as they don't try Australian accents!                    The puzzles are far too easy, and game too short, despite the            promise of a different ending on the 'hard' difficulty setting.            Spanning across four CDs, you're lulled into the false sense of            hope that the game is going to be massive.                    A bit of an opportunity missed for me. I'd be interested in seeing            where they go if a sequel is planned, but for me Fear Effect is            just another average 3D adventure. Nowt special.                    - Out Now"}
