You've come here to read about games, because you            know and love games. We all do. One of the great things about being            a gamer (besides the games) is that when you're sitting in the pub            on a Friday night and somebody says ~so, I've just bought Generic            Platformer 4 for my Dreamcast, is it any good?~, you can wheel            round (if you weren't already facing them) and yell, ~No! It's            pants! You've wasted \u00a335 on something that is better suited to            dressing your tackle!~ On the other hand though, your reputation as            a gamer also singles you out as a fountain of knowledge on the            subject of good games. So, while your blurry-eyed friend has            to stare ashen-faced at the titles on display in his local gamery,            you can glance knowingly at the shelves and spot the titles beaming            'Yes, I am good. Play me.'                         Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and its even finer sequel are both such            titles which sit in this enviable position. They are the games            which all the other extreme sports games so want to be when they            grow up. Can the THPS series ever falter? With the release of the            Game Boy Advance version of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2, we're about to            find out.                         The announcement of THPS2 on the GBA seemed a little strange to            me, because back then I was slightly naive of the machine's            capabilities and wondered how on earth the same fluid, energetic            and (I'm going out on a limb here) almost balletic gameplay could            be ported across to a screen slightly smaller than a cream cracker.            The team in charge of the port, Vicarious Visions, have actually            done a sterling job of recreating each of the PlaySation versions            skating locales from a curious fixed isometric viewpoint. The            packaging boasts ~advanced 3D graphics~, whereas the only actual 3D            models are the skaters themselves - the levels are no more than            pre-rendered backdrops.                         From this viewpoint, the feel of the game is entirely in the            handling of your skater. The way the characters glide into the air            out of half-pipes feels almost no different to its more mature            console sibling, and this surprises me. A lot. The other major            achievement is the control system, which is just as intuitive and            easy to manage as you have come to expect from the series. The A            and B buttons take care of the grinding and jumping respectively,            whilst the shoulder buttons handle the tricks. If you're a THPS            veteran, it's a combination that feels natural as soon as you start            playing, although the slightness of the GBA's design can            occasionally result in aching fingers as you try to get a decent            grip whilst pulling off frenetic combos.                    The game itself is exactly the same as in previous incarnations.            You choose from a wide variety of skaters and then take them            through a 'career' of seven different levels, each converted into            isometric form from their 3D relatives. Every level has at least            some of its secret little quirks and secrets intact, and once            you're used to the perspective you'll soon be finding your way            around them like you're arrived back in your home town after a few            years.                         The tasks which you are required to fulfill in order to progress            are also the same, although because of the limitations of your            perspective and without the luxury of a fully 3D environment, the            challenge is upped somewhat from the original. Gaps become a lot            trickier to judge, ramps become harder to take straight, and even            the simplest of rail combos is a major accomplishment. The task of            locating all the money, letters and icons is still ever-present in            the back of your mind, but the camera position practically            encourages exploration before you even begin to attempt your tasks,            which emphasises one of the stronger points of THPS2 - the level            design is genius at work.                         The only obvious problem is that on structure-heavy levels, such            as the school, your precise position in relation to the buildings            can occasionally become a bit of a mystery as the roofs of some            buildings blend into the adjacent ground, and it's not until your            skater ghosts out to indicate that you're actually behind the            building and you go careering into a wall you couldn't see that you            realise what went wrong. Your limited viewpoint also becomes a            problem when attempting a session in some of the games half-pipes,            simply because you don't expect your skater to come flying up the            other side of the ramp because you can't see it, however pretty            much all of this is alleviated somewhat once you get used to the            angle.                    What's endearing about THPS2 on the GBA is that it's by no means            original, and there aren't even any new ideas save for the            admittedly very clever pseudo-3D, but it's almost like a new game -            Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2b if you like. For veterans of the            original, it's a chance to replay the game again from a fresh            perspective and in a new style, and for those who are new to the            game... well, they wont know what hit them. An impressive            accomplishment.                        -        The Portable Avant-GardeThe Portable Avant-Garde"}
