It almost            sounded too good to be true...                        Well, for Binary Asylum it was, as they ceased trading due to            financial difficulties after being taken off the project by            American publisher Interplay due to ~creative differences~. Not to            be discouraged, Interplay handed the game to in-house team 14            Degrees East, who could be considered Star Trek experts after their            work on the Starfleet and Klingon Academy games. Flash forward to            September 2000, and after the drama and delays of its interrupted            development cycle, the game has finally been released.                        The game starts when a Romulan experiment goes drastically wrong            due to the interference of those meddlesome Klingons, resulting in            a whole system of new planets getting dragged through some kind of            temporal rift. Suddenly there are several new mineral-rich planets            floating around in an area that used to be nothing but empty space.            Cue escalating battles between the Klingons (~Ah .. new planets -            let's kill everyone and take them for ourselves!~), the Romulans            (~It was our experiment that brought them here, they are obviously            ours!~) and the Federation (~Ah .. strange new worlds - let's            integrate the locals into our dreary existence~), as well as the            added complication of three new races introduced in the game (~Ah            .. erm .. we live here!~).                        The idea sounds fine in theory, and the game should have appealed            to both Star Trek fans and real-time strategy players alike. But            does the execution of the idea live up to expectations?                    The first thing you will notice on starting the game is that it            looks wonderful - the HUD changes according to race, the terrain            feels authentic, and the skies are a mash of glorious hues. Even            the buildings look how you would expect a Star Trek building to            look.                        And all of this is in lustrous 3D, with a flexible camera system            which can do almost anything you would want it to - zooming and            tilting, with everything from a bird's eye view to first person and            chase cams. Sadly though you will spend almost all of your time in            the overhead view, zoomed out as far as possible to get a wider            view of the action. Once in a while, you may think ~Oh, let's look            at a different view~, but then it's a case of ~Oh dear, I can't see            what's happening .. are those my units? No, don't go over there! Oh            hell, are those explosions? Where's everyone gone?~. Unlike            Battlezone II, which balanced the different viewpoints            successfully, you get the sense that the various camera options in            New Worlds were just put there to show off the 3D engine.                        The missions are suitably complex though, from out and out fighting            to search and rescue, and from scanning ancient crashed ships to            finding a cure for a deadly virus, with all of the appropriate            vehicles to go with it. You even have officers who you can place            within ships to make their scanners, shields or weapons more            efficient, and training these officers in their respective fields            makes them more effective, adding an RPG element to the game.                        When you do get into battle the explosions are fantastic, and            photon torpedoes veritably glower as they fly through the sky.            Vessels with cloaking capabilities waver as they disappear, and all            the while typically Trekkish sounds gush forth from your speakers.            It all looks, sounds and feels like a Trek game should.                    So, that pretty much covers the Trekkies - good looks, great story            and interesting missions will have them grinning inanely and            telling each other to 'live long and prosper', or some such.            Real-time strategy fans, on the other hand, will have a harder time            of it...                        With the recent influx of innovative and original strategy games -            such as Shogun, Ground Control and Homeworld - the RTS fan really            expects something special if their attention is to be held for any            length of time, and unfortunately I found New Worlds to be lacking            in many of the basics.                        For example, there is no research tree. Yes, you can only construct            certain buildings when others are already present, and certain            vehicles cannot be created until the science block has researched a            disruptor field or some such, but this isn't strictly a research            tree. Instead what tends to happen is that at the beginning of each            mission you spend the first ten minutes upgrading and researching            all of the same things that you already did in the previous            mission, until there is nothing left to do. The problem is that you            have to research lots of different technologies even to create the            most basic of vehicles, so in the end it becomes less of a research            tree and more of a monotonous bush.                        Resource collecting is a hassle too - other than a scanner mode            which tells you where certain minerals are residing, there is            nothing to indicate where to build a mine. You can spend many            minutes with the template of a mine, sweeping across the terrain            waiting for it to turn green, indicating that this is a good spot            to build one.                        And while I'm at it, how come Kirk can find a lone person hidden in            a cave on a huge world, but I can't scan the planet for the enemy,            or even build some kind of radar? Instead you have to rely on short            range scanner vehicles. To find the enemy you usually have to wait            for them to come to you, and then head off in the direction they            came from.                    More problems could be caused by the interface. Building is            something of a chore, clicking backwards and forwards between            screens, and having to click on each building to see if it can be            upgraded yet.                        Getting your vehicles to actually do what they are told to is a            mission of its own too. If you single click with your mouse the            units will travel to that point, but it's anybody's guess what they            will do when they get there. You can double-click an area, which            brings up a mini-menu of icons, allowing you to order them to fire            at will, protect the area, or even not to fire, but they rarely            seem to take any notice of this, and just merrily blast away at            anything they happen to see. But then sometimes they let enemy            ships wander past and attack the building next to them without even            batting an eyelid! It's also extremely difficult to double-click an            enemy vehice when it is moving, which can get extremely            frustrating.                        Most missions seem to degenerate into creating a ton of tanks and            raiding the enemy base, a tactic I thought had finally vanished            from the RTS scene. But probably the most irritating aspect of the            whole thing is the speed - it's so slow! Everything seems to            take an absolute age, which is compounded by the fact that you            can't save the game in the middle of a mission.                    If the fact that it is a Star Trek game is enough to sway you to            its cause, then you will no doubt put up with New Worlds'            inadequacies and thoroughly enjoy it. But if you want a serious            real-time strategy game you may want to look elsewhere - the            beautiful graphics and authentic Trek feel aren't enough to            overcome the confused AI, awkward interface and glacially slow pace            in what is ultimately a disappointing game."}
