Dominion and Daikatana both promised so                 much, and delivered so little, that the company has become the                 games industry equivalent of the boy who cried wolf.                    Screenshots, no matter how good looking, are distrusted. Interviews            and previews, no matter how positive, are taken not so much with a            pinch of salt, as with the entire saline content of the Atlantic.            But it's all too easy to forget that Ion Storm isn't just one            studio. There is a second Ion Storm studio out in Austin which is            much quieter and, on paper, has much more potential.                    Deus Ex is the third product to bear the Ion Storm name, but the            first to originate from this second studio. So rather than            considering the negative connotations now borne by the Ion Storm            brand, perhaps we should look at the other name on the box - that            of Warren Spector, best known for the incredible System Shock, an            innovative blend of the first person shooter and role-playing game            which stands out as one of the unsung greats of the 1990s games            market.         In Deus Ex you take on the role of JC Denton, an                 agent for futuristic global police organisation UNATCO. While                 UNATCO agents in the past were physically augmented with                 mechanical parts to make them better in combat, you and your                 brother Paul are the first in a line of agents augmented with                 nanotechnology - tiny cell-sized machines which reside inside                 the body and increase strength or speed, or provide any of a                 number of other enhancements to an agent.                    UNATCO agents are the front line of defence in a world gone mad -            the gritty urban environments of Deus Ex are populated by powerful            terrorist organisations, gangsters, and pathetic sufferers of the            disease known as the Grey Death - a global epidemic for which the            only cure, Ambrosia, is very scarce and available only to the top            tiers of society.                    As the game progresses, however, it becomes clear that UNATCO and            the shadowy organisations behind it aren't the force for democracy            and justice that they would appear to be. The twisting plot of Deus            Ex reveals wheels within wheels in a global conspiracy of epic            proportions, and although you can simply rush through the game if            you like, the urge to explore all of the sub-plots and undertake as            many hidden missions as possible will be rewarded with further            information about your character and the organisations you work            for.                    Deus Ex concentrates on plot and character development, drawing            inspiration heavily from the likes of Todd McFarlane's ~Spawn~            animated series and Chris Carters ~The X-Files~ and ~Millennium~,            although the design and atmosphere of the game is closer to ~Blade            Runner~.                    Most of the characters in the game have large amounts of spoken            dialogue, and while the voice acting in the game is unlikely to be            nominated for any awards, it is quite good - certainly nowhere near            the ridiculously bad voice acting in the likes of Resident Evil,            although not quite up to TV standards either.         With this focus on plot and characters comes a                 different perspective on the play mechanics of the first                 person genre. A far cry from the ultra-violence and speed of                 Unreal Tournament, Quake 3, or even Half-Life, Deus Ex draws                 more from cerebral masterpieces like Metal Gear Solid and,                 surprisingly enough, System Shock.                    While it is perfectly possibly to play through the game by killing            all that stand in your way, there are multiple more intelligent            ways of advancing in the game, and you will often find that a            softly softly approach will be rewarded with additional items,            information, or dialogue. The use of items such as gas, EMP or            scrambler grenades, pepper spray, lock picks and electronic hacking            devices can often yield an ingenious (or in some cases, downright            evil) solution to a problem which will have you patting yourself on            the back for hours.                    In contrast, the combat system itself, while certainly passable, is            nowhere near the slickly polished mayhem of CounterStrike or the            like. While this is partially due to the low framerate often            experienced during combat (a hangover from the Unreal engine used            in the game, which suffers from framerate problems when detail is            high), it is mainly caused by a weapons system which actively            promotes sneakiness.                    A headshot from most weapons will kill instantly, but flicking            around to suddenly hit someone's head is impossible - the targeting            reticule takes time to lock on to a target, and until it does so            accuracy is significantly lessened. Spraying bullets is also            discouraged by the lengthy reload times, and while both this and            the targeting issue can be helped by upgrading your weapon skills,            stealth and silent take-downs are the order of the day.         The nano-augmentation of your character isn't                 simply an excuse for a plot device, or an explanation for your                 ability to mow down terrorists; it is a complex part of the                 game in its own right. At various points in the game you can                 pick up Nanotech Augmentation canisters, which can be                 installed into your body by a medical bot.                    These canisters contain improvements to basic skills such as            strength, speed, regeneration or even resistance to bullets. The            decision of what augmentation to use will effect the way you play            the game significantly - for example, installing and upgrading the            speed and jumping augmentation will allow you to run much more            quickly than normal and jump over vast distances, as well as fall            from heights without taking much damage.                    When combined with your character's penchant for black trenchcoats            and sunglasses, it's hard not to feel just a little bit like Neo as            you jump from the top of a tall building to escape assailants,            hitting the ground running and dashing off like the wind, shouts of            disbelief ringing in your ears...                    Between the nanotech augmentations, the multitude of different            items and tools available, and the open nature of the levels, the            number of different ways in which a player can accomplish any given            goal is huge; yet Spector and his co-designers seem to have thought            of them all. At no time in the game does a character respond in an            inappropriate way, and it's almost impossible to ~break~ the            scripted sequences in the game by coming at a problem in an unusual            way. Instead, the tantalising number of things which you didn't use            in your solution will find you playing through the game again,            trying different approaches and solutions to problems and            situations.         There is no doubt that Deus Ex is a difficult                 game; many of the problems presented are quite fiendish, and                 require the player to think laterally, while several of the                 combat situations are near-impossible if an all-guns-blazing                 approach is taken. But the game never gets boring, and while                 you may turn it off in frustration after a couple of deaths,                 you will soon be itching to get back in and try a different                 approach.                    There is also no doubt that Deus Ex is highly derivative; a cynic            can walk through the game naming sources of inspiration with ease,            because there isn't really a huge amount of truly fresh innovation            here. However, the crucial point is that while Deus Ex's tricks may            be old, they are given a fresh spin, and performed with such            panache and showmanship that it's hard to find fault in them.                    In essence, while Ion Storm have not found perfection with Deus Ex,            they have come about as close as anyone ever has with a first            person game. Moody and atmospheric, compelling and addictive, this            is first person gaming in grown-up form, and it truly is            magnificent.                        -"}
