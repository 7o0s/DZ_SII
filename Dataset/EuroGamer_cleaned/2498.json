Obviously it was never going to be able to live up            to gamers' high expectations (nothing short of the Second Coming            could have done), so the key questions are just how disappointing            is it, and is it still worth buying? And the answers are fairly,            and absolutely.                        At the heart of the game is an epic single player campaign. Bioware            say that it offers over sixty hours of gameplay, and given that            we've been slogging our way through it for the last few weeks and            have only just finished the first of its four chapters, it seems            that if anything that might be a conservative estimate. As the game            begins the city of Neverwinter is quarantined thanks to a            mysterious plague, and things soon go from bad to worse. Four            dangerous magical creatures have been brought to the city in the            search for a cure, but an attack by unknown assailants sees them            released to run wild in the city streets. By the time you are            ordered to track them down they are already raising mischief in the            city's various districts. Undead are running around the Beggar's            quarter, violent criminals have taken over the city prison, the            docks are overrun by thieves and pirates, and a secretive wizard is            under suspicion in the posh end of town.                        It's a bewildering opening to the game, and leaves you free to head            out from the city centre and complete the quests in any order you            want to. The bad news is that the pacing is glacially slow, and it            takes forever to actually progress through the storyline and            develop your character. Bioware seem to have fallen for the old            fallacy that bigger is better, and as such most of your first week            or two is spent running around Neverwinter slaughtering vast            numbers of zombies and plague-ridden thugs. It's a bit dull and            repetitive at times, and more reminiscent of Icewind Dale than            Baldur's Gate. There is a plot under there, but you spend more time            killing things, picking locks and disarming traps than actually            role-playing or adventuring.                    This would be fine if the game had an interesting and varied combat            system, and the use of the more flexible character development            system introduced by the AD&D 3rd Edition rules should provide            just this. You can now multi-class more easily, and skills and            feats aren't limited to a particular career choice; you can, for            example, create a wizard who can wear armour and pick locks.                        The problem is that Neverwinter Nights has no party dynamic - you            are limited to your main character and one follower, which may be a            hired henchman, a magical familiar or a creature companion. This            may come as something of a shock to fans of Bioware's previous            games, and it was certainly a huge disappointment for me. In the            Baldur's Gate series you have a party of half a dozen varied            characters at your disposal, usually including a thief, a mage and            a priest as well as warriors, giving you a wide range of spells and            abilities to take advantage of. In Neverwinter Nights you only have            two characters at a time, one of which really needs to be a            dedicated close-range fighter to stop the hordes of evil doers from            overwhelming you, and one of which needs to be proficient at            picking locks and disarming the many traps you'll stumble across.            Even with the increased freedom you have in developing your            character, this doesn't leave players with much room for manoeuvre,            especially in the early stages of the game. And given the            incredible length and plodding pace of the main campaign, there's            little encouragement to come back and play your way through the            whole thing again with a different character type.                        To make matters worse, you have absolutely no direct control over            your sidekick. All you can do is give a few general orders like            ~follow me~ and ~stand your ground~, and set basic behaviour such            as how close they stay to you, options which your henchman often            seems to completely ignore anyway. There's no way of exchanging            items between your inventories, which means that your lead            character has to be pretty burly if you plan to lug much loot            around, further limiting your choices. The one exception is that            you can give your sidekick a potion, but they always quaff it            immediately, whether they need to or not. Elsewhere the AI varies            from reasonable to pitiful. For example, rogues will sometimes run            through a gaggle of enemies to disarm a trap at the other end of            the room, blissfully ignorant of the battle going on right behind            them. Other bizarre behaviour is down to scripting rather than AI,            like the way rescued NPCs merrily walk past enemies on their way            out of an area without either side batting an eyelid, or your            sidekick's habit of instantly teleporting back to your side if you            get too far ahead of them (although annoyingly they won't do this            if they get stuck on a piece of scenery, thankfully a fairly rare            occurence). And don't get me started on the voice acting, which is            monumentally repetitive. If I hear the words ~oh, I can pick that            open easy~ one more time I'm going to have to cleave someone's head            in twain.                    Of course, the single player campaign is really just an entr\u00e9e            - the main course is the online community. In multiplayer you can            actually group together into parties of more than two characters            with other players, sharing experience between you as you work your            way through the campaign or one of the many third party add-on            modules already available.                        Multiplayer is, as you would expect, a varied experience. Servers            range from serious role-playing zones, where speaking out of            character or using the shout command is frowned upon, to lawless            hack and slash action. The first server I joined was in total            anarchy - as I spawned into the game a group of players were busy            assaulting Aribeth, one of the key campaign characters, and a quick            trip out into the streets beyond revealed that they had already            massacred the entire town guard, corpses littering the cobble            stones for miles around. It's also a little worrying that one of            the most popular servers in the world is titled ~Free XP / Gold /            Items~. By contrast though, on another server you might find            yourself chatting with fellow adventurers in a pub, playing games            in a working casino, or taking part in an epic quest.                        If you can't find a server to your tastes and you have a few            like-minded friends who can be convinced to buy the game, you can            always run your own. One or more players can even act as the            Dungeon Master, moderating the game and adding a little extra            atmosphere to spice things up. Obviously you need a broadband            connection to make the most of multiplayer, especially if you want            to play custom modules (which are auto-downloaded from the server            where appropriate), but with the right hardware and enough            bandwidth you can host anything up to 64 players on a single            machine.                    I say ~on a single machine~, because it is theoretically possible            to link multiple servers together, allowing players to hop from one            area to another in a more-or-less seamless fashion. Not many people            have attempted this yet, but it does work, and no doubt it won't be            long before large scale persistent worlds start to spring up.                        This kind of customisation is supported by the easy-to-use editing            suite which comes with the game. Although the more arcane arts of            scripting take some getting used to, almost anybody should be able            to throw together a basic dungeon crawl, with plenty of            point-and-click ~wizards~ to help automate common activies like            creating new areas, adding monsters and so forth. If you find            yourself out of your depth, a reasonably helpful            tutorial            module is available from the            game's website, and the            official forums are a            gold mine of information, suggestions and sample scripts. Your            mileage may vary, but I've actually had more fun messing around            with the toolkit than playing the game itself.                        Modules are fairly compact and tend to compress well, making them            easy to distribute, but it's not all good news. The main problem is            that the way the game is structured is very much built around            serving the default campaign rather than allowing maximum            flexibility for mod makers. For example, each area may only use a            single preset theme (city exterior, forest, dungeon etc) with its            own unique buildings and terrain features, and there's no way to            mix and match these in a single zone. So if you want to place a big            park in the middle of your town, you're out of luck. You can            combine or replace the default tilesets, and even add entirely new            monsters and items with a little modelling know-how and some            artistic talent, but this is fairly complex and involves the use of            ~hak packs~. These are currently not auto-downloaded, so they're no            use for most multiplayer modules. You can only use one pack with            each module at the moment as well, so if you want to include            multiple new monsters, items and terrain tile sets you'll have to            combine them by hand into one big hak pack which everyone will need            to download for your module to work, even if they already have all            the modifications you're using as seperate files. It's a clumsy            system that shows little foresight, and all we can say is that we            hope it will be fixed at some point.                    Out of the box, Neverwinter Nights is something of a mixed bag. The            single player campaign is, if anything, too long, and            focuses more on continuous combat than actual role-playing. The            lack of any support for parties in the single player mode is also            disappointing, and makes the game far less involving than it should            be. Multiplayer is a more entertaining experience, but you may have            to explore several servers before you find one that feels like            home.                        What really lifts the game above the crowd though is the mod            support, which literally opens up a whole new world. Persistent            online realms, linked servers, new quests, monsters and equipment            are all possible, although the way the game handles these could            have been better thought out. Already the internet is awash with            add-ons, some of which are very good, and the future looks bright.                        If you're a role-playing fan and don't mind downloading additional            content, Neverwinter Nights is something of a no-brainer. It might            not be the best role-playing game ever (not by a long shot), but it            is arguably the most promising."}
