But however impressed we were with the aesthetics, there were still            nagging doubts about those tiny shoulder buttons, the recessed            D-pad, the lack of a headphone socket and whether your hands would            end up contorting into a claw after extended use. To its credit,            Nintendo dispatched the sleek silver version of its tiny games            machine to Eurogamer with impressive efficiency, just days after            its Japanese launch. And rather than deliver us an imported            version, as expected, we have been furnished with a European            edition, complete with two pin charger, necessitating a bit of plug            jiggery pokery.        Given that the hardware is functionally identical to its            two-year-old brother, it's pointless discussing the ins and outs of            the gaming performance. You'll know plenty about that already. What            you'll be more interested in is how it plays - and after several            hours putting our now extensive GBA software collection through its            paces, it's fair to say there are big plusses and some fairly large            minuses; it's a flawed masterpiece.                    The easiest things to document are the plusses - they're obvious            and joyful additions that should have been part of the machine from            the beginning. The most fantastic new feature of the GBA SP is its            toggleable front light. Placed in the centre of the control deck            just below the screen, it's down to you whether you'll need to use            it. But unless you've got Sam Fisher night vision goggles, you'll            know that playing GBA in all but optimal lighting conditions is a            fairly hateful experience. Not anymore. The joy of flicking on that            front light and - for the first time - being able to just settle            down anywhere, no matter how dark, and be able to see everything            with crystal clarity was a very special moment. It may sound            ridiculous, but following this logic to the extreme, we were able            to indulge in a session of Doom, in the dark, sat in bed, on a            Wednesday night. Sometimes, we worry about ourselves, but it's all            in the name of research you understand. Previously, even settling            down to play the GBA in a fairly well lit room was nigh on            impossible unless you happened to have an overhead spotlight            trained on the screen. Ah, simple joys. GBA SP, where have you            been all my life?                    Sticking with the positive, the 'clamshell' design makes for a far            more portable and pocket-sized console. While the GBA was hardly            bulky, the SP version is now only just wider than the screen, while            measuring the same in depth and length as before. You'll be far            more tempted to slip it in your pocket than before - especially as            the screen is now protected when it's closed. Previously, any            attempt to carry around the GBA outside of a protective wallet            would inevitably result in a scratched screen - in fact, even in a            wallet it seemed to be a magnet for scratches, although we do            wonder how long it will be before the silver plastic coating of our            SP starts to wear out.        The                 battery life is also worthy of praise - with up to 10 hours of                 front lit gaming, and 18 hours without, the included                 rechargeable lithium ion battery not going to wear out in a                 hurry, and will save heavy duty users a fortune in batteries.                 The charger comes as standard, and takes no more than a couple                 of hours to replenish. On the downside, if you're on a                 particularly long haul journey, there's no way of using normal                 batteries instead. You'll be forced to either wait until you                 reach your destination to recharge, or do something radical,                 like talk to someone. We can't imagine it'll be that                 much of a problem, unless you really hate people. Or they                 really hate you for being antisocial and playing for 18 solid                 hours on your GBA.                    While, yes, the GBA SP closely resembles the design of Nintendo's            early Game & Watch efforts, there is something very now about            it. Call it retro futurist, but it appeals to us greatly. It's a            Super Nintendo, in your hand, and it looks nice and plays some of            the best games ever made. What more could you want?                    Well, a bloody headphone socket would've been nice, for starters.            Unbelievably, after creating one of the finest pieces of gaming            design known to man, Nintendo go and fleg* in our beer and forget            to add one of the most essential parts of any portable gaming            device. Apparently Nintendo will be selling a separate headphone            port, that will plug into the Ext 2 port, but has yet to announce            how much this will cost. Why Nintendo, why why why why why? The            speaker is just as tinny and pathetic as the GBA, and thus if you            have any intention of playing a game with the sound on while in the            presence of human beings around, you'll know that you'll get            that glare. Try the same thing on a train or a plane (or            better still, in a library) and your life won't be worth living.            Headphone socket. Where the hell is it?                    * Flob, hawk, gob, spit        The next thing to point out, again, is that the shoulder            buttons are about the size of your fingertips. Tiny. They're in the            region of a third of the size of before, and while we're not paid            to design consoles, even we can see that there are acres of space            for an extra two buttons on the control deck. Ok, maybe not            acres but you can almost hear the lonely A and B buttons            screaming ~please let the L and R buttons come and live with us,            pleeeeease~. Another glaring oversight. In practise, the shoulder            buttons are much easier to use than you'd imagine, once you come to            terms that bleating about their size isn't going to magically make            them grow. Fortunately, most of the games we played don't use these            buttons extensively, although something like F-Zero felt            comfortable. How it would feel after 9 hours of solid play on a            beach is still open to question, (as was the case 18 months ago            when this writer was utterly obsessed with the cream of the GBA            launch titles).                    The D-pad, however, feels as good as it is bad. On the one hand,            the fact that it's recessed means you'll not suffer from gamer's            thumb, and on certain games you'll benefit from being able to            perform quick, gliding manoeuvres (e.g. beat 'em ups such as Street            Fighter II). On the other hand there's an odd side effect of not            having such a defined D-pad, and finding yourself pressing harder            to compensate, and this puts an odd strain on the base of your            thumb, just in the fleshy portion of your palm. The slightly more            angular nature of the SP means that unless you curb your gaming            instincts, you'll be suffering some slightly odd pains. The            negligible distance between the D-pad and A/B buttons might take            some getting used to, but it's not something that bothered us much            after the first couple of minutes, and we don't expect anyone but            the most shovel handed gamer to bleat too long about this.                    So is it worth parting will your cash for? If you've held off            buying one, then the answer is emphatically yes. The catalogue of            classic - and now discounted - titles is as long as Tom's best            lies, and it really would be rude not to tuck into the very best of            them. Your holidays and long journeys will never be the same again.            If you're one of the millions of owners of the original GBA, then            it's a tougher call. If you've already modded yours with front            light, then our question would be 'why bother?', but then if you're            that keen to go to the lengths and expense of performing that            upgrade, the chances are you'll twitch yourself to sleep with envy.            Such is life. If, however, you've resisted the upgrade and your GBA            is gathering dust, then ask yourself why? Was it the light issue?            If so, a swift trade in is recommended - or hang onto it, thus            ensuring multi-player link up possibilities. Ultimately, the            reasons for not buying an SP are considerably less compelling than            just treating yourself to an extremely cool toy. It's not perfect,            but our faith is restored - and that's what counts.
