You            could say that something like Resident Evil scares you, as a zombie            lunges out of nothing and you leap from your seat in the darkness,            but through its haunting narrative and the developer's skilful use            of 'sanity effects', Eternal Darkness has the power to actually            frighten you, and that's an important distinction.                    Some of the things Silicon Knights will do to you during their 15            hours will actually haunt you. Some of the fates that befall the 12            characters you control will have you tearing your hair out,            writhing in confusion, and wondering where the line falls between            what's actually happening and what the game is manifesting to spook            you.        Eternal Darkness is definitely a            different kind of survival horror game. The challenge isn't            marshalling your inventory, storing things strategically in            lockboxes and fighting for the right to save your game, whilst            gradually clawing your way through hordes of the undead. Although            the game's setting is a mansion, the spirits and evil that lurk            within aren't going to come limping toward you with their arms            outstretched.                    Your host for this mansion tour is one Alex Roivas. Having been            summoned to her grandfather's secluded home in Rhode Island, she is            shown the decapitated, mutilated corpse of her relative and makes            an ill-conceived pledge to find the culprit. As the local law            enforcement stands mystified, she combs the depths of the Roivas            mansion in search of clues. And in the recesses of the library, she            finds one - the Tome of Eternal Darkness.                    Reading chapters from this grim, Evil Dead-esque relic constructed            of flesh, sinew and bone will send you back through time,            transplanting the player into the shoes of whichever poor            unfortunate found their fate ingrained in this otherworldly Tome.            As Alex reads, more of the story is told in Roivas senior's voice,            as you act out the words on the page in the role first of the            Centurion Pious Augustus, as he wanders the darkness of a Persian            labyrinth, and later the archaeologist dusting cobwebs from            inscriptions and the Franciscan monk trying to prove his innocence,            in locations as far afield as a Cambodian temple.                    These unfortunate subjects of Eternal Darkness work in a grizzlier            environment than young Alex, though she too will soon find a blade            and defend herself. Pious, like Alex, is a noble construction.            Neither the game engine's characters nor its environments are as            finely detailed as Resident Evil's, but neither tries to compete            like for like.        Rooms are            meant to be ornately decorated, but there's far more definition            than elsewhere - whereas in Resi you spent a lot of the time            scouring your photographic surroundings for glinting clues, in            Eternal Darkness, there is enough detail to have you believe -            books lie strewn in wonky piles on desks, pictures hang from every            wall for you to examine (and often you have no handy text-based            scrawl to explain them), and torches line tombs, occasionally            spitting flames to make you jump as you tiptoe along watching for            your next adversary.                    Characters like Pious are given greater body through individual eye            movement, craning their necks to examine things and other hunching            before they lunge to attack, not to mention the clinking and            clomping of their chainmail and armour which can obscure the noise            of approaching death...                    What's more, the voice acting is in a class of its own - though            Western games often suffer from badly disjointed dialogue, Eternal            Darkness suspends your disbelief that bit longer by sustaining a            high quality of commentary from Roivas and dialogue from the rest            of the cast. Elsewhere on the audio/visual front, the use of            lighting is the best we've seen in a survival horror game. Having            Alex peer up from a table and the light gradually fill the contours            of her face and body, as shadows fall across her and her eyes stare            worriedly - it adds so much more realism than a million            painstakingly constructed photographic backgrounds ever could.                    Back to the game itself though, and main tenets of your progression            through the book are exploration of the house, puzzle-solving and            undead combat. You'll complete chapters as you unlock more of the            house - this is mostly a process of using clues and items you've            picked up thoughtfully, and although the puzzles are rarely            mindbendingly difficult, nothing in ED is ever simple. Find the            second floor key, for instance, and you'll also find that it breaks            in the lock. Find a telescope in a room just off from the library,            and you'll also find that you can't just pop your eye to the lens.        Fighting the legions of the            undead, who seem quite upset about your dabbling in their masters'            affairs, is a process of aiming for a body part and then hacking            away with whatever you have. At first. Pious, for example, has a            short, sharp Roman sword. By tugging on the R button in the            presence of an enemy, that enemy's upper torso will flash white,            indicating where any blow struck with A will land. By tapping R            again you cycle enemies. By holding forward, back, left or right            you can target an individual body part - you'll want to remember            'up' for head. Once decapitated or slashed enough to be            downtrodden, the game prompts you to finish an enemy with a grizzly            B button blow, often celebrated by a close-up camera angle.                    As you progress though, you can learn to harness the complicated            magic system. Each spell is made up of symbols called runes, which            you'll see throughout the game. By combining them, it's possible to            cast greater and greater spells. Spells are stored in the Tome of            Eternal Darkness. The best thing about the spell system though is            that you can roll your own - pop into the options menu and choose            New Spell and you can choose its alignment and a combination of            runes (you'll find scrolls and parchments on your travels which            give you an idea of what to mix). Once concocted, you can cast            spells in-game to vanquish wards which impede your progress,            protect yourself from lethal blows and even to summon companion            creatures. You can even increase the potency of your arsenal by            creating spells to enchant items.        The thing you most want            to hear about though is the sanity meter. On the whole, spells,            weapons and sanity aside, Eternal Darkness is a fairly standard            story told in an adventurous way, combining the tales of many            people into one big, long yarn. What gives it that edge is the            sanity meter. As unspeakable abominations hurtle forth, you            gradually lose your mental grip. Lose enough of it and you'll start            to hallucinate, and it makes progression that bit more difficult.            Enter a new room and you may find yourself completely unarmed. Go            out and come back in again and your weapons are at your side            - did you imagine it? Waltz into the midst of hordes of enemies            hoping to cause some damage, and the Cube complains that a            controller is not inserted in port one! What the motionless hell do            you do?                    At the end of the day, there are only three things about Eternal            Darkness we can fault. Three. And none of them should stop you            buying this game. Firstly, we have a problem with the combat.            Although the targeting system is fine, the way your character's            blows often strike scenery wastefully is an unavoidable quirk, and            often frustrating. Second, the camera, though eerily cinematic and            often ominously placed to give you little clue as to what lies            ahead, can obscure important objects and is perhaps less useful            than a roving third-person approach. That said, it's not too            annoying and it often heightens fear and tension.                    And the third thing we want to contest is the difficulty level.            Well, we don't really want to contest it, but some will definitely            blitz through Eternal Darkness in about 15 hours and moan, ~that            was too easy,~ and for them we must raise a hand. However, to reach            the end of ED and complain is arguably to have missed the point -            you should buy this game because it's frightening in a way that few            games ever have been, and because it's a vividly explored,            engrossing narrative the likes of which few out-and-out            storytellers like Final Fantasy can compete with. Given the sheer            quality of the composition and a very engrossing 15 hours of            gameplay, I have to recommend this. There isn't much else like            Eternal Darkness, and though it might have felt that way for a bit,            I'm not losing my mind.
