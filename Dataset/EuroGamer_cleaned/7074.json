Probably the least famous fighting            game to come from the Capcom studios, the original was one of the            companys abortive forays into 3D beat'em'up territory during the            PlayStation era, and was a complete flop outside of Japan. Indeed,            it didn't sell particularly well in Japan either by all accounts;            the only aspect of the game to achieve any kind of popularity was            the central character, Hayato, a sword-wielding young chap with a            metal plate riveted to his forehead and a torn vest.                         Hayato can be found in many of the ~Capcom Versus~ games            (including the recent and rather wonderful Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 on            the Dreamcast) and there was talk at one point about a spinoff            anime television series featuring the character, although whether            this ever came to anything is unknown. It is possibly in order to            promote this potentially valuable franchise that Capcom have            decided to return to Star Gladiator on the Dreamcast - although,            perhaps mindful of the low regard in which the original Star            Gladiator is held, Star Gladiator Chapter II has been renamed to            ~Plasma Sword~.                         Like most modern beat-em-up games, the plot is tenuous to say the            least; essentially, the action is all set in a Star Wars-esque            universe, which is threatened by a terrible evil which was defeated            in the first game but has conveniently reawakened in order to            provide an excuse for a sequel. This evil seems to rotate around a            chap with a ridiculous hat and a bizarre robot that wouldn't be out            of place in an episode of Buck Rogers; how exactly the galaxy is            threatened by this pair of jokers is never quite revealed, but we            can assume that they are evil beacuse they're collectively referred            to as the ~Nightmare of Bilstein~, so they can't be very pleasant            people.                         In order to save the galaxy from this unspeakably evil person with            poor taste in headwear, a band of heroes need to fight against each            other in an apparently random fashion. I use ~band of heroes~            loosely here, because it's never made particularly clear which            characters are heroes and which are villains; Hayato is clearly a            hero since he rides a motorbike very fast in the intro, thus            marking him down as a Good Guy, but aside from that the characters            are a motley crew of furry Chewbacca lookalikes, birdmen, and green            cone-headed creatures who wear far too much cheap jewellery.                    I'm not really sure why beat-em-up developers even bother trying to            create a plot any more; Soul Calibur may have had quite an            interesting plot that built up the more you played the game, and            Street Fighter and King of the Fighters may have built up great            chronologies and backstories over the years, but these are            exceptions rather than the rule. The overall effect of Capcom's            attempts to make the characters in Plasma Sword unique, to give the            game a serious backstory no less, is not as they may have desired.            Rather than adding additional depth to the game, it makes makes the            whole thing seem cheesier than the most luxurious Quattro Formaggio            pizza you've ever seen. (That's quite a claim, milladio -Ed)             Every beat-em-up game has joke characters which you can unlock, or            a specific character who is meant to provide light relief; be it            the Panda in Tekken 3, or Maxi in Soul Calibur (who manages to            knock himself out with his nanchaku during a particularly            spectacular bit of showing off). One of the basic problems with            Plasma Sword is that every single character in the game feels like            one of these joke characters; the type of character who, like the            playable piece of tofu in Resident Evil 2, is laughed at briefly            before being dumped for good, never again to leave the prison-like            confines of the character select screen. Only Hayato plays like a            reasonably competent fighting character, and even that is at the            expense of having any particularly decent special moves.                         Take, for example, Saturn - a ~loveable~ green-skinned character            who has a cone-shaped head and a lot of multicoloured bangles. He            fights using, believe it or not, a pair of yo-yos! Ho ho, isn't            this amusing! He hits you with his yo-yos, and even uses them as an            impromptu grappling hook! One of his special moves makes you do a            little dance before he blats you! As you can imagine, the            indescribable hilarity of this wears off very quickly as you            realise that not only is Saturn a main character in the game, he is            actually relatively normal as Plasma Sword characters go. Others            sport laser rifle, light sabers and plasma-edged axes, and all of            the characters have ludicrous special moves. As character            selections go, playing Plasma Sword for any length of time feels            like accidentally picking up a trick deck of cards - one in which            every card is a joker.                    Poor fight mechanics are unforgiveable in a beat-em-up, and there's            no doubt that Plasma Sword has some of the poorest fight mechanics            I've ever seen, making the likes of the risible Star Wars: Masters            of Teras Kasi look enjoyable and deep. In fact, the fighting system            in Plasma Sword makes Kate Moss' lingerie look deep. Frankly, it's            appalling that a company like Capcom can on one hand produce            wonderful beat'em'ups such as Marvel Vs Capcom 2 and SNK Vs Capcom,            and yet turn around and produce low-grade dross such as this at the            same time. Some of the poor gameplay could be excused if the game            was a graphical triumph, but sadly this is less of a triumph and            more of a full-scale disaster.                         The graphics of Plasma Sword are not only clunky and outdated by            Dreamcast standards (after all, with technically stunning games            such as Soul Calibur and Dead Or Alive 2 on the system, it's            becoming increasingly difficult to look ground-breakingly stunning            on the Dreamcast), but they would look poor on a modern PlayStation            game. Not exactly high praise for a title running on the fastest            currently-available console system! (Over here anyway, tomorrow            is the 26th of October lest we forget -Ed)             The characters themselves are very low-polygon - they look chunky            and blocky, and shading artifacts mean that the edges of the            polygons are easy to see. The low-quality textures used don't do            anything but exacerbate this and the poor-quality animation of the            characters doesn't help much either. Character movement looks jerky            and I suspect that the game doesn't bother to use tweening frames            in animations, or that their tweening system simply doesn't work.            Either way, the characters look terrible when they stand still, and            even worse when they move. So where, you may ask, is the processor            power of your Sega-built superconsole going? It isn't the game            mechanics, it certainly isn't the character graphics, could it be            that the play areas are breathtakingly lush and detailed?                    Whatever your Dreamcast's power is doing while playing Plasma Sword            (I would imagine that ~not a lot~ pretty much summarises the answer            to this question, actually), it isn't being pumped into displaying            lush backgrounds. The backgrounds are, in fact - wait for it - 2D            images that scroll around as you fight. Yes, good old hand-drawn            2D. The ground on which you fight is similar to Dead Or Alive on            the Playstation - a rectangle that mysteriously fades into the            distance about 3 metres away from your feet. Somebody on the            development team must have been drinking a lot of coffee while            creating some of the stages, however, because they have completely            outdone themselves by having the characters fight in a giant puddle            - with ripples and reflections! Actually, what this boils down to            is that two small circles appear beside your characters feet every            time they step anywhere, and the buildings in the background are            mirrored into the water with a slightly wavy modifier applied to            them. This has the presumably unwanted effect of making it look as            though your characters are doing battle on a stretched piece of            cling film suspended over a futuristic city; however, this is about            as special as the ~special~ effects in Plasma Sword get. After all,            when other graphical highlights include ~pasting a random texture            all over the floor during special moves~ (I call this the ~vomit in            a compost heap~ effect) and ~a slowly expanding circle with            multicoloured bits~, one does start to wonder about the use of the            word ~highlight~ in the first place.                         As far as aural stimulation goes, Plasma Sword is not actually            substandard; it is just very, very average. The music consists of            endless looped samples that sound like, well, every single other            beat-em-up game you ever played. There are ~thunk~ noises when you            kick somebody and ~thwap~ noises when you slap them with your            weapon, as well as ~grunt~ and ~argh~ noises when something            particularly painful happens to a character onscreen. One of the            few positive things to be said about the game is that the Japanese            voices have not been redubbed for the Western release. The addition            of terrible American voiceovers would have been a final dash of            awkwardness which would probably have reduced this reviewer to            tears of pain and desperation. As it stands, the voiceovers, like            the rest of the audio in the game, is completely unremarkable.                    The Dreamcast is a wonderful console. It is powerful,            well-supported, reliable and has a superb library of top-notch            software titles. Any owner of a Dreamcast will probably be            bankrupted in the coming months by the deluge of quality software            for the platform. Put bluntly, Plasma Sword is not one of these            pieces of quality software. If your Dreamcast is going to bankrupt            you in the run up to Christmas, then at least make sure that you're            bankrupted due to purchasing good games. Take it from us - this            travesty isn't worth the walk to the rentals shop, never mind the            risk of financial insolvency."}
