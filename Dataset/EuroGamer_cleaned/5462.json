{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/pocket-16", "date": "17 Oct 2006", "game_name": "Lemmings", "text": "Tailored for the mobile format, this retro conversion of Lemmings makes cuts and tweaks in allthe right places to ensure that old school fans and Lemmingsvirgins will be similarly delighted.For the latter, if they even exist, a quick recap: you are a godlike figure who must empower your followerswith specific skills in order to help them negotiate a series ofincreasingly deadly environments. The upside is that there's quitea diversity of skills on offer, varying from the mundane digging,climbing and building bridges to the more exotic floating, smashingand erm... exploding. The downside is that you only have a limitednumber of each of the skills to endow, and your eponymous disciples arelolloping rodents who joyfully trail after one another regardlessof the spinning blades, toxic pools and sheer cliff-faces in theirpath.So ensues a rich mix of initial strategic planning (put ablocker here, build a bridge there) followed by a rather morefrantic execution in which you put your stratagems into action and,more often than not, witness the one small but fatal flaw in yourplan lead to another mass suicide.The difficulty level is well-balanced with early essentiallytuition levels giving way to ever more challenging obstacles andcorresponding reduced time limits and skills. The control systemhas been equally well implemented with a handy lock button enablingyou to select a lemming and track him in advance of allocating askill. Naturally, even the most sensitive of phone joysticks is nomatch for a mouse, but if anything this adds to the frantic natureof the challenge rather than detracting from the game.However unarguably, the real genius of the game is to be foundin both the open-ended design allowing you to experiment in yourapproach to most levels and the characterisation of the lemmingsthemselves. Graphically it's virtually identical to it's forbear, cramming more character into a couple ofpixels for it's hapless heroes than many home console titles canmanage with a full textured 3D model. Even the most saintly amongus must admit to taking a guilty pleasure from triggering theArmageddon option when a level has either been fluffed (orachieved) with lemmings to spare, starting a countdown from 5 afterwhich the rodents literally pop their clogs.Disappointingly, the immortal cries of the lemmings ('let's go!'when the level opens and 'oh no!' when facing imminent death) areabsent although the familiar jaunty music tracks remain. The onlyother real criticism to offer is, as with the original, there areonly 30 levels to play through and no new ones.Otherwise, this is a perfect conversion of one of the mostimaginative puzzlers ever produced and an absolute essential forany self-respecting mobile games collection."}
