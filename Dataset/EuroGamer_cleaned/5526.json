It'snot often described as 'quite cute' or 'a bit of a laugh'. Still, these are precisely the words that ought to be dangling around Cannon Fodder's neck. On dogtags, obviously. Not one of those girly chains. Although maybe...Equal parts Platoon and South Park, thisconversion of a classic home computing war game truly lives up tothe ~war has never been so much fun~ theme.Whether they're picking off jungle patrols, steering skidoosthrough arctic wastelands or simply lobbing grenades at guard-huts(and sending the doors flying) the miniature military under yourcontrol rarely fail to raise a smile. Heck, they even die in afairly humorous way, issuing a cry and being propelled violentlyaway from the gunshot with blood trailing... Well it amused us,anyway, but let's not dwell on that.The entertainment is further extended by some intelligent andincreasingly challenging level designs - which involve the use ofvehicles and more advanced weaponry like rockets - and somewonderful details like the way the body counts are tallied up ashome vs away scores as in a footie match or the tongue in cheekmission names.Unfortunately the control system, though in many ways as braveas your shrimpy soldiers, isn't quite as charming (having sufferedthe equivalent of a shrapnel wound en route to the mobile phone). The process of manoeuvring your troopsacross land and sea (either singularly or as a group) involvesrotating a cursor (controlled by left and right on joypad or 4/6keys) and then pushing up (or 2) to actually move and 5 to fire inthe direction indicated. Whilst this is undeniably effective inallowing you to select a very specific direction of fire, it toofrequently introduces annoying delays and misdirections in the heatof battle leaving you pointed in the wrong direction and unable toturn and fire before you yourself are picked off. This is furthercompounded by a rather temperamental secondary fire control (usedfor grenades and rockets) which either demands you find preciselythe right spot to fire from or fails to operate completely againleading to your demise more often than not.Although both of these niggles can be combated by a moreponderous tactical approach, and neither is enough to prevent youfrom wanting to keep playing on to the next mission (especiallywhen you have a nearly unlimited amount of Cannon Fodder,sorry 'brave troopers', at your disposal), they are more thancapable of wiping the smile from your face, particularly on themulti-part missions. Once the smoke from your ears has clearedhowever, the sheer joy of battle will ensure that you'll struggleto resist taking just one more incursion into enemy territory."}
