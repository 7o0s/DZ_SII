{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-mvc2-ps2", "date": "26 Dec 2002", "game_name": "Marvel vs Capcom 2", "text": "If the Dreamcast had an abundance of anything, it was fighting            games and a crowd of hardcore devotees willing to lap them up.            Arguably one of the finest fighters released on the platform was            Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and some two years later Capcom have seen fit            to resurrect the classic to a new and far wider audience on the            PlayStation 2.        But come on... two years? That's a            long time to leave a title to mature, and most titles left for this            length of time would have been surpassed long ago. It's a testament            to just how accomplished this title was, then, that it still feels            like a powerful contender amongst the fresher faced games bustling            for attention in the genre.                    The Marvel vs. Capcom franchise is unique in that one on one            battles are eschewed in favour of three-character tag fights,            lending a completely chaotic but often strategic slant to the            proceedings. The main portion of the game takes the form of the            genre-staple Arcade mode. You pick three from the complement of 56            fighters, comprising favourites from the Marvel universe and Capcom            classics, and enter the fray.                    Once the fight starts, you're able to freely switch between            combatants with a click of the shoulder buttons, helping you to            better suit your current opponent. While off screen, each fighter            regains a little health and so simple ability-swapping strategies            can evolve as the fights go on. Additionally, if your current            character is in need of a little backup, another character can be            brought in briefly to automatically perform a special move while            you step back to work on a combo.        At first, all the to-ing and fro-ing            can feel like a frantic mess, but once the nuances of combos,            character switching and special abilities sinks in, you'll be            deftly performing devastating assaults on your opponent's team. The            screen sometimes descends into a mess of colour and stuff            flying all about the place, particularly when a couple of            characters team up for a special attack, and losing track of            exactly who it is you're meant to be controlling is a regular            annoyance.                    The game tends to rely on intensity a little too much for my tastes            however, and at first you'll be randomly bashing away at the            buttons without any real sense of control; wins in the early stages            can feel like a totally random occurrence. This enforces the fact            that the art of playing MVC2 is an acquired taste, and tapping the            hidden depths of the game could take weeks or even months. The            deceptively simple approach to the game's presentation disguises an            enormously complex fighting model.                    Visually, the game is very strong for a two year old 2D fighter.            Well, we say 2D, but the backgrounds are lavish animated 3D            backdrops, decorated with a wonderful painterly quality that feels            both unusual and surprisingly elegant when contrasted against the            bombast of the foreground effects. There are some nasty sprite            scaling issues as a result of the port to PS2, but the well            animated characters are flitting about the screen so fast the            majority of the time, you rarely get a chance to notice. It's a            shame such nicely-crafted visuals can be backed by such a horrific,            lift-music oriented soundtrack and low quality sound effects,            though.                    Whether or not the number was up for 2D fighters long ago is            something of a grey area, but this is by no means an unsuccessful            cash in of a port. There are easily better fighters on the PS2            though, and so this feels more like an exercise in retro gaming            than an essential and accessible purchase. One for the hardcore,            then.                            Marvel vs. Capcom 2 screenshots (PS2)                                    Marvel vs. Capcom 2 screenshots (PS2)"}
