{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-arxfatalis-pc", "date": "5 Nov 2002", "game_name": "Arx Fatalis", "text": "First-person role playing games have something of a patchy history,            with examples ranging from the superb Deus Ex through the arguably            mediocre Morrowind to the lamentably bad Kings Field series.            Created by continental developers Arkane Studios, Arx Fatalis is            the latest addition to this genre; the question being whether it            scales the heights of Deus Ex, or plumbs the depths of the            execrable Kings Field.        While Morrowind immediately impressed            players with graphical excellence, Arx Fatalis starts off rather            less promisingly, with our hero character bashing his bonce and            ending up in a murky prison cell, lacking both clothing and his            memory. Not exactly an innovative backstory, although the high            concept of the game - a world whose sun died, leading to the            construction of huge underground cities beneath the mountains while            the surface is locked in perpetual ice and darkness - is an            interesting one, bringing to mind particularly Brian Aldiss'            fantastic Helliconia novels.                    After breaking out of your cell, the game leads you around by the            nose for a couple of hours, learning the ropes of the world into            which you have been introduced. The level of interaction is            certainly better than most RPGs, with potential uses for just about            everything in the world, and your character skills are very open to            adjustment, allowing you to learn handy tricks such as lock            picking, powerful magic or better persuasion when bartering for            goods. All the statistical staples RPG fans will expect are present            and correct, while the first person setting is used to good effect            in terms of puzzles and hidden areas.        The primary plot of Arx Fatalis is a            complex one, and has the obligatory raising of Dark Gods and            Terrible Evils Which Threaten The World (TM). Interestingly,            though, Arkane has opted to make the plot quite linear, and while            there's always plenty to do on the side, the main path of the game            is always fairly clear. In many ways, we prefer this to the            open-ended nature of something like Morrowind, which seemed very            clever for a few hours and then became quite dull once we realised            that although things were happening, they were happening very            slowly indeed. Arx Fatalis keeps the pace up and keeps the progress            of the story interesting, which is in many ways a vital feature of            a good RPG.                    Other vital features, of course, are good magic and combat systems            - of which Arx, sadly, delivers only one. The combat system is            vastly disappointing, making almost no use whatsoever of the            first-person mechanics available to the creators, with shockingly            poor collision detection and physics. Obviously RPG combat is            inherently stats-based, but in this instance you might as well be            clicking on your enemies with a mouse pointer a la Diablo, rather            than waving a sword in first-person mode. To be fair, no first            person RPG with the exception of Deus Ex has really managed this            problem particularly well, but it's disappointing nonetheless that            combat is so lacklustre.        What isn't            lacklustre by any means is the magic system, which takes its cue            from the mouse gestures used to cast spells in Black and White.            Spells are built up from a collection of runes, which are generally            hidden away in hard-to-find places around the game, and are cast by            doing the correct series of rune-gestures onscreen. Cleverly, you            can pre-cast a certain number of spells and store them as hotkeys,            which is a very useful ability for combat, although once you've            become proficient at casting you probably won't bother. Each new            rune you find opens up a variety of new possibilities for spells,            making this into one of the most interesting systems in the game.                    Graphically, Arx Fatalis won't be challenging the throne of            Morrowind any time soon, but it's certainly acceptable in terms of            rendering impressive, gloomy indoor environments. The game's            creatures and characters are also nicely drawn - a little too            nicely in some cases, with this (mildly arachnophobic) reviewer            finding the giant spiders which infest certain areas of the game a            little bit too realistic for his liking. Yes, I know, I'm a big            girl's blouse... The audio is also good, with a generally high            standard of voice acting and sound effects. Sadly, the main            characters voice is downright annoying, but the incidental            characters more than compensate for this mistake.                    Arx Fatalis is a huge, sprawling game, with loads of sub-systems to            explore and master and a compelling plot to drive you forward. In            many ways this game is superior to Morrowind; although it doesn't            have the initial appeal offered by that title's graphical            splendour, it has a lot more depth and far less time is spent            walking from place to place aimlessly. As a dungeon-crawling RPG,            it's a lot of fun, so if that's your sort of thing - and you don't            mind dealing with the quirks of an occasionally poorly-implemented            first person viewpoint - then it's definitely worth checking out.
