And probably divorced,                 friendless, jobless, and living in an Internet Caf\u00e9,                 having been evicted from the home they once occupied. After a                 period of enforced abstinence, there was almost a feeling of                 dread when the CM4 review code arrived, as we knew just how                 all-consumingly antisocial the effect of installing it on our                 fearful PC would be.                    You see, CM has time-shifting properties. You put it on, and you            vow to have a ~quick go~, maybe reshaping your favourite team in            your image, checking out your squad's form and fitness and            dithering over which central defensive partnership works best. If            you can resist the temptation to check out how other team's players            are performing (and maybe put in a sneaky bid or two) then you            might just get around to playing your next fixture. But then your            team puts in a thoroughly indifferent performance; throwing on subs            and a switch of tactics makes little difference. Dang. Time to            rethink. This team are a bunch of overpaid prima donna donkeys.                    But oh gawd. We've got how much in the transfer kitty? How on Earth            are we going to restore this bunch of apathetic losers to the            elite? Best check out those out of contract players, and best we            start polishing up on our precise knowledge of the lower leagues.            We need hunger, desire, commitment, a sympathetic board, loyal            fans, and hour upon hour of our spare time. Shit. Is that the time?            Oh my god, it's daylight. Time to throw a sickie...        It's impossible                 to do CM justice in a review so soon into its lifespan. Sports                 Interactive's lavish attention to detail is staggering, and                 it's no exaggeration that you'll be discovering the                 intricacies of the game in months, and possibly years to come.                 Already this game has forced us to forfeit sleep, forget to go                 to work, and had us furiously scouring the sports pages in the                 vain hope of surreptitiously gaining a degree of in                 depth-knowledge on the stars of the lower leagues.                    Naturally, CM4, like its predecessors is a game with an almost            infinite number of skill levels to suit the demands of the player.            With an incredible number of teams and leagues to choose from (from            39 national leagues across the globe) it really does come down to            personal preference of an extraordinarily precise level. If you            don't fancy scrapping it with the basement boys, then you can            always choose a fantastically rich club with unrivalled funds and a            huge stadium. Think ManYoo.                    Or, if you've got soul and fancy awakening a sleeping giant, then            you could, in theory, choose a Conference club and eventually guide            them to the dizzy heights of Champions League glory. You'd have to            overcome overwhelming odds to do so, and work tirelessly to grab            every underrated and under-valued player going, but the option is            there if you've got the stomach for the battle.        There are pros and cons whatever end of the difficulty spectrum            you choose to plump for. Choose a big club, and the odds can be            stacked against you in all manner of ways. Success will be a given.            Both the board and the supporters (and the media) will demand it,            and if you don't get things right from the off, you'll soon find            the pressure will be on. On the flip side, at an unfancied club            you'll be given time to turn things around, and expectations will            be correspondingly lower. It's all a question of how you want to            play things, and this level of depth and flexibility runs            throughout the entire package.                    On first glance it's possible to dismiss CM4 as a tarted up version            of the previous two versions. The core of the game has, since CM2,            been almost flawless, and SI is right to have retained the simple            core of the game. But peek behind the surface and it's almost            unbelievable how the team has managed to pack so many easily            accessible layers into the package. Careful use of the right mouse            button opens up so many possibilities, and within literally a few            minutes you're able to traverse a world of information and hidden            detail with virtually no effort.                    Filters play an equally important part of the experience. At its            most bloated, CM can seem ridiculously over-stuffed with insane            amounts of detail, including the option of taking charge of reserve            and youth teams. At this uber-hardcore level you'd barely get            through a week's fixtures in a night's session, but CM4 always            gives you the option of filtering out the peripheral detail. It's            this ability to play the game as deeply as you require, with a            beautiful interface that is ultimately the key to the game's            success as it is an everyman game. Pick up and play, tinker like an            obsessed lunatic and all points in between; it's hard to think of a            single other game out there that allows you to do this. And it's            this very element that makes CM such a personal experience;            literally every single player of the game will be living their own            unique vision of the beautiful game. Or suffering harrowing            hardship - it's all down to the decisions you make; the teams you            pick, the crazy 8-1-1 tactics you employ and the time you take.        Talking of time, you reap what you sow in CM4 like never            before. As we've discussed, the layers of detail enable a            breathtaking amount of micromanagement that can have a subtle            effect on what goes on on the pitch. The team, of course, will be            your prime concern, and careful observation of their personalities,            contracts, and physical attributes are all important. Even with the            right qualities, in the right positions, and with the correct team            balance, success can be an elusive quest. But part of the fun of CM            is the trial and error; you may not realise what works until            several seasons into the game - at which point it may well be too            late. One tactic we always employ is to play the game for a few            seasons, find out who the real bargains are, and start over,            identifying the transfer targets. Signing Wayne Rooney in            pre-season is always a good one (after all, who had heard of him            back in July last year?).                    The much vaunted 2D match engine is clearly the biggest addition to            CM4. By default, the game flicks to an overhead viewpoint of the            pitch and displays numbered, coloured blobs to represent the            players. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but it gives            instant feedback on how your team in performing: are they being            beaten for pace? How sharp is your No.9 in front of goal? Is your            central defender winning the aerial duels? All these previously            difficult to determine factors are answered in seconds, and the            more you get involved in the game, the easier it becomes to work            out who deserves to be in the team, and who deserves to warm the            bench.                    Of course, the running text commentary still delivers an            atmospheric sense of anticipation but being able to actually see            your onrushing forward in the 2D engine takes away some of the old            magic. But in reality, you get a far better idea of the relative            merits of your (and your opposition's) team, which was never that            easy with the old system of playing blindfolded. Many still argue            that a fully realised 3D match engine would be the ultimate way of            displaying highlights, but we suspect that this is not something            Sports Interactive would consider, at the risk of diluting the            purity of the game. Looking at our crystal (foot)ball, however, it            can't be beyond the realms of possibility to imagine CM5 in 2007(?)            sporting a glitzier approach to the match highlights. Think of all            that power at their disposal.        Back to the present, CM4 is considerate when it comes to your            PC's capabilities. One of the most intelligent elements of the            series is its ability to run on a vast array of PCs, from the            creaking underpowered relics upwards, taking advantage of any extra            processing power or memory capabilities if they're there. The            latest version does this even better than previously, even to the            extent of making recommendations of how many leagues your machine            is capable of running simultaneously. Admittedly, we weren't            prepared to go against this advice, but by following the            recommended settings, the number crunching was pleasingly swift,            even on a relatively underpowered laptop.                    At the risk of turning this review into a dissertation, CM4's            feature list is exhaustive to the point of madness. Every element            of training, scouting, injuries, the media, commercial            opportunities, and the all-important transfer market management is            handled with such conviction, it's clear that this project has been            a labour of love for everyone connected with the game. The old            adage of Sports Interactive creating a game that they themselves            would want to play is never more apparent. Of course it's utterly            self indulgent, but in the most gloriously satisfying and complete            way possible. It doesn't get any better than this; fact\u2026until            the next CM, naturally.                    The greatness of CM4 screams at you from every angle: it has a            fantastic user interface that even the complete ChampMan novice can            slip straight into, is underpinned by a staggering amount of depth            to cater for literally anyone, and is frighteningly realistic - not            to mention ridiculously entertaining. As we scribe, the game has            already smashed the sales record for the fastest-selling PC game            ever. If you're a PC-owning football fan, you owe it to yourself to            own this game - it's that simple. The ultimate fantasy football?            Back of the net."}
