The ludicrous re-hashing of old ideas is synonymous with            this tradition, especially with athletics games and Olympics            tie-ins, with usually the only real change being the gaming            hardware and the graphical capabilities available. So.. the year            2000 sees another Olympic games, with only one licensee (this year            it went to Attention to Detail) and another parade of titles            coincidentally being released at the same time, all clamouring for            the ultimate recreation of this glorious sporting occasion.                         Sega are a bunch who have come to be known as game creators who            set standards, and they certainly haven't shied away from this            trend with their Sega Sports titles on Dreamcast. The most recently            notable of these obviously being Virtua Tennis - an outstanding            piece of work by anyone's standards, it even made EuroGamer editor            Tom Bramwell want to get up and play tennis.. anyone who's met him            will know that's no mean feat. (Fired -Ed) And so it is with            great pleasure and anticipation I picked up Virtua Athlete 2K,            looking forward to a repeat of the kind of quality and sheer            gameplay on show in VT.                         Back in days of yore, a game by Konami called International Track            & Field (the Dreamcast update will be upon us very soon)            heralded a control method in which the players could physically            exert themselves in a manner only superseded by the real-world            competitors. This method involved bashing two buttons as fast as            physically possible without breaking your fingers and/or the game            cabinet. I was expecting more of the same frenetic fun from VA2K.            But, to my immense surprise, it proved to be possibly the worst            execution of this formula I've yet played.                    Obviously, the aim of the game is to break world records in a            series of seven events and win medals for your country. The events            (100m dash, long jump, shot-put, high jump, 110m hurdles, javelin            and the 1500m race) are all executed with more or less the same            method of bashing the two running buttons, and then utilising a            third button to perform a particular task, such as jumping a hurdle            or tossing a javelin - apart from the shot-put, where you just            press the button when the power bar is full, the hold it down again            to judge your angle, then release. Before each event starts, you're            given a brief tutorial as to how to perform your task. This would            be all well and good, but unfortunately the instructions flick past            so quickly, you're very likely to be caught off-guard and not know            what you're supposed to be doing. Blundering into an event blindly            for the first time hardly reinforces the fun-factor.                         In an attempt at innovating on this style of game, Sega have seen            fit to introduce stamina to the running events. How this works is            that above your power meter (which fills up according to how fast            you tap the buttons) are four coloured blocks. If the power meter            exceeds the end of these blocks, they begin to disappear, and when            they are finally dissipated, your runner begins to stumble, leaving            you to slowly tap away until he can regain his pace.                    Frankly, this attempt at some kind of realism only hinders gameplay            and removes any kind of fun you could've had, especially so on the            immensely disappointing 1500m race, and on what should be a            frenetic button-bashing experience, the 100m dash instead become an            immensely complex and frustrating task. Even more criminal is the            fact that you can't turn the feature off.                         Another ~innovation~ is the ability to create your own athlete            with some sexy leotard colour-combo's and upload your scores and            times gained during the competition to the VA2K website via your            Dreamcasts network function - hardly a reason to buy the game,            though, but sadly there are seldom other redeeming features. Audio            and music is grating (I deplore anyone who can withstand to            horrendously patronising tannoy announcements), and player models            have the appearance and build of comedy styrofoam theme-park            statuettes. Animation is relatively pleasant, however, but rarely            reaches the superior heights of Virtua Tennis.                         Another bugbear I simply must go back to is a joke of an event,            the 1500m race. One of the events affected to the absolute maximum            by the dire stamina ~feature~, a few goes and a couple of surely            unintended little quirks of the game mechanics let you in as to how            you can easily win the race. Simply stand at the front of the pack,            tap slowly and let the rear runners literally shunt you down the            track, all the way home. How the playtesters didn't pick that one            up is beyond me. It also occurred to me that during the            mini-tutorials, the game instructed that for the shot-put, the best            throwing angle would be 45 degrees. Fair enough, I thought. Until            it instructed the same for the javelin and even the high jump            events. Honestly\u2026 what on Earth are these people thinking?            Little things like this scream laziness.                    Sadly, a game which could've been a real Dreamcast killer app to            accompany the likes of, dare I say it again, Virtua Tennis, simply            fails to impress on so many levels. Quite how Sega managed to stuff            it up so badly is beyond me, because VA2K honestly lacks any kind            of fun factor, and longevity doesn't even come into play here. This            is the type of throwaway game I'd come to expect of latter            PlayStation publishers (no offense to PSX owners meant). All the            signs are clear that this game was made simply to cash in on the            Olympics, and as such feels unfinished and rushed - exactly a            factor of the title rush I mentioned in my opening paragraphs. I            can't help wondering what this game could've accomplished had it            not been pushed to meet the stiff competition it will surely face,            and so our attention turns to the original contender, International            Track & Field."}
