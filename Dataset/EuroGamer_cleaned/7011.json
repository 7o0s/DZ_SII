But as is            always the case in any space epic, everyone wants to rule the            universe! I guess it would make for a pretty miserable and boring            computer game if all of the different lifeforms exchanged polite            chatter and sipped tea together.                    In Far Gate you take control of the Proximan colony, the human side            of the story, pitting your wits against the two other races in the            game, the Nue-Guyen and Entrodii. Why science fiction type games            always spring up planet or race names with a double 'i' in them, or            think that having a 'xz' in the name is cool, I will never know.                    You play Jacob Viscero, a cynical young man who has been            blackmailed into assisting the Proximan colony to re-establish them            as the dominant force in the universe. It's no surprise then that            the game is a strategic battle to occupy and defend territory in            different quadrants of space. With games like Homeworld already            shining the light brightly for the space strategy gaming genre, Far            Gate really has a hard job at hand to impress.         In single            player you only get to play as the Proximan colony, but thankfully            you can play as any of the colonies in multiplayer. All of the            missions take place within an entire solar system, complete with            gas clouds, asteroid belts, wormholes, planets and of course the            huge mass that makes the worlds go round - the Sun.                    The mission formula treads familiar ground, with your first task            usually to set up a construction base, or ~Station Hub~ as they are            called in the game. Once in place you can build ships, turrets,            remote mining stations, planet-side defence systems and lots more            besides. To gather the resources you need you will have to mine            nearby asteroid belts using the small Utility Pods. You will often            find that the enemy targets these pods, and you are well advised to            deploy a few Gunships and Interceptors to protect them.                    For the most part all of the action is performed via the mouse, and            although you will need at least half an hour to acclimatise            yourself to the way it all works, once you know what you're doing            the interface is a dream to use. From anywhere in the solar system            you can zoom in and out from any ship, structure or planet with a            simple click of the mouse. Your ships are easily accessed via a            neat pop-up menu, and you can divide or merge them into fleets as            you please and then assemble these squadrons into various            formations.                    Setting up patrol routes is simplicity itself, and is useful for            detecting incoming enemies that were previously out of radar range.            The game can become a frightful yawn though if a mission involves            your setting up or protecting an area of the solar system a long            way from your initial starting position. There is no time            acceleration option, and you quite literally have to wait for your            ships to traverse the entire distance before continuing. Space is            big, man!         While you are            busying yourself with your empire building your enemy will either            be doing some construction of their own or trying to destroy yours.            The combat system can be awfully confusing, and it is quite            difficult to pinpoint just what exactly is going on at any one            time, or even whether you are winning!                    This can be further compounded when you have more than one battle            to contend with, and it becomes a major headache to actually            administrate everything with any sense that you are in complete            control. Enemies also have an uncanny knack of disappearing            altogether, and I don't just mean off the radar - they vamoose            completely! It can be extremely infuriating when you have made the            effort to send a squadron out to deal with an enemy that is no            longer there, especially if those troops are needed elsewhere.                    The game AI also appears to be incredibly haphazard about what            enemy it is attacking. If I instruct my entire squadron to attack            one ship and one ship only, then I don't expect them to do what the            heck they please, unless I have the 'auto attack' function enabled            of course. Some of the alien species are big guys that take a lot            of pounding to take down, so channelling all of your forces into            that one vessel is vital. If the game does not play ball it can            easily lead to mission failure.         One area where Far Gate            does excel though is in the graphics department. The gas clouds,            planets and wormholes look absolutely stunning, and the sun itself            gives off wonderful flames that dissipate into space beautifully.            It is quite easy to get struck on the eye candy rather than playing            the game. The immensity of space is convincingly portrayed, and the            ability to view all of the action from any angle makes the            experience even more enjoyable.                    The graphical excellence continues with the ship and structure            models looking superb; ships burners blasting blue and white trails            behind them, Station Hubs rotating silently as they build new            items, and the industrious Utility Pods to-and-froing from the            asteroids. The detail level is very good, and becomes even more            apparent when you zoom in and witness the intricacies up close.                    Audio on the other hand is a little disappointing, with just your            typical Star Wars inspired laser sounds and strangely dull            explosions. Okay, so in reality you actually would not hear any            sound at all in space, but come on, spruce it up a bit! Meanwhile            the soundtrack is a strange orchestral mish-mash which sounds more            like a concert hall full of musicians tuning their instruments than            a game complimenting score, but is still oddly compelling.         Far Gate then is graphically superb but cursed by a rather            confusing and flawed combat system. The length of time it takes for            your ships to traverse the solar system is unnecessarily            long-winded, and it can be particularly annoying if you have gone            there specifically to confront an aggressor only to find that they            have completely disappeared. Without the ability to play through            the single player game as one of the two other species, the sixteen            missions do not give you much in the way of value. The game can be            taken online, but at the time of writing there was only a closed            beta test server to play on.                    It's entertaining enough, but the little annoyances will get under            your skin eventually, which is a shame as the foundations for            something truly splendid were in place."}
