A triumph            of the Ion Storm ~Design Is Law~ philosophy (and perhaps the only            one to date), the gritty urban tale of conspiratorial government            schemes and shady corporate nastiness won the hearts of gamers            aching for something different to quench their thirst for            originality in the first person genre. Some two years after Warren            Spector's masterpiece first hit the shelves, it's now the turn of            PS2 gamers to get a taste of the action.                         The player assumes the role of JC Denton, a genetically engineered            counter-terrorist operative working for the global policing            organisation, UNATCO. Denton's uncompromising strength, stealth and            combat capabilities are a result of his nano-augmentation. These            nano-augs are carried out by miniscule machines inside the subject,            which manipulate key functions of the body to enhance vision,            combat strength, speed and a good number of other skills.            Furthermore, Denton can easily upgrade his talents through the            installation of aug canisters found throughout the game world,            which each give him a choice of two skills.                         The clever part is that your game will take on a completely            different feel depending on which skills you choose. Concentrating            on strength and ballistic resistance augmentations will virtually            turn Denton into a walking tank. Conversely, upgrading his ability            to run silently and increasing his speed will enable you to conduct            swift stealth operations without even having to pull out a riot            prod for defence. Couple this with the opportunity to gradually            upgrade Denton's core skills like computer hacking, swimming,            weapons handling, visual enhancement and the like, and you have the            opportunity to mould the game into your own kind of adventure.                    We were perhaps naively confident that Deus Ex wouldn't fall foul            of the regimentally sloppy PC-to-console porting process, and that            the game would remain as playable, accessible and involving as its            older brother. However, the conversion is a rather mixed effort; in            some places we're happy to say that the port has been a resounding            success, and in other areas we struggle to wonder what on earth Ion            Storm were thinking (as we so often do).                         It seemed wise to first probe the game's training level in order            to get to grips with Deus Ex's fairly complex control set, but this            is where the first major gripe with the conversion crops up - the            Dual Shock 2 controller just doesn't work well with first-person            gaming. It's not as if it's simply a case of having to get used to            the twitchy analogue aiming, because you never, ever will.            Obviously this is more a failing of the hardware, though, and with            a USB mouse and keyboard plugged into your PS2 you're laughing.                         Heading into the game's first mission reveals a fair amount of            other problems though. The first of these is how badly the PS2            handles the very clearly ageing Unreal Tournament engine, with the            frame rate dropping into single figures on regular occasions. More            often than not though, this is a fixture of the in-game cut scenes            and not sections of gameplay, and this is perhaps due to the clear            compromises in level design taken by Ion Storm to keep the            framerate steady. The sprawling UNATCO constructions now fit the            PS2's comparatively tiny memory capacity much better than they did            the average PC when the game was originally released...                    The level designers behind the PS2 port have relied on one tactic            to simplify the game's environments, and it basically boils down to            chopping them up. The result is that a number of small levels form            part of larger missions, connected by small tunnels and loading            screens, but this doesn't always work. For example, the complete            re-organisation of the Hell's Kitchen section is baffling, and a            sense of direction will do you no favours here as we found            ourselves stumbling around the map trying to find mission-critical            locations. Unfortunately, loads occur far more often than we would            have liked too, and this spoils the flow of the game in places            throughout.                         Other than moans and groans about the level design, there are a            handful of problems. The characters themselves have been graced            with much improved skin jobs, but the overall quality of texturing            and the lack of architectural detail in the game is shocking by            today's standards to be perfectly frank. Patchwork cement smeared            across enormous slabs at the foot of huge rectangular building            block constructions just doesn't cut it any more, certainly not as            far as conveying a vision of tortured urban hell is concerned.                         Building interiors are an improvement though, construction wise,            and the multiple approach routes and attention to detail here is            admirable. You can either head straight through the main entrance            and get ready for a confrontation with security, or you can have a            good poke around looking for a far more silent and deadly approach            - through a skylight perhaps? How about this elevator shaft? That            ventilation duct looks handy... you get the idea.                    But where the game falters on the visual side of things, it redeems            itself tremendously in others. The new PS2-exclusive rendered            cutscenes are a great deal more cinematic than the PC's wooden game            engine efforts, and the sound design is utterly fantastic. Much of            the soundtrack has been re-recorded with a full orchestra, and this            adds to the theatrical air. Elsewhere, sound effects and voice            acting are of fantastic quality, with the latter only slipping into            mediocrity on rare occasions, and if you've got the hardware,            proper 5.1 surround sound will enhance the experience.                         What made Deus Ex such a fantastic game on the PC is still here in            force, even if it does look and feel terribly haggard. The            satisfying rush of diving in and out of cover to avoid the gaze of            security cameras, slipping through a door without a sound to hack a            security terminal, followed by the turning and aiming of the sentry            turrets against unsuspecting guards is still there to savour. As is            the beautifully conceived storyline and the ongoing character            development - there's a narrative permeating throughout Deus Ex            that most contenders couldn't hope to better.                         A console conversion of a two-year-old game that looked a bit            shaky when it first came out was never going to be spectacular, and            Ion Storm have probably tailored the game to the format as far as            they possibly could. The interface changes are splendidly thought            out, offering items via a modified inventory menu seems to have            worked, squeezing the myriad of functions onto the Dual Shock 2 was            an impressive achievement, and the visuals have been augmented to            good effect, although perhaps with less success than JC's own            augmentation. Deus Ex is still an amazing, immersive and downright            life-stealing game no matter what platform it's on, and Ion Storm            can only be congratulated for that."}
