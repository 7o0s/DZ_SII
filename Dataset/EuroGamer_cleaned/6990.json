The game offers a progressive storyline            and enough opposition to keep you on the go nigh on constantly. As            you proceed you gain access to more powerful ships and better            weaponry, assuming a position of command and so on.                         Rather like the X-Wing titles from Lucasarts, each mission you            face is a pretty linear affair barring the occasional surprise, and            before starting you are treated to a short animated briefing, prior            to ship selection, and once over you set off out into space.            However unlike X-Wing and its cohorts, Starlancer forces you to            improvise. The game helps you on your way, steering you in the            right direction when needed, but although faced with an objective,            accomplishing it isn't always a case of following straight orders.                         On that note, one of the game's early drawbacks is that many            missions include instructions to shoot down torpedoes before they            can blow up your principal carriers, and the game is often quite            slow at drawing your attention to them. If fired, you have only a            small amount of time to react and take them down, and on two            separate occasions I had to replay lengthy sections because the            computer didn't warn me of their presence in time, or I was busy            cycling through the target roster while they winged their way into            the bowels of my ships.                    As a concept, Starlancer was always a likely one to be ported to            the Dreamcast, but I wasn't terribly convinced that the game would            turn out as well as it has. The subtle blend of graphical finesse            and console style action is right at home, but the control system            of the PC version was pretty complicated, using keyboard and            joystick seamlessly. Squeezing such an effective control system            onto the relatively simple Dreamcast controller was probably quite            an effort, but much to my delight the interface remains intact and            just as convenient.                         Rather like a racing title, the two triggers on the reverse of the            pad are used to control your velocity. Unlike other titles though,            using the acceleration trigger twice in quick succession fires up            the afterburners, while pulling both simultaneously will match your            speed with a targeted enemy. It's little double-ups like these on            each function that help make sure every option that PC users had is            also available to you on you control pad. Although complicated at            first, a bit of manual-juggling and common sense will see you            through.                         Navigation through the menus is achieved using a combination of            the X and Y buttons and the D-Pad, and whilst fiddling around with            those menus, you will notice all sorts of trendy features, like            online play, an instant action option (that allows you to race            against the clock to kill as many enemies as possible) and things            like that.                    Set against a backdrop of big burly planets (including our own cute            little blue one), the interstellar war parties are made up of            fighters, bombers, cruisers and even cargo ships. The slightly            unrealistic strafe function returns from the PC version, so given a            free run, almost-stationary objects like cruisers will have a            difficult time targeting you as you bank round them repeatedly,            covering them in blast craters.                         That said, your squad mates' AI is a bit shifty at times, so            strafing might not be such a good idea if you're not 100% sure that            the coast is clear. It's not just AI either; the game seems to have            issues with the order in which you take out certain objectives,            too.                         Blowing up turrets in particular seems to be a fine art. And don't            go thinking that just because you've played the mission through            once the game will let you use your advanced knowledge to any great            effect. I made that mistake, on more than one occasion, by failing            to destroy my targets, restarting, then coming back to attack the            secondary objective pre-emptively. If you try this, what you will            discover is that your onslaught of torpedoes is ineffective until            the primary objective is destroyed. Silly, isn't it?                    One of the things that made Starlancer's online play so captivating            on the PC was the co-operative mode, so its absence is a bit of a            sore point, but there are standard games of deathmatch and a few            derivatives for up to six players simultaneously. The various            servers online were a bit sparsely populated, but with any luck            they should fill up quite quickly now that the game has been            released.                         Another issue I had with the game was that although incredibly            pretty with its luxuriously textured ships and wondrous, gaping            black holes, it did seem a little dark at times. Space is fairly            dark, in general, but I was rather hoping to be able to see a            little more clearly. One might argue that the moody nature of the            game helps to emphasize the glorious explosions and the weapon            effects, but for me that's no excuse.                         With those few points made though, that just about wraps up the            groaning parade. Elsewhere the game is sublime - it has an            excellent soundtrack, not to mention some infectious in-mission            chatter from friendly pilots and endearing characters, and lest we            forget the inherent replay value. The PC version was pretty            ambitious, and although maybe the learning curve will prove a touch            steeper than most, with so much to offer it would be hard to run            out of reasons to play Starlancer any time this Solstice.                    Although marred by a few careless errors and idiosyncratic            oddities, Starlancer is a perfectly competent space shooter, and            one with enough brunt to keep you coming back for more. The single            player game is challenging, and playing multiplayer against other            experienced pilots is an exciting experience. Overall, an excellent            port, it's just a shame that the original had a few problems.            Related Features:-                        \u00a0Starlancer            Review"}
