The milking of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon            license has begun in earnest, and the initial droplet of calcium            from this particular gaming cow comes in the form of Desert Siege,            Ghost Recon's first mission pack.                         There are eight new single player missions to crack in Desert            Siege, along with a couple of new multiplayer modes (Siege and            Domination, both simple team-based territory defence and attack            games), four more multiplayer maps and nine new weapons, also for            multiplayer. The brand new single player campaign sees the elite            team of Green Berets known as the Ghosts heading into Eritrea to            protect the small country from invasion by neighbouring Ethiopia,            the peak of sixty years of conflict which is putting the Red Sea's            vital shipping lanes at risk.                         If there's one thing that bugged me about Ghost Recon, it was the            fact that just because Red Storm had knocked together a fancy-pants            engine capable of rendering lush open battlefields, they used it as            an excuse not to bother with the superb detail and variety of            locations so resplendent in the Rainbow Six series. While the            locales on offer in Desert Siege create a distinct change in            atmosphere and scenery from the predominantly green marshland of            the original, there is still a distinct lack of variety on the            whole. Assaults on well-designed sites like a train depot and an            oil refinery do offer some reprieve from the sprawling desert            scenes though, both in tactical decision-making and the actual pace            of the game.                    Despite the lack of progression in the actual design of the levels,            the game seems to be more at home in a desert context. The textures            and artwork are generally splendid and you can almost feel the sun            beating down on your face as the troops scramble across the harsh,            dusty terrain. The game is also audibly superb; the guns sound            suitably meaty, the chatter from fellow soldiers and enemies alike            manages to draw you into the world effectively, and the ambient            noise on some levels does a stellar job of depicting the war torn            environment you're struggling through.                         One of my other issues with Ghost Recon was Red Storm's attempt at            simplifying the soldier command interface. This resulted in some            degree of dumbing-down, effectively doing away with any real            planning stage, and so it became usual for me to just go it alone,            using other soldiers as extra lives as opposed to formulating any            kind of strategic assault routes. By contrast, the design of most            of these new missions facilitates and almost forces you to command            with utmost efficiency through this very simplistic interface. This            is achieved through the design of multiple and very obvious            approach paths on the maps, and while this makes the game feel a            little more linear, the sense of employing real tactics to outsmart            your enemy outweighs any drawbacks.                         The addition of some desert missions to the slightly plain Ghost            Recon is just what the title needed to re-establish Red Storm as            the gods of tactical action gaming. No doubt there will be a whole            string of expansion packs for Ghost Recon in the future, but as            long as this kind of standard is maintained, that will be no bad            thing.                        -        Ghost                    Recon reviewGhost                    Recon review"}
