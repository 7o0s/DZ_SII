{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-comanche4", "date": "15 Dec 2001", "game_name": "Comanche 4", "text": "While most flight sims aim for an almost excessive degree of            realism, manuals that put War & Peace to shame and controls            that require several hours of real life pilot training to master,            Comanche 4 is a very different beast. Designed to appeal to the            Quake generation, it's all about pick up and play action rather            than detailed flight models.                        A brief tutorial mission should make even the most inexperienced of            PC pilots feel at home with the advanced RAH-66 Comanche            helicopter, and then it's time to head off to war. Suitably enough            this is a new kind of war you are facing, with heavily armed            terrorists the target in most missions rather than hostile nations.            In all there are six campaigns, which you can play in any order,            and should you get stuck on one mission you can simply switch to a            different campaign and come back when you're feeling more            confident.                        Settings range from the Balkans and Belarus to the Libyan border            and tropical islands, with everything from deserts and jungles to            snow-covered forests and debris-strewn city streets to explore. The            one thing that these locations have in common is that they all look            absolutely stunning. Doing away with the voxels of yore,            Novalogic's new polygonal graphics engine still produces extensive            and highly detailed terrain while taking full advantage of modern            hardware.                    The result is eye-catching and the sheer attention to detail is            impressive. The wash from your rotors stirs up dust as you hover            low over the ground, oil tanks explode in huge rolling tongues of            flame, buildings gracefully collapse in on themselves in a cloud of            smoke and shattered glass, and ships slowly keel over and sink as            your missiles strike them.                        Moreover, for the first time in the Comanche series you really feel            as though you are in the middle of a full scale war. Enemy            helicopters and fighter jets fly overhead while jeeps, tanks,            trucks, anti-aircraft vehicles, infantry, icemobiles and dune            buggies litter the ground. Up close during the in-game cutscenes at            the start of each mission they can look slightly blocky, and the            way the tanks glide along the ground without their tracks moving is            a little disconcerting. But in the heat of battle you won't notice            any of this, and from a distance the vehicles look every bit as            beautiful as your own intricately modelled helicopter.                        Sadly all of this eye candy comes at a cost though. Even playing at            800x600 with a fast Athlon processor and GeForce 2 graphics card            the game can be rather choppy when things get frantic, and that's            with the default settings the game recommended for my hardware. If            you lift your helicopter too high into the air during a large            battle the whole thing can grind to a halt, rendering literally one            frame every second. There are plenty of options available to reduce            the detail of the graphics to improve your frame rate, but we would            recommend taking the minimum system requirements on the box with a            recommended daily allowance sized pinch of salt. The bottom line is            that while Comanche 4 still looks attractive on lesser systems, if            you want to see the game in all its glory you really need a GeForce            3 graphics card.                    Luckily most of the time you will be hugging the ground, making            things relatively easy for the graphics engine while maintaining a            low radar profile. Comanche 4 might be an action game at heart, but            it also has a healthy dose of stealth, and you will sometimes need            to take advantage of the terrain to avoid detection and complete            your sortie intact.                        Missions often boil down to ~follow the waypoints and shoot the red            dots on your radar display~, but there is enough variety to keep            things interesting. You may be called upon to infiltrate Russian            airspace and destroy a missile silo before terrorists can launch an            attack, to clear the way for engineers to recover a downed            satellite before the local army can get to it, or to take out the            anti-aircraft turrets and radar systems on a pair of destroyers to            open the way for an air strike on a naval flotilla. Frequently you            will be called upon to work in co-operation with allied ground or            air forces, with some campaigns seconding you to the CIA or Delta            Force to fly air support for their covert missions around the            world.                        The bad news is that a few of these missions are incredibly            difficult, and there is no in-game save function. Combine this with            the fact that a quick burst of machinegun fire followed by a direct            hit from a ground-to-air missile is enough to scatter your flaming            wreckage across the landscape, and you can imagine that things get            rather frustrating at times. There is nothing worse than            triumphantly taking on the entire Libyan army, only for your team            mate to fly into you from behind or a lone enemy soldier to knock            you out of the sky with a shoulder-fired missile as you close in on            your final target.                    This is made more irritating by the occasional targeting problems            which the game suffers from. For obvious reasons you lose your lock            on a target when you lose your line of sight to it, but this often            happens even when you can still quite clearly see your target and            it's only obscured by a few branches of a tree or the corner of a            ruined building.                        Luckily you can still take out a partially hidden anti-aircraft gun            with your cannon by aiming it manually, but in the heat of battle            this is easier said than done. It also makes using Hellfire            missiles far more difficult than it perhaps should be, as you must            maintain a target lock for as long as the missiles are in flight.            Unless you're out at sea or in the middle of a desert this is            harder than it sounds, especially if you are trying to dodge            incoming fire at the time. And if at any point your target            disappears behind a tree and you can't regain your lock quickly            enough, your missile will fly off out of control and miss            completely.                        The enemy AI doesn't seem to quite understand trees either, and            sometimes you will catch your foe trying to fire ground-to-air            rockets through foliage, only for the missile to blow up in its            face as it strikes a stray twig. Otherwise the AI does a reasonable            job, although the focus seems to be more on numbers than brains            when it comes to enemy forces. It's not unusual to find yourself            going up against dozens of hostile troops single-handed, which can            be highly satisfying, if not particularly realistic. Ammunition is            often in short supply, but you can always return to base or find a            forward resupply post to restock and repair at. Again, this isn't            particularly realistic (your 'copter is restored to full ammo and            health the second you touch down), but it does make some of the            tougher missions that little bit more manageable.                    Comanche 4 is essentially a first person shooter in the skies, best            played with a mouse and keyboard, and as such it's not likely to            appeal to hardcore flight sim fanatics. For action fans though it            can be highly entertaining, particularly when taken in short doses.            Disappointingly the Novaworld online support still isn't            working, but given the variety and difficulty of the single player            missions on offer there should be enough here to keep you busy for            at least a couple of weeks, and if you run out of things to kill            you can always set up some new scenarios with the mission editor."}
