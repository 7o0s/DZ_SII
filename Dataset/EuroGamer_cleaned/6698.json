{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-hotpursuit2-ps2", "date": "28 Oct 2002", "game_name": "Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2", "text": "The various iterations of Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit totalled            well over a million units for Electronic Arts, so it's little            surprise to see that a great deal of effort has gone into the            highly anticipated sequel. Thanks to a supreme marketing push, (and            being a frankly kick arse game) Burnout 2 is outselling Mario at            the moment, and Black Box Games' Need For Speed title finds itself            in Hot Pursuit. But Burnout 2 has already rewritten the benchmark            for the PlayStation 2's arcade racers - can Hot Pursuit 2 overtake            it?        Graphically, Burnout 2 has            the lead by a mile, although EA's marketing bulk means you'll be            sitting in real cars, from Jaguars and Mercs upwards. Each vehicle            is nicely modelled, with real-time reflections on the body and            glass, although unfortunately all this licensing has left EA unable            to damage the cars. This means that a 140mph collision with a tree            jolts the camera to a stop like whiplash and you can drive straight            off. In Burnout 2 the same situation would likely shatter the car            explosively - a feature greatly missed here.                    Outside the car, there's the requisite nice use of particle effects            as smoke pours out of orifices in the chassis and tyres screech            menacingly as you brake, and the world is reasonably detailed. And            of course, where there's smoke there's fire, and the early woodland            courses give you forest fires to contend with - quite scary as            you're flying down a country lane at over 100. The trackside            scenery and plenty of shortcuts mean that the game doesn't play as            if you're driving through a tunnel - something a number of the            PS2's finest racers are guilty of. Although, hitting an invisible            wall in the air does raise a few eyebrows, particularly as the game            shifts into slow motion, bullet-time camera mode when you fly off a            jump.                    And because this is a 'Hot Pursuit', your journey will continue            across various sunny American peninsulas, inland through major            cities, passing palm trees in the twilight, and forest fires and            ancient ruins in the sun. The various locations are re-used in            different track configurations throughout, so you often have a            sixth sense of what's round the next bend, even if it is in            reverse, mirrored or upside down and back to front. It's an            approach which worked well in games like Project Gotham Racing, and            it works well here.        In the longevity stakes, this Hot Pursuit 2 wears on for a long            time, favourably so even when compared to the hours to be found in            its main competitor. The single player game consists of two major            championships, with plenty of quick-play modes available elsewhere.            Your two, thirty-challenge tasks are the main Hot Pursuit mode and            a World Championship. In Hot Pursuit, you complete under the            watchful eye of the local law enforcement. You race either alone or            with varying levels of competition, in races which last between            five and 15 minutes, and sometimes come in knockout groups or            points-based mini championships. And occasionally you become the            law yourself, chasing down and ticketing speeders.                    Each of these Hot Pursuit races sees you speeding along at insane            speeds (at which it's reassuringly tough to manoeuvre), racking up            police attention via a little star meter. A token patrolman will            follow you at first, gradually picking up more assistance. Before            long, they start laying roadblocks to snag your car, which you can            either bust through (slow-mo bullet-time) or go around. At their            rowdiest though, the cops deploy a chopper, which sweeps along the            road ahead dropping bombs. There's a certain James Bond-ness to the            action in this mode (and unsurprisingly uses the same engine),            which is why it's best to play it second.                    If you ignore our advice and race through Hot Pursuit, lapping up            every last drop of excitement and polishing the thing off in about            five hours, then you'll only have the prospect of time trialling            and racing cops arbitrarily to keep you amused, because the World            Championship aspect is a bit sedate. Without the attention of cops,            races come down to pure driving skill, and because of the difficult            controls (and extraordinary braking distances apparently required),            this task is somewhat arduous. As you snag a bit of scenery and            come to a juddering halt, you can even watch the time in seconds            between you and the cars behind you zip past zero on the helpful            heads-up display.                    What's good about World Championship mode is that, like Hot            Pursuit, virtually every task unlocks a new track or a new car, of            which there are more than 50. In fact, unlocking everything is            going to take a very long time - we only wish we had more            ourselves.        One of the things Hot Pursuit 2 has            managed to top Burnout 2 for is musical choice. Burnout 2 has a            nice selection of tunes, but they lack the edge EA's huge ~Trax~            library can bring to the party, and it's a fair selection of good            old-fashioned American rock tunes which accompany the action here.            Some of them are less than memorable, but many of them are quite            engaging - certainly the sort of thing you want to hear when you're            speeding at twice the limit.                    And Hot Pursuit 2 sticks another one to its competitor with the            two-player mode. Burnout 2 suffered from hideous slowdown - 30fps            instead of the expected 60 - whereas Hot Pursuit 2 is steady.            Sadly, it's not steady enough to be as fast throughout. A 60Hz mode            is infuriatingly absent, which gives Burnout 2 a significant gain,            and the draw distance doesn't really seem adequate by comparison.                    Ironically, Hot Pursuit 2 suffers for its adherence to basic arcade            values; simple control systems, rough handling and fast cars, with            the added benefit of a cop element. However, the goalposts have            moved in the last month, and Hot Pursuit 2's slower graphics            engine, lack of vehicle destruction and tough steering leave it            looking rather posh compared to explosive antics elsewhere. And            even Burnout 2 has cops.                    In the end it comes down to a matter of quality. Although Hot            Pursuit 2 is an excellent racer, well worth buying and stuffed with            many hours of gameplay, Burnout 2 is all that and more, without            having to obey strict license agreements regarding damage.            Malnourished Cube owners will be pleased to discover that their            system has a new king of racers, although Xbox owners will be less            impressed as they fire up Project Gotham again. Hot Pursuit 2's            points system is a facile alternative. On the PS2, only those bored            of Burnout 2 need apply, and in all honesty, there can't be too            many of you.
