Comic book turns movie turns            sequel turns videogame turns hideous cash cow. Blade II was a            reasonable recent successor to the not-bad Wesley Snipes action            flick, but can the fast action, insane martial arts and satisfying            gruesomness be pulled off to proper effect in game form?        Blade II rather predictably takes the form of a mostly            hand-to-hand combat game through several levels, beating away            hordes and hordes of vampires with your leathery fists and            occasionally Blade's collection of shiny and sharp things. There            really isn't much to tell of a story; Blade is a tortured soul kind            of fellow with part human and part vampire blood endowing him with            some incredible strength, and it's his job to take on a kind of            Duke Nukem-style ass-kicking crusade against those who would oppose            him, namely large organised groups of vampire drones in parking            lots and sewers and the like. Honestly, you know the drill.                    In practice, the gameplay is entirely out of the ark, and plays            rather like arcade classics Double Dragon or Final Fight, and if            you've played either of those lately then you'll know why this            isn't necessarily a good thing - walk a bit, punch and kick some            enemies for a few seconds, walk a bit more, repeat. There's some            kind of apparently amazing 360-degree combat engine thing in place            here though, so let me explain how this ~works~...                    You move about with your left analogue stick, while your right            takes on the battling duties, as opposed to the regular button            based configurations we're used to in this type of game. You sidle            up to your enemy, who surround you and proceed prodding you in the            face with fists and bottles or whatever, so you start waving the            right analogue stick to get Blade to start pulling off some crazy            moves, but instead he'll just stand there going ~punch... punch...            punch~. The game then lets you know that you need to move slowly            and rhythmically, all the while you have a crowd of dark-eyed            weirdos jostling around you and hissing in your face. So you slow            things down a bit, and eventually you sort of get the hang of it as            Blade pulls off kicks to enemies behind him, and punches to enemies            in front in tune with where you're pulling the stick.                    You'll also occasionally stumble across combos and slightly amusing            finishing moves - we liked the one where Blade declares his love            for his gun, and removes a vampires head with it just to prove it.            Unfortunately, the way the system is implemented has turned Blade's            martial arts abilities from a brutal dance of death to more of an            awkward waltz of confusion.        Naturally, Blade has guns and steel ware, too - a pistol,            shotgun and a sharp head-removing boomerang called a ~glaive~ make            an appearance along with others once you've unlocked them for use,            but you can't carry them all at once, instead being forced to            select from your collection and filling equipment slots at the            start of each mission.                    Further limiting the player is the requirement for Blade to use his            sword; you have a rage indicator that rises as you dispatch            opponents, and at set levels you get first the ability to use your            sword, then invulnerability for a short time and finally increased            combat power. But why should you have to wait to be able to use            your sword? You should have the option to whip it out            willy-nilly and swing it about with reckless abandon. The limits            imposed on the player merely stifle the amount of creative fun we            should be having with this type of melee combat.                    Visually, Blade II is alright - character models are fairly well            done but animated like they have enormous rods up their backsides,            however the disintegrating death animations are really quite cool.            Environments also leave a great deal to be desired, with a lack of            detail and dull textures that leave little to take in as you're            bopping another band of vamps on the head. On the audio side of            things, the soundtrack is lacklustre and repetitive, and the            attempts of a voice actor to emulate Snipes' trademark drawl are            worryingly bad. Some of the effects aren't too shoddy, and the            weaponry sounds quite meaty but frankly there's little atmosphere            to drag you in.                    Blade II is a missed opportunity. What should have been a good            chance for some Devil May Cry-style combat with fantastic            characters and recognisable environments has instead turned out to            be an extremely dull and awkward jaunt through some dull levels,            and a combat system with complications that only serve to make            things... dull. A decidedly mediocre title in short supply            of redeeming qualities."}
