This time the battlefield centres on the colonial wars in America,            with historical landmarks including Christopher Colombus' crusade            to expand the Spanish empire right through to the War of            Independence - playing as either the Britons or Americans.                    The game has an impressive suite of no less than eight campaigns            that spans forty-two missions, along with nine separate            single-player maps if the pressure of the main campaign is too            much. In addition, twelve tribes and nations are featured, ensuring            all sides of the story are told. That's a whole load of content            ladies and gents, but how does it all hang together? Read on, my            well travelled reader.        The first            few missions of the main campaign mode offer a tutorial in the game            mechanics - and you're going to need it. The range of mission types            is refreshing, and it isn't all about creating a base here and when            strong enough attacking there. For example, certain missions will            simply dump you in with troops all ready to go, and no means to            create any more, whereas others will have you setting out to loot a            village in the complete absence of scruples. There's wonderful            variety in the design, which demands far more than just laying            waste to all and sundry.                    It is warfare on a massive scale though, with the number and            diversity of selectable units being positively bewildering at            times. Creating war games that focus on huge troop movements seems            to be the current trend, and obviously you are going to need an            interface that accommodates. Thankfully, playing the game is a            breeze, with an interface which never over-complicates and keeps            all the important options readily available. Click on any            individual member of your armed forces and you will be given the            relevant statistics for that unit, along with a command list. One            hotkey later and you can select all units of that type and assign            them a singular task, or click and drag the mouse to draw a            rectangle round a collection of troops you wish to reposition.                    Obviously with literally hundreds of units at your disposal (the            game handles up to 16,000) the view can be a little restrictive.            This is where the zoom out function is invaluable, giving you a            much broader view of the sometimes huge battlefield maps. The first            time you switch to this view when in command of a large army, I            defy you not to be totally awestruck. Imagine drag-selecting the            entire crowd at an England football match...        Naturally with something            on this big a scale you're going to need decent AI for it to work,            and this is an area which has seen much attention. Troops you've            sent off into a separate battle don't just go there and slug it out            until they all die, they'll retreat if necessary or hold their            position. Of course you have the overall say in what they do, but a            lot depends on troop moral, another key AI feature. If your troops            are inexperienced, and witness everyone around them falling to the            enemy, they will become dejected. This will have them scarpering in            every direction - in blind panic - and you'll have to scour the            landscape for these stragglers and get them back into line. Or just            shoot them.                    An understanding of realism is key to the composition and success            of AC, with awareness of shot distance and accuracy over distance            being of particular importance. Capture a village, stick some            troops in the buildings to defend and a nice quota of ground            forces, and then let the enemy come to you - a nice tactic, but if            you move your ground forces out too far, they won't enjoy cover            from your building forces, something we learnt to our cost...                    The AI isn't without its quirks though, with one of the more common            problems being that of pathing. You will click for your troops to            go to a certain point, and on the map it looks clear that they can            easily reach this. Happy with that, you switch to your next group,            only to notice on the radar map the others are wandering off            somewhere else! What? On other occasions, they will pass through            too narrow an area with no problem at all. It doesn't happen that            often, but can cause frustrating delays in your overall game plan            when it does. The wild creatures you come across also seem to be            ridiculously strong, often requiring a large group of your troops            to take down, and inflicting several casualties before they die.            Ok, it's a wild creature, but deers don't have sodding armour!        With this much            action going on you'd think that the animation would be minimalist,            but this is most definitely not the case. Pistol bearers can all be            seen reloading in glorious detail, pike-men will move themselves            from attacking stance to march as if they really are lifting a            heavy weapon, and salvos of arrows rain down convincingly. It            really is a sight to behold. All of this runs at an impressive            frame rate with resolutions of up to 1600 x 1200 supported. The            only time you will experience any noticeable pauses in gameplay is            when switching between zoom modes, but with the calculation            involved in doing so, it is quite understandable.                    Presentation all round is wonderful, with neat menus and excellent            spoken historical explanations of all the missions before you enter            them. If only history had been this interesting at school I might            have avoided so much line duty. Landscape graphics are also            fantastic, with some really nice ocean effects, land textures and            battle smoke going on. Accompanying the smoke is appropriate battle            noise, not layered like symphony but lumped into cacophony - like a            proper war. The music is also rather nice, if a little lacking in            variety.                    And once you're done with the single-player game, multi-player is            catered for with a choice of LAN or Internet based warfare. Up to            seven players can take part in Deathmatch mode, where you are            simply dropped into a map to slug it out, or Historical Battle mode            which allows you to re-enact famous battles against yer buddies.            However, in the absence of a retail version I was unable to test            the game over the Internet - needless to say though, with a game            this good for lone players, anything on the multi-player side is a            bonus.                    There isn't a great deal I can fault American Conquest for - it            really is a splendid game. The pathing issues do incur a degree of            frustration, but never enough to drop kick your monitor into next            door's garden. It's also the sort of game that you can pick up now            and again for a quick fix, meaning a healthy shelf life. The amount            of content is perfectly balanced, with enough to keep you occupied            until the inevitable expansion pack arrives. And, no offense to our            American readers, but we get to beat the crap out of those pesky            colonials, and given the state of modern politics that makes a            refreshing change..."}
