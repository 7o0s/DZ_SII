The resulting changes are difficult to            distinguish (we did only get 20 minutes or so with Panzer at JVC,            and all the menus were in Japanese!), but a worrying cloud has            formed above our original synopsis, that arcade and            simulation fans should both be right at home.                         The most striking thing about Panzer Front is its control system.            It takes quite a while to get used to and adds a mountain or two to            the learning curve, but ultimately it's quite rewarding. The system            mimics that of classic (okay maybe not so classic) future-tank            simulation Wild Metal Country from DMA Design. You control each of            the tank's tracks independently of one another, allowing you not            only to handle them together (for forward or backward motion) but            also left and right in a manner more akin to actual tank control.            You've got to admire Enterbrain's courage here.                         We'll have to take their word on the level of authenticity. It            looks well researched, and they've neatly allowed you to control            the tanks of any nation you like, rather than shoving you into the            cockpit of a yank Panzer. One suspects that this probably has            something to do with the fact that it's a Japanese game, but it's a            welcome change from those blindly patriotic simulations of the            past.                    Panzer Front is all about the tanks. Instead of focusing on one            individual war, the game plunges you into any conflict you could            possibly want throughout history. There's no moral bias against any            nation, no Nazi insignia, no Stalin memorabilia, no nothing, just a            lot of tanks, and the ones ringed with red targets are the ones you            shoot at. German, American and Russian forces are available, and            depending on the conflict you may be called upon to take up any of            their positions.                         The 25 stages in Panzer are taken from a number of real-life            conflicts, but many are also from the creative minds at Enterbrain.            Included are 38 unique tanks from World War II right up to the            present day, all authentically modelled on their real-life            counterparts.                         Visually Panzer's tanks all look splendid. Again it's difficult            for us to comment on the authenticity of the things since we aren't            au fait with modern and historic tank designs, but considering the            humble PlayStation is driving the action here things are remarkably            detailed. Scenery crumples under the weight of your metallic beast            and you can even see the little step ladder rungs on the telegraph            poles as they churn beneath your tracks. Every tank on the screen            is detailed to the same level, with negligible pop-up.                    The object of the mission is usually to vanquish opposing tanks,            and who can argue with that? Your little battalion is made up of            several tanks, and you can cycle control of them using the map            feature. You can also set waypoints and the like around the            landscape, be it the snowy flats of Russia or the rubble of            deserted French towns, and occupy the land in numbers. As a new            tank controller though you'll have to have your wits about you and            make sure your tanks are never outnumbered. One of my pet hates            about Panzer Front is how quickly your machine gets smoked when            within the range of another, unless you fire off a volley of decent            strength ordnance immediately. In fact, I'd go so far as to say            that it's dangerously difficult. After all it's a new control            system, and given an absurd difficulty level too, it will require            some serious perseverance before it's enjoyed.                         Luckily, one tank is not very much the same as another, so            certain vehicles are more suited to certain tasks than others. And            you get a decent mix, so completing a mission can simply be a case            of selecting the right tank for the right job. One of my favourite            moments while reviewing Panzer was using one of my smaller tanks to            lure a big rumbling enemy giant into range of my hill-mounted            beast. It's moments like these that will be sorely missed by those            who are frustrated away by the steep learning curve.                    The rest of Panzer Front's make up is fairly standard but well            executed. The music is nonchalant and the sound effects are            suitably booming. As for longevity - I've played every mission in            the game, but I've not managed to complete more than half. The            difficulty level means that you will want to tear your hair out in            the process, but there comes a point beyond which you won't give up            for love nor money and each mission must be replayed until perfect.            The lack of a real structure (you can after all just pick up a            mission and go) may take some of the fun out of the game for people            who like organised single player campaigns, but I found it quite            liberating. The only thing that should (and will) keep Panzer from            reaching PlayStations is the frustration of being annihilated            within seconds of chancing upon an encounter.                         As a gamer I would very much like to see a more refined sequel            from the same crew. Given the game's success in Japan (which led            directly to its translation) I had hoped to see changes in the            meantime, but I'm prepared to tough it out for a sequel if I must!                         At the moment though I'm not too sure who I can recommend Panzer            Front to. If you find yourself irritated by the notion of having to            learn a less-than-obvious control system then you'll want to pass            this up straight away, and if you're not prepared to sink a few            hours into learning the basics you won't take much away from Panzer            either.                         Alas, we don't often suggest rentals on EuroGamer, but if you want            to avoid disappointment, sampling it before you hand over your            crisp banknotes comes highly recommended.                        -        Panzer Front PSX                    PreviewPanzer Front PSX                    Preview"}
