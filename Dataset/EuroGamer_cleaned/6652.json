Having survived the almost ruinous            hardware days intact, the publisher has more recently had to            contend with all but a small fraction of its releases meeting with            public indifference. In particular its commercial fortunes on the            Xbox have so far been dire: Jet Set Radio Future, Gun Valkyrie,            Sega GT, Crazy Taxi 3, Soccer Slam, to name but a few, and not a            single big selling title between them - and its recent fortunes on            other consoles haven't exactly been blockbusting, either.                    It was always going to be tough to get its plethora of development            studios up to speed with the inner workings of multiple console            platforms. The fact that the company is still porting ageing            Dreamcast titles such as Shenmue 2, Phantasy Star Online and Sonic            Adventure this far down the line gives the impression of a company            struggling to come to terms with its reinvention.        But those days are nearly over, if Panzer Dragoon Orta is            anything to go by. Finally the Japanese software giant has a title            that not only pushes the platform it's written for, but has            inspired the kind of excitement that Sega used to be synonymous            with. One of the EG team was moved to utter last week: ~this is the            most important Sega release since Sonic The Hedgehog~. Blimey. We'd            better take a closer look.                    The long awaited follow up to the revered Sega Saturn title tells            the tale of a population on the brink of extinction, its planet            almost destroyed by years of intense battles. A band of rebels            rises up to take control of their destiny, and in true mysterious            gaming story nonsense, a young girl named Orta becomes ~mankind's            only hope~. Yes, really.                    It's the usual paper thin plot, admittedly, but such suspension of            disbelief is a formality once you engage in this intense third            person shooter that follows in a long line of classic Sega blasters            such as Space Harrier, and more recently Rez. It borrows the lock            on control system that worked so well in Rez (and, fundamentally at            least, in the original Panzer Dragoon), and features the relentless            assault of enormous creatures that Space Harrier trademarked all            those years ago - albeit dressed up in some of the finest shiny new            clothes we've ever clapped eyes on.                    Of course, Panzer Dragoon Orta has plenty of innovations all of its            own, and is arguably one of the most strategic shooters we've ever            played. It's not often we're moved to play a tutorial mode, but            this one is almost a necessity, largely thanks to the complexity            involved with dealing with the numerous types of attack. The combat            variation wouldn't necessarily be an insurmountable problem were it            not for the fact that you have so many ways of dealing with your            foe - some being more efficient at dispatching them than others.        On a basic level you            have three different modes of fire available to you at once.            Normal, Heavy and High Spec, and each can be cycled through with            the Y button. Normal is the middle of the road, well balanced            cannon, and holding down the A button will lock onto about eight            targets at once. Releasing the button then unleashes a destructive            blast onto each of the enemies - but it's not the most powerful of            the set. This accolade befalls the Heavy gun, which can only lock            onto three targets at once, but inflicts far more damage - the            smaller number of targets it can take out at once means that when            you're overwhelmed it can be real struggle to avoid being hit.                    However, the High Spec weapon has a much wider target area than any            of them, and although it can't lock on, this high speed cannon can            take out incoming projectiles with ruthless efficiency - useful in            the many situations when clusters of enemies rain down upon you.            Despite its deficiencies, it does give you the useful ability to            activate a Homing Glide offensive, which not only attacks the enemy            forces, but sucks up their hit points, in turn replenishing your            own. Getting to know which gun is appropriate in what situation is            the key to progression, and our initial attempts were littered with            failure as we came to terms with which weapon to use - and when.                    Far from employing the usual third person shooter mechanic of            staying stuck behind the player, Panzer Dragoon Orta utilises a            fantastically well realised 3D system. Enemies can approach on any            side, and often even above or below you, and a radar in the top            right hand corner displays the, as red dots in relation to your            Dragon, which sits in the centre. To cope with this 360 degree            combat, Orta can switch to a side view by pulling the right or left            triggers, sending her clockwise or counter clockwise respectively.            Each tap on the trigger will send her 90 degrees in the given            direction, with the player able to then steer Orta in the precise            direction of her enemies.                    Further control options are available to allow the player to            briefly alter the speed of the Dragoon; tapping X activates a            boost, while hitting B momentarily reduces your speed. In boss            encounters, or particularly aggressive mid level encounters it is            often necessary to use the speed control to dodge out of the way.            Likewise, the choice of fire mode 'morphs' your Dragon and subtley            affects its manoeuvrability. In our experience the High Spec gun            seemed to be the best option, thanks to its ability to take care of            the masses of projectiles that the enemy delights in sending your            way.        Another feature of            your impressive arsenal is the Berserk weapon - once fully charged            you can tap the black button to unleash a brief all encompassing            'smart bomb' blast that gets you out of sticky situations. As you'd            expect in a Japanese shooter, boss encounters come thick and fast,            and are both spectacular and evil. But not always spectacularly            evil. Only sometimes; that will depend on which of the three skill            levels you plump for.                    With such a comprehensive, strategic array of attacks available at            any one time, it's just as well the game backs it up with a            generous serving of eye candy that will sate even the hungriest            graphic whore. The ten stages are all deliciously well rendered,            with backgrounds of the highest calibre, featuring lush detail at            every turn - and as such it's no exaggeration to state that these            are possibly the finest visuals we've ever witnessed, all delivered            at a rock solid frame rate even when the screen is packed with foes            - which, by the way, is regularly.                    Talking of foes, in keeping with the incredibly slick backgrounds,            you're treated to a continual array of delightfully well animated,            finely detailed and well realised creatures to dispatch. It may            only be a shoot 'em up at its core, but the believable, credible            world that Sega has created with Panzer Dragoon Orta allows the            game to skilfully transcend its trivial roots. Supplemented by a            regular assortment of cut scenes, the story of Orta's battle            against the repressive regime and her encounters along the way with            new friends and foes is expertly dealt with, even though for most            of us, the fantasy tale isn't necessarily to our tastes. No            matters. The breaks these cut scenes provide are extremely welcome            after the intensity of a ten minute boss battle.        As with so many other well crafted games, there's a ton to            unlock too. As well as multiple routes hidden within each level,            Panzer Dragoon's 'Pandora's Box' mode contains many a treasure that            real hardcore players will delight in. Each creature and world has            an in-depth explanation stored in the Encyclopaedia, while the            Gallery lets you check out previously encountered foe at close            quarters. Later on you'll even be able to unlock subquests that            allow you to play the game from the Empire's perspective, giving it            a tremendous amount of replay value.                    On the downside, the game is ultimately a very pretty, albeit very            playable shoot 'em up, and therefore becomes repetitive very            quickly. Granted, the scenery changes, the type of monster changes,            but all too soon you realise that you're merely guiding a cursor            around a screen, shooting, dodging, and admiring the view. It's a            very pretty view, let there be no doubt, but the chances are you'll            tire of doing the same thing over and over again. Also, once you've            mastered the controls, it's possible to blitz through entire levels            on your first go - and with only 10 levels to plough through this            is the kind of game you'll have licked in a weekend.                    Panzer Dragoon Orta is a beautiful game - and stands as a landmark            3D shoot 'em up; a refined, well designed and intelligent title and            marks a real progression in the genre. If strategic blasting sounds            like your idea of gaming nirvana then look no further. Sega's back,            and about time too."}
