Instead it has rebuilt the world with cheap            pollution-free energy and advanced nanotechnology with the ability            to build anything from a lamb chop to a mile high skyscraper in a            matter of seconds.                    Of course, this being the action-strategy genre, such a world could            make for a rather boring game. Thankfully for us the deposed            leaders and corporations of the old world order have not gone away,            but instead have been planning their revenge on the do-gooders.            While the new government has spent the last two decades recycling            its swords into ploughshares, the people they replaced have been            developing devestating new weapons of war. As missiles rain down on            the undefended utopian cities, it is up to you to take control of a            salvaged hulk from the last great war, the carrier Antaeus, and            explore a chain of islands which has just appeared in the south            Pacific.                    Although the storyline is rather cheesy and far-fetched at times            (the chances of any imminent outbreak of sanity in this world are            indistinguishably close to zero), it's supported by voice acting            from a veritable who's who of BBC sci-fi series. The narrator is            Tom Baker (formerly Dr Who), while your bosses back at headquarters            are voiced by the actors behind Avon and Soo Lin in cult classic            Blake's 7. Towards the end the developers seem to have run out of            ideas, and a few of the cutscenes are hilariously poor            space-fillers which would have been better left out, but apart from            a few let downs the quality of the cinematics is generally very            high, helping to suck you into the game.                    Hostile Waters is played on two levels. The first is a flat-shaded            3D tactical map which shows the terrain which you have explored and            the location of your units. This is by far the simplest way of            controlling your troops, using a straightforward point and click            interface to tell them where to go or what to attack, with a            waypointing system allowing you to give any unit up to eight orders            to carry out sequentially. There are a host of more advanced            options which become available as the game goes on, but most of            these are only rarely used.                    This screen also gives you access to the construction menu, where            you can decide which types of vehicle to build and what weaponry            and optional extras to equip them with. The Antaeus can construct            units out of thin air with its nanobots, recycling whatever debris            you can find (or create by blowing stuff up) into vehicles. These            are then fitted with a Soulcatcher device containing the memories            and personality of a dead soldier - like the man said, ~war is            hell~. You can choose which personality to put into which vehicle,            but as there is no way to view any stats or information to assess            who is best for which role this tends to be rather hit and miss,            and you generally won't know if you've made the right choice until            the vehicle is built and the pilot starts to complain that ~this is            not my area of expertise~.                    Only a handful of personalities are available, which limits the            size of your army to around ten units, and with individual faces            and voice acting for each of them it does make things far more            personal, and adds a lot of character to what is usually a genre of            faceless cannon fodder. Unfortunately the chatter between the            various soldiers soon starts to grate when you realise that they            each only have a few comments to make but insist on talking to each            other incessantly.                    While you are on the tactical screen the game is paused. This gives            you plenty of time to plan out your actions, but your units will            only start to carry out your orders once you switch back to the            in-game view. Here you can watch the action from the carrier            itself, or from a third person view locked behind any one of your            units. This can be a little clumsy in a crowded area, but generally            works fairly well.                    While you can play the entire game by just sitting back and            admiring the graphics, occasionally switching to the tactical map            to give out orders, you're very much encouraged to jump in and get            your hands dirty. You can take direct control over any of your            units at any point, and as Soulcatcher devices are in short supply            you will find that sometimes it pays to create units without one            and control them yourself. This is particularly true for vehicles            which are only rarely used, like cargo lifters and repair trucks.            The controls are easy to use once you have had a little practice,            and the traditional first person shooter combination of mouse and            keyboard works surprisingly well for everything from helicopters to            hovercraft.                    Sometimes it is necessary to take control of your units whether you            want to or not though, as the pathfinding AI is pitiful. On some of            the more rugged islands your vehicles will often wander off in            completely the wrong direction and frequently end up in the middle            of an enemy base as a result. And because they are still trying to            get to their destination they won't even fight back. Units also            have an aversion to steep slopes, even when you can easily motor up            them under manual control, and have a nasty tendency to get stuck            on bits of debris and lose interest in enemies they don't have a            direct line of sight to. This can lead to annoying situations where            a hovertank sits just below the crest of a hill bobbing up and down            without ever managing to target the helicopter which is hovering on            the other side, or spends several seconds slowly circling around a            shattered wall to get a clean shot at a target while being shot at            by somebody else. This is irritating to say the least, and you know            that something is badly wrong when attacking an enemy base with a            single tank under your own control often proves far more effective            than sending in an entire flotilla of AI-controlled vehicles.                    And sadly these problems extend to the enemy AI as well, which is            remarkably passive for a revenge-obsessed junta of former world            leaders. In a few of the harder missions it seems to have been            scripted to throw everything it has at you, but most of the time it            will just sit back and let you take down its production and            resource areas one at a time without ever responding. Needless to            say this doesn't make for much of a challenge, with boredom proving            to be your main enemy in all too many of the missions.                    There is enough variety in mission objectives to keep things from            getting too repetitive, although it is only in the last half dozen            missions that you get the most interesting units. For much of the            game you are limited to a hover tank, a fast-moving scout buggy and            a helicopter, plus a cargo lifter and a slow tracked vehicle which            can be used for repairing your units or recycling debris, depending            on what equipment you fit it with. Gradually you will build up a            choice of about half a dozen weapons to choose from, as well as            optional extras like cloaking devices and extra armour plating, but            most of the time you will just go for the cheap but devestating            close-range chaingun and as much armour as you can afford to bolt            on.                    The graphics and presentation on the other hand are first rate, as            we have come to expect from Rage. Units are nicely detailed,            explosions are truly spectacular, the in-game cutscenes are only            marred by their terrible music, and the islands themselves are            visually impressive, if rather unsuited to the lacklustre            pathfinding abilities of your ground-based units.                    Hostile Waters is an entertaining enough game, but it could have            been a lot more. The poor AI makes playing it something of a chore            at times, while the impressive graphics come at a high cost, and            you will need a fast PC to get the most out of it. It is also            fairly limited, lacking any of the quick play missions, random            skirmishes or multiplayer options that most games in this genre            sport.                    There are suggestions on the official Hostile Waters website that            some form of multiplayer support may be patched in later, but it's            not entirely clear how this is going to work given that you spend            much of your time staring at the tactical map with the action            paused, something which is clearly not going to work very well            online without some fairly drastic changes.                    In the meantime though the twenty mission single player campaign            should keep you busy for a week or two, and if you have \u00a330            burning a hole in your wallet you could certainly do a lot worse            than this."}
