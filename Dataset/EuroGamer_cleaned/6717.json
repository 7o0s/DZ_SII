With epic battles that can feature            literally thousands of troops on-screen at once, superb multiplayer            support and a variety of historical single player campaigns            following more than a dozen European nations through two centuries            of conflict, it was a truly spectacular affair.                        And judging from the preview code we've been playing for the last            few weeks, American Conquest is bigger and better in almost every            regard.                    Hand-crafted by Cossacks developer GSC Game World and based upon an            updated version of the engine that powered their original real-time            strategy hit, American Conquest is to all intents and purposes            Cossacks 1.5, a stopgap to keep fans of the series occupied until            the arrival of the Napoleonic Wars themed sequel.                       American Conquest is no half-hearted cash-in though, covering some            three centuries of warfare in the New World from the establishment            of the first colonies by Christopher Columbus to the War Of            Independence and beyond. Many of the battles can be fought from            both sides, giving you the chance to desperately fight off the            conquistadors as an Aztec general, or to control the British as            they try to contain those pesky American revolutionaries. Less well            known wars are also included, such as a campaign in which you take            on the role of Tecumseh as he works to establish a native alliance            to halt the westwards expansion of the newly formed United States            of America. The game is a far cry from the all-American ~manifest            destiny~ tubthumper you might have expected - missions can vary            from leading a rabble of Spanish adventurers as they loot their way            through Central America to holding off seemingly endless waves of            native warriors as you wait for reinforcements to arrive.                          Battles are more impressive than ever, with the game allowing a            frankly ludicrous 16,000 units to run around the map at once. The            roar of gunfire and hollering of native warriors charging into a            fight is deafening, and it's hardly surprising that in the early            stages of the game at least the natives are terrified of the din            made by horses and firearms. Morale plays a much bigger role than            in Cossacks, and native troops will often break down and run away            in the midst of a battle when they get panicked. Playing as the            European invaders is still far from easy though - native troops may            have little or no armour but they tend to move faster as a result,            and if you're not careful you can find your heavily laden pikemen            being constantly harried by archers who run off before you can            reach them, slipping away through the jungle as you approach.                    This attention to detail is found throughout the game, and gives            each side in the conflict its own unique flavour. Whereas in            Cossacks most countries were essentially the same, in American            Conquest the troops, technologies, buildings and gameplay vary            drastically from one nation to the next. So while the Incas and            Aztecs are frightened by horses and gunfire, the Sioux fighting on            the great plains a century or two later are quite comfortable using            these weapons themselves. The natives aren't your stereotypical            ~noble savages~ either; some tribes do live in wigwams and hunt            buffalo for food, but others build wooden houses and cultivate            crops.                          The graphics are more detailed and varied as well, and the world of            American Conquest is an endless source of wonder. Maps can stretch            for literally miles in every direction, which makes the new zoom            mode a particularly welcome addition, allowing you to get a wider            view of the battlefield. Streams and rivers flow through dense            jungle towards the sea where waves lap against the shoreline, and            naturally this landscape is dotted with ornate buildings varying            from vast stepped pyramids to the brick houses and stone forts of            the colonists.                          The buildings aren't just there to look pretty or to increase your            population limit either; units can now be stationed inside any of            your buildings, making the cavalry raids that were so common in            Cossacks a little less devastating. If you're quick you can now            bundle any stray peasants into nearby buildings to stop them from            being captured, and once safely inside your men will start firing            out the windows at their attackers. As a result battles over towns            tend to descend into lethal street-to-street fighting as you rush            into buildings to root out their hidden defenders. Casualties can            be horrendously high, and warfare in American Conquest is generally            a frantic, brutal and noisy affair.                    Although there were some missing features in the build we played            (most notably artillery, ships and multiplayer support), American            Conquest is already a lot of fun to play and has proved more            entertaining than any other real-time strategy game I've played            since the original Cossacks. It's shaping up to be another monster            hit for Ukrainian developer GSC Game World, and I for one can't            wait to see the finished product."}
