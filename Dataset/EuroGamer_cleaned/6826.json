Although it            proved to be somewhat short-lived, Parappa The Rapper established            the standard for others to follow when it came to music-based            games. Now Parappa is back, this time on PlayStation 2, but can he            live up to the expectations of fans in a genre that has advanced so            much in his absence?                         The answer is, in a word: no. Parappa 2 is essentially the same            game as its predecessor. The ridiculous storyline is played out in            the same garish ~2D in a 3D world~ graphics, even though the style            is helped greatly by the improved resolution, and the gaming            mechanics are exactly the same. We never expected Parappa 2 to be            some kind of pioneer in deep, cerebral storytelling, but what            they've actually come up with is borderline insanity. To be honest            though, that's where the game's charm stems from...                         Parappa's had his fill of noodles ever since he won a contest to            win a year's supply of the things. Unfortunately, for some reason            all the food in Parappa's town is mysteriously turning into noodles            of its own volition. Of course Parappa and his mates take it upon            themselves to get to the bottom of the mystery, by rapping with a            series of ~teachers~ who can each help Parappa in their own special            way.                    The controls are incredibly simple to grasp, and the gameplay is            Simon Says. The words in a line of rapping are represented by            symbols corresponding to DualShock functions. You simply have to            repeat the sequence of buttons relayed by the other characters in            time to the music. If you happen to slip up a few times, you start            to lose points and you're on the slippery slope to being completely            overrun by noodles.                         The skill level monitor at the bottom of your screen starts out at            Good and can drop to Bad and then Awful, with the music shifting in            style to a slower, sloppier rendition accordingly; any lower, and            you have to retry the stage again. However, getting the meter            higher than Good and up to Cool involves some quick thinking and            cunning button tapping on your part. To be really proficient, you            need to not just rap with but also outclass your opponent, which            involves ad-libbing your words as the stage progresses. This is            achieved by adding flurries of button presses in time with the            beats, adding a superb sense of tactics to what could otherwise            turn out to be a quite predictable affair.                         If you perform especially well in a stage, you're whisked off to a            special bonus section reminiscent of the bonus sections of            International Karate+ on the Amiga [there goes your token Amiga            comment for the year - Ed], where you need to smash blocks held out            randomly by four small onion characters. It's a nice diversion from            the main game, and there should have been more of this kind of            dynamics to break up the main story. It's unfortunate then that            while Parappa 2 is so much fun, it's astoundingly short. Within            three hours of opening the package I'd finished the game's eight            stages on its default settings, and was left wanting a great deal            more. This was a criticism levelled at the original game as well,            and it's criminal that there isn't more here to keep you coming            back. There is the Battle Mode, where you can either play against            the computer or a human player in a game of freestyling mastery,            but the novelty wears off remarkably quickly.                    What little there is of Parappa The Rapper 2 is superbly charming,            funny and downright entertaining. The music had my foot tapping for            the majority of the game (even if the training stage music did            begin to grate) and the cinematics are on a par with your average            Saturday morning cartoon. I could wholeheartedly recommend Parappa            2 to any PS2 owner were it a bit cheaper, but the shocking lack of            replay value really does set it back, and that's a real shame."}
