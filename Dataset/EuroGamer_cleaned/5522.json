{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/pocket-451", "date": "14 Sep 2006", "game_name": "Doom RPG", "text": "Whether it's theclassic PC original, the recent Hollywood movie, or even theslightly alarmist press coverage it's garnered over the years,we're going to assume you've heard of Doom. We're also going toassume that you probably have certain expectations of any game orfilm attached to the title, namely that it'll include exploringmazes and shooting at monsters, that there's plenty of blood andgore and that the experience is scary, yet somehow intenselyentertaining. The good news is that Doom RPG delivers on all theseexpectations; even better news is that it adds a few neat twists ofits own.The basic setup will be instantly familiar to any Doom fan: youplay a marine who's been sent to a research centre on Mars toinvestigate some strange goings on. It rapidly becomes clear thatthese goings on involve the release of hordes of unearthly demonswhich now freely roam the corridors and tunnels of the researchcentre, and that your role is essentially to 'clean up',dispatching the dark denizens with the aid of an increasinglypowerful arsenal of weapons through 10 ever-tougher levels. Thefirst-person viewpoint (you can see the weapon clutched in thehands of your marine) is identical to the original PC version andboth demons and weaponry borrow heavily (albeit with a fewadditions like the brutal axe and the fire extinguisher) so you'llbe able to employ all the old favourites such as super-shotgun,rocket launcher and the BFG to dispatchbull demons, fiery skulls and hell barons.However, whilst the basic plot and goal remain the same, themeans by which you get there are crucially different - after all, this is a role-playing game and notan all-action shooter. Consequently, in place of the non-stopshoot-n-move approach, everything is broken up into turns. Eachmovement, conversation or action (e.g. firing a weapon) essentiallytakes up one turn, so that combat becomes a matter of firing,waiting for the enemy to retaliate and then deciding whether tofire again or simply move out of harm's way. What might soundslightly cumbersome in our explanation actually works faultlesslyin execution and fits incredibly well with the mobile format. Theaction can still progress fluidly if you make decisions quickly(indeed, at times you can forget that it's not all done inreal-time), but the pace of the game is under your control sothere's also the option to take time out, heal yourself with amedikit, check the map and select a different weapon beforerejoining the fray.The role-playing element goes further than combat though, withthe ability to use credits collected throughout the game to boostyour character's vital statistics (such as health and accuracy) aswell as buy additional weaponry. Though it's not essential to yourenjoyment (your levels will increase naturally as you clear levelsand kill demons, and most weaponry can be picked up as you go) itdoes add an extra dimension and a way to measure your progress.The presence of multiple secondary characters and interactivecomputer systems is similarly welcome, providing additional puzzleelements (for example, you need to locate the pass codes for doors)as well as spinning an intriguing X-files-esque sub-story aboutfactions within the establishment and their role in the arrival ofthe demons. Just as importantly, these interactions also add to thewicked humour that underpins the game, with witty asides andclassic character catchphrases.The only casualty of the role-playing approach is the game'stension. Where the PC and Xbox versions have never faltered intheir ability to genuinely terrify, here you'll barely receive morethan a slight scare, as although the demons still look prettyfearsome as they loom into sight in a tight corridor or appear onall sides from an unwittingly sprung trap, the curious lack ofsound coupled with the ability to effectively put them on pauserobs them of their menace.Whilst fans will justifiably mourn this downgrading of the fearfactor and will hope for the restoration of some unearthly audio inthe inevitable follow up, from our point of view this is anincredibly small price to pay for a great mobile version of a trulyexceptional game."}
