I'm not even            sure it was released over here. It was low on action, despite            selling itself as a dogfighting flight sim, and its sales suffered            heavily as a result. Aerowings 2 makes up for this by focusing            almost entirely on dogfighting, filling the skies with enemy jets            and creating a profound and embracing game to wrap it up in. Even            for the lowly newcomer, like me!                         I'll let you in on a little secret - flight sims aren't really my            bag. Never have been. But Aerowings 2, through its softly-gently            training and tutorial modes, has taught me everything I need to            know about throwing a \u00a32 million fighter plane into a barrel            roll and coming out of it on the tail of my nemesis. The game is            quite complex, but it's equally rewarding. There are lots of            techniques to get to grips with, and the training scheme is very            thorough.                         Of course, experienced pilots rejoining the series after the first            encounter may find the early sections rather boring, or at least,            less interesting than sharing a wartime story with some pals in the            mess hall. That said, despite forcing the player to take part in            the training regardless of their experience, it will offer a            good grounding for the controls, and as the game wears on, more and            more challenging and complicated missions unveil themselves, making            up for the lack thereof earlier on. I'm certain that the later            missions will give even the most practised baron of the skies a run            for his money.                    Elsewhere, there is also a separate tactical challenges mode to            overcome, which will have you flying around shooting targets            against the clock. Some of your targets are stationary balloons,            whilst others are anything but, and even return fire. These            challenges are just that though - challenging - and will definitely            prove a little too daunting if you've just put on your flying gear.                         The free flight mode can actually be quite troublesome as well,            but after a few minutes learning the various sticks, the shear            amount of things you can do with it makes it quite cosy. For            instance, you can select any of the main game's set missions and            just fly around getting to grips with the controls and interface,            or, you can add in a few enemy pilots and see how you fare against            them. I must admit, for all the fighting, a relaxing break after a            hard day at work is definitely piloting a multi-million pound            fighter plane 200 feet off the ground in middle-America. Especially            if your enormous surround sound audio/visual set is gently pounding            away in the background. Rattle the neighbours, then complain that            they blocked your runway.                         One slightly disappointing thing about Aerowings 2 is that there            aren't too many planes that you can go for at the start. The reward            structure gradually gives you access to them as the game gets            going, and although I didn't recognize too many of the model            numbers, I'm pretty certain that this will attract flying buffs all            over the place.                    As it goes, dogfighting is the name of the game, and whether you're            in campaign, tactical or free flight mode, you will definitely need            to get the hang of outwitting your enemies before you take to the            skies.                         The main trick is to get on their tail, of course. If you can do            that you can lock on with a missile and run them into the ground.            The thing is, they are just as well taught in the art of getting on            your tail as you are on theirs. The artificial intelligence            must have been given just one instruction - to stick a rocket up            your rear end, and it's effective. Playing against the enemies in            some of the more grisly campaign missions is a diehard affair.                         The two player dogfighting mode is equally superb. Ideally you            want to con one of your Dreamcast owning mates into buying            Aerowings 2 as well and get them proficient in the art of            wingmanship before going head to head.                         If your real life opponent is up to standard, you will have the            time of your life. I honestly believe this is the best multiplayer            experience I've had all year. If you are both inexperienced it can            quickly degenerate into pot luck with whoever gets a lock on            winning, but after a while the gameplay becomes utterly intense,            with both players locked into the battle, gripping the Dreamcast            pads hard - it almost becomes a case of he who flinches first            loses.                    It's not just about the gameplay though, Aerowings 2 looks and            sounds the part as well. Visually it's a tour de force, although            ground detail is rather sparse. Each plane is well defined and            intricately detailed, and the noise of the jet engine is every bit            as g-force-intensive as you might expect. The sound effects are            pretty infallible on the whole, with the exception of the            machineguns, which have nothing of the cutting staccato chatter one            would hope for in a dogfighting game.                         The soundtrack is a bit of a flop too. Everything sounds like it's            been ripped out of Top Gun, and fair enough, Berlin were pretty            big, but the tunes here do nothing to take your breath away in the            21st Century. (You are so utterly fired this time! We shall have            no Berlin puns on this website! -Ed)             Overall Aerowings 2 is a very involving, very exciting game, and            one that matures with your cockpit experience. It's full of things            to do, and little extras that just make it perfect. For instance,            you can actually save playbacks of your dogfights to VMU memory and            analyse them for your weaknesses in battle. Although pilots coming            to the game with experience may find the opening missions a bit            tedious, even they will have to admit that the two player mode is a            gift from God, and every bit as exciting as it should be.                         Congratulations, then, to CRI for managing to fit such an            extraordinarily good flight sim onto the relatively limited            Dreamcast, and to have done so with such an impeccable control            system and multiplayer aspect."}
