But while we survived            perestroika and the collapse of the eastern bloc more or less            intact, Operation Flashpoint offers a ~what if~ scenario in which a            maverick Russian General opposed to Gorbachev's reforms decides to            force the Kremlin to relent by invading a chain of islands off the            coast of Eastern Europe.                    As part of a small American force on the southernmost island of            Malden you are just completing your training as the game begins,            which acts as a neat tutorial to introduce you to some of the basic            commands, controls and weapons. It's not long before you are thrust            into the frontline though, as General Guba and his forces invade            neighbouring Everon. Communication is lost with the island and a            special ops team dropped in to investigate fails to report back,            and so it is up to your unit to find out what is going on over            there.                    Over the course of the game's lengthy single player campaign you            will spend most of your time as a grunt called Armstrong, gradually            rising through the ranks until you have command of your own squad,            able to give orders to your fellow soldiers and select equipment            load-outs before missions. But you will also get to take on the            role of an elite special forces soldier going behind enemy lines to            steal documents and weaken defences, a rookie pilot flying close            air support missions in A-10 tank busters and helicopter gunships,            and a trainee tank commander battling against Soviet armour.                    Yes, Operation Flashpoint is the latest in a string of (mostly            unsuccessful) attempts to marry on foot and in vehicle action, with            an additional dose of squad tactics thrown in for good measure. The            good news is that it's without doubt the best example of the genre            so far. The bad news is that it's not without its flaws.                    The first person action should be instantly familiar to fans of            games like Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but transplanted into            the great outdoors with fields, villages, forests and valleys to            fight over. A wide range of weaponry is on offer, from standard            assault rifles and heavy machineguns to bazookas, stinger missiles,            grenade launchers and my personal favourite, the highly effective            M21 sniper rifle. Combat is reassuringly realistic, which means            that even on the ~cadet~ difficulty setting it will only take a few            shots to drop an enemy soldier. This also means that you have to be            very careful though, as you are equally frail and a couple of stray            shots are enough to send you home to America in a plastic bag.                    Those of you expecting Quake style run and gun action will be            disappointed - moving while shooting is highly inaccurate, and your            best bet is to hit the ground and hide behind the nearest bush as            soon as the fighting begins. The AI does a good job of using cover            and locating threats though, so if you stay in one place for too            long you are inviting a Soviet soldier to take your head off with a            Kalashnikov. Instead you will have to move from one piece of cover            to the next, keeping low and staying alert, making sure to steady            your aim before opening fire. In fact, the only real flaw in the AI            is that it has difficulty handling close combat, with soldiers            sometimes running straight past you without bothering to fire.            Luckily this doesn't happen very often though, and otherwise            Bohemia have done an excellent job of giving their soldiers            believable behaviour.                    Combine this realism with a stringent save game system that only            allows one save per mission plus (in some of the lengthier battles)            an auto-save retry position midway through, and you have an            extremely tense atmosphere. At the end of one particularly tricky            covert operation far behind enemy lines, running low on ammunition            and having used my sole save game some half hour earlier, my heart            was beating so hard I thought it was going to jump out through my            rib cage and run off down the road screaming when I nearly ran into            a Soviet patrol just two hundred meters from my extraction point.            This game is not for those of a nervous disposition...                    While most of the missions involve some degree of pedestrian            activity, you can also hop into any empty vehicle you come across            and drive off in it. In total there are some thirty vehicles            available throughout the game, including jeeps, trucks, armoured            personnel carriers, tanks and helicopters. Many of them also have            multiple crew positions which means that you can, for example, act            as the driver, gunner or commander in a tank, or ride in the back            of a truck while somebody else drives you around the game's massive            islands.                    Controls are mostly very straightforward, and the physics seem to            have been geared more towards fun than realism. The only real            disappointment is the air war, which is complex at the best of            times. The A-10 in particular is hard to control from either the            first or third person viewpoints, especially when you try to select            targets that are flashing past you on the ground below at up to 400            kmph. Thankfully only one mission involves flying the A-10, and as            your character admits to having learnt how to fly fixed wing planes            in night classes you don't have to worry too much about your own            ineptitude - it's all in-character! Helicopters also take some            getting used to, but in the Cobra at least you have a gunner who            can take some of the load off your shoulders, and the more sedate            pace and the ability to stop and hover makes it all much less            frantic.                    Perhaps the biggest problem though is that the graphics engine            which powers Operation Flashpoint simply isn't appropriate for a            flight sim. On the ground you are faced with spectacular rolling            hills, towering mountains, stunning sunsets and vast swathes of            forest, with the slightly blocky infantry models the only fly in            the ointment. But from the air things look far less impressive, and            because you can see much further from up there the engine sometimes            has to resort to heavy handed use of fog and dynamic level of            detail adjustments to keep the frame rates playable. Trees pop in            and out of view alarmingly as you fly over forests, and you can            rarely see more than a couple of miles. As you can easily cover            that distance in under half a minute in an A-10, this only adds to            the confusion of air combat.                    Ground based action is generally far more satisfying, apart from            when you are acting as a tank commander, which gives you            surprisingly little control over your crew. Your driver doesn't            always take the most obvious route when you order him to move            somewhere, ploughing through trees or hedges with glee instead of            following the road, sometimes even colliding with other vehicles.            Give him direct commands (left, right, forward, reverse) and he            interprets them rather loosely though, rarely ending up going in            quite the direction you wanted him to. This often leaves your tank            wriggling around the battlefield chaotically as you struggle to get            him to go where you want him to.                    The gunner, meanwhile, is a total pain in the ass. Often he will            decide to keep the turret pointing in one direction for no obvious            reason, and as you can't look directly behind you this can make it            harder to select targets using the otherwise simple point-and-click            system. Once you have selected a target though, the gunner            will fire as soon as you give the order (assuming that he has a            shell in the gun), even if he hasn't targeted the cannon yet, or if            there's something between him and the target. Like a hill. Or your            commanding officer. Unfortunately this can all make tank battles a            little frustrating at times. It doesn't help that orders are queued            with other messages and then executed strictly one at a time, which            means that it can sometimes be two or three seconds before your            command is carried out in the heat of battle.                    Having said that, only a handful of the single player missions            involve taking on the role of a tank commander, and in multiplayer            you have a real human driver and gunner to scream at when they do            something stupid. As Operation Flashpoint hasn't been released yet            we obviously can't judge the quality of online play, but we have            spent several hours playing the game over a LAN and are happy to            report that the multiplayer mode is incredibly addictive. The game            features both co-operative and teamplay missions, ranging from the            now standard capture the flag and deathmatch modes to            objective-based missions such as seizing enemy villages and            rescuing allied prisoners. At the moment online play consists of a            simple peer-to-peer system using GameSpy Arcade, but in August a            patch will be released adding a Quake-style client-server model,            which should prove far more effective. Either way it's an awful lot            of fun, and although there are only a handful of multiplayer            missions out-of-the-box, with three vast islands to range over and            an easy-to-use mission editor bundled with the game it may just            unseat Counter-Strike as the online shooter of choice come this            autumn.                    Apart from a few annoying glitches and disappointing air combat,            Operation Flashpoint is incredibly enjoyable and atmospheric, from            the vast landscapes and wide range of real-life weaponry and            vehicles available, to the deafening sound of your soldier's heart            pounding as he runs through a forest chased by Soviet infantry.            Missions are varied and well scripted, the plot keeps you hooked            even though the cutscenes and voice acting are distinctly            amateurish, and the single player campaign alone will keep you            occupied for a couple of weeks or more, even before you start            exploring the eleven stand-alone missions and various multiplayer            options.                    Operation Flashpoint is one of the best PC games we've played so            far this year, and our only disappointment is that with a little            more polish it could have been even better. Well worth a look            though."}
