But with            that exclusive period now over, the console's finest game has            finally found its way back to the series' spiritual home on the PC.                        And what a homecoming it is. To all intents and purposes you are in            a living, breathing, brawling, pimping city. Blocks of buildings            stretch out to the horizon, the streets bustle with cars of varied            shapes and sizes, pedestrians wander down the pavements and run            screaming as your car slides past them at speed, trains rush by            overhead on elevated tracks and rival gangs indulge in turf wars,            taking pot shots at each other, and at you, if you've done            something to upset them.                        It's also a very open, non-linear experience. I spent my first            couple of hours with the game completely ignoring the preset            missions and just cruising around in stolen cars, running people            over and getting chased by the police. Once the novelty starts to            wear off there's a dazzling array of jobs for you to carry out for            gang bosses, bent cops and dirty business men, ranging from simple            parcel deliveries and escorting other characters to taking out            police informants and battling SWAT teams and FBI agents on the            streets of Liberty City. However long you play the game for, you'll            never run out of things to do - after the best part of a week            playing non-stop I've still not reached the end of the storyline            and my ~completion~ score is barely at 50%.                    Although this freedom of action may be a little bewildering at            first, the game does ease you into the world of Liberty City a            little at a time. When you begin the game you have only a baseball            bat, a hideout and a mafia contact who might be able to throw some            work your way. You are also restricted to just one of the three            islands that make up the city, as the bridge connecting you to the            neighbouring island of Staunton was destroyed in the opening            cutscene.                        As you progress through the game your options multiply rapidly            though. Most of the time you will have two or three different            bosses that you can carry out missions for to push the storyline            forwards, which means that if you get stuck on one mission you can            ease your frustration by trying something different while you come            up with a new plan. This is lucky, because some of the missions are            incredibly difficult, and the most obvious approach is not always            the best one. One mission, involving taking out a police van            transferring a witness, was proving utterly impossible until I            finally gave up on it and went off to work for another gang boss.            This soon opened up a new weapons shop, giving me access to a            bazooka for the first time, at which point completing the police            van mission suddenly became a doddle.                        The arsenal at your disposal by the time you've unlocked all three            islands is certainly an impressive one. From your humble baseball            bat you soon progress to a handgun, before moving up to uzis,            shotguns and assault rifles. As well as being useful for taking out            cops and gang members, you can also threaten passing pedestrians by            targeting them with one of your guns, encouraging them to drop all            their money and run. If you're in need of something a little            heavier, grenades, rocket launchers, molotov cocktails and            flamethrowers are eventually available, while a sniper rifle can            prove useful for picking off targets from a safer distance.                    Completing core storyline missions and holding people up at            gunpoint in the street aren't the only ways to make a quick buck in            Liberty City. Steal a cab, for example, and you can indulge in some            Crazy Taxi style action, racing around the streets picking up            punters and dropping them off at their destinations. Similar            mini-games can be unlocked by stealing police cars, fire engines            and ambulances.                        The game also includes a selection of optional side missions, which            aren't necessary to finish the game but will add to your completion            score tally and can earn you extra money and equipment. Most of            these are picked up by stopping at ringing telephones, and work in            much the same way as the game's main missions. Others are more            freeform and can be dipped into whenever you're not busy with            something else, such as a Gone In 60 Seconds inspired mission that            has you stealing a list of cars and delivering them to a warehouse            near the harbour.                        Then there are the more esoteric distractions, such as the bonus            points you can earn by pulling off insane stunts, flying off a            bridge or hitting a ramp at speed and cartwheeling through the air.            The more impressive your jump and the better your landing, the more            money you earn. There are hidden packages to recover, unique jumps            to pull off, and bizarre little bonus games to find like an assault            course for off-road vehicles. All of these accomplishments are            recorded in a lengthy list of statistics that reels past you when            you select the appropriate option from the game menu, and even once            you've reached the end of the storyline, the chances are that            you'll still have a whole host of things to see and do before you            get anywhere near 100% complete.                    All of which will no doubt be familiar to PlayStation 2 owners. And            that's the only problem - GTA3 on the PC doesn't really add            anything to the game except high system requirements, low            framerates and hardware conflicts.                        Yes, you can create new skins for your anti-hero and import your            own MP3 files to supplement the hilarious in-car radio stations,            but that's about as far as Rockstar have gone in exploiting the            PC's capabilities. There's no multiplayer, no mod tools, and the            developers haven't even managed to fix the rare graphical glitches            that afflicted the original PS2 version. If anything they've got            worse. Bits of road or even entire buildings can vanish from view,            and driving across the Callaghan bridge with nothing beneath your            tires but the river far below is a disconcerting experience to say            the least.                        The translation to the PC has been a rather quick and dirty one by            the looks of things, and performance is uneven. Whatever it says on            the back of the box, if you have a graphics card with less than            64Mb of memory you're likely to run into problems. Framerates vary            from low to near stationary on a GeForce 2 GTS, producing an ersatz            bullet time effect in the midst of a major shoot-out or car chase            as the game grinds to a halt. Some people have also experienced            lock-ups, which seem to be caused by the game choking the AGP bus            in an attempt to shift data back and forth between graphics card            and system memory.                    If you're thinking about buying GTA3, you have to ask yourself two            questions - do I already own the PS2 version, and is my PC much            more than a year old. If the answer to either of these questions is            yes, you can probably forget about it. If you have yet to witness            the splendours of GTA3 though and have the hardware to handle it,            you're in for a real treat. GTA3 looks great, sounds great and            plays great, will keep you busy for months, and has the kind of            production values most PC games can only dream of."}
