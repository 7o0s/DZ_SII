Developer SSI                 have taken the brave step in shifting the games mechanics to a                 more mainstream real time strategy style for this latest                 incarnation though, presumably gambling the wrath of the die                 hard fans against a potentially larger audience.                    Warlords Battlecry still keeps to the traditional fantasy theme of            its predecessors, and the tools of war here are swords and spells            rather than modern day guns and tanks. The battles are represented            in the usual top down view, and the current trend for displaying            the conflicts in three dimensions has been ignored in favour of an            almost retro style of two dimensional backgrounds overlaid with            sprites.                    Despite this choice the game's visuals are accomplished,            represented at an impressive 1024x768 resolution, and the units are            very well drawn and (most importantly for the strategy genre)            easily distinguishable. There is some great animation for the units            too, especially in some of the larger and more exotic characters            such as the mounted cavalry units or massive dragons. The            pyrotechnics that accompany the spellcasters' attacks are also            impressive, and really liven up the screen during a heated battle.                    Unfortunately the intricate animations aren't extended to the            structures which you create, and these can make the backdrops look            flat and static compared to the lively characters that inhabit            them.         The order of play will be                 instantly familiar to anyone who has played a real time                 strategy game which includes resource building, such as the                 Warcraft series. To create fighting units such as soldiers or                 cavalry you must build barracks, and each unit or structure                 requires a combination of the four resource types - in this                 case gold, metal, crystal and stone.                    You obtain these resources from mines scattered around the level.            Simply take ownership of one and it will start producing for you            automatically, but if you assign men to work on the structure it            will produce the resource even faster. Balancing production of four            different resource types can be tricky, but the game cleverly            provides a market structure which allows the trading of materials,            helping you to manage your stocks more efficiently. The actual            distribution of resources is handled automatically, which is a            welcome relief in an already hectic game.                    But with nine playable races, and many different unit types            available for each of these races, there is a lot of variety to the            combat strategies as you learn the nuances of each different race,            especially considering that the weather and even the time of day            can be an advantage for some races or a penalty for others.            Psychological effects can also greatly influence combat, with            certain units inducing different effects on their enemies. Meeting            a large dragon, for example, can inflict the terror effect on your            men and cause them to flee.         Where Battlecry really differs                 from the norm though is that the most important unit in the                 game is your hero. He is the primary unit, who can build                 structures and gives a bonus in combat to all other units                 inside his influence range. While he does offer this combat                 bonus, he is such an essential unit that it is often better to                 leave him protected behind your lines during a skirmish, as                 his death often means the end of the mission.                    The hero character has also got the cunning ability to take control            over enemy structures that fall within his command radius. This            ability, called convert, is an extremely powerful feature, and if            used with some thought can completely sway a battle in your favour.            A valid tactic is to storm an enemy installation with your troops,            then have the hero follow on behind to convert the buildings to            your control while your men keep the enemy busy.                    Heroes also bring some role playing elements to the game. After you            have completed a certain number of missions you will get the chance            to chose a career path for your hero, be it warrior, wizard, rogue            or priest. This choice will influence the characters primary            statistics from that point on - a warrior will increase in            strength, for example, while a wizard will increase intelligence.            Later on, after gaining yet more experience, you must chose an            ability to specialise in which will again increase the appropriate            statistics.                    You can also keep some of your other units with you as you progress            through the game. These honoured units are added to your retinue,            and provided you keep them alive they will develop and grow as you            progress though the game. Another role playing element is the            introduction of Quests to some levels. These small missions reward            your characters with bonus items or abilities in return for            completing a small task, adding some welcome variety to the            resource building and fighting.         While most of the game is                 mouse driven, a number of useful shortcuts have been added for                 assistance during the frantic play. Commands can be queued by                 holding down the shift key, and orders can be temporarily                 ignored with some new urgent orders by holding the alt key.                    Your favourite spells can be assigned to shortcut keys making them            far more accessible in the heat of battle. Your units response upon            encountering the enemy can be pre-set with a choice of a cowardly,            guardian, defensive, aggressive or rampant reaction. These behavior            settings allow you to leave the squad alone and busy yourself with            other matters.                    Unfortunately there are a few problems with the game that can            occasionally spoil a mission. The intelligence of the computer            controlled units can be frustratingly dim at times, and while the            range of races and abilities and the interesting convert ability            really does lend itself to sneaky tactics, the computer players            rarely take advantage of this, instead just relying on repeated            brute force attacks with large numbers. When the computer            controlled hero does try to infiltrate your camp and convert your            structures, he tends to do it alone, making eliminating him and so            crippling the enemy forces relatively easy.                    Another problem stems from the large maps, as finding and            eliminating all of the enemies can take quite some time, especially            if the remaining unit is a building class.         Despite these few flaws, Warlords Battlecry is a                 well constructed real-time strategy game. The sheer range of                 race and unit combinations combined with progressive hero                 character building makes the game highly compelling and                 varied. Multiplayer also works well, and has been given                 variety with a number of different mission types such as                 capture the flag or team based games.                    Fans of earlier Warlords games might not take to this real time            incarnation, and players tired of this genre won't find an awful            lot new here. But if you have battled your way through Warcraft II            and still lust for more real time swords and sorcery, then Warlords            Battlecry will provide you with hours of quality entertainment. It            may also be your last chance to play this kind of game in two            dimensions..."}
