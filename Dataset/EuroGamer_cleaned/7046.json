The average disc costs me anywhere from $15-30, but with            import duty and other Customs taxes on top it costs a few pounds            more than it would buying locally.                         Still, it is unlawful, and like all good things unlawful it has            now inspired an original and startlingly playable computer game, in            this case ~Smuggler's Run~, the debut PlayStation 2 game from            publisher Take 2. Angel Studios are the creative geniuses            responsible, and yes, they are the same group who did Midtown            Madness. But unlike their other PS2 game ~Midnight Club~,            Smuggler's Run shares little in common with their classic PC title,            preferring instead to take a simple objective and shape some            entertaining adversity to put in the way of it. Rather like ~Grand            Theft Auto~, in fact.                         The basic premise is that you (and potentially your friend, thanks            to the multiplayer) are a smuggler, a rather dastardly one at that,            and your mission is to locate and redistribute contraband, avoiding            wherever possible the reprisals of the local constabulary. When you            get a new objective you are usually just tootling around in a buggy            on country roads, but as soon as you get word of the contraband's            location you know where to head, and this frequently involves            diving offroad. But it's once you have picked up the delivery that            the race really begins - you swipe the goods and almost immediately            the police are onto you, and after a while the CIA, National Guard            and just about everybody else will join them.                    The skill it takes to evade some of the cops on your tail is rather            akin to that which Doom fans will remember was required on the            Ultra Violence and Nightmare settings of that game at times. The            cops initially will set up roadblocks and the like on the highways,            where passage is a lot quicker. Soon they will wise up to your            offroad capabilities though and head into the countryside on your            tail. They batter and bruise the back of your vehicle trying to            keep up, and in true ~Driver~ style it's possible to engineer some            hilarious pile-ups by moving swiftly and in the right circles.                         Your destination (and the final destination of the contraband) is            found located somewhere murky on the other side of the map, which            is made up or either Forest, Desert or Snowy terrain. The 3D engine            has been crafted sublimely, allowing you to travel literally as far            as the eye can see in any direction, and while the draw distance is            phenomenal, the frame rate barely suffers a jot. Players are            expected to cover an awful lot of ground, heading through rivers,            border patrols, and even small towns at about 100mph, whilst trying            to stay upright.                         Of course, this is a bit of a difficulty in itself, because as in            real life the bouncy suspension of your buggy when connected to            high speeds and bumpy offroad locations means you spend a lot of            time on a random combination of wheels twisting and turning in ways            which they frankly shouldn't. The controls make all of this            incredibly intuitive though, with simple analog or D-Pad steering            and acceleration, and alongside regular brakes a sort of handbrake            that allows for sharp turns, which adds a much-needed edge to the            non-stop action. While you can flip your car and all sorts of other            things, it's still possible to right yourself easily using a            combination of these controls. And in a tight situation, it's            important to get moving again as quickly as possible.                    The structure of the game is simple; you have three key modes of            play, the Smuggler's Run itself (a campaign of missions where you            play against the computer), Turf Wars, which itself contains three            types of smuggling-based racing modes for one or two players, and            Joyriding, which allows you to race around the three terrains doing            pretty much whatever you like.                         Smuggler's Run, the campaign, takes in the region of seven to ten            hours to finish for the average gamer, and gives you several            objectives per map, with variations on the theme of retrieving a            package and delivering it - doing it against the clock, playing a            sort of Capture the Flag against a team of enemies (basically it's            the same as normal, except with rival smugglers vying for your            jobs), and also off-road races and fairly normal time-based races.            Distinguishing between the various types isn't terribly important            in the thick of things, but the slightly different objectives add            to the fun and help sustain interest.                         Turf Wars, on the other hand, includes several different types of            game, and this is where the multiplayer stuff comes in. You can            either play against a friend, or with one; both options provide            countless hours of fun. There are several vehicles running and            incredibly large maps to race around on. The Capture the Flag style            mode in this section is probably the most entertaining though, and            along with a few friends I have spent the last couple of nights            bashing through it.                    The buggy is the most popular vehicle, but it isn't alone by any            means. You can also take on the guise of a little SUV, which has            improved strength but less acceleration, a Trophy Truck, which has            more acceleration than the SUV but less power, a Rally Car, which            is incredibly nippy, a Massive Truck, and even a Hummer, or            ~Military vehicle~! The Hummer is certainly my preferred method of            transport\u2026                         Sadly, although the vehicle models and skinning is quite            impressive, visually the game is only adequate. The lack of VRAM in            the system doesn't help with such enormous environments, and the            repetition of textures becomes quite startling at times. In its            favour, cars have nice damage skins (you will never have known so            much rubbish could be ejected from one single car) and the animals            and other organic areas of the game can all be propelled into the            air when hit correctly. This isn't Carmageddon, but it's nice to            see Angel Studios not fleeing to the other extreme as they have            done in the two Midtown Madness games, and this time actually            letting you hit some damned people.                         The soundtrack is a bit peculiar at times, using techno and            electronica as opposed to heavy guitar riffs and rock music as I            had expected it to. Misplaced, I felt. Slap on something silly and            pacey by Bon Jovi and it will fill the gap just fine. [You're            fired -Music Editor]. Hey! It was just an example!            Incidentally, while the sound effects are quite fitting, the voice            acting is dire, so opting for your own tunes and muting the volume            on the TV is probably the way it will go.                    Smuggler's Run is a pretty impressive outing for Angel Studios, and            a darned playable game for as long as it lasts. Sadly I doubt you            will still be playing it in a week or two, which is a shame if not            unusual for launch titles. Still, by the time you are done with            this Midnight Club should be upon us, and that looks different            enough to prove a worthy successor."}
