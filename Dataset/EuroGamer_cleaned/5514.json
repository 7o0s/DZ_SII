Think ofthe others that come to mind before it: tennis, cricket, Formula 1,athletics - even football some years, thanks to the WorldCup. Perhaps it's a result of Britain's changeable weather and thefact that motorists are more likely to use cyclists for targetpractice than embrace them for their green credentials.Whatever the reason, the Tour de France has slipped out of ournational consciousness, consigned to backwater TV channels and anoccasional passing interest among the media when Lance Armstrong'sname is mentioned.In-Fusio hasn't given up on it, though, and if its latestedition of the official mobile phone game is anything to go by, weshould give it another chance too. Because rather than pedallinganother tired racing game, Tour de France Mobile 2006 captures all the tactics andstrategy involved in the world's most famous cycle race.Encompassing each of the 21 stages that take place throughoutFrance, as well as the guest stages in Belgium and the Netherlands,Tour de France Mobile 2006 is a title with epic scope for amobile game.If you embark on the Tour mode that's featured in the game andtackle every stage, the challenge will take you a good couple ofhours. But it's not as arduous as it sounds and, in fact, you'll bedriven to push hard and make the most of each and every stage.Starting in the middle of the pack, you control your rider'sspeed by pressing left and right on your handset's controls, movingfrom side to side on the road by pressing up and down.Then off you go, over a scaled-down version of the actual stagein question, gradient changes and all. But it's not simply a caseof pressing the controls to keep going faster and faster, as youhave to consider your stamina and morale. Accelerate away from thepack too soon and you'll tire yourself out, get overtaken later on,and not be able to keep up with the pace. Go too slow, on the otherhand, and the leading riders will get so far ahead of you that youwon't be able to catch up.It's a tricky balance to strike, though one that's helped byyour team-mates. Cycling is a team sport, with each team of ridershaving a captain (usually the chap most likely to win). Pick upthree team power-ups while out on the road and you can call yourteam to you, providing you with a temporary slipstream that'll giveyou a boost of speed.That's not the only bit of good news, either: other power-upswill endow you with speed boosts (though less impressive than thatconferred by your team) as well as first aid kits that'll restoreyour stamina.Picking these up can be tricky when you're pedalling flat-out,so little alerts pop up on the right of the screen to let you knowwhen a power-up's on the horizon. Helpfully there are warnings ofupcoming danger, too, such as cones, fences and potholes, whichwill break a wheel on your bike if you ride into one at fullspeed.Any kind of delay like that will hurt your stage time -and it's the cumulative total that determines the leaderboard.However, you'll soon realise that you don't need to win every stagein order to lead the board and don the yellow jersey. It's thistactical aspect that makes Tour de France Mobile 2006 so involving to play.Add to that the quest for the green sprint jersey and the polkadot jersey of the King of the Mountains and you've got a fabulouslyengrossing title that's got a great deal of crossover appeal. Evenif you left racing on your bike behind in your childhood, you'llfind much to enjoy.True, you will have to overlook the bland visuals and lack ofany sound effects. But the amount of pride you'll feel when you setoff wearing one of the three special leader's jerseys is immenseand quite rare in pocket gaming. All of which lifts Tour de France Mobile 2006 above the minority appeal of theevent itself."}
