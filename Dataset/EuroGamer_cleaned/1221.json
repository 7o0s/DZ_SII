Pikmin is a sterling example of exactly how far the man's            imagination can stretch, and his ability to design endearing,            playable and thoroughly bizarre titles is resplendent throughout.            It's obvious that he has a creative 'Midas touch', and Pikmin is            full of intriguing ideas and wonderful characters through his            influence, but is it actually any good to play?                         You assume the role of Captain Olimar - a tubby little fellow with            a big nose in a space suit complete with a shining wobbly antenna.            Olimar's rocket ship, the Dolphin, has crash-landed on a mysterious            planet, scattering parts of it in and around the crash site. Of            course, Olimar can't take off and continue his journey home with            his ship in the untidy state that it is, and so he sets off in            search of the parts in order to repair it. Unfortunately he needs            to recover the 30 parts of the ship in only 30 days before his life            support system fails, and stops filtering out the poisonous gases            in the planet's atmosphere.                         And that's where you come in. At first, control of Olimar feels a            little strange as you get used to the perspective controls, but the            trigger buttons take care of this with three angles of zooming and            an orientation correction function. As you start your search around            the immediate area, you stumble across a huge red object which            promptly springs from the ground at your presence, extending            enormous spindly legs which elevate it above the surface. Olimar            decides that he's going to dub this an ~onion~. Then, a tiny            sparkle fires from the top of the onion, which gradually floats            down and embeds itself in the ground.                    While all of this is going on, Olimar relays exactly what he's            seeing via a kind of tutorial system, teaching you controls and            giving you (or rather, himself) suggestions as to what you might            do. Eventually a small leaf pops up from where the sparkling seed            landed and Olimar feels compelled to yank it out of the ground.            This is the Pikmin's entrance into the game, as a weird red            creature with a leaf poking out of its head flies out of the earth            with a ~Woohoo!~ The tiny creature responds to your every whim,            following you around like a lost puppy and returning to your side            when you use the A button to toss it into the distance.                         Dotted about the landscape are several large flowers containing            huge pellets, and your new friend takes a particular interest in            these as he begins to batter them with the leaf on his head.            Eventually the flowers disintegrate and the large pellets drop to            the floor. Tossing the Pikmin towards the pellets prompts him to            hoist them above his head and carry them back to the onion. These            are then absorbed into the vessel and more sprouts spring from the            top, and of course more sprouts means more Pikmin.                         Eventually you end up with a small but massively humorous army of            the little blighters following you about, knocking down flowers and            indulging in mass pellet-procreation. It's easy to get distracted            at first by the novelty of just wandering around and commanding            your Pikmin, which are a hoot to watch; some of them will stumble            and trip over as they run after you Maggie Simpson-style, and the            tooting noise they make as you usher them towards a target with the            C-stick is adorable and chuckle-worthy. In fact, the whole            experience starts out overwhelmingly charming, and you would be            hard-pressed not to fall in love with the characteristics of the            Pikmin as they go about their business.                    While you could spend all day playing with your Pikmin, there's the            ever-present task of finding your ship parts and getting off the            planet. Further exploration of the beautifully textured and            detailed landscapes reveals more skills in the Pikmin's armoury, as            they set about knocking down huge walls to clear your path, and            leaping upon dangerous wildlife to beat them to death with their            leaves, emitting a curious, but eminently amusing ~Hiiiya! Ya! Ya!~            noise as they set upon their foe.                         As you traverse the environment and discover unbreakable walls,            pools of water that your Pikmin drown in and strange glowing rocks            that appear to serve no discernible purpose, you soon start to            realise that something is missing. Thankfully, as you find your            ship's engine and the Pikmin lug it back to your ship for you,            you're able to take off a short distance above the planet and find            other sites to land in search of parts. As you feel your way around            the new level with your Pikmin, you eventually come across another            onion, this one being yellow.             The new yellow onion sprouts, you guessed it, yellow Pikmin. The            significance of this is that these Pikmin have different skills to            their red-tinted counterparts; they are lighter and can be thrown            further, and they can pick up those glowing rocks and use them as            bombs for destroying otherwise unbreakable walls. Having a new rank            to your Pikmin army opens up the possibility to travel back and            forth between levels unlocking new areas that were previously            inaccessible. These abilities are further increased with the            addition of blue Pikmin, which are able to swim.                    What starts out as a charming adventure begins to morph into a kind            of real-time strategy game as you set about commanding your army of            Pikmin to perform various tasks all about the level, and this is by            no means easy. Keeping track of all your Pikmin is especially            important, as they must be in their respective onions by sundown,            and this imposes an enormous stress on the player as they run about            the level attacking creatures, locating ship parts and finding            extra pellets. And this is perhaps Pikmin's major short-coming -            the majority of players do not want to be rushed through a game,            and the imposing of the 30-day time limit annoyingly restricts the            game to about ten to twelve hours of gameplay, regardless of            whether you manage to completely rebuild your ship or not.                         It could be argued that imposing the time limit is necessary to            disguise the fact that underneath all the charm and stress is a            fairly rudimentary Lemmings-style affair which, without the            constant threat of time on your back, would turn into a repetitive            and massively dull title. As it is, the game starts to become            slightly boring by the half-way point anyway, and only the promise            of more intriguing and beautiful levels to explore and bizarre            creatures and bosses to defeat causes you to press on.                         Pikmin is an outstandingly pretty game, and it's the details that            really make it stand out. The animation is top-notch, the textures            are rich and the level design is outstanding. The sound effects are            perfect and the music complements the various scenes admirably.            It's a shame, then, that all this detail has to be ignored in order            to pelt through the game, keeping your Pikmin in check. Beyond the            main game, there's little to make you come back aside from the            Challenge mode, in which you have to grow as many Pikmin as            possible. This gives you a good chance to revisit and further            explore some of the levels, and battle some more of the better            designed creatures.                    So, is Pikmin any good to play? Undoubtedly yes, but you can't help            but want more once you've rushed through it all. I wanted to take            it all in at my own pace without sacrificing the life of little            Olimar. I wanted to soak up the gorgeous, rich environments, the            subtle lighting and shadows as the sun slowly passes through the            sky. And I also wanted to toy with my Pikmin as well as getting            them to build bridges and knock down walls, but I suppose I'll just            have to go back and do it all again. Am I looking forward to that?            Well, do Lemmings like cliffs?"}
