Even with today's swanky new arcade games, with their technical            wizardry and complex gameplay, I will still seek out the good old            joystick bashing of ~Track and Field~. It has always been such            simplistic fun, and curiously addictive, and it usually only costs            10p too!                    Athletics games on the PC have been few and far between though, but            with the Sydney 2000 Olympics almost here, the inevitable influx of            titles is upon us. Midas' Millennium Games is endorsed by none            other than Ukranian born Sergei Bubka, World and Olympic record            holder in the Pole Vault. With modern 3D graphics technology to            further back the game up, my expectations were high as I dusted off            my running shoes, and headed for the track...         Things begin nicely            with a dramatic introductory video sequence, followed by an in-game            graphics camera sweep through one of the stadiums, giving you a            glimpse of things to come.                    The game can be played in two or three different ways, the Team            Arcade mode being the one that you will more than likely get stuck            into. In here you take control of an entire team of athletes            spanning across nineteen events and a variety of nations.                    Progression through this mode is a little frustrating, as in every            event you have to qualify to compete against the other countries.            Oddly enough though, each of the qualifying events is played out on            your own, without any computer opponents. This makes for a bit of a            shock when you come up against some of the tougher athletes, and            consequently you can be beaten easily.                    There seems to be a very strange skill gap between some of the            track events as well, where you will find yourself strolling to an            easy victory in the 110m hurdles only to be left standing in 400m            relay. I suppose that is real life, but it makes for some pretty            impossible targets to beat at times. I would have liked for the            game to have flowed a little more evenly, with all the events            played out in competitive succession. Having to qualify for the            events, in particular the longer races like the 5000m and above, is            rather laborious.                    Thankfully there is an option to play all of the events in any            order, but this really only serves as a practice mode. For the real            enthusiasts there is also the Decathletic simulation - basically a            management simulation for athletics, allowing you to make            managerial decisions, customise training schedules and so on.         Those of you fearing for            the life of your keyboards need not fret - Midas have incorporated            a clever mouse control system, as well as the traditional battering            of the keyboard method.                    In mouse mode you have a circle beneath your athlete with an arrow            with a red and green band around the circle perimeter. When the            green band passes the arrow, pressing the action key will cause            your power to increase, and red to decrease. I found that the mouse            system, whilst being very easy to operate, made it extremely            difficult to attain enough power to challenge for the gold medals            though, let alone any of the world records. In the end I dropped it            in favour of the keys - I knew I would find a use for my old IBM            keyboard one day!                    Every event involves a frantic toggling of the left and right keys            to keep the athlete's momentum going. The only events that lessen            this wrist aching exercise are the 1500m and above. Obviously            bashing your keyboard for a 1500m race would be ludicrous, so these            events use a far more leisurely endurance versus exertion method.                    Competition events such as the 4x 100m relay are still all done            with the key bashing method, and when coupled with the qualifying            session this becomes a quite literally tiring experience. Both the            jumping and throwing events can sometimes be extremely fussy in            their execution too.         Graphically the            game impresses, with the stadiums looking splendid in their colour            and realism. There are brilliant touches like the big jumbotron            screens showing a smaller image of what you are seeing in the main            screen, creating a cool TV coverage type of feel. Another nice            touch are the little time monitors dotted around the track,            displaying the current event and your time as you sprint on past.                    The athletes look and act superbly, with the attention to detail            quite brilliant in places. For example, limbering up for the high            jump is amazingly captured, and the track racers preparations for            an event are also accurately depicted. Strange then that the worst            animation is in the running itself, never quite convincing you of            speed, and looking like someone's holding a naked flame under their            bums!                    Sound is adequate, never really impressing, but not so bad as to            cause irritation. Spot effects range from the rhythmic claps of the            crowd as you prepare for a high, long or triple jump, to the grunts            of exertion in the throwing events, but all of the athletes make            the same noises as each other, with just one set each for male and            female participants. A bit more effort channelled into the sound            department wouldn't have gone amiss.         Millennium            Games is certainly good entertainment, with great graphics and            enough variety to keep you coming back for more. The controls can            be extremely unfair, making it nigh on impossible to catch up with            the computer players at times, and the fussy nature of the throwing            and jumping events will infuriate.                    The inclusion of a two-player split-screen mode is a huge bonus            though, and plays surprisingly well. LAN play is also supported for            up to eight players, only make sure you warn the neighbours in            advance! I would have liked to have seen a few more events thrown            in, but I guess that is just the Hypersports addict in me.                    Not bad at all - go decimate your keyboard now!"}
