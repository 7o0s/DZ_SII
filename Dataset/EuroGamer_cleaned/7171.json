In theory. On the whole you                 just run around doing the job for yourself, because the men                 can't be easily controlled.                    You are supposed to be able to order them to attack a target,            defend a location, patrol etc, but the AI smacks of 1990's real            time strategy - this sort of rampant incompetence hasn't been            encountered since the likes of Command & Conquer were gracing            store shelves. Ironically, your troops' stupidity is quite useful            at times, as they eagerly draw enemy fire while you deal with the            tasks at hand.                    You ~control~ the action via the keyboard for the most part. You            can use a joystick or gamepad, but I wouldn't recommend it.            With the keys, controlling the type of weapon Sarge is equipped            with and how he's using it is pretty simple. You can order Sarge to            kneel or lie on the ground, positions plastic army men could be            expected to assume. This impacts the level at which he fires and            the ease with which he can target enemies.                    In real-time strategy titles, the keyboard is used sparingly and            the mouse is unobtrusive and generally the only way to go. In Army            Men, the mouse control is sluggish leaving the keyboard as your            best choice.                    Visually the game is a bit plain as well. But then, this is a            budget re-release. The graphics do serve their purpose, and            reminded me of plastic toy soldier-style games from my childhood.            The character animations look realistic enough (for toy soldiers!),            and the movements of the Sarge in particular are impressive.                    Sound effects are slightly unusual for a game based on little            plastic men, and I had hoped for something along the lines of            children screeching and kapow'ing along to the action. For that            matter I had hoped to be racing around carpets and ducking between            match boxes, but you can't have everything...         While Sarge can't carry infinite weaponry and ammunition, he            does have the ability to carry his rifle and a couple of other            weapons. There are flamethrowers, grenades and bazookas in the            heavy weapons category, and explosives, trip-mines and mine            detectors to back them up.                    Thanks to this pretty wide selection of tipples, it's often            important to make very sure of which weapon to use for each            situation. Normally this would be a fairly strategic element to a            game, but in Army Men it just creates an air of unpredictability.            If you don't choose the correct weapon for each situation, you end            up dead and have to replay the level.                    Infantry-based weaponry isn't Sarge's only refuge - he can drive            tanks, jeeps and trucks too. With the tank you can fire in a            different direction to the one in which you are travelling, but            it's pretty hard to control two 360 degree movements. Vehicles come            along every once in a while, and are quite fun to use, though sadly            they don't last.                    There is also a proverbial ~get out of jail free~ card comes in the            form of air strikes and paratroopers. If you are pinned down you            can signal for them to take out your enemies, but they are strictly            limited use.         The game is set out in                 several campaigns, as well as being able to train in Boot Camp                 - a non-linear map that demonstrates how to use the various                 weapons at your disposal, and how to command your troops. It's                 a useful training device and you might as well heed its                 teachings before tripping out into the field.                    The campaigns in Army Men are linked across Desert, Alpine and            Bayou terrains, which must be played in order. Each section has            four main missions and some sub-missions. They are large maps,            although not too large - it may take only a minute or so to            cross from one side to the other with Sarge at running speed.                    To start with, the campaign missions are fairly easy, but they            become increasingly difficult and annoying as you progress. They            are generally non-linear, and usually objectives consist of moving            to a certain position or destroying a particular unit. Simple            objectives do not make simple missions though, with a surprisingly            large number of foes attempting to prevent you from finishing each            mission.                    What primarily makes the going so tough though is that you cannot            save missions midway, meaning that you are constantly replaying            each one in order to complete it. Your game is saved automatically            post-mission, but that's not good enough, because it's so stupidly            easy to die in Army Men.                    A system of save points during the game would have been preferable            - safe-houses throughout the maps I suppose, so that you could save            and resume should death become you, as it were.         Army Men doesn't boast much in the way                 of replay value. Should you get stuck mid-campaign you won't                 be able to progress any further, and you will be resigned to                 replaying earlier missions to get your kicks.                    I had the opportunity to test out Army Men on a LAN though, and in            terms of gameplay it hardly resembles the single player campaigns.            Ironically, by branching away from the single player mode's            incessant ~almost-RTS-ness~, a much more interesting and enjoyable            combat simulation emerges, with different coloured Sarge's battling            it out like assassins to kill the target. Weapons, air strikes and            the like are scattered around the play area, and it's generally the            luck of the draw that dictates who finds the more powerful weapons.                    Playing best-of-3 matches proved good fun for the most part,            although if you want to play over the internet you will have to            settle for using Mplayer or HEAT.Net, neither of which is ideal.                    In all honesty, if it weren't for the multiplayer aspect, I'd            probably not have played Army Men for more than a few hours, as it            made an otherwise disappointing campaign-based strategy title into            an engrossing, action-packed army game.         For a budget title,                 Army Men would normally be resigned to obscurity, but you                 know, I kind of liked it. The multiplayer element is                 unquestionably the best section, as the single player lets it                 down somewhat.                    Seeing as the latter is what most people will play though, I can't            highly recommend Army Men. But on the other hand, it is only            a fiver, so if you're bored one afternoon, why not?"}
