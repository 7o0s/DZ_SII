This is a well known fact, and has            been true since its release in September last year.                    While the performance of this chip is undisputed, there are two            factions that exist within the GeForce camp. These relate to the            type of memory used to partner the chip on various manufacturers'            boards. While most companies are happy to produce both boards, they            do charge a premium for one, and it is because of this that people            may be confused by the whole idea of there being two apparently            identical boards, one of which costs a significant amount less.                    The difference in the memory types is that they are either standard            Single Data Rate (SDR) or Double Data Rate (DDR). Just to explain            briefly the difference, data can only be transmitted across a bus            in time with a clock pulse. Traditionally data could only be            transferred on only one edge of this clock pulse (the clock pulse            is a wave), but with recent advancements data can now be            transferred on both the rising AND falling edges of the clock            pulse. This is very much how AGP 2x functions, and the DDR front            side bus of an Athlon CPU.         Elsa are one of many companies that                 have produced both the SDR and DDR variants of GeForce board,                 and here we will be looking at the cheaper SDR flavour, the                 Erazor X.                    The board itself breaks with the standard tradition of following a            reference design. Elsa are known for their esoteric boards, and the            Erazor X doesn't disappoint. When looking at the board it wouldn't            be surprising for someone to wonder where the rest of it went.            Elsa's unconventional design involves taking a fairly substantial            chunk out of the board, toward the 15 pin connector edge of the            card.                    The board doesn't feature any TV-Out capabilities and, as a result,            it makes sense for Elsa to have taken this chunk out, as why waste            board materials when its only going to be empty space. It is a            shame that there are no other output features other than a standard            15 pin monitor connector, but seeing that this is a very under-used            feature it makes sense not to include it just to keep the price of            the board down.                    One very good thing about the Elsa board is that the supplied            heatsink and fan on the GeForce chip is rather nice and solid, and            has a large surface area from which to dissipate the copious            amounts of heat generated by the chip.                    My only annoyance with this is that while the heatsink is attached            using a fairly standard thermal compound, which is more than good            enough for the task, the actual contact between the chip and the            heatsink isn't particularly good, as there is a slight gap between            some of the chip and its heatsink. This isn't good, and it may only            have affected the board that I saw, but seeing that I experienced            no problems with it in testing it should be sufficient.         Elsa have once again done a sterling job                 with the drivers, and have based them on the latest Nvidia                 reference set in order to achieve the highest performance                 possible.                    It is nice to see that they have also added a few extras to the            drivers, as all too many companies just churn out the reference            drivers but replace NVIDIA company graphics with their own. While            this isn't too much of a problem, it is nice to see that some (like            Elsa) go a little further.         The extra driver features come                 mainly in the form of the monitor set up, with an extensive                 control app which allows for very precise tuning of the                 monitor. Thoughtfully they have also included a large set of                 pre-defined monitor scripts, although creating your own                 personal one isn't particularly difficult.                    One very interesting feature that has popped up is something called            chip guard. The idea behind this is that, should you overclock the            chip or have a problem with it overheating due to a fault, chip            guard will monitor this and attempt to prevent you from doing any            real damage to the chip itself. Chip guard will either forcibly            stop the application, crash the machine, or apparently turn the            computer off. During testing I didn't encounter any problems, and            so never got to see chip guard in action, but there is certainly            peace of mind knowing that chip guard is there.                    Elsa may not have come up with this idea (I believe Asus first came            up with this solution for their own GeForce boards), but kudos to            them for actually including such a program. I have yet to see            anyone else implement such a feature...                    The Erazor X was compared to a DDR based GeForce in order to            highlight the performance differences that exist between the two.                    It is clear to see from the benchmarks that the DDR GeForce is            consistently faster than its SDR cousin, especially when running at            higher resolutions and bit depths. It is for these reasons that DDR            memory was brought in.                    The available memory bandwidth is the main reason for the            relatively poor performance of the SDR Erazor X, in comparison to            the DDR variety at least - the performance is still excellent            compared to any other graphics card currently on the market!                    It is easier to demonstrate this with a few simple calculations...            Both varieties of GeForce have a 128bit memory bus, but while the            memory runs at 166MHz for SDR memory, it reaches 300MHz for the DDR            variety.                    Therefore the SDR memory's bandwidth is (128/8) * 166 = 2.6Gb/sec,            whereas the DDR memory's bandwidth is (128/8) * 300 = 4.8Gb/sec                    Due to this rather impressive bandwidth increase, a card using DDR            memory is capable of transferring more data, which the chip is all            too happy to supply, and so the card doesn't lose as much of its            performance at higher resolutions or bit depths.                    In fact, the SDR memory becomes a major bottleneck due to a simple            lack of bandwidth between the chip and the memory. Do bear in mind,            both chips are running at the same clock speed, and so the ONLY            factor affecting the performance is the memory bandwidth.                    The Erazor X is a good board that performs well. It comes with a            good set of drivers which are constantly updated by Elsa, and it            also includes Chip Guard, which is a useful feature for anyone            wanting to overclock the board. Unfortunately the performance is            being held back by the memory used, and so you will never see the            full power of the GeForce released on to your screen.                    Now, one would have thought that by using SDR memory the Erazor X            would be cheaper, but when compared to other offerings the Elsa            board is still quite expensive, which is a shame as performance            wise it can't offer anything more than any other SDR based GeForce            board.                    It is for these reasons that the ErazorX doesn't receive a higher            score, but nonetheless this is another good product from Elsa, if a            little expensive.
