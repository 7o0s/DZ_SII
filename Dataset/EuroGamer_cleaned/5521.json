Win a million on World Poker Tour. Save the world as Jack Bauer in 24. And scamper down the wing before incompetentlyballooning the ball into the crowd as Djibril Cisse in Real Football 2006. The world is your oyster, albeit on atwo-inch screen.With this in mind, Paid To Kill is tailor-made for anyone whose dream is totravel the world and meet new people. And then shoot them.You play globetrotting assassin Ramon Spectre, who's gettingpaid sacks of cash to bump off a bunch of terrorist leaders. Whatthis translates into is a top-down action-adventure set acrossthree different terrains - snow, desert and forest.The graphics are small but pixel-perfectly formed, with morethan a whiff of the old-school gaming days when people had homecomputers, not consoles.Each level involves sneaking and shooting your way past dozensof henchmen to reach a boss character, which you have to terminatewith extreme prejudice. The controls that enable you to do so aredead simple, showing that Rovio has put a lot of work into ensuringthe game works well for mobile.For example, you don't have to actually aim your gun to shootpeople. Instead, if you're pointing in the right direction andthey're in range, you'll automatically start firing. It's great forlurking behind a wall in wait for a hapless bodyguard to walkpast.Lurking is important in this game. There are plenty of shadowsto hide in - an approach which often pays more dividends thanan all-guns-blazing approach. You can even hide in closets, whichis a good way to get out of a tight scrape when your energy levelis low.There are bags of neat touches in Paid To Kill, including a novel upgrade system in betweenmissions. Killing the bosses gives you cash that you can then spendon beefing up Ramon's shooting accuracy, body armour, walking speedand his stash of C4 explosives. It's not RPG-level characterdevelopment, but it does mean you can tweak Ramon to be an expertsniper (the accuracy), a tough man-mountain (the armour) or a greatbig cowardly custard who would run away rather than say boo to agoose (the speed), and adjust your tactics accordingly.The other thing worth mentioning about Paid To Kill is the marvellous dialogue, as demonstrated inthe following exchange from the start of the game:Falkov: ~Get a grip, man. You are the hard-boiled assassin RamonSpectre. And I'm Falkov, your assistant... Damn it.~Ramon: ~Shut it Falkov or I'll shoot you. Well now, am I on amission?~Falkov: ~No, we are on a skiing holiday, you moron...~There's more in this vein throughout the game, and it's always ajoy.Paid To Kill is that rare beast - an action-adventuregame with a sense of humour. As such, it deserves to appeal to awider audience than the camouflage-clad nutcases who watch Ultimate Force. Although they'll probably like it too."}
