Although the language barrier            masks the game's no doubt delightful dialogue and storyline, it            cannot mask the basic underlying virtues of the Castlevania series.            It's a 2D platformer with advanced character development, superb            level design and - in this case - it makes inventive use of the            GBA's hardware to produce some lovely visual effects, all to the            sound of a haunting soundtrack.                         Belmont begins by breaching the castle's outer walls, pursued by            an enormous metallic beast which wakes in the moon's glow and looms            several screens high above our hero, before working his way through            darkened corridors and attics, uncovering spellbooks and slaying            the undead with his trusty chain whip. As usual the whip's            mechanics are incredibly ornate - you can stand still holding the B            button and wiggle the chain around in the air with the directional            pad to snag power-ups and other bonuses, before it flops believably            at the behest of the game's consistent physics.                         Defeating your enemies improves your abilities and increases your            experience. Levelling up like an RPG character, Juste Belmont            learns new skills as he fights - he is able to slide low to the            ground after defeating the first boss, and after the second he can            perform the platformer's favourite move, the double-jump. Before            long Belmont can reach difficult ledges, destroy powerful enemies            swiftly and with more grace and finesse, and perform spells            combined with weapon attacks to improve his odds of escaping            unharmed. One improvement here is the ability to lunge or retreat            quickly using the shoulder buttons, which proves incredibly useful            in escaping the clutches of quick-witted enemies and penetrating            the defences of those with complicated movement patterns.                    The only thing worrying me as I first booted up my import copy of            White Night Concerto was the impending squint-fest of a graphics            engine, but fortunately I was quickly relieved of that concern. As            the game's title screen appeared, reflecting beautifully in the            water in front of the castle, the warm glow seemed worlds away from            Circle of the Moon. The lighting is beyond acceptable, but far from            bright and cutesy. It emphasizes the detail on Belmont and his            aggressors' outfits and in the background, and in a lot of places            it helps move the game out of the gutter of practically opaque noir            and into moonlit horror movie territory.                         The graphics are largely unchanged in terms of composition though,            with a smattering of Mode 7 here and there, the usual neatly drawn            and detailed backgrounds (which haven't aged much since their days            on the Super Nintendo at the start of the last decade), and smooth            character, background and weapon animations. Konami has perfected            the art of Castlevania, and with the correct lighting things should            be fine from now on.                         So far the game is more than living up to its predecessors, with            just the right amount of difficulty to keep you coming back after a            frustrating death, and just as Belmont improves, the player also            grows more competent in handling his abilities. One thing which I            noticed however was that early boss encounters are much easier than            their equivalents in previous Castlevania adventures, but if            anything this just dragged me in even further, and to call the game            'easy' would be an insult - thanks to the distance between save            points it requires a lot more time to attain something tangibly            rewarding from a session, and before long White Night Concerto            becomes Life-Sapping Black Hole. Although it's perhaps a little            early to call it a foregone conclusion, Konami's latest Castlevania            does appear to be a delightful addition to the series, more vibrant            than its predecessors and not lacking any of the things that made            them great."}
