We watch                 images of unfolding conflicts, on the one hand clucking                 sympathetically about the suffering of the people on the                 ground, while inside we thrill at every deep boom of the heavy                 artillery, and shiver with excitement at the sharp cracking of                 assault rifles.                    The media have exploited this facet of human nature since the            beginning of time - our basic need for conflict is expressed most            powerfully in warfare, and thousands of plays, novels and movies            have fulfilled that need admirably, from Shakespeare's Macbeth to            the latest Hollywood action flick. Most recently of all, computer            games allow the player to enter into a wartime situation, either as            an individual soldier or as the commander of an entire army.                    All of these games - from the military authenticity of Counter            Strike and Shogun to the exaggerated technological carnage of            Unreal Tournament and Tiberian Sun - base their appeal on the fact            that they bring the player into the battlefield, allowing them to            become part of the action in the age old game of war.                    While of course many different factors combine to create a good or            a bad game, there is no doubt that immersion is a primary one - the            ultimate aim of a game creator is to make the player feel part of            the action to as large a degree as possible.                         Not so Rising Sun. This is the latest in a line of games from                 Talonsoft that recreate historic theatres of war, in this case                 the Pacific during World War II is the focus.                    Any fan of military history will recognise the names of            battlefields such as Guadalcanal, Manila and Tarawa, but rather            than basing a real-time strategy game of tactics and resource            management around this rich source material, Talonsoft have created            a turn-based game played over maps made up of large hexagons which            has more in common with military board games than it does with            contemporary strategy wargames.                    Starting a game of Rising Sun is like stepping into a timewarp, not            back to the 1940's, as the developers might hope, but to the early            1990's, when most strategy games were two dimensional and based on            moving pieces around on hexagons.                    Rising Sun is admittedly a little more advanced than that - the            battlefields in the game are based on actual overhead photographs            of the terrain of the Pacific during the war, and concepts such as            height and line-of-sight are implemented quite well. But at the end            of the day, it is very hard to get away from the fact that this is            a game which is not a million miles ahead of Civilisation 2 in            terms of graphics, and whose gameplay mechanics are akin to those            found in very simplistic table-top games.         The basic premise of all                 of the scenarios in Rising Sun is that your units are placed                 at one end of the map, and you are given a certain number of                 turns to complete an objective, such as the capture of a                 strategic position, or the destruction of certain enemy units.                    Each of your units has a number of action points at the beginning            of a turn, which can then be used to move or to shoot. Click on a            unit, and the hexagons which it can see, move to, or shoot at are            highlighted awaiting your orders. The main problem with the            gameplay arises when you realise that many of the maps are            very large indeed, and that unit movement is painfully slow.            You will often find that the larger part of a game is taken up            entirely with laboriously moving your units to the middle of the            map, followed by a short bout of combat.                    The combat itself isn't exactly worth writing home about, being a            very staid affair indeed. Certain realistic touches are applied,            such as the advantages of height and cover being well implemented,            but other features of the lacklustre unit combat system will come            across as annoying at best. For example, units that have come under            fire can sometimes lose heart completely and refuse to move towards            an enemy unit - a clumsy attempt at implementing unit morale, which            was done much more successfully in Shogun and the Close Combat            series.         A special                 mention must go to the musical score, which is one of the most                 inappropriate and utterly terrible soundtracks that I have                 ever come across.                    The music seems to jump about seemingly at random (possibly an            attempt at doing dynamic music, although this is unclear), skipping            merrily between themes, moods and tempos at a rate of knots.                    One minute you are moving units to a dramatic ~Ride Of The            Valkyries~ style march, the next you are opening fire on the enemy            position to the strains some light-hearted ~dancing with the pixies            and faeries~ music that would probably be more at home in EverQuest            than in a game presenting itself as a realistic combat simulation.                    Rising Sun plumbs new depths when it comes to soundtrack selection.         The TalonSoft series of                 wargames does have a certain hardcore following, mainly made                 up of older gamers who have moved from table-top wargames to                 PC gaming. Indeed, the (rather hefty) manual for Rising Sun                 carries a number of advertisements from companies selling war                 miniatures and the likes.                    If you are one of these people, then you already know what to            expect from a Talonsoft game, and you probably aren't reading this            review out of anything but passing interest, since you will buy the            game anyway. If so, rest assured that Rising Sun does have a wide            variety of missions and units, and will probably be a good purchase            for you.                    If, however, you are in the majority of gamers who don't like            table-top war games (and we aren't talking about Warhammer here,            but dry military games), then you would be advised to steer well            clear. Far from being the realistic simulation of warfare in the            Pacific that it claims to be, Rising Sun is in fact nothing more            than a relatively poor board game, albeit a board game wearing            layers upon layers of cheap digital makeup."}
