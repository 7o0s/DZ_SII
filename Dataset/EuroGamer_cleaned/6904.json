And so with deft timing the            great granddaddy of tactical action games has returned to rid the            world of AK-47 toting scum once again, in the latest expansion to            the ever-present series of games based on the novels of Tom Clancy.                        Black Thorn is effectively another mission pack for Rainbow Six            sequel Rogue Spear, and it's priced accordingly. Confusingly though            Red Storm have decided to release it as a stand-alone product, as            well as being able to tack it onto the side of Rogue Spear. So is            it a mission pack, or simply a straight-to-budget title? Whatever,            the game offers more of the same for fans of the series, with            additions including ten single player missions, thirteen new            weapons, a few new multiplayer maps and a new multiplayer mode to            round off the decidedly slim package.                        The story is based around a terrorist group led by a psychotic            ex-member of the Rainbow team, who has taken it upon himself to            re-enact famous terrorist activities of the past in order to lure            Rainbow to its demise. Cue a cheery jaunt across the world for our            stealthy chums to pop a cap in the ass of a few hundred dim-witted            foot soldiers, in settings ranging from cruise ships to foreign            embassies, and middle eastern villages to suburban train stations.                    The difficulty curve of the missions is a lot less forgiving than            in previous outings. This is not only due to the shorter length of            the game, as Red Storm have obviously presumed the player will know            what they are up against this time round. Unfortunately newcomers            to the series picking this up as a stand-alone product are going to            be immediately daunted by the complexity they will be launched            into. The proceedings seem to be slightly more action-oriented this            time around though, which will no doubt please Counter-Strike            veterans searching for something else to get their teeth into.                        Apart from the new missions and weapons, Black Thorn apparently            also features a much-improved graphics engine compared to the            original Rogue Spear, but we really didn't notice much in the way            of enhancement. The maps maintain the excellent design and detail            of the originals, yet still have the flimsy feel of a movie set,            and the whole affair is starting to look very dated indeed. Even            the excellent orchestral soundtrack and spot-music from the            original is starting to get boring, as audibly the game remains            unchanged.                        Thankfully there have been some improvements though. Either through            sensible level design or improved pathfinding AI, your team mates            no longer appear to be a hindrance to the smooth handling of your            operations. Previously it was possible for a terrorist to stand and            pick off your entire team one by one as they bumbled through a door            to their death, but this problem seems to have been ironed out            nicely. For those of you looking for more intelligent opposition, a            new multiplayer mode called Lone Wolf is also included. This allows            a single player to go up against a team of human-controlled            terrorists, offering an interesting dynamic not seen elsewhere.            It's just unfortunate that the team couldn't have offered more of            these little innovations.                    Black Thorn is a decent little expansion to keep the covert            fetishists satiated for a while, but it certainly doesn't offer            anything more than you would expect from a mission pack. What with            the far more impressive looking Ghost Recon round the corner,            hopefully this will be the last product Red Storm manage to squeeze            out of the ageing Rainbow Six engine before things start to get            embarrassing.                        -        Rainbow                    Six : Rogue Spear ReviewRainbow                    Six : Rogue Spear Review"}
