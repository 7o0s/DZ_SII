{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-issadvance-gba", "date": "3 Feb 2003", "game_name": "ISS Advance", "text": "Anyone who's played footy games as long as EG has will know two            basic facts: firstly that a stock of spare controllers is necessary            during particularly competitive occasions, and secondly that            handheld attempts at recreating the beautiful game are almost            always complete rubbish. Admittedly the arrival of the GBA 18            months ago helped matters a touch, but even the best that have            arrived in that period are half arsed approximations of the 32 bit            era.                    The abject failure of Codemasters to recognise the value of its            Sensible Soccer franchise on the GBA has presented an enormous gap            in the market for an enterprising publisher to fill - but even the            mighty EA found out recently with its super low selling FIFA 2003            that the apathy among the 1.5 million GBA owners in the UK is rife.            The fact is we want value for our \u00a334.99, and unless the            game's an absolute bona fide triple A classic, we're not going to            be remotely interested.        Given that this is Konami's            second attempt at a footy game on the GBA, there was a fair amount            of optimism that this could at last be ~the one~. After all, this            is the same publisher that regularly churns out the Winning            Eleven/Pro Evolution series to blanket acclaim. Surely a port of            one of one of its N64/PSX mid '90s efforts can't be beyond them?                    But last time around it most certainly was beyond them. A quick            refresher of that one reveals itself to be an unplayable wobbly            sprite travesty - and we're more than happy to report the latest,            identically titled effort has improved matters no end. It has all            the usual bells and whistles you expect in a portable footy title:            respectable visuals, a two player link mode, commentary (from John            Champion, once again), a plethora of            formation/weather/difficulty/match length options, as well as            Friendly, Penalty Shoot Out, Superstar and 58 team International            Cup modes.                    But the less said about the team situation, the better. The lack of            a FIFPro license has made it a mockery of a sham once more, with no            recognisable player names allowed, so we've ended up with such            laughable replacements as Syelma (Seaman?), Bohaen (Owen?), Dekkaan            (Beckham?) and Eescei (Heskey?!). No clubs are included either,            which is also a bit annoying for anyone hoping more for their            \u00a335.        But at least the game resembles a            football match these days. The viewpoint has been zoomed out this            time to allow you to actually have a chance of seeing where your            players are, and the animation has come on leaps and bounds            compared to the bizarre, stilted stickmen of 2001's effort. Gone,            also, is the slightly unhelpful isometric viewpoint, with a more            traditional touchline view making it far easier to get an idea of            what's going on. Weather also plays a part, with regular downpours            helping to add to the atmosphere, although in all honesty we didn't            really notice a significant difference to the play.                    Despite the obvious lack of buttons, the control system has a            surprising amount of options. The usual defensive and attacking            system is employed, with A providing a weak pass/marking, B for a            strong pass/sliding tackle, L for sprint, R for selecting players,            with combinations of the buttons providing opportunities to show            off with overhead kicks, headers, aftertouch and the obligatory            through pass. Although using the shoulder buttons for any length of            time is still the most uncomfortable experience in gaming, it's a            system that any footy veteran will slip straight into. The main            limitations are down to the relative lack of animation compared to            more recent incarnations on the PS2 - sometimes going back to old            style 3D football games makes you realise how far things have come.                    Attempting the kind of flash tricks that Pro Evo veterans will be            used to just isn't an option here. You'll be turning the clock back            to the days when the ball was glued to your foot with stilted            comedy shots abound. The problem in ISS seems to be keeping the            ball from going over the bar - often we'd end up with 20 odd shots            on goal per game, but still only have a couple of goals to show for            it, while the overly forgiving refs almost always turned a blind            eye to our rabid Vinnie Jones antics. It's hardly fair to compare            this mid 90s fare with the next gen versions, but somehow you can't            help it. We've been spoiled. Things have moved on so much, and it's            not just a visual difference unlike so many genres.                    In the context of the platform and the competition, it's easy to            see that ISS Advance easily tops anyone else's handheld attempts            and as such offers the best football experience on the GBA. Just            don't expect it to mirror the kind of high gloss football            entertainment possible on the current crop of consoles - and thanks            to the limitations of the GBA expect your hands and eyes to hurt            like hell after a few hours wrestling and peering into the gloom.            How it performs on the SP will be another matter entirely, and it            could well be worth hanging on until the March 28th release of the            redesigned GBA to find out.
