Long after the radio stations have lost their zing, and the story mode's been cleaned out, GTA's environments continue to deliver freeform mayhem in a way few other games can. Liberty City is not just a brilliant pastiche of New York, it's New York boiled down to its key landmarks and textures, and then blended with the best aspects of a theme park: looping highways to spin around, sudden unexpected jumps hidden in the strangest of places, and an effortless ability to frame shiny spectacle at just the right moment.That's probably why the team had no qualms about staging GTA IV's multiplayer in the same mean streets its campaign walked down. It's a trend that continues with The Lost and Damned: once again, when you head towards the online lobbies, Rockstar hands over the keys to Liberty City in its entirety, and the new content is not a handful of new boroughs and a scattering of unexplored streets, but a range of new modes, all designed as variations on a theme. Alongside the traditional deathmatch and race options, each of the expansion's new challenges puts a novel twist on tried and trusted dynamics. A recent chance to try a few of them out suggests the strategy's likely to pay off. Even the most basic offering will be enough to win many gamers over. While GTA IV already has perfectly serviceable combat-focused race events, the magical combination of motorbikes and baseball bats unexpectedly turns Rockstar's moody epic into that cheerful Road Rash remake you've always wanted. The mechanics are unmistakable, and it's handled with the lightest of touches, X and A allowing you to lash out on either side, while holding down the button charges your attacks. It's a bare-bones system, but that just gives you more time to take in the courses, which swing you on a series of rigorously angled tours of the city's more cinematic spots \u2013 of the two we played, Middle Ground dumps you into a rain-soaked downtown, while Beaches flings you out along the waterfront, threading the chase through unexpected alleyways and past the fairground, before eventually sliding between the wooden spars of the pier.Things get noticeably more complex with Own the City, a tug-of-war land grab that looses teams of bikers onto the islands to take control of various territories, and then hang onto them until the clock runs out. It's an evolution of Turf War: target districts are highlighted in slabs of bright colour on the mini-map, and while you initially take over an area by shooting it out with AI-driven Defenders, the real fun starts once you move into enemy-controlled streets and take on rival players. Play it like a deathmatch, and Own the City will initially confuse you - the real pleasure comes with the strategy, as your gang slowly starts to work as a team, gambling on how many people should stay behind to defend captured territory, and how many should head out into other boroughs in the name of aggressive expansion.As with all the multiplayer modes, although you start on your bike, you're by no means limited to it. Long matches tend to devolve into a series of increasingly desperate vehicular experiments, as you rope in hatchbacks, sports cars, and even the odd station wagon to try and ram home your advantage most effectively. When you throw in the prospect of a wandering Gun Van, which, if hijacked, can be driven around to each team-mate to supply new weapons, there's the possibility that Own the City may have a few too many ideas for its own good; but its street-by-street brawling and endless opportunities for revenge seem promising so far."}
