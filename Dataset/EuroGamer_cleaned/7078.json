They used to land off our coast before            venturing onto our land to rape our women, pillage our towns and            kill our men. They were bastards, quite clearly.                         But then blow me if they haven't gone and inspired a damn fine God            game! While Cultures shares not only its creator's CV but also its            general aesthetic with classic strat-fest The Settlers 3 (and its            esteemed lineage), it's a very quirky and entertaining game in its            own right when you get down to the nitty gritty.                         Your objective in Cultures is to turn a group of nasty, loathsome            and downright stupid Vikings into a successful, educated and            prospering community with the ability to survive the onslaught of            their pillaging ilk and live harmoniously with the locals. It's a            tall order but it can be achieved.                         But what is it that makes a Viking want to settle down? Apparently            it's a mixture of the religious and the coincidental. Our Viking            troop was growing tired of pillaging, its homeland already            destroyed, and when a comet explodes and rains down upon them they            treat it as a sign from their Gods to move on, shifting their butts            into longboats and rowing to the continent of North America, with            the firm intention of overcoming and colonizing it. The game starts            out with you helping them through a campaign of mapping and            populating the West.                    Yes, fundamentally, but arranged and executed in a very spontaneous            and enjoyable manner, showing the gamer how ruthless and motivated            the Vikings were, despite their long journey.                         I mentioned earlier how the similarities between The Settlers and            Cultures dwindle as you continue with it. The biggest difference            has to be the personal level upon which you interact with your            Viking chums. Each Viking has its own name and various social and            personal statistics associated with them; it's your job to improve            them.                         In a way Cultures has more in common with what we've heard about            Black & White in that it's less crucial to control your Vikings            but important to influence them. The right decisions can affect not            only your little Scandinavian chum's lifestyle, but also his            happiness. If you marry him to a girl with all the visual charm of            a skunk's rear end he is going to be unhappy.                         When playing Cultures I felt more as though I was aiding their            development than winning anything, and yet it felt satisfying. It's            a similar feeling to that which I experienced playing The Sims,            only different, because here I was focusing on a multitude of            detailed resources, like different types of clothing, and not just            worrying about my net worth. Similarly, you can focus on the            personal and social development of a single villager, or you could            treat them as a sort of Communal Farm, working with them as a            whole. Needless to say there's so much potential for replay it's            not funny.                    Of course, if you've busied yourself with developing your colony            into the Viking version of the hippies, free love and all, you may            find yourself in a spot of bother when the locals come looking for            a bit of the action. Training up your most rowdy Vikings at a young            age to fight to the death is a good idea, but once again you are            training them for potential combat, not the inevitable, and in a            way that's what makes Cultures so pleasant; you are living out the            lives of a group of Vikings, and just like characters in a good            book, you treat them like family and feel endeared to them. As such            throwing them into battle is a last resort and wherever possible            you attempt to make use of diplomacy to save their hides from            Indians, Mayans and Eskimos.                         But it's not as open-ended as something like The Sims; there is a            set mission structure to observe. After getting the basic gist of            things you are given individual campaigns to master and eleven            different scenarios. It may not be The Sims then, but in terms of            accessibility it's easy enough to pick up every once in a while            without feeling overwhelmed.                         Part of what makes the Vikings so endearing is how close you feel            to them. You know exactly how they are living and what their living            conditions are like, because you can check more or less every            statistic imaginable, right down to the absurd details like how the            indigenous foliage is getting on. They may have been dirty brutes            in the past but you are educating them and living with them. And if            you think one of your Vikings is taking a bit of a liberty with            you, you can pull up a menu immediately to track his whereabouts            under that bush with Lola the Luscious. There's a time and a place,            after all.                    Part of Cultures attraction for me was how easy it was to get into            and re-enter into whenever I liked. Due to the broad spectrum of            campaigns and scenarios it's easy enough to have a stab whenever            you feel inclined, and thanks to the low system requirements            (despite the thoroughly appropriate visuals) you needn't spend half            a minute sharpening your helmet in between loads.                         Multiplayer is another aspect that will add to the game's appeal.            Although the computer AI is captivating enough, the multiplayer is            done in a very cunning fashion to allow up to six players to take            part across a LAN or on the Net, with each taking on the role of a            group of Vikings. Seeing as the game has yet to be released we were            unable to verify the Internet portion of the title, but our LAN            games were enthralling..                         It's at about this point in the review that you must be starting            to wonder just what we have to say against Cultures. Well,            very little really. There's no claret to accompany your battles and            of course it's startlingly unoriginal as far as fans of The            Settlers go, but aside from that the only thing we could find that            might put people off was the slow pace. But lets face it, if you're            after a real-time strategy game you'll pick up Red Alert 2.                    In retrospect it's very hard to pigeonhole Cultures as emanating            from any one single source. It's a God-sim, that's for certain, but            it's exhaustively detailed and easy to get into and enjoy. Far from            being a clone of any one game, it's a delightful mixture of the            genre's finest. If you don't think the slow pace of the game will            perturb you, pick it up now."}
