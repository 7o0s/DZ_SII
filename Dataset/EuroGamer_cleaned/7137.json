Via in-game                 cutscenes the old man relays the plot and your mission - to                 rescue his daughter and wield the time-travelling sword known                 as Daikatana against some dictatorial chap.                    Then he gets capped.                    You try to stow away in his coffin to enter the fortress where            things will take place, but obviously this doesn't quite go            according to plan, as you somehow end up in a swamp. Why do they            store dead people in the dictator's fortress? And why would you            jump in a coffin for some old man who could be making up all this            tripe for all you know? Good question...                    As the game itself starts, things don't look any better. The            opening levels are absolutely terrible - you can hardly see            anything, and you are constantly being mobbed by frogs and insects.            The textures used in these early levels look like left overs, and            are totally unsuitable for their purpose. As is the Quake 2 engine            which powers the game - it never was particularly good for outdoors            areas, rocky terrain and swamps.                    Thankfully as you approach the end of the first episode the action            progresses and the plot thickens appropriately. After you escape            back in time with the Daikatana and your newly found companions to            an age of mythical monsters and an ancient undead society, things            actually start to get interesting...         The rest of                 Daikatana's episodes literally seem like totally different                 games. Each offers an entirely seperate arsenal of weapons and                 all the monsters are altered as well, but ultimately it's like                 playing a string of unconnected, but admittedly above average,                 Quake 2 ~total conversions~.                    As soon as you move into the classical levels things start to look            rosier, with skeletal warriors and mythical fortresses doing a            great job of showing what the Quake 2 engine does right. Your            enemies get a lot more aggressive too. In the first episode they            saunter up and poke at you incessantly with their snouts, but in            the subsequent episodes enemies race towards you, sabres held            aloft, preparing to kick seven shades out of you. Weapons are still            only bearable, with nothing particularly standing out, but the            action is relentless.                    The third episode is somewhat reminiscent of Raven's ~Hexen~, with            a brooding sense of darkness and foreboding, complete with decaying            zombies, medieval villages, and large cavernous areas. The weapons            are all magical, including my personal favourite the Summoning            Wand, which scrawls a pentagram in the air and summons hellish            demons forth to take care of your enemies.                    The final episode takes you back to the future, starting out on            Alcatraz Island, which has been reopened as a prison with lots of            nasty inmates, as well as equally horrible cybernetic guards, who I            can't help thinking would have been better deployed in the first            episode...         The main problem with                 Daikatana though is that it is now three years overdue, and as                 a result it is very much based on the technology of                 yesteryear. The Quake 2 engine was good for its time, but Ion                 Storm just couldn't do enough to lift it to the level of                 today's top games, such as Unreal Tournament and Quake 3.                    The outdoor areas in particular are poorly constructed, and the            models also look a little amateurish, not because of their design,            but simply due to the limitations of the aging engine. As for the            rest of the graphics, they are impressive enough in their own            right, but nothing to shout about.                    I've never found first person shooters to be particularly inspiring            when it comes to sound effects and music, with the possible            exception of Half-Life, and Daikatana does little to sway my            position. The futuristic weapons are the worse, sounding like            half-baked Star Trek leftovers, but the medieval and classical            arsenals pack a little more punch and have appropriately beefy            dark-age thwacks and cracks.                    The music is fairly standard fare to be honest and doesn't bare            discussion. The only interesting part about it is that the music is            stored in MP3 format - easy enough to delete or more,            interestingly, to replace. Good fun.         One thing that is supposed to lift                 Daikatana above the opposition is the sidekick system, with                 Mikiko and Superfly joining you during the game. They can be                 useful in a firefight, as long as you are not between them and                 an enemy.                    There is a lot of inter-character banter to advance the plot, and            you can issue preset verbal commands to them in order to get work            done, but sadly their AI leaves a lot to be desired at times. There            are a lot of doors in Daikatana, and should you come up against            one, off run Mikiko and Superfly, bounding around looking for an            alternative route. There were scant few occasions where I issued a            command and saw it instantly executed, too. And ladders, ugh, don't            even get me started on ladders.                    As for their health, your HUD lets you know how they are doing, but            they don't seem to care much for their own lives. If you run past            some cryogenic gas leaking from a capsule, they will make no effort            to avoid taking damage from it, and if you stop in a particular            position just through a doorway they will happily stand there under            the frame and get squished by the door repeatedly until they keel            over.                    Meaning it's game over, seeing as you have to complete the game            with the two buffoons still in tow.         Daikatana does a lot of                 credible things for all of its flaws, but it's never going to                 set the world alight, and the only really original aspects                 have been poorly implemented.                    Had this been released early in 1999 it may have sold like            hotcakes, but thanks to mass walk-outs, bugs and other problems it            took Romero and his merry band another year to sort it out, and now            they are paying the price.
