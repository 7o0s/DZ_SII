Even on the old            8-bit home computer systems, titles like ~Way of the Exploding            Fist~ and ~International Karate~ were top of my favourites list. Of            course the big heavyweights in recent arcade times have been Capcom            and SNK, with their own sets of ardent fans constantly comparing            and dismissing the other in a strange battle of 2D fighting wits!                    Capcom have consistently upheld their standards with a long line of            ~Street Fighter~ games (apart perhaps, from the Street Fighter            Movie game, with its hilarious ~real-life~ Kylie and Van Damme            digitizations -Ed), in so doing making the likes of Ryu and            Guile household names. On the flipside of the coin you have SNK who            are famed for their ~Fatal Fury~ and ~King of the Fighters~ games,            with popular characters including the likes of Geese, King and            Iori. In all there are over twenty-five characters from both sides            of the fence, giving incredible variety and a good shelf-life for            the game.             The first thing to strike you in Capcom vs. SNK is the            completely over-the-top menu system, with lots of psychadelic            colours and snazzy scrolling going on. You have the choice to            either leap into the arcade mode if you don't happen to have a            fellow control pad wielder around, or the 'vs. mode' which is by            far more enjoyable pitting you against another human opponent. In            time honoured tradition you can step in at any time during arcade            mode for some two-player slugathons.                    Your first choice in all fights is whether to use the Capcom or the            SNK groove, which offer differing styles of gameplay. The Capcom            groove works via a 'Super Combo Gauge' which gradually increases as            you attack your opponents, and there are three levels to attain            each providing you with the ability to perform special moves that            were otherwise unavailable to you. The SNK groove differs slightly            where you hold the 'B' and 'Y' buttons to charge up you 'Extra            Gauge'; with the gauge full the attacking power of your character            is increased and you can also perform 'Super Special Moves'. It is            actually quite tricky finding a spare moment to do all this, and I            found it to be the more challenging of the grooves.                    There is a nice variety of character combinations that you can            enter the fighting arenas with, which are based on a clever ratio            system. Certain characters have a ratio of three, others two or            one, and your team can only ever have a maximum overall ratio of            four. With this in mind you can select one of the tougher            characters like M.Bison or Sagat, and pair him with a one ratio            character like Cammy or Vice, or you can choose to take on the CPU            opponents as a quartet of one ratio rated fighters. You will find            the latter gets rather tough when meeting the likes of Geese in the            final battle, who chews and spits out most of those that oppose            him!                    Gameplay is simple - choose your characters and fight through the            various challengers put before you that increase in difficulty as            you progress, finally taking down the big bad ass at the end that            may well open up one of the many secrets that can be unlocked in            the game. Such is the volume of secrets that I can safely say you            will be playing this game for weeks on end to unlock them all. It            is in no way an easy task - even to unlock your first secret - and            the game forces you to work darned hard to get your rewards, but            there are some excellent rewards to be had. This is where I feel            the game will appeal far more to ardent fans than a casual shopper            picking their first fighting game expecting it to be an easy ride.         Controlling of all the            characters is straight forward and reasonably trouble free, but            there are occasions where you want to pull a specific move out of            the hat, only to find your character jumping like a moving target            across the screen. I thought that maybe it was my controller that            was at fault, but I don't have any of these problems in similar            styled games, Capcom vs. SNK is just finicky at times I guess.                    Luckily the occurance of the above is seldom and for the most part            you can go on about your dishing of pain business. Performance of            special moves (once you have achieved the necessary groove            pre-requisites) is extremely easy, and when combined with lightning            fast punching and kicking can have you quite literally whooping out            loud in a delirious state of bloodlust! Unfortunately, you will            find with some characters it is all too easy to corner your            opponent on the left or right of the screen and repeat a move to            win, with little or no resistance.                    The action is fast and furious, perhaps a little too fast            sometimes, particularly when your opponent is performing a special            move that has him moving at triple speed and battering you all the            while. You are left wondering whereabouts you are on the screen,            and what time of the day it is! Thankfully you can choose to play            in either 'Turbo' mode for the more active brained of you, or            'Normal' for the likes of me who prefer their gaming a little more            sedate .. and no I'm not getting old!             If you            are expecting supreme 3D graphics similar to the likes of Soul            Calibur, then you will not get on with this game, with the whole            point being to retain the original look and feel of the 2D arcade            fighter. Characters are all nicely detailed and cartoon styled, and            have just enough frames of animation to stop them from being too            jerky. Some of the little animations when your character wins are            excellently done too, a particular favourite is when Iori bursts            into maniacle laughter which would be more at home in an old black            and white movie!                    The focus is definitely on extravagence as far as the special            effects are concerned, with some of the character special moves            filling the screen with violent explosions, and others hurling            balls of orange or white fire. Environment graphics are excellent,            ranging from a builder's yard to the outside of an amusement            arcade. All of these are introduced to you in some weird and            wonderful way, like the dragon's eye blinking and then revealing            the bar scene with a waitress waddling to-and-fro in the            background.                    Sound is also well catered for providing typically Bruce Lee style            chopping sounds and squawks, with a mix of Oriental and English            banter before and after the fights between the characters. Also            worthy of a mention is the choice of soundtrack, which provides a            superb audio backdrop to do battle on. Definitely a game to turn            the volume up on, particularly if like me you have neighbours who            are having a kitchen fitted which is taking an age to complete!             The only disappointing thing about Capcom vs. SNK is that due            to it's diehard nature it perhaps won't appeal to the more spoilt            modern gamers amongst us. It will be a great shame though to miss            out on this experience, as what you have here is hours and hours            worth of kick ass gameplay just waiting to be released.                    It can be a little difficult to keep track of what's going on, and            the temptation to win all rounds by exploiting the edge of screen            character entrapment detracts a little from the challenge of the            game, but this is very nearly as perfect a 2D fighter as you are            ever going to get."}
