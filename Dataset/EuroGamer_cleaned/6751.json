I thought            this job had hit a new low when I was installing Zanzarah, I mean,            honestly... fairies for crying out loud. Luckily though the            German-developed Zanzarah is much better than the subject matter            might lead you to presume. Starting out in her house in London, our            protagonist Amy ventures into her attic to discover a small chest            (stop giggling at the back). Unable to contain her curiosity, she            opens it and subsequently finds herself transported to a cave            opening out onto a lush green garden, where she is approached by a            friendly looking goblin who lets her know just what the hell is            going on.                        Ages ago the realms of the humans and fairies were in harmony but            humans, being the monstrous oppressors that they are, waged a kind            of ethnic cleansing against the magical fairy world. Not best            pleased about this, the fairy guardians blocked the gates to and            from the human world and severed all contact with us. However, the            fairy world is now under siege from a mysterious and unknown evil,            and an ancient prophecy tells of a great ~fairy master~ that will            save the realm from the dark forces. That'll be you then. Heading            off outside the cave to find your first fairy, the world of            Zanzarah looks fantastic, with plants that sway when you brush past            them, small babbling streams rippling as you step through, and the            sun's rays lending a wonderfully effective aesthetic warmth. Other            areas such as the swamps and forest are similarly realised in            beautiful almost-realism, maintaining a storybook illustration kind            of charm throughout.                         Once you do find your first fairy, you're able to send it into            battle against the variety of other fairies that will attack you on            your travels. This is the game's major selling point, as you            control your fairy in real time, flailing around attempting to            avoid your adversary's mana blasts while charging up your own and            trying to get them on target, gradually whittling down their            energy. A win will gain that fairy strength and experience points,            improving its ability to handle collectable spells and defeat            stronger foes. To progress in the game though, it's necessary to            collect and develop different types of fairy to combat different            kinds of enemy. You can grab new fairies if you have a fairy            sphere, which (in true Pokemon fashion) contains an enemy fairy you            have weakened in battle and makes it available for your own use in            combat. The story itself is progressed in typical RPG style,            through exploration and speaking with various non-player characters            who give away chunks of plot and clues as to where you should be            heading next. You can spend as much time as you like just entering            battles and building up your fairy collection though, going about            the story at your own pace.                    Zanzarah is a surprisingly entertaining and completely charming            adventure, and the fairy combat sections lend a pleasant dynamic            against the relatively slow pace of the adventuring. There's just            enough variety and interest in the environments and storyline to            keep you plodding through, and had the similarities to Pokemon not            been so blindingly obvious it would be easy to hail this is an            essential purchase."}
