Devoted addicts were                 understandably excited when news of a sequel spread, but is it                 just more of the same?                    Well, there is literally tons of gameplay here. You might think            that missions would generally be the same - move, shoot a bad guy,            move, shoot a bad guy, reload, move, etc. But you couldn't be            further from the truth.                    You can choose between two single player campaigns, each with their            own story line, and you don't have to complete one to start the            other. The story lines are easy to follow and quite interesting,            although a little predictable. In some cases when you complete a            mission you will be given the option of choosing from two possible            missions. If you are stuck in one, then being able to choose the            other makes a pleasant change...                    In games such as SiN though, what you managed to achieve would aid            your efforts later on - less reinforcements if you took out a radio            station, for example. This is not the case in DF2 though, and even            if you manage to to kill and destroy everything it will not effect            your objectives later on.                    As well as the campaign game, you can also choose to play one of            the many quick missions which are independent from anything else,            and just plop you into a defined scenario.         Once in a mission you                 can give your team mates orders to follow using the new                 commander's screen, which is basically a larger version of the                 map with the positions of most enemies marked, although it is                 annoying when a stray foe who was not marked walks right up                 behind you when you are using this screen.                    As your allies are already given their own objectives beforehand            though you don't have to spend much time bothering with this, and            if like me you aren't a Rainbow Six fan then you will enjoy being            able to jump straight into the action.                    The map in the bottom right is effectively a smaller version of the            commander's screen, and you can zoom it in and out. It's as useful            as you would expect a map to be when you are dropped into the            middle of unknown territory, and paired with the binoculars it            gives you a major advantage.                    Moveable waypoints mean you can now go the way you want to, which            is useful as sometimes you won't be able to follow waypoints            precisely, as booby traps and sniper towers will occasionally force            you to divert your route. My only complaint with the map is that it            makes some hills seem much steeper than they are, but turning on            the contour lines in the commander screen overcomes this, if you            have the time.                    Your squaddies are also very useful. In some instances they stormed            a base and cleared much of it out for me, and at other times they            provided much needed covering fire. They lack in the personality            department, but in action packed games like this that's the last            thing on your mind...         Many people have complained about DF2 using voxels, but by            doing this Novalogic have managed to create huge outdoor areas.            Rolling hills are visible for miles, blending into the sky on the            horizon. There are also snow-coated environments with (you guessed            it) falling snow.                    Fog is impressive - your enemy slowly emerges from the mist as you            kneel in the swamp with your itching trigger finger ready. You fire            a single shot, and all hell breaks loose as his companions attempt            to track you down. Other missions take place at night, so you must            don your night vision goggles in order to see what you are doing.            This adds another dimension to the gameplay, as enemies find it            harder to see you and vice versa. It works quite well, and you have            to rely heavily on your map and binoculars.                    Explosions look excellent, and there are so many ways to create one            - shooting a can plastered with 'danger' signs, or setting up your            laser targeting device which guides artillery. Or perch up on a            hillside and luzz grenades into a camp below, hearing the screams            and speaker-rumbling booms. Smoke then slowly spirals up into the            air where the charge was let off.                    Weapon models are very mediocre though. The M4 is the best of the            lot, obviously because it will be the weapon of choice, yet much of            the other equipment looks poor. Take the sniper rifle for instance,            which looks more like a strange walking stick. The knife looks            alright, but its animation is simply a slow pull towards the            screen.         The                 final word on the graphics is the textures on the vehicles,                 which look so realistic that you just wish you could climb                 inside and drive around. Disappointingly this is only just a                 dream. Trucks, boats and such can transport you, but you are                 never in full control.                    In one case you are told that you must take over a train, so you            clamber into your friendly helicopter and jump out when you are            over the target. I especially liked this mission, as you are            dodging shots from snipers on hills while climbing over ladders on            carriages in true James Bond style. In another example you are            ~inserted~ by parachuting down to a hill side.                    Unfortunately when you destroy, say, a helicopter, it turns from a            lovely textured model into a wire frame that looks like it has just            been placed on a barbecue, and falls out of the sky like a lead            brick.                    Sadly the AI is weak in places as well, and sometimes a man a few            feet in front of you will shoot wide as if he is totally blind.            Mind you, if they were all top notch sharpshooters you wouldn't            stand a chance of survival, and in many areas you will be wondering            where the hell the soldier that just killed you was hiding. And            being able to fire through certain materials (such as leather,            windows, and wood) makes stealth work paramount.                    The thuds and wisps of bullets as they pass by your head all add to            the effect. It also allows you to distinguish where the enemy is            shooting from, and they too will instantly react to shots they hear            fired, yelling to their comrades. The soldiers will then all kneel            or hit the deck, trying to pin point the source of the panic.                    The crunching of gravel underfoot and the splashing of water as you            dive into a swamp does its job as well, but best of all has to be            the extremely clear communication amongst your own team members.            Although you cannot communicate with them, they will often give you            hints like ~there's a patrol just north of your position~.         As well as the single player game, there are also many forms            of mulitplayer - team deathmatch, king of the hill, co-operative,            capture the flag - and you are bound to enjoy at least one of            these.                    I found multiplayer extremely difficult though, and as soon as I            stepped outside my own base I was annihilated in a flurry of            bullets. But there are a large number of clans out there, so if you            fancy yourself as a sniper lurking in a shadowy corner and can            prove your worthiness, there is bound to be a place for you.                    If you enjoyed the first Delta Force, or if you like Hidden &            Dangerous type games and need something new to hold your attention            then you will almost certainly like Delta Force 2. If instead you            want to test your latest 3d card to its limits and want a fast            paced first person shooter, prepare to be disappointed.                    -                            SWAT 3 review                    SWAT 3 review                    Rogue Spear review                    Rogue Spear review            Try before you buy -            download            the Delta Force 2 demo.
