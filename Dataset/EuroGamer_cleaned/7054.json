Gospel choirs, street preachers, buxom beauties and midgets in            diapers all played their part in publicising the company's last            game, the cherubic third person action-adventure ~Messiah~.            Compared to that, ~Sacrifice~ has had a positively low key entry,            although it has been hyped almost incessantly in the press, and if            you placed every screenshot of the game which has been posted on            the web end to end, they would easily reach to the moon and back.            Obviously no game could live up to this level of hype, but is            Sacrifice a total disaster or merely a mild disappointment?                    The basic premise of the game is certainly promising enough. You            play a wizard with a murky past who finds himself in a strange            world ruled by five argumentative gods, ranging from the            tree-hugging Persephone to the evil god of slaughter, Charnel. Each            of these gods will try to lure you to help them in the series of            missions which make up the single player campaign, and you aren't            forced to follow the same god throughout, although your choices            will narrow as the plot progresses. This means that you can play            through the game over and over again, and each time it will            progress in a slightly different way, with only the central            storyline remaining more or less constant.                    Each of the five gods have their own range of spells and creatures            which will become available to you as you carry out missions for            them. For example, the god Pyro's speciality is fire - follow him            and you will gain spells varying from your basic run-of-the-mill            fireball to meteor storms and walls of flame. If you decide to            switch back and forth between different deities during the game you            will soon build up a wide range of abilities to smite your enemies            with, from earthquakes to tornadoes and fire storms.                    All of these spells are powered by mana, which can be harvested            from the various resource points around the map by summoning a            building known as a manalith, while the number of creatures which            you can command at any one time is limited by the number of souls            you have under your control. To expand your army you will need to            summon sac doctors, who can pump the souls of your fallen foes back            into their bodies, and then drag them off to your altar to be            sacrificed. The altar is also the heart of a wizard's power, and            the only way to defeat them is by desecrating their altar.                    At first sight then the game looks like a winner, with a typically            bizarre Shiny concept, an intriguing storyline, and a range of            oddball characters to interact with. But dig a little deeper and            the flaws start to show through. The biggest problem is that the            game just can't decide what it wants to be, and ends up hovering            half way between action and strategy, making a rather mediocre job            of both.                    Much of this is down to the game's third person camera system,            which seems to have been designed to make life as hard as possible.            Although you can spin, zoom and rotate your view around your            wizard, and it would have worked perfectly for a straight third            person shooter, it just isn't flexible enough for a 3D strategy            game. You can't zoom out far enough to get a clear view of the            action going on around you, and without a free roaming camera it's            impossible to tell what is happening elsewhere on the battlefield,            apart from by gazing at the tiny 2D map in the bottom right corner            of the screen.                    This means that you usually find yourself wandering around the            world with all your creatures formed up in a huge gaggle behind            you, although you will want to leave a few behind chained up to            your altar and manaliths to make sure the enemy doesn't wipe out            your resources while you are half way across the map. Once you are            into combat things tend to get rather chaotic, as the action is so            fast paced that your carefully assembled formations are soon in            disarray, and any thought of tactics goes straight out the window.            In fact, the only real way to control your troops in the heat of            combat is to pause the game while you give your orders, which isn't            very satisfying. More often that not you simply end up running            around trying to avoid enemy attacks, stopping whenever possible to            lob offensive spells at the enemy and to heal friendly troops in an            attempt to sway the battle in your favour.                    Sadly the rest of the game just seems to enforce this rather            unsatisfying style of play. The way that souls work, for example,            means that you can't send troops anywhere without you, because if            they stray too far away and then get killed enemy wizards will            steal their souls before you can reach them. Given that you start            most missions with far fewer souls than your enemies have, it is            vital that you hold on to the ones you have and capture as many as            you can from the enemy, but the only way to do this is to be with            your troops in every single battle.                    And while it takes a few seconds to summon up a sac doctor, and            several more for him to pump an enemy soul back into its corpse,            all you have to do to recover one of your own souls is to run over            it. You will often see enemy wizards whizzing around like they are            on speed, rushing through the middle of battles and picking up            disembodied souls before you can capture them. This means that            short of killing the enemy wizard (and thus forcing him to return            to his altar to regenerate) it is very hard to capture souls, which            tends to lead to a stalemate as you fight a series of pointless            skirmishes which don't give either side any major advantage.                    Even if you could afford to leave your troops to their own devices,            the AI ranges from merely infantile to downright moronic. While            some creatures (particularly trolls) will chase down enemy units            without any prompting, often running straight into an ambush in the            process, others will simply stand there and take damage from ranged            attacks without bothering to get close enough to return fire unless            you specifically order them to. The constant cries of ~your            creatures are under attack~, usually swiftly followed by ~your            creatures are dying~, soon become highly irritating...                    Apart from the story and voice acting, about the only other            department that the game truly excels in is graphics, and it's easy            to see why posting dozens of high resolution screenshots of            Sacrifice every day has become a way of life for many gaming            websites over the last year.                    The worlds over which you are fighting are beautifully textured and            covered in smooth rolling hills, towering mountains and gentle            valleys, dotted with villages, windmills and other buildings. The            effect is somewhat marred by the occasional polygon popping which            occurs as the graphics engine adjusts the level of detail of the            terrain and buildings on the fly to maintain a reasonable frame            rate, but luckily you won't have time to notice this in the heat of            combat. The sheer attention to detail is impressive as well. Rain            falls from the dark and brooding skies, flowers sprout from the            ground in the realm of Persephone, while flies buzz around the dead            lands of Charnel, and there's always something going on to keep            your attention.                    The creatures are also nicely detailed, and the third person camera            means that you have an up-close-and-personal view of them, whether            you want it or not. Animations are funny and generally very            life-like, although creatures often seem to be sliding over the            terrain rather than running across it. The game's real highpoint            though are the spell effects, which are simply spectacular. The            sight of flaming missiles raining down on the battlefield, tornados            lifting your men high into the sky, or the ground swelling up            beneath your feet as an earth wizard unleashes his magic, is            positively breathtaking.                    If only as much attention had gone into the gameplay as has            obviously gone into the graphics, Sacrifice might have been the            classic 3D strategy game which we were all expecting. As it is the            result is yet another oddball third person shooter from Shiny, with            some rather dubious strategy elements which just don't seem to gel            with the rest of the game.                    Sacrifice isn't a bad game, just frustrating. If I drop dead from a            heart attack tomorrow, it will be because of the massive increase            in blood pressure I've suffered from while playing this game. The            camera view is frustrating, the controls are frustrating, the AI is            frustrating, the resource system is frustrating, the missions are            frustrating, and above all the fact that this game isn't half as            good as we were all hoping it would be is very, very frustrating.                        -        Sacrifice                    screenshotsSacrifice                    screenshots"}
