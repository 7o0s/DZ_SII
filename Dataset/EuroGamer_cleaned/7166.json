At first it was a Michael Owen                 sponsorship, which lasted a couple of years, but then the                 price tag for that probably went through the roof, so now it's                 a UEFA deal that adorns the package.                         As soon as things kick off, there's a distinct feeling of            mediocrity, rather like the visual element of ITV's Champions'            League coverage! The short introductory video is of a low visual            quality - it's not even as impressive as last year's EA Sports            intros. The NHL '99 video with David's Bowie's accompaniment wowed            me when I first bought the console, and even watching it a year on            it I'm more inspired by it than I am by UEFA's.                         In-game, UEFA CL is nothing to get all that worked up about            either; it's fairly average Playstation fare, and nothing on a par            with the likes of Virtua Striker 2 on the Dreamcast. You can put up            with it though, and if you haven't been pleasured with the            Dreamcast's sumptuous visuals, you probably won't mind. The player            animations are the graphical saving grace for UEFA. Facial            expressions are indiscernible, but on the whole the players have an            air of realism.                         The menu options on offer to you include ~Play Game~, ~Quick            Match~, ~Options~ and ~Load Game~. The first presents you with a            sub-menu allowing you to select what sort of game you'd like to            take part in; either a Competition, a Scenario match, a Friendly or            some other games types. The ~Quick Match~ option takes you straight            to the Controller Assign screen, where you can pick one of the two            randomly assigned teams.                         My favourite option is to pick the Scenario option, which allows            you to take part in classic European encounters from 1960 right            through to the present day, including the dramatic            century-concluding Manchester United versus Bayern Munich clash.         Once you've selected the teams,                 you hit Play and after a pause for loading, your players pour                 out of the tunnel and onto the pitch. The classical Champions'                 League tune oozes out of the tinny Television speaker and the                 game begins.                         The game is handled via a simple Pass, High Pass, Kick, Power Shot            control system and from the usual sideline TV camera. Of the            players on the field, the one currently under your control is            denoted by a Star beneath his feet. From here you have several            options.                         Simple passing one-twos are completed by a pass then a knock on            from the second player involved, and you can accelerate away with            the ball by depressing the Sprint button (L1).                         You can also perform shimmies, drag balls, chip returns and other            interesting moves, which add to the fluidity of the game play. The            thing which makes football so watchable these days is the quality            of the flowing moves performed by some of the bigger International            teams. Anyone who witnessed Real Madrid's despatching of Bayern            Munich last night will know exactly what I'm talking about. True to            form, that sort of European talent can be replicated on your humble            Playstation.                         Due to the fantastic boost that sprinting gives you, Silicon            Dreams have also provided a Simulation mode option, which levels            the playing field a bit by making the players tire after a lot of            exertion. This is similar to the Simulation mode present in most EA            Sports football titles, so there's another similarity\u2026         Is UEFA Champions' League best                 described simply as a poor man's FIFA 2000, though? It takes a                 lot of the best and most popular options from EA's franchise                 and collates them into a fairly complete football title. Even                 the Scenario mode is rather akin to the classic Cup matches                 that were available to the player upon completion of EA's                 ancient World Cup '98 game.                         The commentary comes courtesy of Bob Wilson, Clive Tyldesley, and            Kevin Keegan, but it's not that impressive. Keegan and Wilson sound            stitched together and unrealistic, and Clive Tyldesley's screeching            is just plain funny, especially since most of his exclamations are            repeated often enough to make them boring. As everyone knows, while            ITV may have scooped Des Lynam for their Champions' League            coverage, for it to be worth listening to they really need the            complementary vocals of John Motson.                    Unlike the            gorgeous            PC incarnation, UEFA Champions League PSX cannot be saved by            its visual flair, since it hasn't any to boast about! While a fun            and fairly complete conversion of the ambitious PC version, it            slips into mediocrity by not offering anything particularly new            since last year. Perhaps next year Silicon Dreams may actually            introduce their own innovations to the genre, instead of relying on            EA Sports to set the trend.                        - Out Now"}
