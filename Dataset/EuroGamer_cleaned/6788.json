Now the Manhattan Project is            taking him back to those roots, with an all-new side-scrolling            action game that sports a mixture of retro gameplay and snappy 3D            graphics.                        As with most Duke Nukem games, the plot is fairly inconsequential.            A villain called Morphix is saturating New York with a radioactive            slime which is turning Manhattan's vermin (human and otherwise)            into hideous gun toting mutants. With the city's police force            rapidly turning into pig cops, it's now up to the Duke to track            down Morphix and put an end to his dastardly plan. In your way            stand hundreds of mutants scattered across eight action-packed            episodes. There are platforms to hop across, ladders to climb,            buttons to push, babes to rescue and colour coded keycards to            recover. To quote the Duke, ~someone's gonna pay for making me find            these frigging keycards~.                        The level design is generally very good, with detailed locations            packed full of secret areas to uncover, desperate leaps to pull off            and power-ups to collect. Settings range from the rooftops of            Manhattan down into the sewers and subway system, and although the            game lacks the interactivity of Duke Nukem 3D, there are plenty of            surreal moments along the way, such as a nightclub full of babes            and mutants boogying on the dancefloor, strobes flashing as Duke            leaps between the lighting rigs hanging from the ceiling. The            humour doesn't all hit the spot, but little touches like the way            Duke's health depends on inflating his ego by killing mutants and            rescuing babes make it all worthwhile.                    It's not all good news though. The spike traps that are found            throughout Morphix's underground factory are particularly annoying,            instantly reducing you to a shower of gibs, often without seeming            to touch you at all. Then there's the Frogger inspired section in            China Town, which has you fighting your way down a dual            carriageway, blowing up cars or switching between the two lanes to            avoid oncoming traffic. I guess Duke never heard of using the            pavement. Sorry, sidewalk.                        What makes this section even more annoying is the fact that you            can't see the traffic until it's right on top of you, a flaw which            afflicts the entire game. A lot of the time the developers have set            the camera too close in, nicely highlighting your character in the            middle of the screen, but leaving you with virtually no peripheral            vision. You can pan the camera around to a limited extent to see            what's waiting for you, but only while you're stationary. Other            than that your only option is to zoom in even closer, which is            completely useless unless you want to admire Duke Nukem's jawline.                        At times the game can seem almost sadistic. The fully 3D engine            means that Duke can walk in and out of the set at certain specific            points (marked by a flashing green arrow), and occasionally the            camera will curve around in a loop to track him as he edges his way            around a building or changes direction. Most of the time you're            locked onto a fixed side-to-side track though, and you're left            wondering why the game is forcing you to hop across a dozen narrow            girders under enemy fire to get back to the other end of the one            you started off on, when there's nothing obvious which would have            stopped you from just walking along it and saving yourself a lot of            time and effort. The controls are also a bit too basic,            harking back to the original shareware games and ignoring the            innovations of more recent side-scrollers like Abuse. As such the            mouse is only used for its extra buttons, and there's no way to aim            your gun except to point it straight up, which makes picking off            enemies standing on platforms a lot harder than it really should            be.                    The Manhattan Project is an entertaining if somewhat shallow and            overly simplified action game. At times it can prove frustrating,            while other sections (including many of the end-of-episode boss            encounters) are really too easy. What really spoils the experience            though is the poor camera placement, which shows off the 3D            graphics to great effect but isn't always particularly playable. At            a near budget price it's worth a look if you want some retro            side-scrolling action with the benefits of modern technology, but            ultimately it falls short of its potential."}
