Aside from the fantastic Final Fantasy X,            European gamers really only have the likes of Dark Cloud,            almost-an-RPG Square-Disney collaboration Kingdom Hearts and the            tragically under-rated Shadow Hearts to choose from - slim pickings            indeed. Of course, this picture is much better Stateside, where the            likes of Suikoden III, .hack and Xenosaga have been released, and            the lucky Japanese just got their mitts on Final Fantasy X-2 and            Star Ocean 3: Till the End of Time, but for European gamers without            the ability to play imports (or indeed speak Japanese), such            turn-based delights are still a long way off.                    Wild Arms 3, the successor to a pair of little-known but quite well            respected PlayStation RPGs, aims to fill that gap in the diet of            the ardent Japanese RPG fan. Like many other RPG series, Wild Arms            starts each game with a fresh slate - although there are hints that            this game may be set in the same world as its predecessor, you            don't need to have played either previous game in order to get            stuck into WA3. The slightly oblique references to events in            earlier games are few and far between, and you can happily sail            through the game without ever noticing them.                    Wild Arms' setting is very different to the usual swords 'n sorcery            (or technology 'n magic) backdrop employed by most RPGs. Unusually,            the theme of the series is modelled heavily on the Old West, and            from the designs of the locations to the background music, it's            clear that the team has watched rather a lot of Westerns. Of            course, this is all tempered with the usual Japanese stylistic            touches - the characters may sport spurs, six-shooters and            Stetsons, but they're anime designs through and through. (In fact,            there is a Wild Arms anime TV series, although it doesn't feature            any of the characters from the game.)        Graphically, Wild Arms 3 isn't exactly the most impressive game            to grace the PS2. The game's characters are cel-shaded, which takes            a little bit of getting used to but works quite well; however the            environments and world map are downright ugly in most places, and            indeed some of the graphics you'll see here wouldn't look out of            place on the original PlayStation. Overall, however, the graphics            are more than passable, if a bit workmanlike; what's of more            concern is the fact that the team hasn't gone to any great lengths            to create a wide range of interesting creatures to fight. In fact,            most areas in the game seem to have only two creatures, with random            battles popping up a mix and match selection of the two - not            exactly a wide or interesting menagerie.                    Ah yes, random battles. Wild Arms 3 is nothing if not a very            traditional RPG, and the random battles are certainly here in force            - although thankfully the developers have made them at least            partially optional. While strolling around dungeons or on the world            map, before a random battle occurs a small exclamation mark will            pop up over your head, and it's possible to avoid taking part in            the battle by pressing a button at this point. This costs you            points from an onscreen gauge, however, so you can't keep avoiding            random battles forever; but as your characters progress through the            game, you'll gain the ability to avoid battles with very weak            monsters without costing any points, so you can walk around areas            with weak creatures without constantly being annoyed with stupidly            easy random battles. This is a nice touch, and will certainly be            welcomed by the legions of ardent random battle haters.                    Otherwise the game is roughly as you'd expect from a competent            Japanese RPG. Each character has physical attacks (shooting the            enemy with a gun, called an ARM) and magic (Arcana) attacks,            monsters come with weaknesses to certain types of attacks... You            all know the story. This immensely rigid conformity to the            stereotypical RPG game design can grate a little - not helped by a            very clich\u00e9d story about a world threatened by a great power            in the aftermath of a war against demons, four drifters who come            together to save it and, of course, the obligatory grouchy boy with            no knowledge of his past. You're introduced to each character in            turn in four ~solo play~ sections at the start of the game, which            serve as an entertaining prologue to the main story.        This is all made            worse by the single most annoying aspect of the game - namely the            need to search for locations on the world map using a type of            radar. Locations don't show up until you're meant to know about            them, and what this generally means is that after each plot segment            you'll be given the vaguest of details about the next place you're            meant to go, and sent off to wander around the map aimlessly for            ten minutes hammering the square button in an attempt to find the            next village or dungeon. Why the developers felt the urge to            include this is beyond us; it completely breaks the flow of play            and is by far the single worst element of the game.                    Thankfully, once you get into the dungeons, things lighten up            considerably. Although the battles are turn-based, the game has            quite an interesting line in dungeon puzzles, with each character            in your party having ~tools~ which can be applied to solve puzzles            and progress through dungeons. To begin with, you get tools such as            a boomerang (for hitting switches a long way off) and a fire spell            (which can light torches or melt ice), and some of the chaining            puzzles later in the game are really quite difficult - but an            entertaining break from standard RPG fare.                    For all its flaws and its hugely traditional approach to the genre,            Wild Arms 3 has a lot to recommend it to any Japanese RPG fan. The            music and overall presentation of the game is superb, and the            combination of action RPG-style dungeons with competent, turn-based            battles is a very entertaining mixture. The game also has the            occasional surprise to spring - we were enthralled the first time            we found horses to gallop around the plains on, and were then            treated to a battle on horseback, complete with angry enemy            monsters running alongside our heroes. The traditional cel            animation ~opening sequence~, which plays each time you load a            game, is a nice touch as well - and we're very taken with the            ability to save your game at any point thanks to an unusual save            system which puts fixed save points only in villages, and elsewhere            requires that you use ~gimel coins~, which are effectively portable            single-use save points.                    Wild Arms 3 isn't for everyone by any means. If you don't like            Japanese RPGs in general, you probably don't even want to look            here; and if you're a fan of recent Final Fantasies but find older            Japanese RPGs too slow-moving and all alike, look elsewhere            (possibly at Shadow Hearts). However, if you're prepared to            overlook quite a few flaws, Wild Arms 3 is a charming and            entertaining Japanese RPG which adheres to the conventions of the            genre far too much for its own good, but will still provide many,            many hours of entertainment."}
