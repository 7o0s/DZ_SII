While game development has moved on            somewhat since the Dark Ages, every now and then a new company pops            up from the proverbial back bedroom and delivers the kind of            innovative genre-defying game that a big international publisher            wouldn't have touched with a barge pole. Enter Uplink, produced on            a shoestring budget by a tiny British team called Introversion.                        Set a few years in the future, Uplink casts you as a freelance            computer hacker, carrying out a variety of legally dubious jobs            ranging from the simple to the incredibly complex and time            consuming. One minute you could be breaking into a software            company's file server to steal data, the next trying to frame            someone for bank fraud, cripple a company with a virus attack or            track down a rival hacker.                        Jobs are usually gained via the Uplink Internal Services server, a            kind of high tech BBS where potential clients can meet and hire            unscrupulous hackers such as yourself. You can also use the server            to browse through the latest news reports, buy new software and            hardware upgrades and get helpful pointers on security systems and            basic hacking techniques from the help menu.                    Any good hack begins with a bounce. If you simply connect to a            server directly and start messing around with files you will be            traced almost instantly, which can lead to a fine or (in extreme            cases) a spell in jail and the loss of your Uplink account. In            other words, game over.                        To give your target's trace program something to think about, you            can first bounce your signal off other servers by clicking on them            on the world map. Once you're satisfied that you have enough            servers in your chain, simply finish the route with the target            server and then click connect. Assuming you bought a trace tracker            and have it running, you will know as soon as your target has            spotted your intrusion, and the beeping of the tracker as the trace            homes in on your gateway computer at Uplink helps build up an            amazing amount of tension.                        The downside to this system is that there are literally dozens of            servers in the game, and there's nothing to stop you bouncing your            signal off all of them, except for the possible onset of            boredom from the amount of clicking involved. With a little            patience you can set up a route that will give you a couple of            minutes or more to hack even the most secure of servers, and            however many times your signal gets bounced around the world, you            never experience any lag. If only the real internet worked like            that. The world map can also get rather messy if you have a lot of            servers displayed at once. Text labels can overlap, and if your            connection is being bounced off servers which you don't currently            have listed on the map screen, the labels of those that are visible            will dance around in confusion.                    Unfortunately this isn't an isolated problem, and the game has a            lot of rough edges. The various HUD elements don't overdraw each            other properly, for example, which can leave bits of a background            window poking out from underneath the active one, and the game also            includes an impressive array of typos, misspellings and grammatical            errors.                        Despite these presentation problems and gameplay niggles though,            Uplink is still surprisingly involving. The graphics are spartan            but stylish, the sound likewise, and there's something strangely            satisfying about reading a news report that a suspected hacker has            been arrested, when in fact the man is completely innocent and is            only being picked up by the police because you hacked into the            Global Criminal Database a few hours earlier and edited his            criminal record.                        The randomly generated missions are varied enough to keep you busy            for a few hours at least, and as your Uplink agent rating rises            with each successful mission you're offered ever more interesting            and dangerous jobs, with new possibilities opening up all the time.            If you get bored of carrying out preset missions you can trade on            the stock market or break into bank servers to transfer other            people's money into your own account, and there are some nice            easter eggs hidden away, such as a Protovision game server (~how            about a nice game of chess?~). Then, just as the novelty starts to            wear off, the storyline kicks in. Suddenly you have several unique            special missions to carry out for one or both sides in a battle            between rival corporations that involves a mysterious piece of            software and the death of one of Uplink's top hackers.                    Actually hacking into a server is a fairly mechanical procedure,            with the player first cracking any passwords and other security            checks, then bypassing or disabling proxies and firewalls, before            finally editing, deleting or copying the relevant data. Once you            are finished you can modify or delete the server logs to mask your            incursion or, if time is short, disconnect and then hack into one            of the servers you bounced your signal through, destroying its logs            to break the chain between you and the target server.                        Although you follow much the same process for every server you hack            into, it can still be a highly entertaining and rewarding            experience. There are enough variations in security systems,            hacking techniques and mission objectives to stop things from            getting too repetitive, and the sheer tension (particularly if you            manage to resist the temptation to bounce your signal off a hundred            other servers) is incredible.                        As you earn money from completing missions, new software can be            bought to analyse and bypass server defences, break cyphers and            passwords, decrypt downloaded data, and analyse speech to get past            voice print checks. All of which gives you access to a wider range            of servers and jobs. Faster or more numerous processors can be            bought to speed up the rate at which this software is run,            additional memory gives you more storage space for stolen data and            programs, and faster modems increase transfer rates. You can even            install a self-destruct device on your gateway computer that will            blow up the machine if somebody tries to tamper with it, which            could save you from being jailed.                    Uplink is an innovative and addictive game, a triumph for bedroom            game development. Sadly graphical glitches, a slightly awkward            interface and the rather simplistic server bouncing system lets it            down somewhat, but it's still well worth a look if you fancy            something completely different."}
