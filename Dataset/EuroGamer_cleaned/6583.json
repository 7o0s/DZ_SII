For many strategy fans, however, the shadow of one game has fallen            over everything else released last year - namely Command &            Conquer, the franchise which really started the RTS ball rolling.            After the disappointing Tiberian Sun, which promised a brand new            start for the series but delivered deeply unimpressive voxel            graphics technology and a mediocre, poorly balanced game, the team            at Westwood saw something of a return to form with Red Alert 2 -            which refined C&C gameplay to a fine art, and had one of the            slickest user interfaces of any RTS game ever made.                    The question since then has been whether the next iteration in the            franchise, Command & Conquer Generals, can bring the series            into 3D, invent a brand new timeline for it, and still retain the            polish and quality which Red Alert 2 displayed; and perhaps more            importantly, whether it can stand up to the magnificent titles we            saw from Blizzard and Ensemble last year.        The first thing that            will strike anyone who plays C&C Generals is that it's a very            good-looking game indeed. Although it lacks the detail and            character of WarCraft III, it is much more ambitious with its            graphics - aiming to recreate bustling cities and villages full of            buildings which can be occupied or destroyed, and civilians who can            be rolled over in your mighty tanks (assuming they're not clever            enough to run away screaming). The game does lack the variety of            earlier C&C titles, however, being set almost entirely in dusty            cities and villages in Asia - with the range of missions mostly            covering the land between Baghdad and Tibet.                    The units themselves are nicely detailed and quite imaginative in            places, although the focus is very heavily on land units - naval            combat is practically non-existent and air units are for the most            part painfully simplistic. Again, however, there's a singular lack            of ambition in terms of what the game can do; whereas titles from            several years ago such as the hugely underrated Dark Reign 2 let            you get right up close to your troops and watch them battle it out            with the enemy from ground level, C&C Generals is very much            focused on giving you the same perspective as you've always had in            C&C, but making it 3D and letting you rotate it. It's a valid            approach to making a 3D strategy game, certainly, but it's a little            unimaginative.                    EA Pacific, the developers behind the game (no, not the late            lamented Westwood - and it shows, as I'll explain in a moment) have            also chosen to ditch the traditional C&C live action cut scenes            and full motion video, opting instead for in-engine cut scenes to            set up the plot of each section. While this does highlight the            graphics in a good way - the explosions, in particular, are            wonderfully realised - it also removes much of the character that            was apparent in earlier games, and in places it serves to highlight            the limitations of in-game graphics as much as their potential.        Generals makes the            bold step of dropping both previous C&C timelines, setting the            game instead in the near future with an all-too-realistic wartime            situation featuring three sides - the Americans, the Chinese and a            rogue Arabic element called the Global Liberation Army, or GLA. The            original plan for the game was to have nine different generals for            the player to choose from at the beginning of the game, offering            significantly more variety to the game; in the final release, this            has been ditched in favour of beefing up the experience system seen            in earlier C&C games. Unit experience is much more important in            Generals than it was previously, with experienced units being            seriously powerful on a battlefield, while your overall experience            in the game allows you to purchase special attacks and unit            upgrades using your experience points.                    Each of the three sides in the game has unique strengths and            weaknesses, and in fact that aspect of the game is strangely more            similar to WarCraft than it is to any previous C&C title. The            Chinese are the most conventional side in the game, with strong            ground units and artillery, while the Americans have air            superiority on their side and the ability to call in supplies from            off the map. The GLA are unusual, however; although their units            aren't as powerful as the other forces in the game, and they lack            air support, their buildings regenerate if destroyed, they don't            need to generate electricity to keep things running and they can            steal supplies from destroyed enemy vehicles.                    This variety is welcome, and seems quite balanced - although the            Americans are certainly the easiest side to play as in multi-player            games, it's certainly not as unbalanced as Tiberian Sun was and we            expect to see this tweaked in patches. However, with the exception            of occasional special attacks, the fact is that the game is very            heavily oriented around tank rushes - and the majority of            multi-player or skirmish games end in a farce, as both sides race            to manufacture as many cheap tanks as possible. Most other RTS            games grew out of this habit years ago, and we're disappointed to            see it re-emerge in Generals.        In fact, tank rushing isn't the only spectre of the unpleasant            past to rear its ugly head in Generals. It's painfully obvious in            places that this isn't the same team that spent the best part of a            decade refining Command & Conquer, because while we applaud            their efforts in throwing out many of the conventions of old            C&C and introducing new gameplay, the simple fact is that the            baby is lying out in the middle of the yard along with the            bathwater. Gone is the polished user interface; welcome back crap            pathing, stupid harvester syndrome, and so many of the annoying            features of RTS games - which had been sorted out by the time Red            Alert 2 arrived.                    Formation move is gone. In fact, formations of all kinds are gone;            you can't even make basic formations by assigning light tanks to            defend artillery, for example, because the defensive behaviours are            gone, replaced with a next to useless system that sets a unit            guarding a small area of the map in the most ineffectual way            possible. Indeed, control over your units is poorer than it's ever            been; you cannot set aggression levels or pursuit distances, and in            general your troops will stand still and be slaughtered by anything            outside their range of fire.                    The useful lines which told you what a unit was doing at any given            time are gone, so when you encounter an air unit buzzing around the            middle of the map, it's anyone's guess where it thinks it's going.            This might be acceptable if the pathing of troops was good; it's            not as bad as it was in some earlier C&C games, but it's still            woeful, with armoured units wandering halfway around the map for            sport in order to get to a location a few blocks away in a city.            Units consistently get stuck on buildings and give up, although at            least they now have the sense to move out of each other's way in            narrow spaces.                    To make matters worse, basic functionality that's been in C&C            since the outset is gone. You can't rebind your keys (or at least,            if you can, it's a bloody well hidden option - we haven't been            supplied with a manual for the game, so if anyone does know where            keys can be redefined, please let us know!) and simple things like            cursor key move have disappeared, which is deeply annoying since            every other RTS game in history gets that one right. To add to this            annoyance, there are many painfully simple bugs in evidence; like            single-player missions you can't finish because there's one cloaked            stealth bomber circling around an airbase you destroyed ten minutes            ago, or American helicopter harvesters which get stuck off the top            of the map after exhausting a supply dump and can't be selected any            more, effectively rendering them lost.        The huge flaws in C&C Generals            are difficult to forgive, especially given the fact that the            single-player game is very short indeed (only seven missions on            each side) and the skirmish mode is painfully crap - displaying            some of the worst AI we've ever seen in an RTS game, and to make            matters worse, cheating like hell to make up for it. Skirmish AI            enemies are utterly, utterly stupid, but are given vast amounts of            cash to make up for it, resulting in a game which is boring and far            too easy on easy difficulty settings, and practically impossible on            hard settings - for all the wrong reasons.                    Multi-player games are more promising, and it's nice to see a            C&C game at last which has decent network code for LAN play.            However, we did also note that multi-player matches, even over a            100MBit LAN, seem to lag quite badly - almost to the point of            unplayability in places. We're not sure what causes this, but a            little experimentation suggests that the game is restricted by the            speed of the slowest machine playing - which would be more            forgivable if it weren't for the fact that neither Age of Mythology            nor WarCraft III suffered from the same problems on the same            network.                    All in all, C&C Generals is a hugely disappointing game; but            there's one further element of it, which represents the final nail            in the coffin for many, and that is the fact that the game is            pretty offensive in places. The first American mission is the            liberation of Baghdad, featuring Arabic enemies who drop            anthrax-filled Scud missiles on busy market squares in the city to            keep you out; early GLA missions include one in which you must            destroy UN humanitarian aid convoys in order to steal their            supplies, and then destroy villages where people take the aid for            themselves, followed by a mission in which you must kill at least            300 civilians with chemical and biological weapons. Oh, and your            weapons of choice include suicide bombers, tractors loaded up with            evil chemical sprays and anthrax bombs.                    Yes, we know that this isn't much worse than what the forces of NOD            used to get up to in Command & Conquer - but this time it's not            the forces of NOD we're talking about. C&C's new real-world            setting should bring with it a slightly more responsible attitude,            but it doesn't - instead we get propaganda by medium of videogames.            Perhaps this will go down well in the USA, but for us, it's left a            bitter taste in our mouths. Videogames are no place for political            statements.                    When reviewing Real-Time Strategy games like Age of Mythology, one            of the phrases we've employed a lot is ~worthy update~. Sadly,            that's not a phrase we could possibly use to describe Generals, a            game which is poorer than its immediate predecessor in every way            other than its graphics. Ultimately, we might be more taken with            Generals were it not for the fact that there are quite a few            significantly better RTS games on the shelves right now. As it            stands, the dull gameplay, horrible interface flaws and            cringe-worthy political message of the game mark it out as a wasted            opportunity, and a very black mark on the copybook of the C&C            franchise."}
