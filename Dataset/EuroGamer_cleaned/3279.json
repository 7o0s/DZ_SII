With Heroes IV the franchise has had something of a            make-over, sporting updates to both graphics and gameplay, but            sadly the changes aren't always for the best.                        Like previous games in the series, Heroes IV lets you control one            or more hero characters who wander around a map hoovering up            resources and artifacts, capturing towns and production centers,            and visiting special areas which can permanently or temporarily            boost their abilities. Maps are also dotted with neutral armies            which you must defeat to access new areas, and most missions            include one or more rival factions to see off, complete with their            own towns, resource centers and heroes.                        Which brings us to the game's biggest and perhaps most            controversial change - hero characters and rank-and-file creatures            are now treated equally. In the past your armies had to be led by a            hero, but now you can move your troops around without a leader, or            have a party made up entirely of heroes with no troops to escort            them. This means that heroes are now treated as just another unit            on the battlefield, instead of standing safely on the sidelines            lobbing spells at the enemy and using their special abilities to            boost their army's chances.                    In practice this is less flexible than it sounds, because heroes            still completely dominate the game. A small army led by a powerful            hero can easily destroy a much bigger force, as their own ability            scores are added to those of their troops.                        Because of this armies without a leader are ineffective against all            but the weakest of foes. They can't capture towns or buildings            either, which relegates them to mopping up stray resources. The            only real advantage of this new system is that you can now easily            transfer fresh troops to your heroes without having to go back to            the nearest city to collect them. This is aided by the addition of            caravans, which can move units from one city to another            automatically, or even allow you to buy troops from remote barracks            under your control and have them delivered to the town of your            choice without having to mess around visiting the barracks in            person.                        The creation of new units has been simplified as well, with a            slightly less bewildering array of options open to you. New            buildings can still be added to cities to give you access to new            types of unit, with each faction having its own unique city            graphics and selection of troops. But whereas in Heroes III you            could upgrade most types of barracks to unlock a more powerful            version of the unit generated by that building, Heroes IV does away            with this. While this reduces the choice of units on offer it does            speed up the expansion of your towns, and it's not a great loss as            the cheaper versions of units were rarely used once you had            upgraded anyway, unless you were really skint.                    This streamlining of the familiar Heroes gameplay makes the later            stages of the game far less tedious and simplifies the management            of your armies and cities. Combined with a proper in-game tutorial,            the changes help to make the game a little less overwhelming for            newcomers to the series.                        Unfortunately these benefits are soon thrown away, as Heroes IV            suffers from some familiar problems, the biggest of which is            mission balance. I found the first campaign almost ridiculously            easy, with most of the missions virtually impossible to lose, but            this is just to lull you into a false sense of security. Some of            the later campaigns proved incredibly hard even on the lowest            difficulty setting, and given that I've played through Heroes III            and its various expansion packs as well as the more recent Heroes            Chronicles mini-games, I hate to think what a Heroes neophyte would            make of these missions.                        The relegation of your heroes to standard combat units doesn't help            matters either. In previous games your heroes could only die if            their entire army was obliterated in battle. In Heroes IV your            enemy might decide, completely at random, to throw everything it's            got at one of your heroes, and there's absolutely nothing you can            do to stop them. Battlefields are still too small and cramped to            allow any real tactics to come into play, and there's no room for            your hero to run away if he comes under attack. This tends to lead            to frustrating reloading as you have to restart a battle that you            should have won, because one of your key heroes was attacked on the            first round by fast moving flying units or missile fire before you            could move a single unit.                    What makes this even more annoying is that the AI is fairly feeble            most of the time. You know that your hero's death is the result of            a random number generator buried somewhere deep inside the code            rather than part of some spectacular strategy your opponent has            dreamed up.                        Your enemy is equally inept on the campaign map, running right up            to your towns with a huge army and then turning away at the last            moment for no obvious good reason, leaving their own cities            undefended, ignoring resource centers, and generally acting like            they don't know what they're doing. Despite this they still seem to            level up their heroes and gather armies faster than you can, and            all too often you will get two or three hours into a mission only            for an all-powerful enemy hero to appear without warning from the            fog of war with a vast army at his side. Until this happens you            have no real way of knowing whether or not you're managing to keep            up with your opponent, and as some of the maps are absolutely huge,            winning missions can be a time-consuming business, even if you do            come out of the initial levelling race on top.                        And if you get sick of playing against the AI, I'm afraid I have            some bad news for you. Heroes IV has no multiplayer support.            Apparently it will be added in with a patch at some unspecified            later date, but given the drastic job cuts which recently took            place at New World Computing we might have to wait until the first            inevitable add-on pack arrives. In the meantime you will want to            download the latest patch, which fixes some nasty bugs including            skipping music and memory leaks, as well as adding an optional grid            for the battle map. This was a standard feature in Heroes III and            incredibly useful, so the mind boggles as at how NWC managed to            leave it out of the sequel.                    Heroes IV might offer prettier graphics than its predecessors,            although the unit animations are still laughable in many cases, but            the gameplay is, if anything, a step backwards. Mission balance is            still a mess, the designers still can't write decent dialogue,            multiplayer support has gone AWOL, and battles can be incredibly            frustrating now that your heroes are just another battlefield unit,            wide open to attack. The old Heroes magic is still in there, and            it's sure to provide a reasonable challenge for hardcore fans of            the series, but it's not the leap forwards for the series that we            were hoping for."}
