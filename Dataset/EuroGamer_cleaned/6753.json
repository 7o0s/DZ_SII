I wandered over the road to the local skate park            yesterday and asked whether anybody knew the difference, and they            had no idea, but presumably for someone, somewhere, it's a word            which holds some significance. Anyway, with that out of the            way it's time to talk about FreekStyle, the latest EA Sports BIG            game borne of the SSX formula. And oddly enough, it's a bit of a            freak.                         EA Sports BIG has developed a reputation for transplanting the SSX            mechanics to other extreme sports titles, and FreekStyle is no            exception. The control system is standard, with the analogue stick            used to turn and lean back and forward in the saddle, the shoulder            buttons used in combination to perform tricks in midair, and the            face buttons used to apply acceleration, brakes and a            speed-enhancing boost. Similarly, the single player game is made up            of three-stage races and trick showcases, and as you progress you            build up your character's stats and collect new bikes to ride in            competition.                         Another unsurprising tenet of FreekStyle is the game's            over-the-top presentation. Stuffed to bursting point with            aggravating skater chic, from shirtless tattoo-emblazoned youths            with bolts through their faces (which saved me the trouble) and            women in tight tops with 'attitude' to menus with fiery backgrounds            and 'freaky' button effects, it feels an awful lot like Sled Storm            and the first SSX - gritty, rough around the edges, but            deliberately so.                    On the track the visuals are nice, but by no means special - it            really does look like SSX on bikes. Circuits have one eagerly            repeated dirt texture, with darker shades indicating mud that slows            down your bike, and as usual you're shoehorned along but offered a            choice of different paths here and there if you're skilful enough            to run the gauntlet of their challenging shortcuts.                        Tracks vary in design but often appear very similar; indeed, if you            kept your eyes on the track and riders you would hardly notice the            difference between the first two - an industrial wasteland and what            appears to be a mining facility. Things start to improve as you            work your way further in. By the third circuit, you're steaming            through burning forests as they collapse and climbing mountains (a            nice reversal of SSX behaviour made possible by the bike), but            ultimately the gameplay remains constant, and this can be a            problem.                         Although it's good fun to play, you start off extremely weak. You            immediately fall to the back of the pack, and because it all moves            so swiftly compared to SSX, if you topple (which often happens as            you get used to the tricks) you're dumped to the back of the pack,            with no easy way to reclaim your position. Losing races is a            regular problem. No tutorial and an unhelpful manual leads to you            repeating the same sections over and over, and despite the length            of the courses, each race is three laps of the same circuit,            repeated three times with increasingly antagonistic AI. The first            six events in the single player campaign work like this, and you'll            end up racing the same lap as many as 15 times in most cases before            you unlock the next circuit. Without the same level of variation in            design or the docile AI on the quarter and semi-final races that            made SSX more bearable, FreekStyle quickly becomes a chore.                    The way to combat this is ~freeking out~. As with SSX Tricky,            performing and particularly combining tricks builds up your boost            meter, but it also builds up your Freek Out meter. Once full, the            little red devil's head on your HUD starts to judder incessantly,            and clutching all four shoulder buttons off a jump will switch the            game into bullet-time briefly before giving your bike a timed speed            boost. The whole screen palpitates with an impressive motion blur            effect, and you have several seconds at this high speed to get            ahead of the pack. Performing tricks here will extend the Freek Out            period instead of adding to your boost meter.                         Sadly though, Freek Out is a once-per-race thing for the most            part, and if you squander it by smacking into a tree or mistiming a            jump, you've had it. Unless you can work your way up the field            through hard graft, you've got no chance, which can be a bitter            pill to swallow. Compounding your misery is the game's feeble            collision detection and the AI's improbable ability to pip you to            the post at the last second. And unlike SSX, you need to finish            first in the main event to progress - there's no gold, silver or            bronze awarded here.                         What this all means is that FreekStyle feels too hard. And for one            reason or another, it has none of the grace of its infamous            sibling. This is made worse by the second set of six challenges in            the single player mode, which are trick showcases set in Tony Hawk            style arenas. This approach just does not work if you clutch onto            the SSX mechanics as FreekStyle does. It's a forced marriage of            game styles, and not a pretty one at that.                    The last six races are more bearable, maddeningly, requiring you to            win while totting up a certain number of points. Fair enough, but            if you make it to this stage without giving up through sheer            frustration at the combination of repetition and other depressing            game design issues then you're a better man than I am. I wouldn't            have persisted if I didn't have to - it would have gone back to the            shop long ago.                         At this stage there's no real respite from the panning for            FreekStyle. Everything starts to get on your nerves. Your character            is stronger and more able, but there's no real incentive to revisit            the earlier stages because you'll be quite sick of them. The            presentation starts to grate even more than ever, thanks to a            combination of the 'attitudes' of the riders and an annoying Yank            bellowing at you about your tricks and abilities with none of the            pizzazz of Rahzel's voiceover in SSX, not to mention the            infuriating skater music and the 'rivals' system. I'm sorry EA, but            the idea of riders gunning for one another was pretty blas\u00e9 in            SSX Tricky, and it's just another nail in the coffin here. It            should have been left for dead on the roadside.                         You could do a lot worse than to buy FreekStyle, as it continues            the trend of introducing BIG's successful formula to other means of            transportation with varying degrees of success. But it's more Sled            Storm than SSX Tricky, suffering from too much repetition and a            challenge that hops the fence of reason and squirms in muddy            trackside puddles of unfairness, linking arms with collision            detection that augments frustration rather than adjudicating            fairly. By no means a bad game, FreekStyle just needs rearranging,            some extra polish, and a bit more effort under the bonnet. As it            is, it's mostly talk, and it sounds like that kid with a board who            hassled you for money as you walked to the station yesterday."}
