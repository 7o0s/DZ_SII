Just            recently we've witnessed MechAssault and Unreal Championship, both            games whose staccato machine gun dialogue, sharp visuals and            frantic gameplay have made them obvious early choices for the Xbox            Live service. And of course where would the great, award-winning            Halo be without its many deathmatch variations?        Phantom Crash is another arena combat game, and like            MechAssault it focuses on walking hunks of customised metal, called            ~Scobees~. (Trying not to say it like ~Scooby Doo~ is a great way            to avoid feeling awkward when playing the game.) Your character is            thrust into a league with these shiny brutes and forced to try and            temper their metal by the dextrous use of circle strafing and            machine guns/missiles/lances/other weapons.                    The setting is the hollowed out metropolis of the former Japanese            capital, which rests beneath a CO2 smog caused by environmental            disasters. Abandoned in favour of a shelled-up Neo Tokyo in the bay            area with its own breathable atmosphere, the old city is the            perfect stage for the AI to wield its metallic puppets and for you            to try and vanquish them.                    Apart from climbing the Scobee combat leaderboard though, you will            have to engage in conversation with your fellow combatants and            their AI constructs (each with a different animal-based personality            - think Holly from Red Dwarf at a fancy dress party), customise,            tweak and replace your Scobee (or SV for short) and challenge for            places in higher leagues or to become ~rankers~ (basically            champions) for different areas.                    And rather like a walking, shooting Gran Turismo with Ridge Racer            plot elements, that's where it ends.        Actually though, a better simile would be Codemasters' TOCA            Race Driver, with its endless plot-based witterings and contrived            situations. Phantom Crash is also guilty of fleshing out a            perfectly simple league and championship-based competition with            oodles of unnecessary storyline, and at a cost. The presentation is            extremely Japanese, and the plot is outlined via on-screen, MGS2            codec-esque speech bubbles. For my first 45 minutes of Phantom            Crash, the sum total of my interaction with it was entering my            name, five minutes of piloting a Scobee through a bland, square            setting to learn the controls and a lot of reading.                    And the problem is that for the most part it's an obligatory read.            Unlike MGS2's 'codec moments' which you could skip through            endlessly (and thus complete the game in a handful of hours),            Phantom Crash requires you to pay attention to characters to learn            new techniques, work out where you can buy stuff, who's the best on            the circuit and so on.                    And the dialogue, however well presented, is in a form of broken            Japlish complete with occasionally redrawn manga character images            in the background to illustrate mood. You'll learn plenty about how            to treat your Scobee, but the unskippable conversations about who            fancies whom, and the reams of personal advice can quickly tire you            out. As the game operates on a day-by-day basis with a proper            league and challenge schedule, time-sensitive rules and a constant            barrage of new thoughts and opinions from your SV-riding brethren,            there's little escape from the story.        One thing you            can do is to bury your head in oily rags, overalls and elbow grease            and give your SV a good going over. You can shop for an SV from            three main manufacturers; Kojima, American Stars and Il Venturo,            and the trick is to stick to one family of products. And although            you can just buy a basic Scobee and graft new toys onto its shell,            there is also the option to roll your own, adding projectile            weapons like rocket launchers, close-quarters conversation openers            like the shotgun and medieval-style lances, and souping up your            SV's mobility with 80s-style roller feet or even hover legs.                    Once the New Yen starts rolling in from combat victories, you can            set about rebuilding your mech from scratch, and you can store            several of them in your garage complex (and buy more garages, too),            giving you plenty of options. You can even sell surplus parts to            recoup expenses.                    Fortunately, Genki has designed Phantom Crash not with mysterious            physical limitations (after all, I could simply build a mech 200            feet high with the best armour and walk all over everyone, right?)            but to emphasize that the semi-legal professional leagues have            entrance rules. They differ for the various league classes, so you            can stick to wimpy, machine gun and basic blaster-based combat for            the first few rounds and gradually work your way up through C, B            and A classes in your own time. This is a good thing, because it            gives the player a nice progressive objective (with various rankers            to usurp as well), whilst also preventing anyone from just bolting            a nuclear reactor to their SV's arm.        Nuclear reactors may be a step far, but you can tool your mech            with up to four unique weapons. On the battlefield, the analogue            sticks combine in Halo-like fashion to achieve movement, you can            strafe-dodge quickly with the black and white buttons, and you can            boost up briefly using X (and boost back down quickly by pressing            it again in mid-air). Meanwhile, left and right triggers control            your left and right arm weapons (e.g. a lance and a machine gun),            whilst the Y and B buttons handle your shoulder-mounted offerings            (e.g. rocket launcher).                    You can also camouflage yourself. The technology is considered            frail, but as long as you don't take a hit and your power doesn't            burn out then you can remain cloaked, sheathed in a Predator-esque            veil of heat haze - very useful in combat, and arguably the most            beautiful in-game effect.                    And the combat in Phantom Crash is mostly excellent, too.            Considered use of your various weapons (using rockets to force the            enemy to boost into the air and then machine gunning them, for            instance) is very valuable. Combined with lots of circle strafing            and an eye for camouflaged SVs, you can be almost certain of a            decent result. The AI does a good job of controlling your            competition, piloting them around the landscape, tucking them away            in nooks and grannies to ambush you and giving them enough            path-finding AI to track you behind two skyscrapers, past a            dilapidated church and through a pile of armour pick-ups.                    Combat isn't perfect though, for several reasons. First of all,            encounters drag on for far too long, with enemy forces replenished            by constant reinforcements. Of course it's a free-for-all, but that            doesn't seem to stop them ganging up. And although you can            differentiate between skill level by the colour of their health            bar, it's still more or less impossible to avoid engagement in PC's            cramped arenas. And that's the second problem - despite claims of a            whole cityscape, ala MechAssault or even Murakumo, PC's levels are            square-edged playpens with half-ruined buildings and crumpled            masonry spread around.                    After a while boosting over small buildings, hiding in dark corners            and jumping off usefully placed ramps, you won't be able to escape            the feeling that you're trapped in a virtual sandpit, and you and            your opponents are just toying with one another. The peculiar lives            structure, which sees you come back at a cost even when dead (often            having benefited to the tune of many thousands of dollars anyway),            means that there's no real urgency to the gameplay either. Fun            though it is to boost around duking it out with the AI, the vast            storyline and its disengaging presentation aren't really enough to            keep you playing.        All of which brings us to Phantom Crash's most fundamental flaw            - it doesn't support Xbox Live. Now it might seem harsh to            criticise it so heavily for the absence of a            just-this-second-launched feature, but we've played MechAssault            online and it really is fantastic. Add to that that MechAssault            looks much sharper than Phantom Crash with much more detail and            less bland grey texturing, the fact that its arenas are much bigger            and the way the single player game is the action-packed Splinter            Cell to Phantom Crash's Japlish text-heavy Metal Gear Solid 2, and            there's only one way to put it.                    As a game for single players who frequently find their friends            seated beside them, pad-in-hand, Phantom Crash and MechAssault sit            very closely together. Both trade on largely the same premises, but            PC offers more depth of customisation. Meanwhile, MA delivers a            greater ferocity of gameplay and arguably a much wider variety of            mechs. And once your mates have departed the split-screen arena,            both games offer fun, challenging single player games.                    But MechAssault offers a proper, growing narrative with villains            and multiple objectives. At times, Phantom Crash feels like Quake            III Arena without the online segment, and endless deathmatching            won't last you forever.                    If you need to own an Xbox mech game, but haven't made your mind up            yet, then you need to consider a couple of things: firstly, do you            have, or do you intend to get Xbox Live? If the answer to that            question is 'yes', then MechAssault is your only option. If no,            then ask yourself whether you want a short Western sci-fi with a            great split-screen multiplayer, or one big, ongoing Japanese            botmatch with mech customisation and a long, detailed story. With            all that out of the way, you should be in a good position to pick a            mech. Us? Sorry, but we'd take MechAssault.
