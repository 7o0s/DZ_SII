We'd take one team of footie-playing 13-year-oldsfrom any playground in the country and put them up against the bestteam that the English Premiership has to offer. You might thinkthat's bit of a one-sided contest. And you'd be right. The PremierLeague players would get whupped. There's no team harder in itsdefence, tougher in it's tackles or more vicious in its attacksthan a group of teenaged schoolkids. Think about it; you've got thecrazy kid in goal, the one who'll dive flat out to save a shot,knowing full well he's going to land on the tarmac and gritplayground. There are the feet-first tackles in the rain andpuddles and may God have mercy any player who gets trapped with theball in the corner of the playground. Then there's the ball controlitself; given that most matches take place with a tennis ball, anyone of these kids would be past John Terry before you could say~nutmeg~.It's clear, when seen from this perspective, then, how the sportof Speedball came about. Get two teams of sevenhard-as-nails nutcases, wrap them up in armour, give them a metaltennis ball, a hard playground surrounded by walls and then letthem go nuts. There's no pretence at subtlety; just pick up theball and run. And don't get mown down by the opposing defence. Itsounds simple and it is. But it's also utterly, utterly brilliant.Games are frantic affairs as you try and score goals by hurling theball past the opposing goalkeeper, and bonus multipliers areavailable by flinging it at the pinball table-inspired furniturelittering the arena.It's an idea that the famed Bitmap Brothers (if you don't know,ask your Dad) came up with back in the late 80's and this,Speedball 2 Brutal Deluxe, is a perfect copy of the gamethat sold millions on the old Amigas, Ataris and Megadrives of ouryouth. But you don't need to be familiar with the game's past toenjoy its present. The visuals are terrific; they're certainly notflashy but they work, and work well. The sounds are meaty and thecontrols are what the term ~pick up and play~ was coined for. Youmove with the joypad on your phone and throw/pass the ball andperform tackles by pressing '5'. There's nothing else to it, whichenables you to fully enjoy the action, tactics and strategy.Because aside from the on-pitch action, you can also captainyour team (the titular Brutal Deluxe) up the ranks of theSpeedball league. With 15 other teams to fight through, it'sa challenging prospect. You have some help, though, as when youplay and win you earn money, which can then be spent on improvingyour players' speed, strength, agility and other such abilities.You can also trade players, sign new ones and generally be everybit the guv'nor.Buy this game and it'll be one you come back to time andtime again, it really is that good. There are few other games thatwe can think of that offer as much value for money or long-termplay appeal, even though your average match will last little longerthan 5 minutes. But that just stands as testament to Speedball2's brilliance.NB: The original version of this review detailed a Bluetooth mode, which was subsequently removed by the publisher before the game was finally released.
