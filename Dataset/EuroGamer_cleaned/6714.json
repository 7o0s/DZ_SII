But can the ageing            Duke deliver the goods necessary to trounce Ecks Vs. Sever and            dominate Doom?        Naturally, the plot is complete guff. Duke has been            hired by the army (the army!) in order to foil a covert            alien operation to, you know... take over the world and stuff.            Teleporting on board an alien spacecraft, it's from here that Duke            sets off on his mission to kick ass and chew bubblegum. And yes,            he's all out of bubblegum - don't tell me you didn't see that one            coming?                    Controlling Duke is a pretty simple affair, with strafing attached            to the shoulder buttons, movement on the D-pad and looking/jumping            on A/B. The only button combinations we needed to remember were for            weapon switching and looking up and down, the latter of which            you'll probably never even need to use. Aiding him on his crusade            is the usual complement of FPS-staple weaponry; a pistol, shotgun,            super-shotgun (or ~lead cannon~ as it's known here), rocket            launcher and pipe bombs. In addition there are the comedy sci-fi            weapons like the freeze and shrink rays, the latter of which forces            your foe into a piddly state, ready for you to stomp on.                    ~So far, so familiar,~ you must be thinking. Well, yes, but then            that's what makes Duke Nukem Advance such an enjoyable little game.            The nineteen brand new missions represent pretty much what we liked            about the original Duke Nukem 3D, albeit sans strippers, in a whole            new set of levels. It's a tongue-in-cheek jaunt through a decent            variety of imaginatively designed maps.        The underlying Build engine, which we have            such fond memories of tweaking and toying with on the PC, appears            more or less unchanged as well, although bullet holes and            destructible scenery have been stripped away to keep the poor            little GBA happy. The texturing is of a generally high standard,            though, and the enemy sprites are just how we remember them - and            trust us, they look a lot better in motion than they do in the            screenshots!                    Even the classic theme tune has been brought across along with a            few of Duke's pithy catchphrases. Chuckling away as he grumbled            ~Let's rock!~ we began to appreciate why Duke Advance stood head            and shoulders above Ecks Vs. Sever and even Doom in the fun stakes            - it doesn't take itself too seriously.                    Developer Torus isn't kidding itself that this is anything but an            opportunity to traipse through nineteen levels blasting away at            random enemies and finding keycards, and to that end they've            created a comfortably-paced and well designed addition to the Duke            legacy. Throw in a four-player Dukematch mode - always a laugh -            and we have the best first person shooter on the GameBoy Advance to            date.                    Frankly, Duke Nukem Advance surprised us. What appeared at first to            be a slapped together run-of-the-mill cash-in has instead turned            out to be a very entertaining little title. It breaks no new ground            in gaming conventions, and it wont keep you playing for months, but            it looks good and it plays well, which is more than can be said for            some of its competition. Hail to the King, baby!                            Duke Nukem Advance screenshots                    Duke Nukem Advance screenshots"}
