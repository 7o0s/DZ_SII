If you are active within the gaming                 scene you have no doubt heard of Turbine's latest addition to                 the genre, Asheron's Call.                    If you are new to this genre, let me explain how Asheron's Call            works... First you have to create a hero who will be your            adventurer in the world of Dereth, choosing one of seven            professions for your character. You can also personalize your            character's look, with over 100 million combinations to choose            from.                    His or her attributes and skills are typical for a character in            that profession, but as you play you gain experience points from            fighting monsters, and these allow you to raise these attributes            and skills.                    Before you can enter the huge world of Dereth though you have to            sign up at Microsoft's online service, ~The Zone~. After you have            registered you get the first month for free, but after that it            costs $9.95 per month to play this game. This is probably the only            downfall with these type of games...         The game features some very detailed graphics - most of the            environments are very realistic, and the climate changes depending            on where you are located. There are plenty of different            environments in the game - mountains, swamps, forests, deserts,            wastelands, and various dungeons.                    Gameplay is solid and open-ended - the entire game is based around            adventuring, improving your character, and making friends.            Asheron's Call features an advanced allegiance system to help you            with the last, allowing you to join various monarchs (guilds) who            will help you if you ever need anything.                    You can also swear allegiance to any character of a higher level,            at which point you become that player's vassal .. but not for free            of course. Usually your patron will provide you with anything you            need (money, armor, weapons etc) and help you out.                    If you prefer not to swear allegiance to anybody then you can            instead make ~fellowship~ with other players, which basically means            that you share experience points from your adventures.                    Be advised, do not join and leave monarchs all the time as it costs            you experience points. The first time you join a monarch it doesn't            cost you anything, but the more you join the more experience points            it will cost you.         Another of the game's features is that the                 developers can go in and change almost everything, from adding                 in new monsters to completely changing the world.                    For example, at the end of the Asheron's Call beta they decided to            end the world with a big bang. There was a meteor coming closer all            the time, until it finally hit the world and everything was erased.                    There were new enemies too, including flaming creatures (ranked            level 5 and upwards) which could be found all over the world.            During the beta, I bumped into one of these flame creatures called            Inferno (level 123!) and it pretty much ripped me apart.                    And during December Turbine changed the weather from a hot summer            to a cold and chilly winter, complete with snow.                    This is one of the things that keeps you interested - when you next            login there might be completely new monsters to kill, or the world            could have changed drastically while you were away.         Well, not quite.                    The sound is one of the game's biggest downfalls. The screams from            the monsters when they die sound bad and are really annoying,            though some of the sound effects are actually quite good, such as            birds singing, blades swinging etc. Still, Turbine could have            polished some of the sound effects a lot more to increase the sense            of realism.                    It also lagged terribly for me, and the worst part is that the            monsters still attack you while you are lagging. This means that            when your connection recovers you might be dead. And when you die            you loose something from your inventory, as well as getting a nasty            5% reduction in your skills.                    Asheron's Call is also very addictive - I sat down and told myself            that I was only going to play for an hour, but after I finished            playing I noticed that I had been playing for over four hours,            which pretty much explains that I'm hooked...                         Unfortunately Asheron's Call is only available in Canada and                 the USA at the moment, and I had to import my copy from                 America and play on their servers. It is still unknown when                 the game will hit Europe. I've heard several rumors pointing                 to a March release, but best wait for the official                 announcement.                    Asheron's Call is a great game with wonderful graphics and awesome            gameplay, but it is a bit expensive. First you have to pay $40 for            the game, and then you have to pay $9.95 a month for playing it.                    If you have the money then I certainly recommend this game, but I            also advise you to have a lot of free time, because otherwise this            game will destroy your social life.                    If you like Role-Playing Games then you will love Asheron's Call,            you will make a lot of friends, and the more you learn about the            game the more you will like it."}
