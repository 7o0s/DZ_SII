Also known as Palomino in some quarters, technology-wise            Athlon XP isn't the jump from the original Athlon that the Pentium            4 was from Pentium III, but it still beats off its main competitor.                         Athlon XP is likely to appeal to the average consumer for several            reasons. For starters it's much faster than its rivals, beating            every other desktop processor on the market hands down - the            1.53GHz part performs well in excess of Intel's 2GHz Pentium 4.            Moreover, you don't have to break the bank to get hold of one. If            you own a KT133A motherboard or any of the present DDR motherboards            on the market, you can expect a relatively painless upgrade to            Athlon XP. Some boards will require a BIOS update, but many recent            boards recognize the chip without any messing around. And the            processor itself is barely half the cost of a Pentium 4.                         For AMD though, the battle is not yet won. It has beaten Intel in            the laboratory, as we will soon discover, but standing in the way            of success is a very tricky marketing dilemma. How do you explain            that your processor operates at a lower speed, retails for a            fraction of the price of its main competitor, and yet outperforms            it? Joe Gamer isn't going to swallow that. AMD's answer is PR            ratings. These have had a lot of negative press lately, but they            are the logical answer to the riddle.                    Processor performance is gleaned from the amount of work done per            clock cycle, multiplied by the total number of cycles per second.            The key to the Athlon XP's success is that it gets an awful lot            more work done per clock than the original Athlon, which in turn            does a darn sight more than the Pentium 4.                         PR ratings are there to advise the consumer how much more work the            processor does compared to the original Athlon. A 1.53GHz chip for            example is being called an Athlon XP 1800+, because AMD feel its            performance is equivalent to an Athlon running at 1800MHz, if such            a thing existed. The PR ratings you will notice have dropped MHz            and GHz tags altogether. This is because AMD believes the average            consumer finds these confusing. Athlon XP is being introduced at PR            ratings of 1500+ (1.33GHz), 1600+ (1.4GHz), 1700+ (1.47GHz) and            1800+ (1.53GHz).                         The other question of marketing was how to sell the Athlon XP as a            'new' processor. It uses the same basic technology, it looks the            same, it even costs virtually the same. What makes it worth owning?            To this end AMD have quantified all of XP's improvements into one            inexplicably clich\u00e9d marketing device: AMD Athlon XP with            Quantispeed Technology. What is Quantispeed technology? The ability            to execute nine things at once as opposed to Intel's six, using new            super scalar microarchitecture; a super scalar fully pipelined            floating point unit; and the ability to get data in faster using            Translation Lookaside Buffers and hardware data pre-fetch. In            English? More bang per buck. And Athlon XP also introduces 3Dnow!            Professional, 52 new instructions that help to keep things faster            than a Pentium 4, with full SSE compatibility.                    That about wraps up the marketing side of things. When we first            heard about Athlon XP though, the questions we wanted to answer            were to do with cooling, power consumption and performance. In            recent times, AMD has made some very hot processors. Puns aside,            Athlon has been known to fry before the anxious owner knows            anything about it. Snag your fan's power cable between chip and            heatsink (something everyone's done now and again) and the chances            are that your new chip will give up the ghost in very short order.            A leading hardware journalist even fried a few Athlons in front of            the camera to show just how dangerous they can be.                         The good news is, AMD have faced this problem head on and come out            smiling. This also leads us on to the other point; power            consumption is some 20% lower than for the original Athlon, which            means that the chips don't get quite as hot. In actual fact, we            found that in the day to day running of our test machines, the            Athlon XP was actually cooler than a Pentium 4. This means less            vigorous active cooling is required (say goodbye to that 7000RPM            fan), and aside from that the chips also now know to react to rapid            temperature changes by slowing themselves down to a crawl or            switching off completely instead of simply carrying on until they            melt. By taking advantage of the new thermal diode, which will            appear on forthcoming XP-compatible motherboards, consumers can be            assured that if the worst should happen and that heatsink clip            flies off, their processor will compensate.                    Ultimately though, the important question for consumers is whether            Athlon XP is a belter or not. Whether it can kick sand in the eyes            of Pentium 4 and spit on its predecessors. Whether it lives up to            those PR ratings. Well, we feel that it does. As you can see from            our dramatic benchmark results, Athlon XP outperforms its rivals by            a big margin.                        We used SiSoftware's Sandra 2001 benchmark suite to test the            performance of the CPU and memory subsystems, and we also used            tests like 3DMark 2001 and the ailing Quake 3 to measure gaming            performance, along with newer games such as Return to Castle            Wolfenstein, which push your computer harder. We used a GeForce 3            Titanium 500 in all our gaming tests to ensure there were no            bottlenecks in the graphics system. Apart from that, we tried            encoding an MPEG4 movie, and finally we had a bash at overclocking            the processor. Enjoy the            graphs.                         Overclocking isn't especially dangerous these days. If a chip            doesn't want to run at a particular speed it won't, and perhaps you            will have to reset your BIOS options. Otherwise, it's analogous to            running - you can often run a lot faster than you generally do, but            the harder you push yourself the more likely you are to have            trouble sustaining it. That said, you don't often have to pencil            links to run, but you do with the new Athlon XP. Our chip, an            XP1800+, running at 1.53GHz by default, was able to achieve an            extra 100MHz or so, but we made no real effort to sustain anything            higher than that. It's safe to say that there is some headroom.                    Is the Athlon XP the sort of processor one should be looking out            for this Christmas? The benchmarks really speak for themselves. If            you are in the market for a new processor, wait a month or so and            buy yourself one of these. The chances are it works on your old kit            too. A festive upgrade doesn't have to mean the entire computer,            and based on our experience with it, the Athlon XP is a darn sight            better than the alternative.                        -        AMD                    Athlon ~Thunderbird~ reviewAMD                    Athlon ~Thunderbird~ reviewAMD                    Athlon 1.33GHz reviewAMD                    Athlon 1.33GHz reviewAMD                    Athlon using DDR SDRAM reviewAMD                    Athlon using DDR SDRAM reviewAMD                    Duron reviewAMD                    Duron reviewPerformance                    Memory ShowdownPerformance                    Memory ShowdownKT133A:                    Performance for LessKT133A:                    Performance for LessApril's                    Marching MotherboardsApril's                    Marching Motherboards"}
