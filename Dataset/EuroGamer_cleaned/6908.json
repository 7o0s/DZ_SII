It just showed up as a demo in a stack of demos,            and happened to be the game I chose to play on a rainy afternoon.            It's taken three years to get the sequel ready, but my patience has            paid dividends. In fairness to Spanish developer Pyro Studios,            three years isn't that long to wait for a game in this industry,            and given that it took me about nine months to wrap up the first            game, and there was a mission pack, the intervening period            wasn't even that long.                         The problem with truly great games though, is that you hang on            every word, every screenshot and every glimpse you can get of the            game. Every time Eidos unleashed another slew of screenshots I            found myself lusting after the sequel, wanting ever so much just to            sink my teeth back into the nit and grit, the trademark engrossing            gameplay of Commandos. So it does feel like we've been waiting a            long time. The good news is that for Commandos fans the game has            certainly been worth the wait, and it's as intimidating and            downright insurmountable as before, if not more so.                         The game draws on plenty of movies to bring you the ultimate            'behind enemy lines' experience, and fans of films such as Where            Eagles Dare and Saving Private Ryan will spot a number of            references. The world Pyro Studios have built for the sequel is            very believable, and as you guide your tiny task force of allied            operatives deep into enemy territory, you truly appreciate how much            more challenging and sophisticated an experience Commandos 2 is            compared to its predecessor.                    The maps themselves are equally believable. At first sight the            screenshots we have been peering at for the last three years look            decidedly similar to the original game, but the difference is in            the detail. The levels are still pre-rendered, but everything is            minutely detailed right down to the door handles and bits of            rubbish littering the streets of a sacked French town. The            character models are in 3D this time around, and rotate and scale            beautifully. It's actually quite interesting to note just how well            Pyro have modelled them despite the overhead viewpoint. Getting the            look of movement right from the side is hard enough, let alone from            four separate isometric viewpoints.                         All this said, there are only ten main missions in the game.            Whereas Commandos offered a number of smaller missions to get you            started, the sequel offers only a couple of (supposedly helpful)            tutorial missions, but really it assumes that you will be hooked            from the get go, chucking ten extraordinarily complex and exciting            missions at you for the single player game. You start out with your            team of operatives already entrenched under cover with an enormous            list of objectives. These can include just about anything from            sabotaging warships and other vehicles to assassinations and            intelligence duties. The game will take perhaps forty or fifty            hours to overcome if you don't rush things, and that's despite the            relatively small number of missions on offer.                         Once you have completed the game once you will want to go through            it a few times on higher difficulty levels too, although you might            want to pace yourself! The higher difficulty levels help the guards            to react quicker, and feature different volumes of activity and            such, and frequently this means changing your strategy. Things are            difficult regardless though - there is no 'easy' mode. The closest            thing is the tutorial mode, which offers little or no actual            guidance, but just gives you fewer objectives. By assuming that            players know the score already, Pyro have made Commandos 2 a little            frustrating for the newcomer, and that's going to give them            trouble, particularly in the PlayStation 2 version, but if you're            prepared to hold off on drawing your own conclusions for a couple            of hours while you get the hang of things, your patience will be            rewarded.                    Commandos 2 is essentially just a bigger and better version of the            original, but then sequels aren't supposed to innovate; they are            supposed to quench the thirst for more. They do everything bigger -            more explosions, more characters, more missions, more story. It's            the same for movies. This isn't a stereotype; it's a simple,            logical facet of every sequel. Commandos 2 doesn't try to pretend            it's something it's not, but everything it does is better than the            original game and there's more of it, and that's why it's so good,            and why fans of the series won't be disappointed.                         Take the cast, for example. In the first game you only had a            handful of operatives, but this time around there are new faces at            your disposal who will prove essential to certain missions. On the            one hand you have your Green Beret, the strength and skill of the            outfit, with his trusty knife for dispatching guards; and a deadly            marine capable of knife-throwing and other interesting methods of            waste disposal. Then there is the sapper, a demolitions expert            perfect for causing a ruckus when it's most needed; your mechanic,            who can hotwire any vehicle; your spy, capable of disguising            himself as the enemy; a sniper; and your typical female secret            agent. New additions include a thief who can sneak in and out of            the deadliest of situations without harming a hair on himself; and            a bull terrier, to help distract your enemies when you need to get            yourself out of a hole.                         Although there is always some way to complete an objective, Pyro            Studios have done an excellent job of masking this by giving you            such a limited set of skills, weapons and other equipment that you            do feel like someone with his back up against the wall. You have            plenty of strategic options when you first start out, but which is            the right one? And which one fits your resources? It's a Blue            Peter-esque balancing act at times. You may have a plan, but can            you really make it work, or are you missing something vital to your            success?                    Just like the original, things can take a turn for the worst            easily, but unlike the original that doesn't mean tracing your            steps back to whichever deadly situation got the better of you.            Commandos was often criticized because most puzzles effectively had            only one solution, and once you had found it you just tried it over            and over again until it came off. With Commandos 2, you could be            walking into a trap the whole time - you can take nothing for            granted - and if something goes wrong you needn't necessarily go            over the same process repeatedly. You could just try another door,            so to speak.                         Strategically though, Commandos 2 shares a lot with its            predecessor, and you still have to case the joint if you want to            succeed. Every single guard needs to be carefully noted if you want            to make your way through to the objective. Pyro never bothered with            the fog of war, because that could never work. As such, you spend            most of the time just staring at the screen trying to piece            together the routine needed to overcome your enemies and steal your            way through to the objective. The tension doesn't come from            something silly like a ticking clock, it's born in the pit of your            stomach just before you go to work. Before you step out into the            open.                         The only thing that caught me off-guard in Commandos 2 is the            multiplayer mode. What genius. If you can find someone as fanatical            about the game as yourself, get together and play Commandos 2            co-operatively. There is nothing to match the joy of completing a            mission in Commandos 2, except perhaps completing it as a team. Try            it with your girlfriend, she'll find you irresistible for weeks.            (Note: actual results may vary.)            Commandos 2 is a resounding success on all counts. It looks better,            it sounds better, it offers you more strategy and single player            game time than the original did, it takes longer to complete, it            has a multiplayer mode and it boasts unparalleled replay value            which forces you to think laterally about the same situations            because of guards with increased alertness. This will probably see            you through until next year, so if you have been looking for this            winter's killer application on PC, pull up a chair and ration            yourself some cocoa. It's going to be a long haul.                        -        Commandos                    2 PC screenshotsCommandos                    2 PC screenshots                    Commandos 2 PS2 screenshots                    Commandos 2 PS2 screenshots"}
