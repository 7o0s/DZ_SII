I reject the terms ~made me soil my            pants~ because frankly even if it did make me do that, I wouldn't            class it as a term of endearment. But still, the game was a moment            of clarity for developer Rebellion, who beforehand frankly nobody            had ever heard of. Presumably because Rebellion are now busy            milking their own headline grabber, 2000AD, Fox have chosen instead            to farm the production of the PlayStation's own scarefest off to UK            lovelies Argonaut.                         Obviously a game based on the Alien franchise needs to thrive on            tension; it's all that fans of the series know and expect. If, for            instance, the guys and gals at Argonaut had come up with a resource            management game about colonizing a planet, that would have gone            down rather like a big lump of lead in a pile of particularly soft            feathers. In order to replicate Rebellion's success, Argonaut            should have sat down with the Alien movies, a pen and paper and            gone through them considering just how best to fuse tension,            excitement and the rather limited PlayStation format. However they            clearly hadn't considered the possibility that one can go too far            with frightening the player, and have done just that.                         Alien : Resurrection, even if played with the lights on and            Teletubbies music in the background, is capable of frightening the            life out of you. If you sit down in the pitch black with headphones            on and a widescreen TV, the best you can hope for is to walk away            sweating with adrenaline pumping wildly through your veins. At            worst, well, some sort of cardiac arrest seems on the cards..                    It's just so bloody scary! The Alien films were shocking at times,            not so much in their depiction of the subject matter, but in the            way they built up a wall of tension then smashed their heads right            through the middle of it. By bombarding your ears with musical            apprehension and gradually leading you toward a climactic splatter            of fear they gripped you (while you gripped the edge of your seat)            and actually made for some very entertaining cinema. In contrast,            you are actually taking part in this adventure, and with every step            you take you're just building up to the next fright.                         An Alien game needs to, in my opinion, provide anxious gameplay a            lot of the time, then frenzied but thrilling battle scenes with the            big bastards when the time comes. Rather like the film of the same            name, your objective as Ripley is to escape from a doomed starship,            which plays host not only to you and your companions (who have            their own playable levels later on), but also to hordes of the            wall-climbing, acid-bleeding, seven-foot tall monsters. Starting            off with what can only be described as the equivalent of Quake II's            ephemeral ~pea shooter~, a gun which will soon be relegated to the            back of the inventory, you set out to get out, alive if at all            possible.                    Unfortunately, although Argonaut have grasped the concept of            tension (I shortened my life by several years playing this game I            fear), they haven't found a good way of making use of the            PlayStation's control pad. The Dual-Shock thumbpad isn't anywhere            near as responsive as a mouse can be on the PC and to add insult to            injury, the programming tends to try and ~help~ you by            compensating, and it does exactly the opposite. Shots fly all over            the place, and it's not until the nasties are physically in your            face that you start scoring some hits. Thanks to a bug in the            collision detection code, you can actually hold your gun through            the aliens when up close, too, so you end up missing shots at less            than a metre.                         Tracking the aliens as they dart around the screen is also a total            no-goer. I'm told the PlayStation mouse is slightly more accurate,            but how many gamers can claim to own one of those?                    Eventually you manage to get some sort of handle on the flimsy            controls and start to make some belated progress, and this gives            you the opportunity to take in the game for once, and what a            beautiful artistic achievement it is. For a PlayStation game, this            is quite an accomplishment; the weapons feel as though you're            hanging onto them, your head bobs credibly and as you sneak around            trying not to get pulverized you feel very alone and very scared.            The level of tension and anxiety when entering a new room is            unparalleled, even by Rebellion's seminal AvP. Thanks to the            voracity of your surroundings and the richness of the textures the            game really feels lived-in - you don't just know that the aliens            are out there, you can sense it in the milieu.                         Aurally, the intensity and authenticity is sublime. Every sound            bite and effect has clearly been lifted straight from the Fox            library, but everything fits, and the spine-tingling screams and            metallic ambience act as a constant reminder that you are trapped            inside the deep space equivalent of the frying pan. Although            throughout your conversations with the group no lines are actually            spoken, things are very believable.                         It's a shame that the whole game isn't simply a case of waiting to            catch a glimpse of the ferocious beast as the original film was.            Indeed, that might have worked better, with the final stunning            encounter a suitable climax, but regrettably the actual action is            very disappointing. The aliens are scripted to do certain things,            but have no discernible AI. They couldn't give a toss whether            you're emptying a clip into them, they just suck it up until they            can no longer. It's the unfortunate lid on a can of worms Argonaut            and Fox will want to try and forget about.                    With no real plot other than escape and a horrible, inconsistent            and very inaccurate control system, Alien : Resurrection is dead in            the water. The sense of tension and excitement leading up to each            encounter is unequalled elsewhere, even in the influential Aliens            Versus Predator, but you can buy the films on tape or DVD for a few            quid more, and with that you get tension, excitement and none of            the flaws so evident in Resurrection. In fact, that's what I'd            recommend you do."}
