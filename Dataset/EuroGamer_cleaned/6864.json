Mix in two decks of            Magic : The Gathering. Garnish with an impressive 3D graphics            engine, add a liberal sprinkling of eye candy, toss in a bag full            of freakish looking monsters and then simmer for eighteen months.            Et voila, Etherlords.                        On paper it sounds like a great concept, combining the addictive            turn-based strategic gameplay of the Heroes games with the equally            addictive card-based tactical battles of Magic. As usual in this            kind of game you begin each mission with one or more hero            characters which you guide around a map of the world dotted with            resources, buildings and monsters. Some of these buildings will            provide you with resources each turn, while others boost the            abilities of your hero, or allow you to spend your resources on            buying more powerful spells for them to use. These spells come into            play when you attack a monster or enemy hero. Rather than taking an            army of creatures around with you, as you would in Heroes or Age of            Wonders, in Etherlords you summon new creatures for each battle            using the deck of spell cards you have amassed.                        Each of the game's four unique races has its own set of cards,            which sadly can't be mixed. Some of these conjure up bizarre            looking monsters, from your run of the mill kobolds and giant rats            to ornate mechanical lifeforms and insect-like mantids, while            others can be used to enhance the abilities of the creatures            already under your control or to weaken the enemy. The wide range            of cards included in the game gives you plenty of scope for            creating your own fifteen card decks, especially once you take into            account the fact that some creatures will boost the abilities of            similar monsters under your command. It's all very bewildering at            first sight, and you may want to indulge in a few practice duels to            learn the ropes before you dive into the game's main campaign.                    And this is where things start to break down. Put simply, the            campaign missions are far too hard, and from about the third            mission onwards most people will be struggling to stay alive, let            alone to win. However quickly you move your heroes around the            world, the enemy always seems to have the upper hand when it            finally emerges from the fog of war.                        This problem is made worse by the fact that the difficulty settings            simply don't work. Whichever of the five levels you choose to play            on, the enemy will always behave in exactly the same way and            usually end up with a hero which has more experience and better            spells than your own, making them very tough to defeat. All you can            do is focus on developing one hero as rapidly as possible and hope            you can keep up. If you succeed you kill the enemy's lead hero and            the rest of the mission is mopping up. If you fail the enemy            slaughters your lead hero and all you can do is quit and start            again from an old save game.                        In fact, the only thing which your choice of difficulty setting            actually changes is how tough your encounters with neutral monsters            are, which is helpful in the early stages of a mission but not            really enough to make the campaigns playable for less experienced            gamers. And to make matters worse, you can't even carry your heroes            from one mission to the next as you would in Heroes of Might &            Magic - every time you have to start out from scratch, which            quickly becomes irritating as you fight the same low level monsters            with the same low level spells, desperately trying to gain            experience faster than your opponent.                    Conversely, the stand-alone missions are far too easy on any            difficulty setting, thanks to the weakness of the AI. Missions            revolve around castles; destroy an enemy castle and their faction            is removed from play, lose your own and it's game over. Which would            be fine, except that your opponent is utterly incapable of either            defending his own castle or attacking yours. Often they ignore your            heroes entirely and carry on hoovering up resources or attacking            neutral monsters as if you weren't there at all, which makes most            of the single missions a walkover.                        Your enemy also seems to be remarkably reluctant to use any of the            shops scattered around the map to buy new spells for his heroes in            the stand-alone missions, which makes them very easy to defeat once            you've built up your own deck, even if they have managed to            out-level you. The AI doesn't have this problem in campaign            missions (quite the opposite in fact - enemy heroes build up            powerful decks frighteningly early on), so either the game is just            plain broken or the AI cheats in the campaigns and uses the fog of            war to disguise this. Either way, it's not very impressive.                        The card-based combat system has other problems as well. You begin            each battle with six cards drawn at random from your deck of            fifteen, and then get dealt one more card each turn. Unfortunately            this means that bad luck can leave you with a totally useless hand            for a few turns, and although you can minimise this risk by keeping            a varied deck, sometimes things just don't work out and all you can            do is hit ~surrender~ and reload from the last autosave position.            This is a particular problem for the Kinets, whose basic deck is            horribly under-powered compared to the other three races at the            best of times. Kinets have no direct attack spells and can't summon            any creatures from their starting deck until the third turn. By            which time your opponent probably already has a small army of            creatures waiting to tear your hero limb from limb. They make up            for this later on in the game with some incredibly powerful high            level spells, but you'll be lucky to get that far.                    Even more annoying is the fact that, apart from the basic spells            you start out with, every card in your deck has a limited number of            charges. Once these are exhausted you can no longer cast that            spell, leaving you dashing back to the nearest ~portal~ to buy            fresh supplies after every few battles.                        You can't customise your deck before battles either - the only way            to change the cards you hold is to travel to the appropriate            building and buy some new ones. As the cards you want may be spread            between two or three shops scattered across half the map, this            makes changing your deck an incredibly time consuming business, and            you can't even swap spells between heroes to speed things up. As a            result the combat system is far less dynamic than it really should            be, and if you find yourself up against an enemy whose deck            includes cards which render yours useless, you're basically            stuffed.                        It's not all bad news though. Battles can be very enjoyable,            and the wide range of cards and the interdependencies between the            various spells gives them real tactical depth, while the swooping            camera views and over-the-top special effects make them a joy to            behold. Until you switch off all the options to speed things up,            anyway. It's just a pity that the missions don't allow you to            properly explore this side of the game, leaving it to duels (both            online and against the AI) to show you what Etherlords could            have been.                    We had high hopes for Etherlords, but sadly most of the niggles we            had with the beta code we played six months ago still haven't been            fixed. The AI is a mess, the missions seriously unbalanced, the            card purchase system tedious and the learning curve almost            vertical. Throw in a dodgy script and some of the worst voice            acting ever to grace a computer game and you're left with a            potential classic which falls far short of its potential.                        -        Etherlords                    interviewEtherlords                    interviewEtherlords                    preview (August 2001)                Etherlords                    preview (August 2001)                Etherlords                    screenshotsEtherlords                    screenshots"}
