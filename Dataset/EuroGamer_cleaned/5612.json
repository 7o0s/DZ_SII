There is only one 24 Heures du Mans, otherwise known as ..                 LeMans 24 Hours. And now, thanks to developers Eutechnyx, you                 too can drive around in a big circle all day and all night...                    I must admit, when I first heard there was a LeMans game in            development, I thought ~Blimey - 1 track, 24 hours - how are they            gonna make that fun to play?~ So when the box arrived from            Infogrames, I had mixed feelings about what would be inside.         Thankfully the team                 at Eutechnyx also realised how boring this game would be if                 there was only one track, and they have spent a lot of time                 spicing things up.                    When you first start the game, you are a nobody. You have no            experience, and no CV. To start things off gently, you can try the            Arcade mode. Here you can choose between Challenge, where you            jostle for position with CPU-controlled cars, or Time Attack, a            classic checkpoint style affair.                    You begin your career driving GT2 cars like the Porsche 911, and            graduate to the open cockpit Prototype class, and then on to GT1.            In the beginning the only cars available have mediocre performance            at best, but the computer opponents at this stage are quite slow.            With each race you win though you unlock a faster car, which allows            you to keep up with the increasing pace.                    Driving the three different classes keeps things interesting - a            GT1 may have superior grip, but its higher top speed means you also            approach the corners faster. Finding a balance is all part of the            challenge.                    Arcade mode is a lot of fun - the handling is more forgiving, you            don't take damage, and you won't have to worry about making            pitstops. Having said that, LeMans 24 Hours is no trip down to            Sainsburys - to succeed you need to adopt ~proper~ driving            techniques, and it may take several attempts to win the later races            as the competition hots up.                    Once you master the Arcade Mode you can try your hand at            Championship Mode. Here you can select Sprint (3 laps) or Endurance            (10 laps), competing in a whole season of races, and accumulating            points just like in the regular World GT Championship season.                    This is where things start to get a little tricky - endurance races            require you to take pitstops to refuel, and you also sustain damage            to your car which can impede your performance. The            computer-controlled opponents are much tougher as well, and you            sometimes simply hang-on to sixth place to secure that last            championship point.         The third                 option of playing is the famous 24 hour race at LeMans.                 Thankfully you're not expected to actually sit there for 24                 hours, and you can play an accelerated time race over 12 or 24                 minutes, or 1 hour, 2 hours, or even go the whole hog for 24                 hours! I can't see anyone ever doing this, but at least there                 is the option...                    Just like the real event all three classes compete at the same            time, so you not only have to watch out for slower moving traffic,            but have to make way for the awesome GT1 cars if you are competing            in a lower category.                    As day turns to night you need to turn your lights on.            Unfortunately, driving with lights on is only marginally better            than with them off. I refuse to believe that anyone would drive            around at 190mph and not be able to see where they are going. I            found it necessary to hold off overtaking some of the computer cars            just so I could follow them around the track and see where I was            going!                    Obviously very few of us will ever experience the real thing, but            from what I can tell the physics model is as accurate as it needs            to be without spoiling the fun. For example, the GT2 Porsche 911            has some wonderful lift-off oversteer that allows you to catch the            most enormous power slides, but as in real life this is not the            fastest way around the track, and if you burn too much rubber you            can rapidly find yourself at the back of the pack...         Graphically the game is            generally excellent, with some real attention to detail. Cars            sputter and pop small flames as excess fuel is burnt, and at night            the crowd goes wild with camera flashes as you drive past.                    A wet track will reflect the brake lights of the cars in front, and            the brake discs glow a bright orange under heavy braking. The cars            are lovingly detailed with over 500 polygons per car, and each is            accurately modelled on the different manufacturers.                    The game supports a wide range of 3D cards via Glide and D3D, and            on my PII-450 the frame rates were high even at 1024 x 768. You            really get a sense of speed, and can almost feel the G-Forces as            you slam through the chicanes.                    I did have a few gripes though... I can forgive the odd visual            glitch with scenery popping in and out, but the mipmap levels are            far too apparent and too close to the action, so much as to be            distracting.                    There are 3 camera modes but no ~In-Car~ shot, only a ~bonnet cam~,            and there are no mirrors in any mode. Instead, there is a separate            key for ~look behind~. I found this especially annoying as you            cannot see cars from behind making a move on your position, and you            have to wait for a straight before you can safely look behind you.                    As I mentioned before, the lighting is fairly woeful, and the night            stages are extremely difficult because you simply cannot see where            you are going. The only way to succeed was to memorise the track in            a day time race, and then race at night purely from memory.                    While driving in Professional Mode you can sustain damage, but even            in the most severe crashes there is no visible damage to the cars            involved, and certainly no debris. Your performance is impeded            though, and the joke is that one of your most vulnerable parts are            your lights - crash at night, and you are forced to crawl back to            the pits at 25mph for repairs.                    Realistic I suppose, but hardly fun.         The sound is good all round,            each class of car making an appropriately distinctive grumble, and            I was impressed at how realistic the Porsche 911 samples were.            Although not employing any specific 3D positional audio, you can            normally hear a car catching up to you, which is handy because you            don't have a mirror to spot them in.                    The one feature that is constantly annoying is the commentary,            provided by Top Gear's Tiff Needel, who himself has competed in the            LeMans 24 Hour several times. Unfortunately, this does not qualify            him to commentate a racing game, and for the most part it is            abysmal. Not only is it repetitive and delivered in a flat,            un-excited tone (Murray Walker he ain't!), but some of the time he            is just plain wrong.                    For example, I'm on the grid for the start of the race, in last            position because I didn't bother to qualify. The flag is waved and            we're off! Before the first corner I manage to blast past the guy            in 7th place, only to hear ~He's been fighting for a long time to            overtake that car, and now he's finally been rewarded~. Oh dear!         Despite some minor annoyances, LeMans            24 Hour is a top-notch racing game.                    Apart from the obvious appeal of competing in an accurate            recreation of the real LeMans race, the arcade challenges and            championship season modes really extend the longevity of the game.            Many rainy afternoons can be lost attempting to master all three            classes of racer, and the difficulty level is just enough to            challenge you without being overly difficult.                    The only other PC racing game this good is Codemasters TOCA2, but            if you've played that to death and need your fix of adrenaline            while waiting for Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix 3, then I have no            hesitation in recommending LeMans 24 Hours. Great stuff!"}
