{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-odyssey-pc", "date": "11 Oct 2000", "game_name": "Reviews", "text": "~Odyssey~ is another title from            Cryo's Legend Collection, which utilises the same graphics engine            used in ~The Time Machine~, and is based loosely on Homer's novel            ~Odyssey~ and Greek mythology. This subject is one of the few that            held my attention in history lessons at school, and one that is            perfect to center a game around.                    At the request of Penelope, Heritias has been tasked with finding            her husband Ulysses, who was lost at sea after the battle of Troy.            Heritias must follow the path Ulysses is known to have taken, a            journey that will have him pass through strange lands and battle            against mythical creatures. The trail of Ulysses is not as            straightforward as he first perceives, and he soon finds that his            friend has made quite a few enemies on his travels. As a result            your task is simply to follow the clues left behind, solve the            various puzzles set along the way, and to recognise who you can or            can't trust.                    Getting anywhere in the game relies on communication with others,            and manipulation of the various objects you will pick up along the            way. Interaction with other characters is purely a case of            'multiple choice' type interrogation. You will find that the            dialogue is a matter of choosing between accepting and refusing            certain situations, but it does not often make a difference to the            outcome. Or it goes to the other extreme, where if you do one thing            you proceed, but if you do the other and you die.                    This method of interaction gets all very tiring after a while,            knowing that if you die after saying one response, you can simply            reload and say the other reply to carry on. As a result there is            only one set path to take to complete the game, which is not too            good for its replay value.         As you would expect from a Cryo            game, everything is very nicely presented from the word go. The            menu system is particularly impressive, giving the illusion that            the various option pages are all mapped within a sphere, and those            familiar with The Time Machine will be instantly at home with the            controls and inventory navigation.                    Each location is pre-rendered, and your 3D character sits on top of            these with defined routes through and around the backdrops. This            works for the most part but can be quite frustrating when you can            clearly see a passage through, only for it to be blocked off as            part of the scenery. Frustration also sets in frequently where your            character cannot seem to negotiate the smallest of rocks and other            such tiny obstacles. It is often hard to tell where you are            supposed to be heading on some locations too, with finding the            screen exits something of a matter of trial and error.                    The game operates with a rather snazzy rotational graphics system,            whereby the camera pans centered on the player, giving the static            backdrops their fake three dimensional look. You can ramp the video            resolution up as high as you dare and the engine should cope            amicably, and it is well worth doing so with the eye candy the game            has to offer.         On            the whole the graphics in Odyssey are excellent, but there are a            few locations which look far too much like oil paintings rather            than realistic settings. The first episode is a prime example, with            the main character looking almost daft against the background. The            characters themselves are solid and highly detailed, but a little            robotic in their animation.                    Sound is perhaps the one area where the game excels, with excellent            attention to underfoot audio, with shingle crunching and rock            floors clicking realistically. Voice acting is also of a high            standard, although it can be a little drawn out at times. However,            all dialogue can be skipped if necessary.                    Most impressive of all is the music though, which fades in and out            during each episode. The tune that plays while you unravel the            Lotus-Eaters puzzle is beautifully haunting, and when you visit the            Fields of Elysees the music is appropriately heavenly.                    Throughout the game you will travel to a variety of islands and            towns, all with their own mystery and intrigue. The trail of            Ulysses will take you to the island of the Cyclops, across the seas            to the curious world of the Laestrygonians, and on to the seemingly            harmless Circe's island, to name but three.                    All very exciting, you would be thinking, and certainly the first            few locations are well thought out and compelling enough. Further            into the game though there is a big feeling of disappointment which            is hard to deny. When you visit the island of the Cyclops for            instance, after just two easy puzzles the section is completed and            it's on to the next location.                    The further into the game you go the more rushed it seems. These            myths are fascinating I feel, but are not given the loving            attention they warrant. The whole sense of purpose is lost as each            section is completed with ease. Only twice did I get stuck            throughout the entire game, and those were due to a game save            glitch that has thankfully since been            patched.         The            game looks and sounds excellent, but is let down badly by            simplistic puzzles, fussy location routes, and it's essentially            linear nature. Just a little more diversity in the way the story            develops through your responses could have made a hell of a            difference. Each location is over too quickly, so you never get to            discover too much about your environment and the mythology behind            them. To compound it all, the end sequence is extremely            disappointing.                    I guess if you are purely interested in the mythology aspect of the            game, then Odyssey could provide you with a simple piece of            entertainment. To the ardent adventurer though this is not going to            be much of a challenge.                        -        Odyssey                    screenshotsOdyssey                    screenshotsThe                    Time Machine reviewThe                    Time Machine reviewArthur's                    Knights previewArthur's                    Knights preview"}
