{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ss2", "date": "5 Sep 2002", "game_name": "Sudden Strike 2", "text": "Real-time strategy games generally fall somewhere on an axis            between two poles. At one end you have the stylised combat of            Command & Conquer and its ilk; at the other, the insane realism            and micromanagement of Close Combat, veering into the realms of            tactical action with Commandos. Sudden Strike 2 plants its flag            firmly on the realistic end of the pitch, but can it keep fans of            the original title satisfied, and perhaps more importantly, will it            attract new players to the series?                                    Despite the much needed addition of easier difficulty settings,            aficionados of conventional real-time strategy games will find            Sudden Strike 2 just as daunting a prospect as the original, a game            which won a surprising level of cult popularity, particularly in            mainland Europe. The game features none of the conventional            hallmarks of the RTS genre, as handed down from Dune 2; there is no            construction of buildings and units and no resources to harvest,            and combat itself is a rather more involved affair than just            building more tanks than your opponent and rolling over his base.            Instead the game gives you a certain number of troops and vehicles            - with occasional reinforcements - and it's up to you to complete            the mission using the military force to hand and nothing more.                                    What's more, these aren't the superman units found in C&C -            they move slowly, die easily, don't always hit what they shoot at            and their morale wavers in combat. They're more Private Ryan than            Major Tanya. Keeping them alive is essential, although regularly            you have to dispassionately choose to break some eggs in order to            make an omlette, sending hapless infantrymen into the breach as            scouts, a distraction .. or bait. To make things more complex,            there are special officer units which improve the morale of troops            when they're around, but seem to have the inverse effect if you get            them killed, making their positioning into a very delicate            balancing act.                    Historical accuracy is a key selling point for Sudden Strike 2, and            developers FireGlow have gone to great lengths to ensure that each            unit and campaign is balanced as it would have been in World War            II. Tanks and other armoured units are now much more representative            of their actual strengths and weaknesses than they were in the            first game - the German Tiger tank is one of the most powerful            units on the battlefield, for example, and lesser tanks won't have            a hope against its amazing armour.                                    Each campaign is based on a famous World War II engagement,            Operation Market Garden being the most recognisable, but there are            also campaigns on the Russian front and in the Pacific theatre. The            difficulty of these campaigns varies depending on historical            circumstances rather than the whim of the developer; so for            example, playing in the Pacific as the Japanese (the new playable            army in Sudden Strike 2) is a particularly fraught exercise, since            historically the balance was tipped against them. All in all, it's            a World War II junkie's wet dream. All this accuracy would probably            look very intimidating to a mainstream RTS fan, but for someone            immersed in the history of the period this title would hold            infinitely more attraction than the likes of C&C Red Alert.                    In terms of graphics, Sudden Strike 2 is definitely in the retro            camp compared to the lush visuals of the likes of Ground Control or            C&C Generals. No 3D rotating camera views or high-polygon units            here; everything is resolutely 2D, with a visual style which is            best described as ~gritty~.                                    However, the 2D approach doesn't grate - in the context of what the            developers are trying to accomplish with Sudden Strike 2, it's            perfect in fact. The graphics take a back seat, with the deep and            intricate gameplay definitely driving the whole show; they convey            the information required (with varied terrain and weather            conditions, and beautifully realised vehicles) and then let you get            on with playing the game. Most impressively, the engine is capable            of dealing with vast numbers of units on-screen at once without            even a hint of slowdown, no doubt thanks in part to the rather            dated graphical approach the developers have chosen.                                    Rather more laudable is the audio in the game, which has obviously            had a lot of effort put into it. The sounds of war are perfectly            captured, and each side has its own set of voices barking out            orders and so on, each in the appropriate language for the force in            question, and with correct accents. This is more than can be said            for the usual standard of German voice-overs found in videogames,            which often bear all the authenticity of a Carry On film.                    Realistically, Sudden Strike 2 is unlikely to entice any gamers who            didn't fancy the first game much. CDV and FireGlow clearly feel            that they have a potted target audience for the title already, and            it is fans of the original Sudden Strike who are the most likely            purchasers of this sequel.                                                Which is perhaps no bad thing, as any attempt to make the game            appeal to a more mainstream audience would inevitably have            translated into a dumbing down of some of the more complex elements            of the title, which would have annoyed the core audience of            hardcore strategy fans and history buffs.                                                As it is, fans of the original will be delighted with this update -            new campaigns to play, a whole new force to command, new units and            an increased focus on historical accuracy will appeal to anyone who            enjoyed the first game, and there's no good reason for them not to            own this sequel. However, casual strategy fans whose patience            threshold for complex RTS titles stops at Age of Empires need not            apply. Sudden Strike 2 is a great game, but it's a great game for a            very limited audience. Which isn't a criticism, as this is a game            which achieves just about everything it sets out to do, but rather            a caveat emptor to potential buyers who might not be aware of what            they're letting themselves in for."}
