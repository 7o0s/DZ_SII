Melee is            one of those games which really has to be played with others. It's            a multiplayer fighter, but much more than a simple beat 'em up, or            even just an update to its predecessor on the N64. SSBM is a            dramatic reworking of the formula which now offers more of            everything, providing a much more varied and enjoyable experience.                        The game is a contest of might between two to four players, some of            whom can be computer-controlled, and the objective is simply to            batter your opponent and then knock him off the edge of the arena            while he's vulnerable. The key to shunting your opponent into the            ether is to batter him with attacks, take advantage of the level            designs, which differ wildly from one stage to the next, and to            make use of the power-ups and items that are strewn about the            place. Instead of a health bar players have a percentage of damage            which begins at zero and can go all the way up to 300 percent.            Anything over the 100 mark leaves the player susceptible to being            thumped into the stratosphere, so games tend to move back and            forth, with one player on the defensive looking for an opportunity            to strike and the other rampantly pummelling the pad in the hope of            landing that decisive blow.                        At the end of the round your various feats are totted up and the            match is decided on points, with funky scoring categories to muse            over before moving on. And that really is it. The joy of SSBM            though is in the sheer variety of things you can get up to and the            strategic elements of the game, not to mention all the minutiae and            nuances you can feasibly imagine lurking just beneath the surface,            and of course a boatload of memorable Nintendo characters to fight            with.                    Your control system is as simple as the game's premise. The A and B            buttons are your main attacks, with an option to make A the only            attack command - perfect for nippers. Using the analogue stick and            these buttons in conjunction you can perform all the moves in the            game, even charged special attacks and other nonsensica, but none            of them is essential to victory.                        You can still lose quite easily to a newcomer if you overdo it in            an attempt to flaunt your skills, but the accessibility of the game            really does count in its favour - it's the perfect party game, for            example, with wacky characters and bright colours for drunken            people, and options geared towards apr\u00e8s-pub players who want            some alternative to bouts of arm-wrestling. A quick and handy            training mode will guide you through the basics if you don't trust            your intuition, and there is a fully-fledged single player            adventure game aspect to help you hone your skills.                         Experienced players can introduce a degree of subtlety to            proceedings by using the pad's three shoulder buttons, which help            you to perform evasive manoeuvres and protect yourself from enemy            onslaughts. You can also take advantage of the game's 31 odd            power-ups and items, which can be anything from harmless to deadly.            Some super-size you, whilst others endow you with little more than            a humble fan. However, any given power-up literally has the            potential to blow up in your face, adding a factor of risk to the            whole shebang.                    Players can take up the mantle of fourteen of Nintendo's most            popular characters, and with a bit of effort another eleven may be            unlocked to supplement that total. Characters are wondrously            designed in typical Nintendo fashion, and although many come from            games with extremely different artistic styles, they all seem to            fit together nicely.                        Stages are thoroughly detailed with a tremendous amount going on.            Sometimes you can fall prey to environmental hazards, with Donkey            Kong's riverhouse sinking 'neath the surging water now and then,            and many levels feature rotating platforms, traps and sometimes            just an awkward layout. The Star Fox stage atop an Arwing is a            superb level, with players leaping between the wings and sometimes            coming unstuck from below, or hopping onto nearby speeders, and the            F-Zero track-based level is also a hoot. Many of these will have            you rubbing tears of nostalgia from your eyes.                         Variations on the simple multiplayer game help to extend SSBM's            lifespan, although I had actually been playing the game with a few            friends for hours before we even tried them - it's addictive in no            small way, so make sure you don't overlook anything! Turbo mode is            a bit of a laugh, if only because it's practically uncontrollable,            while Sudden Death mode is a nerve-wracking experience. As you will            soon learn, the game has no trouble recording all of your feats and            mishaps, with leaderboards and statistical readouts stored on the            memory card for up to 30 players, so make sure you protect yourself            from lunatic rounds with completely uncertain outcomes!                    It's not just varied multiplayer modes either; you can customize            virtually every aspect of the playing experience. You can limit the            amount of power-ups in play or turn them off altogether; you can            choose health limits and whatnot and tinker with the play mechanics            until the game barely even resembles itself. And if you're a man            (or woman) of ambition, you can fight to win some of the two            hundred or so awards on offer, try to collect trophies throughout            the game, or even head to the mini-game stadium and win some points            that way.                         As you can probably tell, this is one of the deepest and most            vibrant examples of a beat 'em up for many years, highly deserving            of its countless awards and sterling sales record. It looks great            and moves swiftly, has a huge soundtrack of classic Nintendo tunes,            and although the PAL version lacks a 60Hz mode it runs at virtually            full screen. You can be as good or as bad at it as you can be            bothered to be, and you'll still be able to play competitively with            newcomers or cope with seasoned opponents. I've also yet to meet            somebody who doesn't like it\u2026                         Overall it's an exotic cocktail of entertainment for Nintendo            fans, who will slurp up every last drop, and if you want to talk            about longevity, I've had this game on import for about six months            and I still haven't finished it. People talk about killer apps and            games that sell systems, and if you can put aside any            preconceptions of this as a kiddie title or a game for beat 'em up            virgins only, then you will have one of the finest videogames ever            to issue forth from the caring hands of a developer. One to be            remembered, and definitely one to own."}
