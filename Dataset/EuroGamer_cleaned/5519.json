PrincessBrick-Leah...How the world's favourite toy and favourite movie franchise cametogether is a bit of a mystery, but come together they did.Featuring a storyline loosely based around the more recent films(that is, the trilogy set before the original Star Wars trio), youtake control of young Jedi Anakin (before his transformation intoDarth Vader) and attempt to find your master Obi-Wan in order togang up on the mischievous General Grievous. He's been up to hisold tricks, kidnapping chancellors and plunging alien races intothe depths of oblivion, like you do.Lego Star Wars is a roam around, explore here and there, whilstslashing-robot-guards kind of a game. Navigating through each levelthere are various puzzles to solve, ranging from the very simple tothe incredibly hard. Even early on, the brainpower needed farexceeds that of most non-Mensa card-carrying, non-bulbous-headedpeople. The developers seem to have forgotten that creating apuzzle is a world away from trying to solve it. With perseveranceyou'll probably stumble across some of the solutions, but that'sassuming you haven't lost interest long before then.Then there's the fighting. On your travels you'll encounterendless droids, firing their lasers from all angles. Armed withyour devastating glow-in-the-dark sword, the difficult part isactually getting close enough to use it. The Jedi council don'tseem to want lightsabres that can also fire shots, so dodging thelasers to get to the enemy before he zaps you is tricky. Whensurrounded on all fronts by these droids, the challenge initiallyseems insurmountable. With practice though, the droids do becomeless intimidating, enabling progress further into the game as youstart parrying their laser blasts with your lightsabre.There's certainly a good deal of satisfaction to be had fromcompleting these difficult missions. Working out the puzzles isrewarding, and defeating all the enemies within half a millionlight years of Endor leaves you feeling chuffed. And visually,while Lego Star Wars isn't going to win any awards, its layout andoverhead perspective make meandering easy; the on-screen action isclearly represented and has a tidy, uncluttered feel to it. Themusic is rather good, too, which is something of a rarity. Cheesy,yes, but it suits the mood perfectly, and it carries the game alongon its polyphonic pulse engines.If you're a fan of Star Wars, you'll find this mobile Legorendition a decent addition to the extended family of spin-offgames. For younger kids, it may prove too tricky. In fact, thepuzzles will test anyone with less than Yoda's level of genius, sodon't buy it if you're after an easy ride."}
