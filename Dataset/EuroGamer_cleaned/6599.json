It was as we            munched the 'Advanced' banana for the fifteen-bagillionth time,            dashing our chances of continuing by going for a distant ribbon up            a narrow gangway, ironically in the hope of catapulting ourselves            further into the game. Conscious (to some degree) of the short            length of the controller cord and the potential of the GameCube to            go flying off the shelf, we beat the smirking crap out of a stuffed            Pikachu for a whole minute. We survived. Pikachu survived. The pad            did not.                    In this household, there is one measure above all else that            determines the true quality of a game, and it is, quite simply, how            long does it take us to go back to a game after we've destroyed the            first peripheral?                    In SMB's case, we were actually playing it with pad two whilst we            destroyed pad one. Back for 2003, this Super Monkey in a Ball hopes            to claim the scalp of my prized WaveBird, with 100 new levels, six            refurbished, returning party games and six brand new efforts to cut            our chequebooks on. With so much to do, we had to keep an            economically viable victim within reach! Er, Rupert? Where did you            go?                    Except, after a while it became clear that you won't need to kill            your boss or shower the floor in shards of plastic, because Sega            has overreacted to complaints that the first game was too hard by            redressing the balance with an anvil, ACME-style.        On a fundamental level, SMB2 is still the same game. You still            have to toil your way across 100 cleverly constructed,            chequer-boarded levels, earning Play Points as you go, 2500 of            which are needed to unlock the new party games (and everything's a            party game now, with no feeble mini/party distinction). As a            goodwill gesture, the returning half of the first game's 12 party            titles are available from the start, emblazoned with a '2' and            variously altered. And as before, anything you can do on your own            is far more entertaining in a group.                    The biggest change the game makes affects the maze mode, which is            now split into Story and Challenge. Each mode sends you through the            game's 100 levels by various routes; Challenge acts like the main            mode from the original game, with 10-level Beginner, 30-level            Intermediate and 50-level Advanced courses with a finite number of            continues, whilst Story mode splits the game into manageable chunks            of 10 levels each, lets you tackle the current ten in any order you            like and offers infinite retries.                    Story mode also throws up some wacky cut sequences, which see Aiai,            Meemee and co. disputing evil Dr. Bad-Boon's mass banana abduction.            However, these feel like someone's deliberately poor translation -            as if we're expected to laugh at ~Magical spell is Ei-Ei-Poo!~ just            because it used to be Japanese. (Speaking of deliberate ineptitude,            let's hope that's to blame for two lowercase 't's on the Story mode            naming screen. ~Mugwum~ had to go without his 'w'.)        This new approach clearly aims to sate the die-hards who            did get beyond level three of the Advanced mode last time            around, whilst pandering to a new audience of thick-thumbed            debutants who need the stock issue of continues to get past a            single level - and we've seen a lot of criticism for it. ~It gives            you a chance to practise the tough levels!~ ~It takes all the            frustration out of it!~ OK, but surely that's a good thing?                    Everyone makes it past Beginner mode on their first or second            attempt, so the real challenge, if you'll excuse the pun, was to            overcome the Intermediate level, and we got to level 25 or            thereabouts on our first go. 25 on the second, 25 on the third.            Basically, there was this one insidiously tricky level which we            only ever had a couple of continues to contemplate with, and we            were up against a brick wall. But thanks to Story mode, we could            take on the same level halfway through the fourth 'world', trying            it over and over again until something clicked. Next time we got to            level 26.                    Is this how Monkey Ball should be played? Well why not?            We'll all get a lot further if we can actually practise the levels,            and given the spread of levels that require precise bouncing or            mid-air antics, puzzle-solving and often now just blind luck, in            addition to the more traditional constructions, it's probably a            good thing we have it.                    Of course it means you'll complete the game at a greater speed than            before, but those 30-something ranked levels are an absolute bitch,            with at least 50 more main levels (plus bonuses) beyond, and those            are no cakewalk either. However long you spend flaunting your            practise 'cheat', you've still got many long hours of tilting            monkeys ahead of you in order to unlock all your new wares, and            they won't let you slip into boredom either. Because, on the            flipside of the banana, you have a lot of partying to do.        Here we are, and for some of you this is the main event. Many            of our old favourites have grown new threads and new features, and            there are six whole new party games to consider. First, the ball            games\u2026                    We kicked off with Monkey Soccer. This five-a-side game is a bit            like digital Subbuteo. Each monkey can perform a dash challenge, as            if flicked out of the ether, along with pass and shoot moves, and            because of the closed pitch and tight conditions, it's very much a            game of pass and move. There are four teams to choose from, each            with a particular slant (one is dedicated to being crap, giving            fresh-faced opposition a fairer grounding) and three strategic            formations, with Penalty Shootouts at the end of a draw and a            roving, Soccer Slam-style camera. The verdict? Well, despite being            fairly far removed from football, this is actually really good fun            and probably well worth unlocking first or second - as with all the            others, it really comes into its own when you've got multiple            players on the pitch.                    Monkey Tennis was the second game we unlocked, and it's equally            simple. Played one-on-one or in doubles, it gives you three types            of shot and rolls along at a manageable pace, leading to more            strategy than brute force victories. It may be more like Virtua            Tennis on the GBA than the Dreamcast, but God dammit it's got            monkeys. Baby even sits on a barrel playing umpire!                    The final ball game debutant is Monkey Baseball, which takes on a            suitably wacky twist. As the bowler (sorry, pitcher), you hurl the            ball and then control it, UT2003 Redeemer-style towards the batter,            who must do his damnedest to propel it into one of a series of big            holes marked around the edge of the pitch. It's a bit like skeeball            meets rounders, my fellow surrender-monkeys.        Of the            three others, Monkey Boat, Monkey Shot and Monkey Dogfight,            Dogfight is the best. Rather like Lylatwars' multi-player, you            skirt around a packed 3D fly-zone trying to line your sights on the            enemy, with a little radar, a big fat aiming reticule and a fairly            insignificant health bar. Very little in the whole game comes close            to the mad panic as four rival fighters from all corners of the            screen converge en masse and slip gracefully into one another's            sights...                    Sadly though, neither Boat nor Shot does much to keep up. Boat            reverses the steering (because it's canoeing, apparently), as the            left and right triggers cleverly work the paddle, but it's like a            My First Wave Race Clone, and doesn't play particularly well. It's            not really worth bothering with until the end, but definitely do            get it before you spend your final 2500 points on Monkey Shot, a            basic and uninspiring shoot 'em up. On a related note, do you            remember the end credits game from the first Monkey Ball, of            rolling through a sea of bananas and avoiding the names and            credits? This time we have a 2D vertical shoot 'em up, and it            actually outdoes Monkey Shot (and can be bought for posterity once            you've unlocked everything else).        Ah,            you're wondering, but what of our old favourites? What genius has            Sega sewn into the lining of Monkey Bowling for example? How does            Monkey Golf differ? Alarmingly, Sega hasn't been coy about fiddling            with our old haunts, and almost caused pandemonium for meddling            with office faves Bowling and Target, so we'll start with them.                    Monkey Bowling was one of the best things you could do with the            first game - a fairly unquestionable simulation of the sport cut            down to its least intimidating. Pick a line, pick an angle, fill            the gage and add spin - very simple, and endlessly enjoyable. Here            we have the same old game, but each of the monkeys now has            attributes. Gongon, for example, throws the fastest ball this side            of the Cricket World Cup, but his aiming arrow swings back and            forward like                        Geri Halliwell on Howard Stern's radio show. Conversely, Baby            gives you all the time in the world to aim at a relaxed pace, but            skips down the lane like an electric pram with an EMP attachment.            Aiai and Meemee are closer to their former selves, but the effect            of the post-gage, pre-launch spin adjustments are borne out            differently, with the ball veering violently at the last rather            than curving gradually any more. It doesn't make a huge amount of            difference to the gameplay, but it does add something to the            tension.                    Did we need those changes? Perhaps not, but they're forgivable. And            as a bonus (or apology, perhaps), we're also given Special mode,            with those wacky, pulsating, rippling, bending lanes you've seen in            the screenshots. The idea is to complete three levels' worth by            totting up the right amount of points to unlock the next one. A            totally unnecessary inclusion which provides endless hours of fun.        Monkey Target has also seen a few changes. You can fly in            formation, as you've seen (switching with B), landing multiple            balls for maximum points, and the sky is now strewn with far more            bananas. This isn't so much of a problem, but also new to the sky            are various power-ups, and these upset the balance. Magnets, for            example, stick your main monkey to the target, allowing you to            switch into overhead view with Y and plant a simian wherever you            like, eliminating the precision required previously. The brakes            power-up, likewise, gives you far too much control on the ground.                    But all of that is easily forgotten when you load up the            multi-player mode and realise it's in split-screen. There is            nothing more entertaining in the whole of Monkey Ball 2 than four            players going kamikaze as they all try to mop up a fair share of            the points. And landing on 750 only to be shunted into the ocean            may not break pads, but it'll break jaws.                    Mercifully, Sega hasn't taken too many steps with the other            returnees (Kristan's thankful just being given a break from reading            this epic). Billiards offers four variations and has a cutesy Wild            West bar background complete with milk-sipping Monkey cowboy; Race            has bigger arenas and up to eight competitors, with a Grand Prix            mode; Fight has new power-ups and a crumbling arena option            (recommended); and Golf now has bigger, 18-hole courses with a shot            system to rival Mario Golf.                    We'll never know why Sega went for monkeys, really, but if we had            to guess then it'd be down to the aesthetic, and Monkey Ball 2            knows how good it looks and makes no attempt to mess with its            forerunner's efforts. The graphics engine is identical, although a            lot more detail has been lavished on the backgrounds (world four,            inside a whale, is just spellbinding to watch - if you're taking it            in turns, it'll keep the off-turn player happy for ages), and some            of the effects like spitting lava now invade the arena. Still            though, the monkeys edge around as per normal with the same            animation (albeit with a few situational changes, like goal            celebrations for Monkey Soccer), the levels are the same sharp,            smoothly constructed shine-a-thons, and the whole thing is            precisely crafted to Sega's comic specs.                    Sadly though, instead of fixing the eye that views it all, the            developer left Monkey Ball's infuriating camera utterly unchanged.            As before, the view is from behind and takes hours to catch up,            apparently unsure how to interpret your hopeful twiddles. This can            be annoying if you're trying to watch for the right moment to run            (which happens a lot), because your monkey is always moving            at a slow pace, forcing you to roll him around to stop him falling            off an edge or something, at the expense of sending the camera            haywire. And there's still no clear way to keep the camera in check            during flight, which, given the number of levels demanding            inch-perfect landings (like the astonishingly nasty 'Launchers'),            is a pretty poor effort really.                    It's hard to remain angry with Super Monkey Ball 2 for too long            though, because even more so than its predecessor, there's always            something to curb your frustration. The party games are like            refreshments as you work your way studiously through the            Story/Challenge stages, and with 12 of them (and only a couple of            duds among 'em) you'll lose many an evening to SMB2. Plus, it's            harmless enough to convince the wife, girlfriend, au pair,            neighbour, kids, goat or ancestors to have a go. Who can argue with            cute, chirping monkeys on a quest to rescue bananas? We didn't say            goat.                    That said though, it's impossible to recommend SMB2            unconditionally, because it's still very hard to play, despite            probably frustrating the hardcore with its new approach - thus            failing to win both sets of fans over. But if you can deal with            that, the useless camera doesn't sound like a showstopper and            motion sickness isn't a problem, then strap on your simian capsules            and spout some unintelligible Japlish, because the monkeys are back            and your Cube needs this game."}
