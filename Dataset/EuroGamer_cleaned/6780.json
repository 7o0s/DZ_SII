Primitive looking text-based web            browser games like the fiendishly addictive Planetarion fill the            gap, but to date there have been only a handful of ~real~ games in            the genre.                    The latest such effort to emerge onto the internet is Time Of            Defiance, and thanks to the appropriately named developers (Nicely            Crafted Entertainment, or just plain NiCE for short) I've been beta            testing the game for the last month.                        At its heart, Defiance is all about exploration and exploitation.            The game world is made up of the shattered remains of an exploded            planet, and the goal is to capture as many of the rocky ~islands~            left behind as possible. Each island has limited resources and            construction space, so you'll need to build your empire wisely,            choosing which islands to settle on and which to simply strip mine            from orbit. Given that there are about two thousand islands            scattered around the play area and only a couple of hundred players            in the current round of games though, there's plenty of room for            expansion.                        On entering a game, players are given a few spaceships and some            basic resources to get them started, and dumped in a system with            two planets and a quantum gate, the importance of which isn't            immediately obvious. Your first task will be to get your colony up            and running, and there's plenty of freedom in how you go about            this. Mines are obviously a good place to start, but you could rely            on a fleet of mining transports to gather resources from orbit            instead. Either way you'll need silos to store your ill-gotten            gains in, and a vehicle constructor to build more transports,            scouts and warships. Turrets can be constructed and reinforced, and            your island's defences bolstered with long range artillery, which            fires lumps of rock at targets beyond the range of normal turrets.            Whatever your choices though, it's always a trade-off. Even fairly            large islands only have room for two or three mines, a few silos,            half a dozen turrets and a vehicle constructor or two, and space            can be even more limited on smaller islands. Even when you have            plenty of space, it's not always economical to fill it all with            buildings.                    While you're building up your base, you'll also want to send out            some scout ships to investigate the surrounding sectors. You can't            actually see a sector's contents until you have a ship or building            inside its borders, which seems a bit odd when you pop across the            dividing line and suddenly a new island appears right in front of            your nose. But as the entire play area is split into square tiles            for easy navigation, it does make a certain degree of sense, and            hopping from one block to the next and dropping markers to record            what you found there becomes second nature after a while.                        As you go about exploring the game world, sooner or later you will            find your neighbours, who may or may not be hostile. The first time            I played Defiance I quickly stumbled across a few undefended            islands and made the mistake of stealing them all from their            previous occupant, not realising that they were just the outermost            fringes of one of the biggest empires in the game. Needless to say            I didn't last long, but when your empire is wiped out you can            simply respawn in another part of the game world with a few basic            ships to get you back on your feet. It's not something I'd            recommend though, and as you don't always know where in the            rankings the owner of a ship or island is, it generally pays to            treat them with respect until you know better - there's a good            chance that they've been playing the game a lot longer than you            have.                        Luckily a straightforward in-game messaging system makes it easy to            chat to other players, save their id numbers to your friends list            for future reference, and leave notes for them while they're            offline. The game has a friendly atmosphere for the most part, and            the random chat facility means that you often get messages from            veterans who are happy to help you with any problems you might            have. Even players who have just reduced your entire empire to            smouldering ruins will quite happily stop to chat with you, if only            to make sure that they caught every last ship.                    Combat itself is arguably the weakest part of Time Of Defiance, and            although the graphics make battles look a bit like Homeworld, in            fact it has more in common with the likes of Planetarion than your            typical real-time strategy game. At first you have a fairly limited            selection of combat ships (mostly small, medium and large warships,            with some boarding parties to capture enemy transports and            buildings intact), but once you have gathered enough water or built            a converter to turn your spare stone into valuable crystal, the            quantum gate comes into play. By sending these otherwise unused            resources through the gate you can buy more advanced vessels such            as carriers and fast moving interceptors. These tend to be much            more powerful than the mundane ships, and if anything the game is a            little overbalanced in their favour right now, which makes            recovering from a wipe out doubly difficult - you don't respawn            with a gate, so you'll have to find another player and steal theirs            before you can make much progress.                        Once you've got your ships, actually controlling them is a little            clumsy, as the only way to select multiple units is to assign one            of them as the leader and then tell other ships to follow it. Your            only options here are to assign every warship (or every ship of a            particular type) within a choice of ranges to follow the leader -            there's no RTS-style lassoing of troops or group selection. Another            problem which will hopefully be fixed in future versions is that            units don't do a very good job of following each other at the            moment. Assign a fast ship to follow a slower one and it will tend            to get ahead of its target, stop, turn round, back track, turn            again and move ahead again, until it reaches its destination.            Needless to say this wastes a lot of fuel, which is often in short            supply, and means that there's no easy way to get, for example, a            group of warships to escort a slow moving carrier.                        The actual fighting more or less takes care of itself, with units            automatically attacking any targets that come within range.            Currently they don't tend to show much initiative, and often ignore            friendly ships getting pounded nearby, which can leave fleets            getting sucked into a fight gradually, unless somebody is there to            manually target them. In theory you can just leave your warships            and turrets to defend your islands automatically while you're away,            but it's always best to be online when a fight is taking place to            control the battle by hand. Besides which, there's nothing worse            than logging on one morning to find out that a more powerful player            has completely annihilated your entire empire overnight, something            which has happened to me twice now. Luckily you can set up e-mail            alerts to warn you if you come under attack, and SMS alerts may be            possible in future versions.                    Despite any shortcomings of the combat and control system, Time of            Defiance is still an incredibly addictive game. Just dropping in            for a few minutes to check if your mining transports have filled            their cargo holds or to move a few scouts around often turns into            an hour long marathon session, and it's hard to tear yourself away            from it. The idea is that players should be able to hold their own            however much time they put into the game, but as always the truth            is that the more time you spend fine-tuning your empire and            exploring your surroundings, the more success you're likely to            have. It's certainly a lot less intensive than most online            role-playing games, which demand a huge time sacrifice just to keep            up, but you can still find yourself getting sucked in for two or            three hours a day if you're not careful.                        Luckily the game seems to have been designed to be left running in            the background while you get on with your day job. The slow pacing            and a robust graphics engine means that it's easy to alt-tab into            the game, give a few orders and then drop back to the desktop,            while a helpful beep will inform you whenever somebody tries to            chat to you, or if one of your units spots a hostile warship. The            unit selection system is a bit awkward, particularly if you have a            lot of ships in a small area, as they tend to overlap, but apart            from that the interface is neat and easy to use, and it's improved            markedly just in the few weeks that I've been playing the game. In            terms of graphics the game is surprisingly good looking for a scant            6Mb download, with fairly detailed models and lovely smoke trails            from weapons fire and ship movement.                        Time Of Defiance isn't perfect, but as beta tests go it's certainly            a highly promising start. It's already incredibly addictive, and            with a little more tweaking of the AI and controls it could be even            better. A frightening thought indeed. If you want to try Time Of            Defiance for yourself, you can sign up at            Nicely            Crafted's website. At the moment the game is free to download,            and will only set you back $6 (less than \u00a34 or about \u20ac6            at current exchange rates) for a month's play. And with a full            commercial launch due some time next month, now's the perfect time            to get some practice in."}
