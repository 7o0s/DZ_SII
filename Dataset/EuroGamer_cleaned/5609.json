Which is probably one of the wisest marketing moves I've seen in a            while, somewhat akin to the fictional ~number 2 and proud of it~ ad            campaign seen in that abysmal Jennifer Aniston flick, ~Picture            Perfect~. Either that or it's just downright cowardice.                    Still, considering this stance we can probably forgive the lack of            customisable leagues and the famous career mode found in NBA Live,            but that hardly justifies the bizarre series of fumbles that the            game suffers from in the areas where it is supposed to excel.                    Things go pear-shaped pretty damned soon after you start out...            You've got realistic statistics, which is nice since I can then            play as basketball players that I have actually ever heard of, but            instead of these stats creating an equilibrium with the basketball            world, the realism just goes right out of the window once you            begin.                    You can beat the Orlando Magic by about 50 points right from the            off. 169-115? That's absurd! I couldn't quite understand this, so I            thought that the AI difficulty must be set to rock bottom. Nope,            it's the average setting.                    At this point you realise that the computer's input into the game            is what causes the problems. The players chase you around without            making much real effort to steal the ball, and once they manage to            scrounge possession a simple blip on the control pad should regain            it for you.         In addition,                 should you want to let the computer play out a game on your                 behalf, which is pretty much bread and butter to every sports                 simulation these days, you have two options. You can either                 start a season game and then relinquish control to the                 computer for about 3/4 of the season, or start a single match                 then hand over control once you're off.                    The problem then arises that you do not want the computer doing the            whole season for you, you just want to simulate a couple of            results, but with the other option you are left watching a whole 10            minutes of basketball, not even being called upon to help out with            play-selection.                    And if you have read my recent            review            of NHL C2K then you will not be surprised to find the controls            in NBA B2K are just as bad. You are going to be wrestling just to            play the damned thing. Running before you walk? Pah! Walking would            be a result in itself!                    Normally when you begin a game you hit either the left or right            D-pad button to select which team to control. Nope, in NBA B2K you            have to drag and drop the controller into position. Someone explain            to me how wasting my time is a virtue worth programming.                    The gamepad still doesn't do anything that it is supposed to            do. I had to reprogram the controls in the gamepad's Windows            control panel to even move my players. The keyboard controls            aren't much better either, and you'll be lucky if you can actually            establish a key-combo that the game accepts.                    In order to play the game I ended up hanging upside down with my            left foot clicking the mouse and my right hand on the keyboard.            Maybe this game genuinely was programmed by monkeys.                    Now there's a thought...         And the torrent of                 niggles continues to fall. There are about four offensive                 plays to choose from. Who the hell decided to cut it that                 short? There's no variety, and I just wanted out after a few                 games.                    In terms of varying the action, soccer titles have started to get            it right, so why can't basketball titles? I have never been so            frustrated by the non-complicity of a sports game before. I want to            command the game, not become a particularly vocal bystander.                    Luckily Fox Sports had their heads on correctly when it came to the            graphics, as the players are fluid and detailed. The shirts ripple            and ebb like an estuary at times over the smooth contours of Jordan            and co. Likewise, the nets around the baskets bulge as the whoosh            of a spectacular 3-pointer envelopes them - the effect is quite            believable and surprisingly well done, considering the dire shape            of the rest of the game.                    In fact, on the whole, despite the occasionally unrealistic body            proportions, NBA B2K does the graphics thing quite convincingly.            Just, in fact, as it does in the sound department.                    The squeak of the players' trainers and aforementioned whoosh of            the ball have all been accurately sampled, which I suppose gives            some indication that the programmers do actually know something            about basketball.                    The courts rebound with oomph, the players grunt with purpose, and            the commentators blandly recount what's going on in the usual drab            American accents of the team that Fox Sports seems to employ.         The game can look and sound as good as it likes,                 but I'm not rating it highly unless I enjoy playing it ..                 which I don't.                    I mentioned equilibriums earlier on. In a way one is in place here            - the sole aim being to remain average by increasing and decreasing            the quality of various segments in order to keep the game            unplayable. Yippee-do.                    The graphics are good? Then it should play like a dead llama's            wedding night. The sounds are realistic? Then the AI needs to be of            the drunken-English-pub-goer standard. It's a no-win situation for            the player, and I dare say the marketing department embraced it            with open arms.                    They like a challenge. It's just a shame the game doesn't offer            one.                        -                            NHL Championship 2000 review                    NHL Championship 2000 review"}
