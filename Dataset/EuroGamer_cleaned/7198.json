They have, however, been            rather insignificant in the more global marketplace. Until now that            is.                    With their recently released Savage4 and TNT2 range of boards, Elsa            have placed themselves further into the spotlight. The Erazor III            Pro is their latest card, and uses a new spin of the TNT2 chip            which not only yields faster clock speeds but also much cooler            running hardware.                    The new chip is called the TNT2 Pro, and represents a step forward            in chip manufacturing, as instead of being made on a 0.25 micron            process it is instead manufactured on a 0.22 micron process. This            has the net effect of allowing companies like Elsa to produce            boards that run faster than the original TNT2 chip, but carry no            significant cost penalty.                    It is certainly nice to see this kind of evolution in the world of            graphics chips, as once the die has become smaller it becomes far            easier to pack more features on to the chips and run them at            greater speeds, which is always good news for all concerned.         The card itself is a typical Elsa board -            it is somewhat smaller in size than one might expect, but other            than bearing the Elsa logo it isn't anything too extraordinary to            look at. The 32Mb of memory is comprised of four 8Mb chips, which            means that the card isn't littered with memory chips as has been            the case with other manufacturers' boards though.                    The TNT2 Pro chip itself sits under a rather unassuming looking            heat sink / fan combo. At first sight it appears that the fan is            actually inside the heat sink, but on closer inspection the heat            sink part of the assembly is more for supporting the fan than to            actually dissipate any heat.                    There are some small fins on the heat sink that I'm sure must have            some effect, but bearing in mind that the chip doesn't            actually generate that much heat there should be no problems with            the supplied heat sink and fan.                    The card we tested was an Erazor III Pro Video, and this has one            other feature that makes it stand out a little from the crowd - an            extra output port on the back of the card. I say output port, but            in fact it covers both output and input. The card will accept            either a composite video or S-Video input, and is capable of            producing a display on all three outputs at once, which comprises            two composite video outs and one S-Video out.                    This is certainly an impressive feature and is bound to be used by            some, although it will be a feature lost on many as the processes            involved in editing and recording video on a PC are not entirely            simple tasks. Thankfully the supplied software is reasonably good,            which is certainly a step in the right direction...         In traditional style, Elsa have                 decided to bundle a few little extras with the card. In order                 to promote the gaming aspect of the card they have included                 EA's Need For Speed 4. Although it isn't such a great title,                 it certainly does help show off some of the power of the TNT2                 Pro chip.                    Corel Draw 7 is also included, although seeing that this version is            somewhat dated (the current one being 9!) it may prove to be            somewhat of a token gesture. Admittedly it is still a good piece of            software, and should you be in need of such a package it may well            make a worthwhile contribution to the bundle.                    Thankfully Elsa have also included a program that is aimed at the            video side of the card, which means that you will be able to take            full advantage of the video features out of the box - Elsa's own            MainActor software, which doesn't have the power of larger packages            of this type, such as Adobe's Premier, but still manages to provide            a relatively efficient way of editing video on the PC.         Ultimately though the most                 important thing about the card is the driver, and it is here                 that Elsa have excelled. It is not unusual to see                 manufacturers making only slight cosmetic tweaks to reference                 drivers, but Elsa tend to be much more thorough than just                 changing a few graphics here and there.                    The drivers install several tabs to the advanced display settings,            which allow the configuring of not only the standard NVIDIA            settings (such as image quality, mip-map levels etc) but also much            finer details, including a very precise monitor set up function            which allows truly fantastic fine tuning.                    I haven't seen anything quite so detailed since Matrox's original            PowerDesk drivers, and it is always nice to see greater flexibility            through better drivers. Thumbs up to Elsa!                    The benchmark results show the Erazor III Pro competing quite            evenly with a TNT2 Ultra card. This isn't too surprising when one            considers that there is only about a 5% difference in core clock            speed between these two chips - the TNT2 Pro runs at 143MHz, with a            TNT2 Ultra clocking in at 150MHz.                    The results reflect this relatively small clock difference, but            there is also the possibility of some CPU limitation with the test            machine used. I would therefore be forced to conclude that given            more CPU horsepower the TNT2 Ultra would be capable of creating a            bigger performance gap over the Erazor III Pro. Despite that fact,            the Erazor III Pro would still be capable of producing more than            adequate results.                    Looking at the card in general, it certainly represents good value            for money, and considering that one not only gets a superb 3D            accelerator card but also the ability to input and output images            the card becomes an even more attractive package.                    The only possible bad point to make is that with the advent of the            GeForce256, the TNT2 is no longer the fastest chip on the block and            so may not be quite so attractive to the dedicated gamer.            Fortunately (depending on your perspective) GeForce cards are            rather expensive at the moment, and support for T&L is rather            limited, so there is still plenty of room for the venerable TNT2 on            the performance tree.                    The Erazor III Pro is another great product from Elsa that has            certainly helped place them firmly on the 3D accelerator map.            Release Date - available now"}
