Blue Shift started life as a value-added episode for the ill-fated            Half-Life Dreamcast, and we should have twigged from that that it            would be somewhat brief. Unfortunately though, 'brief' doesn't do            it justice. Blue Shift is downright tiny, taking a mere three hours            to complete for hardened Half-Life players. Newbies may have a bit            more trouble, but this reviewer played through it before lunch            without losing a single life.                         That's not the only problem with Blue Shift, either. Although I'm            hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence            of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and            everything since is frankly bizarre. I fear that the task Gearbox's            designers were set was ~a smaller version of Opposing Force~ or            thereabouts. After all, this was the padding for the Dreamcast game            [Wistful sigh - Ed].                         In terms of the storyline\u2026 we've done an abandoned scientist            and a marine separated from his unit, so now it's time for a            security guard. Our latest hero's name is Barney Calhoun, and like            Freeman before him Calhoun is dropped in the middle of a            cataclysmic crossover between two worlds and forced to fight for            his life, not just against alien intruders but the secret            government forces sent to depopulate the Black Mesa facility.                    Calhoun's journey starts in a Sector G lift with a couple of            stroppy scientists complaining about his workrate. It's during this            journey into the depths of Black Mesa that Freeman and his            collaborators cause the infamous resonance cascade scenario which            plunges the facility into all out conflict. Calhoun faces plenty of            interesting puzzles in his attempts to escape, starting with some            cunning lift/box placing platform antics and moving on to scripted            sequences that depend on destructible scenery and the marine            insertion force. In all, it's nothing Opposing Force didn't do, but            there are some nice touches here and there, and the interaction            with scientists (and the need to keep them alive) is a much higher            priority.                         With Counter-Strike behind us though, you have to wonder why a lot            of Blue Shift has come out the way it has. Gearbox clearly learnt a            few lessons - for example you get new high definition models - but            they haven't realised that the sort of ~drop them if you can~ real            life style of play is what people want. When I picked up the first            M16 dropped by a marine and ploughed into his assembled comrades, I            immediately jump into CS mode. The marines look like Terrorist            guerrillas anyway, so I dropped to my knees and aimed in short            bursts at the upper torso of each aggressor, one by one.                         Bang bang, oh look I'm dead. Why? Because I didn't put 100 bullets            in their heads!                         It doesn't really surprise me that the default loadout is            something like 150 rounds of ammunition and how high the M16's rate            of fire is - you have to put half a clip at least into each of the            marines, and aiming for the weak points doesn't make any            difference. The head, the foot, the midriff, you can shoot            anywhere, it still takes a while for them to flinch, and they make            no attempts to get under cover either. With a bit of tender loving            care from the programmers, these marines could have been ducking in            and out of cover, poking their heads up over crates and chucking            grenades into your cubby hole, or at the very least firing while            moving.                    As it is, it's a step back from the (almost realistic) encounters            seen on the Internet's Counter-Strike servers. It's not terribly            balanced either - it takes 25 rounds from the M16 to drop a marine,            but only one full whack to the upper body from the shotgun. Since            this is probably the last chance Gearbox will have to work with            these sorts of weapons and troops in the Half-Life storyline, it's            a distinct disappointment.                         The only vague improvement in terms of AI over Half-Life and            Opposing Force is the routing of scientists. Since virtually every            scientist you catch up with and drag along with you is led by a            scripted scenario of some sort, they rarely get stuck, since in            effect they're running along an invisible track. That however, is            more than can be said for Calhoun, who I managed to get lodged in a            wall on three separate occasions. The trick to avoiding this is to            follow these simple guidelines: Firstly, don't crouch in lifts.            Secondly, don't walk close to the walls in sections which look as            though they're barren enough to be ~Loading\u2026~ corridors.            Thirdly, don't for heaven's sake crouch in lifts! Sorry, but the            cussing from my window was enough to drive the local children to            violence, so it bears repeating.                         Another thing I found quite annoying in the original Half-Life and            now Blue Shift is the way scientists and other security personnel            seem delighted to talk over one another. In all three single player            Half-Life adventures there have been times when I've thought one            chap had stopped speaking, wheeled round and clicked on his mate            only to hear them both chirp up simultaneously. It would have been            clever (and even amusing) if there was a safe-guard for this with a            little ~oh, you first~, ~no, you first~, ~no, I insist~ heave-ho.                    Visually it's the same old Half-Life with the addition of smarter            high-definition models. The new weapon models are quite nice,            although they look rather cartoony, particularly the M16, which            doesn't look anywhere near as realistic as the similar M4A1 model            seen in pet favourite Counter-Strike. Amazing given the latter was            made by a bunch of part-timers working from their bedrooms.                         Once again Xen lets the game down thanks to its weird visuals and            lack of any noticeable gameplay. I thought that the half an hour            (1/6 of the game) I spent crawling through little passageways on            Xen was easily the most boring part of the game, and I suppose            unsurprisingly Blue Shift continues the downward spiral of poor end            sequences. This doesn't even really qualify. It's a ~right then~ as            opposed to Half-Life's ~cor\u2026~                         Now, if you've done your homework, you will at this point be            whinging, ~for goodness sake man! All this and it only costs a            tenner!~ Well damn me and my high standards. Valve set them with            the original Half-Life, and since then Gooseman and co. have set            them higher with Counter-Strike. A tenner it may cost, but it's            still only three hours of entertainment, and utterly linear with            zero replay value for the average gamer. The inclusion of            high-definition models and other bits and bobs on the CD are useful            but nothing particularly special.                         If you have a yearning for more Half-Life, Blue Shift will            definitely satisfy you for a little while, but this is probably the            original Half-Life's swansong, and it would have been nice to see            them take things a step beyond the cut and paste action format.                        -        Half-Life: Blue Shift                    ScreenshotsHalf-Life: Blue Shift                    ScreenshotsHalf-Life:                    Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life:                    Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life                    Dreamcast PreviewHalf-Life                    Dreamcast Preview"}
