Instead of            killing by trade, 47 is living out his days at a church in Sicily,            helping with repairs and tending to the garden, whilst repenting            his sins with the local priest, but nobody with as much history and            skill as 47 ever truly retires, and our beloved hitman receives a            quick jolt to his senses when his pal the priest is abducted and            ransomed.                    47 isn't likely to pay, so he checks in with his old chums at the            agency and books some correspondence work to pay his dues, and buy            some information on the priest's whereabouts. The game follows his            path through variations locations including Italy, Russia, Japan,            Malaysia and India, as he fights to recover his chum and get back            to retiring. Along the way he has to reemploy an arsenal of weapons            ranging from a fibre wire garrotte and anaesthetic to silenced            hardballers and a sniper rifle in slaying his targets, picking any            way he can through the surrounding area and silently tending to his            mark before making his escape.        The variety of locations means            that Hitman 2 is always a pretty game, but the most notable            graphical work has gone into human movement and weapons behaviour.            Played from either third or first person views, the former keeps            our bald and barcode-headed chum in sight at all times, dressed in            everything from sharp suits and pinstripe tuxedos to the uniforms            of postmen, chefs and delivery boys. Character animation is relaxed            and conventional, and remarkably lifelike. There's no forced speed            unless you make haste of your own accord, and hand and head            movements are slow and deliberate. Models are quite chunky, but            realistically so, and blokes and birds come in plenty of different            builds.                    On the weapons front, the sniper scope quivers with 47's breathing,            and other guns are held firmly and fire with a degree of feedback.            Death animations are numerous and severe, but none more so than the            sight of a man clutching for breath as a fibre wire is gently            slipped beneath his chin and tightened taut. That said, a shotgun            blast can propel a man ten feet backward through the air.                    The environments of Hitman 2 are serene. From the idyllic, Mafioso            Sicilian mansions with their beige walls, lush gardens and towering            wrought iron gates to the snowy streets of St. Petersburg, 47 is            always moving through a real location occupied by real people and            either genuinely beautiful or realistically dank. The developer's            ability to suggest atmosphere through scenery is quite impressive,            too. The church gardens look hot and lively, whereas the            inside of the church with piercing beams of sunlight bouncing off            the floor is quiet and delicate, with the gentle movement of cloth            on the confession booth the most active element in the room.                    Sound is also disposed to accompany with a degree of class. The            soundtrack mixes original compositions with more familiar tunes            reminiscent of The Godfather and other mob and hitman flicks, all            performed by a symphony orchestra and eerily fitting. Cracking            necks and blowing someone's brains all over the wall feels a lot            less brutal with a soothing piece of classical music in the            background.        The action, such that it            is, is also very well realised for the most part. Missions begin at            47's base in the Sicilian church grounds, with a tool shed that            gradually fills up with high calibre weaponry as the game wears on.            After touching base with his handlers, 47 finds himself plonked at            the starting point for his next mission, and it's from here that            the player gets to flex his brains and brawn within the mission            parameters.                    Io has very wisely chosen to bestow most of the impetus on the            player. As a hitman, you have to examine the information at your            disposal, watch entrances and exits and establish the best way to            take out the mark (or marks) given the tools and situation at your            disposal. The game makes a few suggestions, but it's largely your            own calling and trial-and-error that will see you through. Take for            example the first real mission - 47 has to take out a nasty fellow            who may be harbouring the priest in his basement. This means            finding a way past vicious mafia goons into the mansion compound            and then into the house, up the stairs and through guard-packed            rooms into the target's office.        The            clue you're given is that many people often come to pay their            respects to the don. As you might expect, this means that several            people are coming and going through the main entrance. If you            happen to quietly bump one of them off with a garrotte (like the            postman) and pinch his outfit, then drag his lifeless body (in a            very well animated fashion) somewhere it's unlikely to be            disturbed, you can pick up his bunch of flowers and saunter through            the main gate. But, you'll have to ditch the hardballers and            silenced 9mm before you can do that, or the guards will pick them            up during the frisk and rob you of your ambition.                    That's one option, but it leaves you ill equipped to deal with the            countless enemies inside. Another idea is to go round to the back            and take out the grocery boy. He's hardly going to be missed, and            he happens to be carrying great big trays of food and drink through            the back gate and into the kitchens at the back of the house. If            you take this route, you can hide your guns in with the groceries            and sneak past the guards fully armed. From then on, it's only a            question of working out the best way to the mark.                    Unfortunately, the game relies to a large extent on trial and            error. You'll come unstuck about 15-20 times before you make a            breakthrough, and it's all to do with watching guard patterns,            having the guts to make a break for it when the opportunity arises            and not arousing suspicion. If a goon thinks you're trouble, he'll            raise the alarm and cause you untold problems - and like real life,            a direct attack from a handful of heavily armed henchmen is going            to leave you dead.                    However, the wealth of options at your fingertips is almost            unfathomable. You can take almost any route imaginable, and opt to            kill in whatever way you please, and you can make liberal use of            mid-level saves if you're on a particularly good run.        With all this choice within such a            beautiful game, you could be forgiven at this stage for wondering            where the flaws kick in, and I don't blame you, but for all its            non-linearity and serenity, Hitman 2 really boils down to a game of            substitution and repetition, with some quirky control and camera            habits. It's too hard to switch weapons and behave actively in            close combat - your average assassin is more than a match for any            henchman hand-to-hand, but 47 is clumsy and hard to manoeuvre, with            virtually nothing to say for himself other than blam blam and then            club club with the butt of a gun.                    The third person mode should be the easiest way to silently remove            targets, but the much more irksome first person perspective is            actually a lot easier to rely on because of the way the controls            behave. The whole game is far too relaxed to support third person            close-quarters hit-work, and the AI is far too suspicious, easily            alarmed and once so, efficient for you to wire-tug your way through            the single player game. It's also a bit unbalanced in places,            allowing you to stomp through a mission blowing your cover in            seconds because the scripting dictates that nothing bad can become            of your contact or the priest, leaving you to do as you like.                    So, for the most part Hitman 2 is a sniper's game with a lot of            other paths to opt for if you fancy a challenge, and it suffers a            bit for it. If Io had found a way to smooth things out in the            up-close-and-personal department and eliminate some of the            trial-and-error gameplay, then this would be an excellent,            all-round hitman simulation with a wonderful cinematic vibe running            through it. As it is, it's a very good hitman simulation which will            be remembered for its brutality and non-linearity, even if it is            pretty unforgiving.
