I am not some sort of 'Pokemaniac', but if you            are, Pokemon Stadium 2 is just as exciting a proposition as its            predecessor. On the other hand, if for some bizarre reason you want            to join the ranks of the Pokemon-obsessed with no experience thus            far, neither Stadium 2 nor its predecessor is the gateway. Pick up            one of the recent GameBoy titles - Stadium is for vets.                         Pokemon Stadium 2 is a turn-based fighting game. You take your            Pokemon and compete in a bunch of tournaments for various prizes.            But it's not for beginners. For starters, you will need the            Transfer Pak and a reasonably advanced copy of one of the GameBoy            releases to get anything out of it at all. Into the Transfer Pak            you will plug your copy of Pokemon Gold, Silver, Yellow, Blue, Red            or Crystal, and at the start of a battle a little GB icon appears            next to your controller so you can select and upload characters            from the GameBoy cartridge if you so desire.                         Stadium 2 consists of a huge game world, featuring the Stadium,            your house, the Pokemon Academy, the Pokemon Lab, Gym Leader            Castle, GameBoy Tower and the mini-games area. At the Stadium there            are four cups to compete in, with up to 251 Pokemon at your            disposal, depending on your success in the GameBoy games. When you            get bored of fighting, you can go and check out one of the game's            other locations. Taking a breather at your House you will see all            the details of your home in the relevant GameBoy game. If you have            decorated, this will be obvious on the N64 too. If you fancy some            adventuring, you can head up to GameBoy Tower, where you can play            whichever Pokemon cartridge you have plugged into the Transfer Pak,            in gloriously blocky detail on your television.                    Amongst the various other activities are the new Pokemon Academy            and the Pokemon Lab. At the latter you can trade, examine and            rearrange Pokemon, treating them like a card collection. At the            Academy you can view research materials on our little furry            friends, or sit through one of Professor Earl's lectures. Each            lecture culminates in a test and then a chance to try out the finer            points of Pokemon battling in a sparring session, to show you            understood the lecture.                         Other diversions include Gym Leader Castle, which offers plenty of            intense battles that reward you with a Dodrio GameBoy for speeding            up Gold or Silver when you play them through the N64, and then of            course there are also the mini-games. There are plenty of these to            go through, so if you do buy Stadium 2 you might want to pace            yourself and save a few for the next time you get really sick of            turn-based fighting (it happens). Some of the mini-games are simple            count-the-Pokemon style games, while others are more involved            allowing for up to four-player action. Winning mini-games gives you            coins for the Pokemon Casino.                         Visually Pokemon Stadium 2 is as good as one might expect from the            ailing N64, although the graphics are effectively the same as those            found in the original Pokemon Stadium. The characters are nicely            drawn and the animation is fluid enough, but obviously they look a            bit jagged. Presentation throughout the game is very impressive,            with friendly menus and interface in keeping with one of the            strongest traditions of the Pokemon franchise: cutesy-wutesy-ness.                    Of course, the meat of the game is the turn-based fighting. Now            this is something you are either going to love or hate, but            unfortunately it may take a while for you to really start to hate            it. The Stadium games are extremely repetitive, asking you to            basically take various Pokemon through fights against other Pokemon            with different strengths and weaknesses, all in pursuit of various            cups, prizes and the like. Often a cup will consist of 32 battles            at least, and the competition is ferocious. You will want to groom            your Pokemon for quite a while in advance.                         The problem is quite simply that the repetition doesn't really            yield any particular reward. For Pokemon fans, maybe some new cup            or trophy would be an incentive, but personally I wanted the            equivalent of cold, hard cash. I wanted new toys, basically, and            what I got after hours of clenched teeth and blasphemous outbursts            was the ability to play one of the GameBoy games I didn't have at            double its normal speed.                         To be fair, victory often does feel like something of an            accomplishment, particularly when it's a big challenge like the            game's Prime Cup, but by about the three-hundredth battle my            patience was wearing awfully thin. The other annoying thing about            battling is the commentator. He clearly has been afforded about two            bytes of memory for both of his lines, the most common of which is            ~this Pokemon was badly injured~. Thanks for the newsflash,            brainiac! Apart from this travesty, which can thankfully be turned            off, the game generally sounds okay, with booming sound effects for            the various attacks.                    My interest in Pokemon Stadium 2 waned after about four hours, and            by the seventh or eighth I was sick to death of it. As much as I            enjoy the various products of the Pokemon franchise, this is one of            those games where you do the same thing over and over and over            again, probably just to get the chance to do it once more. High            points include the Pokemon Academy and the ability to play the            GameBoy games on your television screen, but in practice you will            need to have an unhealthy obsession for this game to last you            longer than a day or two. Still, if you enjoy it that much, more            power to you, but you probably won't have read this review            anyway...                        -                            Pokemon Stadium 2 screenshots                    Pokemon Stadium 2 screenshots                    Pokemon Crystal screenshots                    Pokemon Crystal screenshots"}
