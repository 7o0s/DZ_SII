It's not every day you            come across a game in which the primary objective is to assume the            role of a tiny flying insect on a blood-sucking rampage around a            family home. It involves aerial acrobatic skills, stealth and            cunning, quick reactions and, perhaps best of all, cute Japanese            girls. But we'll try not to let that make our minds up... ahem.                         It's summer, and Mr Moskeeto has chosen the home of the Yamada            family as his dining location. The three members of the family,            consisting of two parents and their teenage daughter, go about            their business as you would expect; watching television, cooking            and taking baths and so on in each of the house's twelve rooms.            Your first course of action is trying to figure out where to sting            the person, as they could well have applied bug spray, meaning you            can't simply land anywhere you like.                         Sometimes your landing points are pointed out immediately by red            targeting squares, and at other times you may need to employ some            sort of environment manipulation which will reveal appropriate            areas of skin. For example, on the first level the girl is snoozing            on her bed and you can't see where you might be able to land. A            quick reconnaissance of the room reveals a light switch, and you            hurtle towards it and switch it off. This causes the girl to get up            from her bed to turn the light back on, highlighting an area on her            thigh ripe for sucking (I'm trying desperately not to make this            sound perverse, I promise).                    Once you know where you're supposed to be landing, it's a case of            getting close enough for you to lock-on without the family member            noticing you. As soon as you're actually on the skin the procedure            for juicing your target is an art in itself, which involves the            delicate rotation of the right analogue stick. The speed at which            you rotate affects a kind of awareness meter that dictates whether            or not you're going to get swatted. You need to speed up and slow            down in order to keep the meter in the blue until all your blood            tanks are full up - spend too long in the red and it can be game            over almost instantly, unless you notice the warning signs and take            off before they can get to you.                         Should you completely foul up your stealthy approach and get            spotted, you're granted a warning in the form of your screen            turning red. You need to use this time to get out of sight until            the human calms down and you can try again. However, failure to do            that sends you into a battle mode, and this is where the real            challenges lie. The person begins doing everything they can to try            and dispose of you, including flinging their arms at you, spraying            insecticides, and trying to shoot you with water from a showerhead.            Stopping them in their tracks involves locking on to a ~pressure            point~ somewhere on their body and hitting it, sending them into            some kind of relaxed bliss. The further you get into the game, the            more pressure points there are to hit on each person, and as the            battle mode appears with greater regularity it can become extremely            annoying.                         The environments for you to fly about in are as varied as you'd            expect, from store cupboards and kitchen to bedrooms and bathroom,            and each is fairly nicely decked out despite the textures appearing            rather rudimentary at times. The human characters are nicely            modelled and animated, although there are occasionally slack            moments where they end up walking about like zombies on rails. The            voice acting, however, is utterly diabolical. This adds to the            oddball, humorous atmosphere though, until the meandering and            pointless cut-scenes between each level get mind-numbingly            irritating that is.                    Despite things starting out well for Mr Moskeeto, the novelty wears            thin disappointingly quickly, and there really isn't anything here            to keep you coming back, past the adolescent thrill of swooping            down on a buxom teenager in the bath. I can think of a number of            extras they could have stuffed into the title to make it a            worthwhile purchase; what about some kind of PilotWings-style            flying tests, or obstacle courses to take part in? What about            racing, target practice, or even a multiplayer section of            mini-games a la Super Monkey Ball? There are a ton of missed            opportunities here, and I'm afraid for that reason Mr Moskeeto just            isn't worth the outlay."}
