But for once this sort of shady brand piggy-backing isn't            going to harm anybody, because GT Advance is a damned fine racing            title. Also, in fairness to THQ the Japanese release was labelled            Advanced GTA, which would have caused just as much confusion.                         It boasts 45 licensed vehicles although a number of those are            indigenous to Japan, but the style is decidedly Western, with a            sweet, arcade racer style of gameplay that relies on the mastering            of powerslides. There are a good number of tracks (32) and support            for two players via link cable, completing an impressive package,            but one marred slightly elsewhere by sloppy cost-cutting. We'll get            to that later though.                         GT Advance features several single player modes, but the            Championship is where you'll spend most of your time. It's a race            against seven other vehicles on increasingly tricky courses, and as            the track and competition improves your mastery of powersliding            will also have to as well. Maintaining speed into and out of            corners is the most important factor, but so is avoiding            unnecessary contact with the barriers. As you progress (by            finishing in the top four) you receive a bounty of new vehicles and            upgrades, which have to be applied through the car select and            tuning menus. The car select is pretty obvious, but tuning is a            little nondescript. You receive all these extras, like steel rods            and other bits, and they have to be applied every time you switch            car, but there is no indication of what they actually do, other            than the way they ~upgrade~ your car. Still\u2026                    Powersliding isn't a difficult art to master, but the tracks are            often narrow and unconventional so you have to keep your wits about            you. The other cars put up a decent fight as well, and many races            are decided on the final lap's powersliding more than anything            else. Cars space out as the race goes on, so there's a real sense            of adrenaline pumping as you pip your opponent past the chequered            flag on the last corner.                         As you improve so does the game, and since you'll all start out on            the Beginner setting (losers!) there are further difficult levels            to explore. The hardest is positively devilish.                         We didn't get a chance to test the link up option, but we're led            to believe that it's remarkably playable, as long as both drivers            get a decent amount of light on their screens so they can see. We            can imagine the competition being fairly nail-biting, especially on            some of the more difficult tracks, like the tortuous figure of            eight with the narrow gangways down the centre and the large            oval-shaped map where one mis-timed powerslide is all it takes to            win or lose.                    The technology of GT Advance's visuals is similar to that of            F-Zero, with a flat, painted road sprawled out in front of you            scaling as you twist and turn. Although it's hardly 3D (it's more            Outrun Advance than anything), it does feel suitably depthy. The            only thing we'd have to take issue with is the way the track            boundaries are so hard to distinguish from the rest of the course.            Since they're painted on to the same scaling plane, telling them            apart from things you can drive on is difficult - usually it's just            a change of colour.                         Thanks to the map display in the upper left hand corner of the            screen this isn't too much of an issue though, as turnings are easy            to work out in advance, but with that said, in a game that relies            so heavily on minute margins and perfect sliding, it's a bit            short-sighted.                         Another issue that it's difficult not to mark GT Advance down on            is its lack of variety in its locations. All right, others haven't            been quite so critical of this, but for me, two or three different            types of environment is a little less than I'd hoped for. Even            F-Zero had more, and there isn't exactly much room for movement            there\u2026 Ideally there would be the usual road and offroad            gravel types, but also some gimmickery, like bridge races and such.            The formula may be pretty conventional, but that doesn't mean you            can't spice it up!                    The biggest let down of all though is something that has been            changed in the transition from Advanced GTA (Japan) to GT Advance            Championship Racing. In fact, we didn't realise this until the            first time we came back to the UK version of the game after turning            off the console. The Japanese version features built-in battery            backup RAM, which of course saves players' time by simply            remembering everything - conquered tracks, cars, extra fittings            etc. In the move from East to West though, this crucial feature has            been discarded in favour of an utterly archaic password system.                         Lets be clear, we don't have a problem with password systems, but            only as a last resort! There can be no other explanation for the            absence of battery backup than pure laziness and cost-cutting.            Having to remember a 16 character alphanumeric passcode is an            absurdity I'm not acquainted with, but apparently it's the in thing            for GT Advance players. Since I've started playing I have gone            through a whole page of an A5 pad simply writing down passwords.            And they're difficult to make out on the screen too, so you end up            getting them wrong every once in a while, which is really tedious.                         We have no sympathy for THQ on this one - the absence of battery            backup RAM is like a fatal blow to the heart of a noble hero. It            mars an otherwise excellent racing game!                         So here are your prospects: either you buy the UK version and on            the way home pop into your local stationers for a few trees' worth            of paper to scribble down the codes, or you could figure out            how to import the Japanese version for a few quid more. Most of the            menus are in English and there's no laborious password system.            Whatever your decision, you should definitely own GT Advance one            way or another, as current gripe excepted; it's a sterling example            of handheld racing done properly.                        -                            GT Advance Championship Racing Screenshots                    GT Advance Championship Racing ScreenshotsGT                    Advance Championship Racing PreviewGT                    Advance Championship Racing Preview"}
