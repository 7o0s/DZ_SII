It was a huge hit, both critical            and commercial, and is arguably one of the best games ever released            on Playstation.                    Flash forward to the tail end of the year 2000, and Metal Gear            Solid has finally come to the PC, thanks to Microsoft. As well as            the full game, the PC version also includes the ~VR Missions~            add-on, which acts as a training mode and also makes a nice            diversion when you get stuck in the main game, giving you literally            hundreds of (very) short missions to get your teeth stuck into.            It's taken two and a half years, but was it worth the wait? Has the            game matured or just decayed with age? And will the console            gameplay translate well to our big beige boxes?                    As with the Playstation original, the game puts you in the shoes of            Solid Snake, a genetically engineered secret operative called back            to active duty to take on a group of renegade special forces troops            who have take over a nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska.            Of course, there is much more to it than that, and you soon find            yourself caught up in a vast conspiracy which makes the X-Files            look like wishful thinking, involving the government, the military,            and big business.                    What is the real purpose behind the mecha known as Metal Gear, and            what is it doing in Alaska? Why did the special forces troops            revolt, and who is their leader? Who are you, for that matter? And            who, if anyone, can you trust? Throw in some love interest in the            shape of a young and inexperienced female soldier caught up in the            revolt, and add a touch of mystery in the form of a ghostly ninja            whose true identity and purpose are unknown, and you have Metal            Gear Solid...                    The labyrinthine storyline is one of Metal Gear Solid's            strongpoints, and you are kept guessing as to what is really going            on and what the real motives are behind the various characters            involved in the whole mess. Constant chatter on your ~codec~ (a            personal radio system) from your support team back at HQ and other            characters keeps you up to date, and in-game cutscenes mingle with            FMV footage of nuclear weapons tests and genetic experiments to            keep you on the edge of your seat.                    In fact, Metal Gear Solid is really more of an interactive movie            than an actual game. It took me about twelve hours to complete the            game, and at least half of that time must have been spent watching            cutscenes and listening to the incessant interruptions of the            Colonel, Doctor Naomi Hunter and others on my codec. The dialogue            can be rather long-winded at times, and even the final climactic            battle is split up into three seperate sections by cutscenes, one            of which is over fifteen minutes long!                    The pacing is truly atrocious, and it seems like every time you get            on an adrenaline high the game suddenly grinds to a halt to preach            to you about the evils of nuclear war. Much as I sympathise with            the message, being beaten over the head with it every hour or two            with all the subtlety of a length of lead pipe soon starts to            grate. On the Playstation this works because you are playing the            game on a TV set and probably sat on your couch. Hunched in front            of a PC monitor on a chair, the lengthy cutscenes just seem out of            place.                    On the bright side, apart from occasionally bludgeoning you with            the moral of the story (war is bad, nuclear weapons are bad, don't            trust the military), the cutscenes and dialogue are excellent by            video game standards, and the voice acting is generally top            quality. The only let down is the big villain, Liquid Snake, who            has the misfortune to sound just like the well-spoken criminal from            The Simpsons, making it rather hard to take him seriously. It's            also rather disturbing that you have to kill him five times before            he finally gives up, and yet apart from a few scratches he still            looks to be in perfect shape right to the end. Even James Bond            doesn't look that good after being blown up (twice), dropped from            fifty feet up in the air, shot with a heavy machinegun, and then            rolled over in a jeep at high speed...                    There is a game in between all of those excellent cutscenes though,            and the good news is that it's really rather good. Although you            have a wide variety of weapons to use and can even resort to            fisticuffs, the focus is very much on stealth, making this a kind            of third person ~Thief : The Dark Project~ with guns.                    Trying to blast your way through the game is likely to end in            disaster, and so the best approach is to try and avoid any contact            with the enemy, edging your way along walls, crawling through            ventilation ducts, and hiding in dark corners while guards pass            you. The soldiers guarding the Alaskan base were genetically            engineered to give them improved eye sight and hearing according to            the storyline, but luckily for you the batch you have come up            against must have been the drop-outs, because you can sneak right            past them without too much trouble. You will also find security            cameras, infra-red sensors, trap-doors and automatic sentry guns            blocking your way, not to mention plenty of locked doors which you            will need different levels of security key cards to open.                    The range and field of vision of the guards and security cameras            are marked out for you on a little radar display in the top right            of the screen, which allows you to judge when you can sneak past            them and when to hide. The real master stroke is that once you have            been spotted your radar system will be jammed, and you have to run            and hide, avoiding detection until the guards give up looking for            you and go back to their regular patrols. The result is positively            nerve-shattering.                    Of course, you can choose to try and take down the guards, but            almost as fast as you can kill them more will appear from the edges            of the maps, making any pitched battles with the terrorists            dangerous. On the bright side you do have a full armoury to play            with, including heat-seeking and guided missiles, frag and chaff            grenades, pistols and assault rifles, and even a sniper rifle. You            also have food rations to replenish your health, and a range of            other items including drugs to make your aim steadier when using            the sniper rifle, and a pair of binoculars which allow you to zoom            in and observe distant enemies.                    The game is normally played from a third person view, looking down            on your character from above. At times this switches to fixed            pre-scripted cameras to give certain locations a more cinematic            feel, and your view will also shift if you back up against a wall            or crate, allowing you to see what is going on behind you and watch            for guards passing by.                    Also included in the PC version is a first person view which was            previously only available in the Japanese ~Integral~ release of            Metal Gear Solid, after you had already completed the game once to            unlock it. The first person view is very useful at times, but this            is no Quake - the controls are faithful to the game's console            roots, which means no mouse look and some rather awkward controls            designed to be used with a joypad, and a bug means that you can't            pick up any items without switching back to the standard third            person cam. The game also looks pretty awful from the first person            view at times.                    Which is perhaps the biggest problem - Metal Gear Solid was            released in the hey-day of the Playstation. Two years ago it would            have looked good even on a PC, but in these days of universal 3D            acceleration it all looks rather dated. Characters are chunky,            looking like a cubist's nightmare, and their textures are fairly            low resolution. Animations frequently stretch the characters out of            shape, and there's no lip-synching or facial movement of any kind            during the many in-engine cutscenes. The maps lack detail as well,            and the whole game seems to have been ported pixel for pixel from            the original Playstation version.                    Which is a shame, because your PC is being wasted. Metal Gear Solid            ran silky smooth at its maximum resolution of 1024x768 with 16            sample anti-aliasing on my GeForce 2 graphics card, showing that            almost none of its rendering power was actually being used by the            game. Given that the base in which the game takes place is very            small and the number of characters limited, you would have thought            that Microsoft could quite easily have re-built the entire game to            use more polygons and higher resolution textures. As it is, this is            a faithful recreation of the Playstation original, but apart from a            slightly more flexible save game system and some improved lighting            effects, it really doesn't add anything to take advantage of the            vastly superior processing power of modern PCs.                    Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation was undoubtedly a great game,            but the passing of almost three years and the transition to the PC            has somewhat dented its appeal. It's also rather obvious that the            developers realised towards the end of the game that it was going            to be far too short, resorting to the old trick of forcing you to            backtrack across large portions of the game world (no less than            three times!) to make it seem longer.                    At the end of the day though, Metal Gear Solid is still a great            game for all of its flaws. The graphics are poor by today's            standards, the cinematics dominate the game, and the controls can            be awkward at times, but the plot and characters are truly            involving, the music, voice acting and sound excellent, and the            gameplay still shines through.                    If you already own a copy of the Playstation original then buying            it again on PC is a little pointless, because apart from the first            person view and higher resolution graphics nothing is really added.            But if you haven't played Metal Gear Solid before then it's            certainly well worth your money to see how the other half live..."}
