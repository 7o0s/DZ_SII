This was a time of war and chaos, with the Han dynasty in            ruins and the rival kingdoms of Wu, Shu and Wei battling it out for            supremacy.                        Any similarity to persons living or dead is purely coincidental            though - Kessen II is about as historically accurate as Crouching            Tiger, but in its own strange way just as much fun. Playing as the            Shu leader Liu Bei, you must lead your armies to victory in a            series of massive battles against the tyrant Cao Cao. Along the way            the plot has more twists and turns than your average soap opera,            with generals switching sides, alliances being forged and broken,            new armies appearing just in the nick of time, and spectacular            magical attacks carrying the day.                        The characters themselves are reduced to caricatures, but like the            costumes they wear they're colourful and distincitive. Lui Bei (in            reality a middle aged general) comes across as a typical Final            Fantasy style whining teenager, who leads his people to war because            Cao Cao kidnapped a dancing girl he fancied. His sworn brother            Zhang Fei is a brave but drunken fool with a tendency to bite off            more than he can chew, while many of his generals are buxom young            ladies who act like giddy schoolgirls most of the time. Luckily the            sheer silliness pervading the whole game makes it a joy to play,            with the sometimes frankly surreal cutscenes either carrying the            story forwards or simply leaving you staring at the screen in utter            disbelief.                    It might all sound a little bewildering, but in stark contrast to            Koei's impenetrable Dynasty Warriors III, here the plot actually            makes some kind of warped sense. New characters are introduced            gradually throughout the campaign, and a helpful voice-over            explains what's going on between battles as your armies advance and            retreat across a big map of China.                        A similar approach is taken to introducing you to the game's            tactical possibilities, with more complex unit formations and            spectacular new spells being unlocked as your generals gain            experience from one battle to the next. While you can comfortably            win the earlier battles without worrying too much about what            formation each of your units is in, magic plays a vital role right            from the start, and knowing how and where to use it is the key to            winning a battle.                        Generals have special abilities which vary from simply firing a            volley of arrows or leading a charge through the enemy to disrupt            their ranks to awe inspiring elemental attacks that can severely            demoralize your foe. Giant balls of fire fall from the sky and            bounce through a fight, fissures open up in the ground and swallow            anybody in their path, and tornados sweep across the battlefield            sucking up enemy troops and then dropping their remains from a            great height. The results are always a joy to behold, and can often            sway the course of a battle.                    Before you can unleash lightning storms and meteor showers on your            foe, you must first find and engage them. Battles begin with a war            council where your generals will offer you one or more plans.            Sometimes it's simply a case of deciding who stays behind to defend            the storehouse, other times you have wildly differing plans to            choose from, with the opportunity to set an ambush, lay mines or            take advantage of terrain.                        Once you've selected a plan your units are lined up accordingly on            the battlefield, but although they start out with preset orders            dictated by your choice of battle plan, you can interrupt at any            point to discard or adjust your plan from the battle map. Here you            can view the lay of the land and the locations of your own units            and any enemy forces within your sight, using a simple interface            that looks like something from a History Channel documentary.            Individual units can be given new destinations using the D-pad. If            the destination is another friendly unit they will support it. If            it's an enemy unit, they will attack it. And that's about as            complex as it gets.                        The interface and controls might be rather basic, but there's            plenty of room for crafty tactics as you try to gang up on stray            units and stop the enemy from bringing his whole army into play.            Terrain features such as hills, mountains, forests and bridges can            be used to your advantage, and in some missions you even get to            fight from boats in river battles, or besiege cities using            battering rams to knock down the vast gates and ladders to clamber            over the towering walls. Others include storehouses which replenish            the special abilities of nearby generals more rapidly, and            conversely destroying your enemy's supplies can dent their will to            fight.                    While you're looking at the 2D battle map the game is paused, so            once you have laid your plans you need to switch back to the 3D            viewpoint before anything will actually happen. Here you can trail            any of your units as they run around, kicking up little clouds of            dust as their horses gallop over the grass.                        The real fun begins when one of your armies comes into contact with            an enemy force, at which point you can either sit back and watch            hundreds of tiny soldiers swarm over each other, or take direct            control over one of that unit's hero characters and ride through            the battle, leading charges and picking the right time to unleash a            devestating spell or special ability. The ultimate goal is to            reduce either the manpower or the morale of your enemy to zero, at            which point their leader will flee and you can move your unit on to            fight somebody else. Both statistics are conveniently listed at the            top of the screen alongside your own so that you can see how the            fight is going at a glance.                        Once the enemy's leading general is forced to flee the battle is            yours. Before the next battle you will have more choices to make            though, such as whether to train your existing troops, hunt down a            man-eating tiger or try to recruit a wavering enemy general. Later            on in the game you will often have to split your troops as well,            with a choice of which battle you want to lead personally. The            campaign might be essentially linear, but you won't necessarily            fight the same battles every time you play, and the wealth of            battle plans, tactical opportunities, strategic choices and special            abilities on offer gives plenty of replay value.                    Kessen II might not be the most complex or challenging strategy            game we've ever seen, but with a mixture of colourful graphics and            easy to pick up gameplay it's perhaps a perfect fit for the            PlayStation 2. Yes, the dialogue is exceptionally cheesy, the            translations not always very good, and the cutscenes at times            bizarre, but it's an entertaining and strangely involving game."}
