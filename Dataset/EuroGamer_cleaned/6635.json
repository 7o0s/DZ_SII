What it would have been like had            the United States decided to do something? Or whether the Italians            could successfully invade Germany? Well, probably not the latter,            but these and many more peculiar possibilities can be realised in            World War II themed Hearts of Iron from Paradox, the makers of the            successful Europa Universalis I & II strategy games.                    Let's get it straight from the start though: Hearts of Iron is            definitely old school. So if you are expecting snazzy graphics and            gut wrenching audio, please collect your coat and have your ticket            refunded at the door. Also, be warned, this really is for the            die-hard strategist out there, not a simple drop in and have a            quick play type of game. Those still with me, don your gas masks            and buckle your seatbelts, it's time to go to war!        Your first            port of call really ought to be the tutorials, as there is a heck            of a lot of statistical information and a number of different game            screens for you to negotiate cold. However, the tutorials are            unforgivably poor, consisting of unfriendly reams of badly            formatted text and yellow arrows that are often obscured,            apparently showing you what you are currently learning. We quite            literally gave up in the end, preferring to risk learning the game            by myself instead of trying to make sense of the tutorials. In this            day and gaming age a voice-driven tutorial system is not exactly            hard to achieve, and would have made initial opinions far more            favourable.                    You have a choice of three periods of World War II to be dropped            into, with accurate conditions for each, and having selected one,            you get to choose which country you want to control. The warring            nations are split into three distinct factions; the Allies, Axis            and the Comintern, and your chosen country will be pigeonholed into            whichever is appropriate, or can begin as a neutral. It is then a            simple case of battling against the other factions for land            occupancy, and whoever has the most points at the end of the            scenario period wins. You can choose to play the game as pretty            much any country imaginable, though naturally if you select a            'weaker' country (such as Portugal) you are going to find your            influence on proceedings a touch more difficult than if you were to            go full on as the Germans or the British.                    Not helping matters, the interface really is quite cumbersome to            use, and nothing seems to have been designed to make things easy            for you. The first hour or so is spent simply trying to get your            head round the interface. Unit location can be pretty confusing,            and specific selection can be a frustrating affair. This is mainly            because each province has them all piled on top of each other, and            selecting individually involves clicking a tiny rectangular bar            below the top unit. You would think that drag selecting would            assist you with this, but it merely highlights the topmost unit,            and nothing underneath! All the while you are valiantly trying to            select a unit, message boxes pop up on the screen, providing you            with useful information about so-and-so invading your territory,            attacking your naval fleet etc, etc. These boxes just keep on            coming though, and when you have to click 'OK' on each and every            one of them it starts to make the blood boil. You can reduce the            amount of pop-up messages via the horribly thought-out message            options screen, but not being able to select all options means you            have to go through every single option to disable the associated            pop-up. Cheers for that.        When you finally do start warring            against another country you will happily sit back and watch your            brave soldiers doing battle. Actually no, you will sit there,            watching your unit move to the location via a thin status line,            after instructing them with an attack plan, watch an uninspired            animation of the battle scene and wait for a pop-up box telling you            how you did. Not exactly riveting stuff. We're not asking for a            full-on FPS-style graphical depiction here, just a little more in            the way of separate news flashes coming from the scene along with a            bit of audio to spice it up a little. Maybe even have the ability            to issue new orders mid-fight, or alter unit aggression\u2026            anything! When you consider that the combat is one of the main            aspects of the game, that lack of real involvement is a bit            surprising. The combat box does give you scope for tactics though            with the ability to set certain times for your units to attack,            useful if you want to co-ordinate a ground force attack with            airborne so they invade in unison.                    HoI is played in real-time, though it follows a turn-based round            system whereby all new game data is updated at noon every day. When            you actually study what is going on in the game though, you realise            just how impressive the game's data engine is. Every one of your            units has a whole load of statistics attached to it, and combat            will take all of these factors into consideration. Not only this,            but you can govern what diplomatic relations you have with other            countries, the supplies your provinces require and a whole plethora            of other factors which can have a bearing on the final outcome of            the game. Hell, you can even get stuck into the world trade market            if you wish. This obscene amount of information is simply not going            to be to everybody's tastes, but for an intricate tactician it is            paradise.                    As mentioned above, graphically the game will win no prizes,            limited to a zoomable world map and still shots of various World            War II locations. We also experienced a rather irritating flash of            the screen every few seconds - whether this is an issue with our            GeForce 4 Ti4200, we don't know, but it hurt. Furthermore, the            small amount of animation that exists really is pretty poor, but it            does serve the purpose of showing troop movement where a change of            colour might just as well have done the job. Sound is also minimal,            consisting of trudging shoes and engine sounds giving you notice of            the unit you have selected. Hardly WarCraft, then. Elsewhere, music            is rumbling classical fare, and generally grates after a very short            period of time, so for us the music volume slider hit zero before            long.                    The casual gamer should steer well clear. It just isn't very            friendly and not the type of game you can drop into for a quick            burn. However, for the more detail-driven strategy fan there is a            lot to be commended, and a lot of pleasure to be extracted. You            will often find the game AI to be inconsistent, in addition to the            rather dull combat representation, but HoI offers LAN and internet            options for up to eight hardcore strategy buffs, should you want            that human touch. Internet play is actually good fun, if a little            slow in getting a game going.                    On the whole, my recommendation would be to try before you buy.            Hearts of Iron is a tough nut to crack, but statistically minded            war buffs would do well to investigate.
