That said, Taito            have made a mint by turning obscure concepts into amusing            videogames. Bubble Bobble for instance. The latest product of the            company's overactive creative department is Power Diggerz, a game            about controlling a digger. This would be easy enough to understand            if it weren't for the turtles, beach balls and soup juggling.                        Published by JVC in the UK and priced reasonably at just            \u00a319.99, Power Diggerz will be an essential party game for most            PSone owners. To begin with, players have to pass a number of tests            to receive their digger license, and these generally consist of            manipulating the digger arm to pick things up (gingerly or            otherwise), dig things up and smash things. Your ten aptitude tests            include driving (quickly and with precision), scooping, digging and            flattening.                         The control system uses both analogue sticks (the wacky,            proprietary Power Diggerz controller we saw before Christmas will            not be appearing alongside the game sadly), but after a while the            system is surprisingly easy to use. You can move the arm up and            down, left and right, and move the bucket in or out to scoop things            up. Thanks to some of the gentler license tests, getting the hang            of this isn't a problem, and before long I had a Gold license. If            you don't suck as much as I do, you might get Platinum!                    Adding a little depth to the game, Taito has included three diggers            in total, each corresponding to a difficulty level: easy, medium            and hard. Although it lacks muscle, the PC30 is a small, capable            digger that can move quickly and allows for precise digging, whilst            the PC100 is a medium size vehicle that can't keep up with its            little brother but has the power to out-lift it. At the top of the            chain is the monstrous PC1100, which can rip cars to shreds and            wreck buildings in a flash. Unfortunately its brute strength and            unwieldy arm make precision digging a lot harder, and players are            penalized if they knock down the scenery!                         The single player game is roughly made up of cute mini games and            other digger-related tasks. This is where things start to get a            little weird. For instance, one of the eight mini games involves            rescuing turtles from a swimming pool. The slippery turtles            (including a special golden turtle) have point values, and scoring            enough points completes the level. It's possible to use the bucket            to pick the little blighters up, but dipping the digger arm in and            out of the water is a better method.                         As you improve you find yourself unlocking various secret mini            games and other extras with the money you win, and the game also            has a couple of more obscure extras, like a photo gallery and some            full motion video surprises. Apart from this you can gain extra            Continues and access a bonus Technician mode, which features secret            Time Trial tasks called Whack A Mole, Destroy The House, Destroy            The Car and Load A Sand Truck. All of which reminded me of those            barrel-smashing bonus levels in Street Fighter II.                    Graphically Power Diggerz is more than functional. The game            surroundings are sparsely detailed and the textures are standard            PSone fare, but the diggers themselves are pretty cute (or as cute            as a digger can be). The two-player mode is a pleasant            distraction, allowing diggers to go at it head-to-head through the            various mini games, and a construction kit is also included,            allowing you to shape new realms for your digging delights,            something which will no doubt please both designers and            demolition bods. Although Power Diggerz is a mite easy to complete,            the variety of activities and the multiplayer mode should keep you            coming back. It's certainly worth \u00a319.99 of your hard earned            readies. After all, it's a game about diggers - isn't that what            every man wants?                        -                            Power Diggerz preview                    Power Diggerz preview"}
