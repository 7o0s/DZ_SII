Most people simply            couldn't wait for the UK release in February 2002, so by the time            it was released here there was already a well-established base of            local folks on the US servers. Unfortunately, the UK and US            versions were incompatible, meaning that if you wanted to            experience the lag friendly Euro servers you had to start again            from scratch. Not something you wanted to do if you had a cherished            high-level character or guild to stick with.                    As you would expect the European servers suffered in popularity,            but to be quite frank we enjoyed our return to the lands of DAOC in            a small way because of this. Something the original game doesn't            lack is content, with there being just enough in the way of quests            and interesting camp spots to keep you going. A year down the line            and Mythic have released 'Shrouded Isles', the first official            expansion pack, fleshing the DAOC world out even further. So,            having dusted off our capes and tight leggings, we returned once            again to Camelot.                    Aside: it's important to note here that existing players shouldn't            have to purchase Shrouded Isles. They just won't see the new            features. Otherwise, it goes without saying you will need to have            the original game to play the expansion, and it will not work with            the US version of DAOC.                    For those that are completely new to Dark Age of Camelot, or to            MMORPGs in general, this paragraph is for you, but the rest of you            can skip to the next! DAOC is a massively multiplayer online            role-playing game, where players choose a character race and class            type, give their chosen 'avatar' a name and enter the DAOC world            through one of three different realms. Characters gain experience            through killing monsters and completing quests, and once experience            reaches a certain peak, you will 'level up', or just plain 'level'.            The game can be played solo, but this becomes much more difficult            on the higher levels, and grouping with other players is greatly            beneficial, especially in the many dungeons designed with groups in            mind. Where DAOC differs to other examples of the MMORPG is that            the ultimate goal is to get to a level sufficient enough to fight            Realm Vs Realm. In other words, Player Vs Player. This will be            either straight combat or you can get involved in the capture of            opposing realms' relics.        As the name            suggests, the Shrouded Isles are islands tacked onto the original            realms of Albion, Midgard and Hibernia, one island per realm. Each            island has a whole host of new quests to get stuck into, along with            new monsters, armour, weapons etc, etc. Naturally to enjoy the new            content to the full you are best off starting up a new character            from scratch, and what better way of rolling fresh than with one of            the three new races. Once again you get one new race per realm, not            only this though, you have two extra character classes per realm to            choose from also! One of the immediate benefits of the additional            races is that it helps to give the overall game populace a more            varied look, which freshens things up. Travel to and from the old            lands of DAOC is accomplished via portals, which can be found close            to your initial start location. You can also purchase scrolls to            portal you directly to the RvR locations, an extremely handy            inclusion by Mythic. Very thoughtful indeed.                    The three new races are the Inconnu in Albion, Sylvan in Hibernia            and Valkyn in Midgard, and the two classes for each realm follow            very similar lines to each other. The Inconnu are pale humanoids,            very short in size, with large, almost alien-like eyes, who are            hell bent on retaking the Island of Avalon from the forces of            Morgana. You can elect to be a Necromancer who attacks the enemy            via a pet, or choose the Reaver class, which blends aspects of the            Necromancer with the Fighter class from the original game. Reavers            also have the added benefit of the new 'flexible' weapon type,            which includes whips and chains. Kinky!                    Sylvans are strange looking creatures, with a skin that resembles            the bark of trees and hair the different colours of leafy autumn!            As a Sylvan you can choose to be the spell-casting pet class            Animist, whose pets can perform a variety of tasks. Or you can            choose the Valewalker class, physically attacking your foe with the            new Scythe weapon type. Finally, we have the Valkyns of Midgard,            who are a pre-historic humanoid race, very muscular in build. Again            you have a pet casting and a more fighter type class to choose from            in the Bonedancer and Savage respectively. With all the races            though, you can still opt to use the original game's selection of            classes, if you really want to.        It isn't just new            content that Shrouded Isles brings though. Mythic have taken the            opportunity with the expansion to update the engine, and to great            effect. Higher resolution textures are now possible, making some of            the buildings and surrounding scenery look almost photo-realistic            in places. Greater attention has been given to the rather bland            expanses of fields that you would be used to in the game, with            foliage now richly lavished upon the landscapes. The result is            impressive, giving the whole place a much more natural look and            feel, and add to this the superb water effects, which create the            illusion of a flowing river with accurate reflections. Such is the            level of the eye candy on show you can find yourself sitting down            in the countryside, watching the sky roll on overhead and the            gentle rippling of the water at your side. Everything is there            except a picnic and a buxom blonde to feed you strawberries! [If we            hadn't spent the last few days cooing at 3D Mark '03, we'd probably            join you - Ed]                    With new classes come new spell effects, and these are of excellent            quality too, from the water dripping off the leaf effects seen with            the Animist to the tormented head animation used for one of the            Reaver spells. Thankfully the upgraded engine hasn't been too            detrimental to overall video performance, with the only real            noticeable struggle occurring when you stroll into towns. But to be            honest, they were never exactly smooth running in the first place.                    Elsewhere, sound remains pretty much unchanged except for the            additional effects for the new creatures, which are all of a good            standard. The new soundtrack gets a special mention though. This is            probably the best music we've had our ears feast on in an MMORPG,            and quite possibly the first that we haven't turned off! The music            changes to suit the location you are currently in, and is never so            intrusive as to irritate. The songs experienced playing as one of            the new Albion classes are beautifully haunting, and really give            the game a chilling edge we'd never witnessed before.                    With Shrouded Isles it is clear that Mythic has thought long and            hard about what the fan base wants and deserves. It isn't all just            about the new stuff though. For example, it would appear that            monster drops have been significantly improved, providing you with            a much easier way of upgrading your character and/or getting more            money quickly. We could just be imagining that though. Mythic has            even introduced Co-Operative (no player killing allowed, all realms            open to everyone) and the Free-for-All (everyone can kill each            other) servers, geared towards creating different gameplay dynamics            for those bored of questing for RvR levels.                    To truly appreciate the excellent work Mythic have done on the            expansion, you really should try out the new classes in all            the realms to see how comprehensive this expansion is. The only            conundrum you will have to face is just which race and class you            want to make as your main character? Decisions, decisions. Anyway,            this is an absolute must have purchase for any Dark Age of Camelot            fan. Camelot!
