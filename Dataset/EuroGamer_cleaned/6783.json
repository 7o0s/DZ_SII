What do these games have            in common? For the most part, they all subscribe to the same theory            of adventuring - that an overwhelming enemy populace and the            organised redistribution of their limbs and souls across the            pavement is conducive to a good time. Based on the White Wolf            roleplaying books of the same name, Hunter: The Reckoning is            another such game, thrusting you into a possessed town and throwing            monsters at you relentlessly.                         To get a game like this absolutely 'right', you must first bind it            to a decent backbone - a strong and detailed story. In Hunter's            case, the idea is that during the execution of a chap called Nathan            Arkady at Ashcroft prison, demons erupted forth from the ether and            possessed just about anybody who took their fancy. Only four people            had the vision required to see and repel these demonic invaders,            and these were the Hunters, who after a hard night's slogging            managed to lock the demons away in the prison, and then presumably            retired to the pub. Unfortunately the townspeople of Ashcroft are            pretty dim, and for some reason decide to hold a rave on the very            same spot exactly one year later, and naturally all hell quite            literally breaks loose. Before long, the Hunters are back.                         The four Hunters - each of whom is at your personal disposal - are            extremely cool characters. Each has their own particular strength            and an 'edge', Hunter-speak for magic. There's the Avenger, the            strongest Hunter, an enormous biker with a huge axe and an            eight-shell shotgun reminiscent of Arnie's from Terminator. There's            the Martyr, a nippy little minx with John Woo-style dual pistols            and knives for slicing, and then there's the Judge, a Mexican            priest with a massive cruciform sword and a crossbow. And finally,            the Defender, an all-rounder with enough speed and strength with            her pistol and sword to cause some serious damage; she's also the            only character with a healing ability.                    Hunter has some RPG elements to it, another of the genre's tenets.            Character ratings are increased by completing levels and garnering            experience, improving ratings in several key areas - strength            speed, accuracy, stamina and conviction (magic). Each character can            also supplement his or her arsenal with further projectile weapons            left strewn around as limited-use, disposable power-ups. At first            you find double-barrel shotguns and uzis, but by the end you'll be            clamouring for rocket launchers and worse.                         When the Hunters arrive in Ashcroft, zombies are patrolling the            streets, spawning everywhere, and you have to carve your way            through them. There are no real missions apart from wreaking            constant havoc and carnage to bring an end to the demonic street            party, but there is also the need to rescue civilians, and the game            will reward you with one of two endings depending on how many you            save.                        Playing to each character's strengths is the only way to survive -            if you just go in and try to melee-swipe your way through the game            you will find yourself up against it by the end of the second            level. You don't necessarily need to go it alone, either. You can            play Hunter with up to three other people, and you can pick up a            quest in any state and use as many characters as you like. So you            could quite happily polish off the first level as the Avenger on            your own with no assistance one night, and then invite a couple of            friends over for a romp on the second. The game just throws more or            less enemies at you depending on the number of players.                    Moving further down the list of important hack-and-slash staples we            have the control system. Hunter's may take a bit of flak for being            slightly fiddly, but it really grew on my party after only a few            minutes. The left analogue stick controls movement and the right            analogue stick controls aiming, but because Hunter is played from            the third person, you can run in one direction whilst separating a            zombie from his head with a shotgun over your shoulder. It's really            quite intuitive, and allows you to act out some crazy scenes worthy            of any action movie, with the Martyr hopping about firing in all            directions like a crazed Monty Python bunny, the Judge carrying out            God's good work, and the Avenger racing into a pack of bad guys and            pirouetting with his axe to split them asunder. My only criticism            here would be that adjusting the aim can seem a little less than            fluid at times.                         Attacks vary; simply tugging the right trigger performs a basic            attack, but you can also hold it down for a couple of seconds to            charge a nice alternative, and in multiplayer you'll probably want            to play around with your tactics quite a lot early on. You could            have the two lasses sat at the back with their ranged weapons            helping the Judge and Avenger to avoid being struck from every            direction, but perhaps having the Avenger's awesome shotgun cover            the others would be better. Or perhaps you just want him to wade in            with his axe swinging and let the little Martyr dart around with            her blades while the other two attack.                         If you are planning to hunt en masse though, sooner or later            you'll start to get sick of the camera, which can only be zoomed in            or out slightly. It can impede your party's progress if you're            fighting at opposite ends of the screen, and can often get you            caught in awkward and painfully indefensible tight spaces. There's            also the invisible barrier factor, turning the game into a bit of a            tug of war, and the fact that although your characters can jump            around firing weapons from all angles and decapitating zombies face            to face, they apparently can't leap small metal fences, wrecked            cars or anything like that.                    Of course, Hunter would be nothing without excellent visuals,            detailed locations and various types of enemy. The graphics are            very nice, with burnt out cars, shadowy alleys to lurk around in, a            lovely rippling water effect in the obligatory sewer levels, and a            boatload of different ways for your troupe to reintroduce zombies            to death. And it's not just zombies either; there are little            exploding spiders, hanging translucent spectres and enormous            robotic gargoyles amongst others.                        Limb separation animations are plentiful and satisfying in a            perverse way, and you can splatter them across so many different            things. Your trail takes you through the subway, the streets of the            town, the tunnels beneath, various buildings (including the token            dull environment, a thankfully short hospital level), and            throughout these are piles of debris, shop windows to break and            their mannequins to eviscerate. The quality of texturing is also            very impressive. Character modelling is another strongpoint, with            lots of detail on each of the Hunters, right down to the Martyr's            swinging locks and the Avenger's buckled leather trousers. I            particularly like the way the Judge's cruciform sword looms up over            his image like God perched on his shoulder. There is a bit of a            Catch 22 here though, because although the close-up camera view is            very detailed and easily the best looking of those on offer, you            need to zoom out in order to actually see anything. Rounding out            the package is a neat soundtrack, which alters pace and volume            depending on your circumstances, with ambient chimes and some            thumping melodies for when you're in the thick of things. The voice            acting is also of a consistently high quality, although we wanted            the Judge to be a badass and the Mexican accent made him sound a            bit whiny - oh well.                         Staples of this sort of game are an enjoyable story, detailed            visuals, interesting level design, a varied selection of enemies,            good combat mechanics and a bit of room for character development,            a rocking multiplayer mode and a decent lifespan. Hunter is strong            enough in most of these categories, but if there was one thing            which would keep us from buying the game, it would be its length. I            made it through the thirty plus levels in about seven hours with a            few retries, and although you get some alternate Hunter costumes            and a new difficulty level to play with, that's largely it. It's an            exhausting experience to play the game too, so you'll probably play            it with friends in two or three hour stints, max. In terms of            replay value, death and carnage doesn't get too boring, so you            should still be playing this in a couple of months, but beyond that            I'd question the game's lifespan.                    Have you a thirst for the obscenely violent? Do you harbour a            penchant for the gothic fairytale or the Dusk Till Dawn style            action movie? Hunter is a game which offers fast-paced, hectic,            varied and bloodthirsty action with a huge number of enemies to            overcome. It's a bit short, but if you have a few friends after            roughly the same thing, this should certainly be on your shopping            list. A few rough edges don't do enough to spoil the experience."}
