{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/homeworld", "date": "4 Jul 2006", "game_name": "Homeworld", "text": "Homeworld is a refreshing new take on the real time strategy genre,            abandoning the usual forest, ice, desert and volcanic worlds of            most RTS games and instead setting the action in deep space.                    Amazingly it works .. more or less. Controlling fast moving            starships in a fully three dimensional space can be a little            disorientating at times, but the interface and control system are            fairly intuitive.                    The game also features a full tutorial mission to get you started.            You'll still need to refer to the manual for more advanced orders            and details of all the different units, but the tutorial does a            good job of covering all the basics and making you feel at home.                    Once you've got the hang of things, it's time to start the game            itself. You control a small fugitive fleet in search of your lost            Homeworld, pursued by hostile aliens. Yes, this is ~Battlestar            Galactica : The Game~ in all but name...                    The storyline is pushed along nicely by a mix of in-game briefings            during the missions, and pre-drawn black and white cutscenes            between them. It's all very dramatic, and keeps the game moving at            a fair pace.         The missions            themselves can be a little slow though. Some of them take hours to            complete, often with virtually nothing happening for a lot of that            time.                    The AI is mostly harmless, rarely counter-attacking even if you            leave your mothership wide open. Usually you are left to gather            resources, build up your fleet, and then launch an attack when            you're ready.                    But if the computer does decide to launch an offensive, you'll know            all about it. When the AI brings a big enough fleet together in one            place it can be a real challenge just to survive, let alone win.                    Given that your fleet is carried over from one mission to the next            and resources are often scarce, losing too many ships to an enemy            attack can make the next mission even more difficult.                    Your own ships suffer from AI problems as well, often sitting idle            while the ship next to them is pulverized by an entire enemy fleet.            I guess they're not big on self-preservation...         The only other problem is that space (by definition) is big            and empty. There's no real terrain to control or defend, which            leaves the tactical part of the game a little hollow at times.                    Space does at least look interesting in Homeworld though,            with dust clouds, asteroid belts, radioactive supernova remnants,            and giant cosmic scrapyards. Even the backdrops are big, brash and            colourful.                    Explosions and weapons fire are also spectacular, and the ships            look great as well. Best of all, the game can throw dozens of them            around on screen effortlessly. It takes a really big battle before            you start to see any slow down.                    This does mean some trade-off though, and in Homeworld's case it's            visual range. You can only see a relatively short distance, and            ships outside that range are invisible to you until you switch to            the sensors manager, which gives you a view of the entire area.                    It helps keep the frame rates up, but looks a bit unnatural at            first. Once you've played for a while though you will hardly notice            it.         There is also a basic            research element to the game, but this is fairly stunted in single            player mode as you are only given one or two new technologies to            research each mission.                    It really takes off in multiplayer and skirmish modes though, where            the entire research tree is available to you. The speed at which            you gain advanced technologies, allowing you to produce new units            like cloaked fighters and missile destroyers, can make the            difference between winning and losing.                    In fact, multiplayer is the game's real strongpoint. Finding other            players is easy thanks to the built in chat rooms, and setting up            or joining a game is just as simple.                    Using a 33.6k modem, even chaotic four player games were remarkably            smooth. There were occasional lock-ups when one of the players            lagged out for a few seconds, but generally it worked well.                    The skirmish mode (multiplayer against computer controlled            opponents) also works well. In fact the AI performs much better            than it does in the single player campaign for some reason,            harrying and attacking your fleet constantly instead of just            sitting back and waiting.                    There are also a whole host of different options to fiddle with -            victory conditions, resource levels, bounties, supplies... It all            adds up to a lot of replay potential.         Despite being the first            true spacefaring real time strategy game, Homeworld comes close to            hitting the mark.                    The visuals are beautiful, the soundtrack atmospheric, the single            player campaign (mostly) engaging, and the multiplayer is            excellent. It's only really let down by suspect AI and a few            tedious missions.            Release Date - available now                    Don't take my word for it though, try before you buy with the            Homeworld            demo (63Mb)."}
