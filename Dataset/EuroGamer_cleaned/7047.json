The game, developed            by ex-Goldeneye developers Free Radical, takes advantage of the            PS2's increased RAM and ability to deal with floating point            calculations and produces a 60fps-smooth single and multiplayer            experience that encompasses tremendous fun.                         It's based on a simple idea, that blasting is fun and that we            should all do lots of it. The fast action is sometimes rather            repetitive and draining, but it's just... it's just so            entertaining. At first, the single player mode didn't appeal to me            at all. The multiplayer struck a chord almost immediately (although            it does prove exceedingly boring to watch), but the single player            experience lacked vitality.                         For starters, there's no intro movie, it just begins with a simple            menu offering single or multiplayer, then Story or Arcade if you            opt for the singleplayer option. The ~Story~ is about as simplistic            as something out of a Doom clone from 1995; you travel all over the            world over the period of about ten years and retrieve secret            artefacts before the TimeSplitters (lots of nasty fellows with a            time machine) come along and take over the world. Arcade just lets            you pick and choose which level to blast through.                         We've found that it's best to treat the Story mode rather like            that of a beat'em'up. Sure, things aren't terribly well structured            and it's not exactly gripping, but as you improve your reactions            and weapon skills and beat new levels, new characters, weapons and            even other modes of play are revealed. The reward structure is            nicely crafted, so you receive a boost and something new when you            most need it.                    Actually, Story mode is a very good preparation for the deathmatch            mode, as it teaches you to work quickly and accurately. Accuracy is            very important in TimeSplitters, because if you miss once, the            chances are you will be hit before you can let off another shot.            The auto-aiming of the easy difficulty setting helps to get you            used to targeting enemies loosely, and this is where you should            start, before progressing to medium and hard, which are incredibly            tough.                         Another option the Story mode offers you is the chance to play            through it co-operatively in split-screen with a friend. Learning            the levels is quite easy with two of you working in unison because            you cover more ground - I can't remember a game since the original            Quake that offered quite as exciting co-op.                         Deathmatch feels a lot like Goldeneye, which is a good thing. The            60fps thing is incredibly important, and even with four players on            screen things tend not to drop much lower than you would normally            expect. Setting up is simple, with points and time limits, weapon            selection, bot selection, two to four players and the style of the            level all selected from a simple pre-game menu. There are plenty            more things to fiddle around with too, including pre-definable            weapon sets (which you can of course load onto and from memory            cards) and bot sets. My personal favourite at the moment is a Duke            Nukem style collection with sci-fi guns and trip mines.                    Controlling TimeSplitters is as simple as can be because each            player can load and store their own config. The default is            perfectly adequate of course, with the left stick controlling the            direction you face and how your neck is inclined, and the right            stick allowing you to move around, strafe and such. R1 and R2 are            primary and secondary fire respectively (secondary is either rapid            fire or some other logical option), the D-Pad is for switching            weapons and the rest control crouching and other options.                         Multiplayer games are generally quite hectic, depending on how            many people are in the levels. If it's a tight, claustrophobic            environment, the bots and yourself end up respawning more often            than you ever would have in Goldeneye, and if it's something more            open, it can take a while to nail anybody if you don't have a            splash damage weapon like TNT or a rocket launcher. The weaponry on            the whole is quite evenly spread around the levels (depending of            course on what weapon-set you opt for), and the placement of            respawns is always well judged.                         Map design is something the TimeSplitters team can be very proud            of, on the whole. The multiplayer maps occasionally seem a bit            prefab-heavy, but the single player locations are exemplary, with            huge Egyptian sphinxes and other ornate decoration. And it's not            just the Free Radicals that can be pleased with the mapping, if you            feel like getting involved, there's a very accomplished map editor            included to let you do just that. The options it includes allow you            to create anything from a Minotaur-style labyrinth to a rooftop            shootout scene. The powerful editor is definitely worth spending            some time with, and unlike the cumbersome PC map editors for Quake            and Unreal, allows you to create impressive maps quickly, using a            combination of L-shaped turns, rooms and connectors to create the            scenery and things like stairs to add a third dimension. With the            choice of tile settings (including Gothic, Sci-fi etc) you can            create comfortable and diverse levels.                         Storing the levels on your memory card isn't as complex or            space-filling as you would expect either, and I managed to fit            loads of preliminary designs onto one single card.                    Elsewhere, TimeSplitters isn't just pretty, it's quite beautiful at            times. There are no flickering or silly visual effects to mar the            experience, and on the whole the characters are all very sharp too.            Their identities are somewhat peculiar (one of them looks like a            reject from Interstate 76) and rather bemusing, but they are            certainly appropriately distinctive in deathmatch.                         Other memorables in TimeSplitters include things like the            location-specific damage on windows, the way pretty much anything            you would expect to be able to smash up in real life can be smashed            up here and plenty of larger visual effects later on. The sound            effects are key here, and although somewhat tacky at times are            definitely a lot less cheesy than Free Radical had claimed they            would be. The sounds of guns firing and bullets whinnying through            the air hit the spot perfectly, and if you don't feel pumped full            of adrenaline by the end of a four player deathmatch, you're doing            something wrong.                         So what is there for TimeSplitters to fear elsewhere in the PS2            lineup? Very little as a matter of fact. Unreal Tournament isn't            out over here yet, and even when it is I suspect the two styles of            play will differ enough to make them valuable additions to any            gamer's collection in the long run.                    At the moment, it's the best action game available on the            PlayStation 2, and although occasionally quite cheesy and certainly            not a patch on the likes of Half-Life in terms of storyline and            whatnot, it's a damned fine romp.
