Sound familiar? That's right, I'm talking about            Konami Krazy Racers. Reviewed back in the haze of the GBA launch, I            commented from my experience of Mario Kart Advance (as it was then            titled) at ECTS 2000 that there wouldn't be much to distinguish the            two. How right I was. But now that it's here, I genuinely prefer            Mario.                         How does that work then? Goemon and co. are an amiable bunch, the            tracks were classy, the graphics cutesy; Krazy Racers had so much            going for it. Unfortunately, the thing it cannot compete with is            Super Mario Kart's sparkle. It's the original. Even when it was new            and companies were trying to sideswipe it, Mario Kart was a world            apart. It had the memorable tracks (who can forget the original            Rainbow Road) and it had the visuals. It pretty much defined the            genre, and nobody has done a great deal to redefine it since then.            Mario Kart on the N64 was a muted success, but Mario Kart Super            Circuit is a return to form.                         That said, this isn't the game to redefine the karting genre            either. In fact, I'm beginning to doubt that anybody will            ever take it in new directions now. Mario Kart Super Circuit            actually features over forty tracks, more than twice the number            Krazy Racers did, and its characters are far more memorable than            the occasionally anonymous ranks of KKR. There are eight            characters, but they fall into six categories this time. Mario and            Luigi are the all-rounders; Peach and Toad are nippy but lack            weight; Yoshi is slightly heavier but moves quickly; Donkey Kong            and Wario move quite slowly but pack a lot of punch; and Bowser is            the slowest of the lot, but solid as a rock.                    Other changes from the classic SNES version include the addition of            a new Lightning cup, bringing the total number to five - Mushroom,            Flower, Lightning, Star and Special - and there are now four tracks            to each cup instead of the SNES version's five. The tracks won't            appear all that memorable at first, but don't worry, we'll get to            that later. What you will notice is that the game is slightly            harder than it ever was on the Super Nintendo or N64. 50CC is still            a breeze but it's not the dead calm that it used to be, while 100CC            and 150CC in particular are hard going.                         The track design is still impressive, each themed around a            different Mario environment. All your old favourites are back,            including Bowser's Castle, the desert, lakeside, Mario's circuits            and more, and there are some fiendish additions. Many tracks            feature close-to-the-corner speed boosts which, if used wisely, can            set you (or your opponents) well ahead of the pack. Tracks are            littered with coins again too and, as in the original, if you drop            to zero coins you are liable to be sent spinning by an opponent.            Grabbing lots of coins also enables you to achieve a higher top            speed.                        The incentive that you will really care about though, is that if            you grab enough coins for each cup you can unlock the original            Mario Kart tracks from the Super Nintendo. You receive a ranking            for your performance as well as a trophy this time, and the higher            the amount of coins the higher the ranking, so you can get an idea            of how close you are to the goal. I was a little embarrassed            yesterday when I let out a jubilant yelp of 'wahey!' in front of a            packed carriage of commuters. But I bet they would have been happy            too if they had just unlocked the Mario Kart tracks for the Star            Cup.                    Of course, the single player won't be what keeps you coming back.            As with Super Mario Kart, the real emphasis for many will be on            multiplayer, and Mario Kart Super Circuit takes no prisoners in            that department. Do you have friends with GBAs? Great, you're all            set. Single cart play is included, but Nintendo are using it as a            try before you buy style option, with four basic tracks on offer to            go head-to-head in order to make a decision on the purchase. You            can still enjoy screwing people over in single race mode using            last-lap power-ups and such, or you can resort to buying the damn            thing for all your mates and engaging in battle mode, which is            probably still the most entertaining thing in the entire game, even            after all these years.                         Battle mode is done far better than it was on the N64. The whole            three dimensional thing never worked for me - it felt out of place            in Mario Kart. Because Mario Kart Super Circuit is limited to a two            dimensional plane, it's my opinion that battle mode has returned to            its former glory. The idea (as if you didn't already know) is that            each kart has three balloons orbiting it, and your job is to race            around collecting power-ups with which to pop your opponents'            balloons whilst preserving your own. This is harder than it seems,            because your enemies will sniff out those elusive heat-seeking            shells and invincibilities, and use them on you when you least            suspect it. Now more than ever, because you can't simply glance at            the other half of the screen to work out what your enemy is armed            with. The tactical use of ghost power-ups has been forcedly            randomized too - a ghost icon just means you disappear from his            screen, take whatever he has in his inventory, and you can no            longer know what that is in advance of deploying it.                         Of course, if you run out of friends for whatever reason, what            better way to occupy your time than shaving hundredths of a second            from your best time trials. It's an activity that used to keep my            young mind ticking over from morn 'til night every day, trying to            figure out the best tactic, imaging every turn\u2026                    Visually, you'll think it looks a whole lot more like Super Mario            Kart on the Super Nintendo than anything else, but there are            definite improvements. The question mark blocks that litter the            track containing power-ups are spinning 3D models rather than            painted on to the track, and the character models seem to have more            depth than they ever did on the SNES. The game also features            digitized stereo audio. The GameBoy Advance is of course vastly            superior to the Super Nintendo technically speaking, so this is            hardly a surprise, but it has been said to me by a few elitists            that Mario Kart Super Circuit could have been 'a lot more'.                         Frankly though, I don't think there's much I'd rather they had            done. There are one or two problems that I might mention, but there            always are. One of the most annoying is down to the console's            oft-criticized lack of back-lighting. Ghost tracks are incredibly            dark, and seeing that tiny gap where your kart is inevitably going            to slip through into the blackness below is very difficult. The            righting mechanism is a bit badly behaved too. In traditional            style, if you find yourself out of bounds your pal on the cloud            will fish you out and drag you back to the track, but he does it            rather like one of those seafront grabbing machines, moving on two            axes independently. He never makes a beeline for the nearest area            of track, and he seems to randomly delay his descent too, all of            which can lead to an unfairly long period of idleness, which can            lead to lost laps, races and even championships, not to mention            lost balloons in battle mode. What easier way to win than to find            your opponent out of bounds and camp the area where he will be            replaced with a red shell?                         The fact of the matter is though, apart from some niggles, one of            which is a hotly contested design flaw in the console and one of            which is a carry over from the Super Nintendo version, this            conversion of a five year old game is the best driving game on the            GameBoy Advance to date, and I would take it over a lot of its big            brother's competitors on the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast too. It            has everything a single player, or indeed a foursome of like-minded            console gamers, could ever dream of, and all with the added benefit            of extensive replayability. With Super Mario Advance 2 still a way            off, Mario Kart Super Circuit is the killer app for GameBoy            Advance as of now.
