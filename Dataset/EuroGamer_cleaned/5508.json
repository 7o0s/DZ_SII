With his unflinchingresolve to fend off terrorists, he manages to save the World(otherwise known as America) and protect civilisation itself fromthe pesky bad guys all while maintaining that trademark scowl thefemale characters find so alluring.24 the mobile game follows in the same vein as the TVseries upon which it's based; there's a rolling timeline, whereevents occur and information is uncovered that needs to be actedupon immediately in order to progress. With the help of colleaguesfrom the Counter Terrorist Unit, as Jack you'll explore, decodepatterns, shoot people, isolate targets and look deep and moody inthe process.He could probably stare any ne'er-do-wells to death in thismanner, but instead he's been given a not-so-standard issuestun-gun to aid him in his quest. Quite why Jack wasn't trustedwith a proper firearm is a matter for another day; the result is hemust do his thing before the enemy wakes up and shoots himproperly. Such is the ethos behind the game: in everything you do,time is against you.Running through 24 is a storyline with more thought andintrigue than is typical, where the dialogue between operatives andsecret agent officials is used to progress the plot. This providesa good level of depth to the game, and immerses you into itsenvironments. Without this rich storyline, 24 would havebeen little more than a vague arrangement of sub-standard games,but thankfully it pulls them all together in a fairly satisfyingway.There are only a few varieties of level, each of which evolveslightly as the game gets harder. The first you'll encounter is thestrolling around part of the game. This is where you get to useyour non-deadly, non-lethal, stun-gun. Watch out baddies, Jack'sheading your way, though the control set-up means they'll see himcoming from a long way off. It's here that the unique visual styleof the game kicks into gear. It looks very interesting, with avertical and horizontal white line following Jack around as youtrack him via a heat-sensitive camera. But while the white linesare actually useful for lining up your shot with the stun-gun, theydo make it difficult on occasion to spot any bullets heading inyour direction.Equally hamfisted is the driving part of the game - more levelsviewed from above using a night-vision camera system. These levelsfind you heading from point to point with such an inexplicabletechnique for acceleration that it becomes quite tedious withinseconds.What work best in 24 are the puzzle and triangulationlevels, where you put your spying skills to the test and exercisethe old grey matter. Imagine a Rubik's cube and the Wheel ofFortune, both simplified and put into the context of this game.You need to solve them in order to defuse bombs and unlock doors.After plenty of practice and head scratching you'll start workingthem out; they can be tough, but it's all for a good cause and theyprovide a worthy challenge.Graphically, there isn't a great deal to shout about in terms ofcomplexity, but the game has a visual style that's very close tothat of the 24 TV show. Most of the levels are puzzle based,so simplicity is very much the order of the day, but it's a goodlook that sets it apart from other puzzle and TV tie-in games. Thesound could have been more dramatic, and the absence of the iconicthumping countdown theme from the TV show is a bitdisappointing.But if you want a game that will give you something to worktowards, then 24 is a good option. It isn't perfect and wequestion its replay value, but keep plugging away and thefulfilling puzzle challenges will save the day."}
