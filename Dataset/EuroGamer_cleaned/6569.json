I sat staring at the screen wondering what more            could possibly be said about the infamous Metal Gear Solid 2. By            now we're all used to the 'too many lengthy cut scenes/codec            conversations/girly-haired ladyblokes' exchanges that seem to            permeate throughout comments threads following every web article            published about the game, ever. We've established that there are            some parts of MGS2 that should never have made the cut, and that            there simply wasn't enough game for some of you. Konami            wants to change this.        The arrival of the Metal Gear Solid franchise on the Xbox could            scarcely have been a better one. At the core of the game is, of            course, a port of MGS2: Sons of Liberty; and port is definitely the            operative word. There is absolutely no improvement in visuals,            which was a major disappointment at first. When you line the game            up against Splinter Cell, which everyone does, whether they            admit it or not, it barely competes aesthetically with its            inherited fuzzy PS2 textures and slightly chunky models.                    While Konami didn't bother to take the time to sharpen things up            for the improved hardware, you soon get used to the looks, which            weren't exactly shabby in the first place. But what I did find most            strange and frankly inexcusable were the occasional drops in frame            rate, which scream 'sloppy, unoptimised port syndrome'. Having            played the PS2 version from start to finish, sitting down to this            felt almost like a step backwards, but I imagine newcomers will            still be suitably knocked back by some of the lovingly crafted            visuals and cinematics.                    The gameplay itself translates very well to the Xbox though, and            you'll find your way around the controls in no time. You still have            the initial options of starting at the beginning, with Snake's            mission on the tanker, or halfway through with Raiden's entrance            into the story at Big Shell, except thankfully the game now            sidelines the baffling 'I haven't finished the previous game, but I            would like to start this game from the beginning. I have no            children and a dog called Jenny'-type questions and gets straight            to the point. From there on in, you may as well just read            our review of the PS2 version -            it's exactly the same.        So                 far, so expected. But of course then we have the extras tacked                 on to convince the punter to part with their hard-earned. The                 original Metal Gear Solid was re-released with a collection of                 VR missions; short ~virtual reality~ tasks which focussed on                 training the player in elements of the core gameplay. MGS2:                 Substance takes this idea and absolutely drenches the player                 with over 500 missions to pile through, separated into                 specific categories with tasks concentrating on sneaking,                 shooting and the tricky first-person action mode.                    The missions start off very easy, as you might expect, but they            quickly pile on the pressure, and you'll soon be tempted to hurl            the controller at the screen as you fail the missions over, and            over, and over again. And that's the curious thing; simple though            the concept might be, this portion of the game quickly becomes            extremely addictive and moreish, and coupled with score tables (and            international rankings via Konami's website, albeit not via Xbox            Live) the MGS2 experience takes on a unique kind of            arcade-challenge charm. And the fact that there's no shortage of VR            missions means that you could be coming back for weeks trying to            get through them all. The reward for your efforts? New characters            and costumes, and more VR missions. Big wow, but that's not why            this part of the game is fun; it's the competing that counts.                    The other main alternative to the main game is the inclusion of            Snake Tales; a series of short missions where you play as Snake in            the Big Shell portion of the game - a section previously limited to            the aforementioned girly-haired Raiden. While concentrating on the            raw stealth-assault elements of the MGS model, without cut scenes            and dialogue these missions actually come off rather weakly. The            story is relayed via screens of written text, and in order to            increase the challenge Snake is stripped of his radar, but compared            to the polish of the rest of the game, Snake Tales feels rather            lacklustre and tacked-on.                    So is it worth it? Quite possibly, depending on your experience            with the original version of Sons of Liberty. As a first-time            player with an Xbox, you can't afford not to get this. The main            game is a tremendous achievement; it's brash, theatrical and very,            very cheesy. It doesn't know what it wants to be - some might say            an interactive movie, and if you must level that criticism, then at            least admit it's a damn fine interactive movie. The rest of            us will just get on with soaking up the mostly-fabulous visuals and            cinematics, bizarre storyline and nicely paced stealth antics. It            is what we like to call a flawed masterpiece, rivalled only by            Splinter Cell. Couple this with the huge amount of extra content,            and there is a magnificent amount of stuff to do, making it an            essential purchase.                    However, if you're well-acquainted with Sons of Liberty already,            we'd be hard pressed to recommend the outlay based on the mostly            extras alone. It depends on how much of a fan you are of the            original, and just how much you want to get your hands on more of            the same.
