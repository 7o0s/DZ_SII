'Boarding games, be they skate or snow, tend to vary greatly            depending on publisher. Games like Tony Hawk's are based almost            solely around tricks, whereas Pure Ride is just that. There            have been mixtures too, like 1080 and Cool Boarders, both of which            were immensely popular, but none of them can touch SSX. The            Canadian development team behind it have managed to blend the            various elements of showmanship, skill and speed so surreptitiously            that one might think this is the way all snowboarding takes place            in real life. They have even taken onboard things like skillsets            for the characters and actually made them important to how you play            the game - character selection has made little or no difference            everywhere else.                         The key to success in SSX is also the key to its success;            the way that it is not only possible to do well by varying your            approach but actually important. If you race downhill at 100mph and            thunder into every turn you may very well cross the finishing line            first, but that isn't always the point. By integrating clever            tricks into your technique and discouraging your opponents with            Road Rash-style jolts, you can not only improve your standing in            terms of points but also your position, as a lot of cunning            shortcuts are only available to the eagle-eyed, and those prepared            to do the unthinkable.                    Coming up with the correct blend of tricks and speed is quite            difficult, and is very dependant on character. What works for one            of the nimble yet pleasantly curvaceous women may not achieve quite            the same results as it does for the aggressive 6-foot male. The            other factor that proves important more often than not is the way            the boost system works. Other games give you a finite 'boost' bar            and encourage you to use it rather like you would a 'nitro boost'            or something equally implausible in a futuristic racing game. With            SSX, your stored boost power is dependant on how you're performing            in terms of tricks. And it doesn't just increase your speed for as            long as the bar holds out either, it acts like an injection of            adrenaline, a fuller bar will propel you further and faster - it's            all pleasingly proportional and invites tactical use.                         For example, on one course, I fell into second position after            coming unstuck on a jump, and could see there was no real way I            could get back to where I was without using the boost. So I waited            and waited, performing little tricks here and there, and a few            hundred metres or so before the end I sprung into action, leaping a            difficult turn by boosting into the jump and landed just ahead of            the leader. Satisfaction guaranteed.                         In all, SSX is very involving like that. You can pick up a few of            the free ride courses and passively mosey on down to pass the time,            but to really succeed your practice has to be thorough and            exhaustive, using every little nook and turn, because the AI is up            to task and will beat you down very quickly if you haven't            got your head round everything.                         The actual structure of the game is somewhat loose. There are            single race and world circuit options, and each contains lots of            sub-options, encouraging the development of different styles.            Whatever, I'm here for the boarding.                    The system of control in SSX is both intuitive and simplistic. The            shoulder buttons control various tricks whilst X handles jumping,            Square breaking, and so on. The left analog stick and D-Pad can be            used (in unison if it helps you) and the right stick lets you thump            your opponent if he gets a little too close for comfort.            Unfortunately the latter option is a little difficult to do            effectively without a lot of practice, and becomes quite cumbersome            if you get it wrong, because the computer rarely misses. I learnt            to steer clear of the AI quickly and it works, just.                         Controlling the character on jumps is simple and quite clever. If            you want to perform a trick jump, just weave and charge up your            jump with some manic pre-jump thrusts. If you pull it off you can            perform all sorts of weird and wacky twists and flips in mid air,            with some quite outrageous results.                         Something else that bears mention is the superb craftsmanship that            has been afforded to each and every track in SSX. Some of the            designs are very diverse; with loop-the-loops and other fairground            style attractions. The delightful design is reminiscent at times of            pinball tables more than anything else, and just like a pinball            table, many of the tracks are littered with shortcuts and cunning            ways to bypass certain time-wasting turns. The thing is, these            shortcuts are really difficult at first, but you find yourself            becoming gradually more able to complete them without slipping up            as the races wear on.                    SSX isn't just one of the best games ever thanks to its gameplay,            it also happens to be visually stunning, with beautifully designed            3D polygonal characters, all animated exquisitely with very few (if            any) perceptible glitches in the modelling. The transition moves,            frequently one the glitchiest areas in games of this ilk, are            faultless.                         The backgrounds are also rather impressive. You can venture pretty            much anywhere on and off course, and the environments generally            look almost real. The beauty can prove to be something of an issue            though as with a lot going on, on-screen things can dip to well            below 60 frames per second. It's quite noticeable at times, which            is a real shame, because apart from this little indiscretion, there            really is nothing to fault the game.                         Even the audio is used cleverly. It changes depending on your            performance, with tempo and intensity changing to reflect your            position and skill. The effect is rather akin to the action            segments on Sky Sports, where the beats kick in hard just as            something happens. The music is quite pleasant, but I would            actually have preferred to have been listening to a Crazy Taxi            style offering with Bad Religion and like for the majority of the            time. A missed opportunity, but it's bound to strike a chord with            somebody so I won't deduct points.                    Snowboarding has never been represented in such a positive light.            I've never had as much sustained fun with a 'sports' title, and            ultimately, this is as good as the PlayStation has got to give at            the moment. Buy it, and lose entire weeks to it.            Related Feature -            PlayStation 2 Launch Index"}
