Remember how the            jaw-dropping opening scenes of the movie exploded onto the screen,            and how your popcorn (or fattening cinema food of choice) sat            abandoned as Maximus' army unleashed hell on the hapless barbarian            tribes? Remember how you stood up in the cinema and embarrassed            yourself by revealing your online gaming roots and screaming            ~0wned!~ as a particularly large and bearded barbarian was felled            by the Roman onslaught\ufffd No? Damn. Maybe that was just me,            then.                    Either way, Gladiator made the concept of marching around a bunch            of men in pleated skirts with feathery helmets downright cool, but            if you wanted to do exactly that in a videogame, you were bang out            of luck - until now. Praetorians creator Pyro Studios, best known            for the seminal Commandos games, has taken on the might of the            Roman Empire in a game that spans the expansion of Pax Romana            throughout Europe, North Africa and the near East.        Strategy games            generally fall into one of two camps; there are those which feature            resource management, and those which don't. You pays your money,            you makes your choice. Either you want to get involved in setting            up supply chains, building supply depots, harvesting resources and            building bases, or you prefer to play a tactical game with a set            number of units at your beck and call.                    Praetorians takes a unique new approach to this aspect of RTS            gaming by removing the micro-management of resource gathering from            your control without actually removing resource management from the            game entirely. Most levels of the game will see you capturing            villages and claiming them by building garrisons next to them; this            allows you to train new units at those villages, as long as            sufficient population remains in the village to support the            creation of a new unit.                    That's it - that's the entire extent of the resource management in            the game - but despite the simplicity of the system, it works            remarkably well. Control of the villages on a map often means the            difference between victory and defeat in the long run - it's often            possible to rush a strong army through a combat area, clearing out            enemy troops but not taking the time to secure the villages            properly, only to find that soon enough you're completely            outnumbered as the villages pump out resistance fighters and your            once-proud legions dwindle in a damaging war of attrition.        Removing the focus from resource management means that the            tactical management of your troops in combat becomes the key            element of gameplay, and sure enough, it's here that Praetorians            really excels. Rather than controlling individual infantrymen, the            game treats each division of your army as a single unit in a manner            reminiscent of the way that the Total War series works - so one            ~unit~ may consist of thirty archers, or twenty cavalry, and so on.            Your control over these units is very precise; as well as the ~go            here, attack this~ standard RTS control system, you can also change            the way that units are facing, or alter their stance (which affects            their formation and offensive and defensive strengths). Your            legions even have different marching speeds, which affect their            available stamina.                    As well as the wide range of legions available, there are a few            individual units - such as the scout units, who have a wide field            of vision and are useful for spotting enemies in advance so you can            plan your attacks better; the centurion commanders who provide a            huge morale boost to nearby troops and can occupy villages; and the            doctor units who can heal units damaged in battle (although they            cannot revive the dead, so if a legion loses men during a battle            the only way to make up the numbers is to merge it with another            damaged legion).                    The varied composition of your troops and the detailed control you            have over them gives rise to a much more tactical approach than            most RTS games exhibit. Rushing into battle with a few legions of            spearmen is a sure-fire way to get defeated in a hurry; instead,            you'll want to think carefully over your options and treat each            engagement as a tactical problem. Rather than rushing in against            the barbarian hordes, why not find a high vantage point for your            archers (height advantage is a key element of the game), put a line            of spearmen in defensive stance in front of them, and then entice            the enemy closer with a couple of divisions of fleet-footed            cavalry? A crushing victory won in this way is much more satisfying            than rushing headlong into a messy brawl, and it's certainly fun to            play a strategy game that rewards cunning and careful thought more            often than it rewards grunt rushes.        The graphics in Praetorians aren't anything particularly            special, but then again, after seeing so many 3D strategy game            engines in the past six-to-nine months, it's pretty hard to get            excited about another one. The whole thing is perfectly functional            and the environments are very attractive in places, with special            note going to the weather effects and to the welcome variety of            locations available in the game - from the sandy deserts of North            Africa to the lush valleys of Gaul. The game certainly looks as            good if not better than WarCraft III or Age of Mythology, which is            perfectly sufficient - this isn't the kind of title that is sold on            the basis of stunning good looks in the first place. One thing            worth mentioning, though, is that the game has absolutely no            problem in dealing with hundreds of units on screen at once - not a            dropped frame or stuttering framerate in sight.                    The game also features an orchestral score, which is a nice touch,            but sadly there's some pretty abysmal voice acting in the mix as            well. The developers also seem to have used the same voice actor            for a number of different characters in the game, which can cause            some confusion as you can no longer rely on audio cues to tell you            which type of unit you have selected. We're consistently annoyed by            the low standards of voice acting in many modern games - can it            really be that difficult to hire some professional voice actors who            have worked on, say, BBC radio productions? If Rage could do it for            Hostile Waters many, many moons ago, then surely Eidos could            stretch to it for a game like Praetorians?                    Every time we review a PC strategy game, we end up pointing out how            crowded the market is, and how hard a title has to work in order to            make it worth your hard-won pounds (or euros, for that matter).            Praetorians certainly does set itself apart from the competition -            it offers quite a different approach to any other RTS games we've            seen recently, and neatly occupies a middle ground between the            incredibly hardcore Total War franchise and the more lightweight            gameplay of something like Age of Mythology.                    Sadly, that might be the downfall of the game. More hardcore            strategy gamers might simply find that this whets their appetite            for the forthcoming Roman treatment of the Total War series, while            those weaned on StarCraft and Command & Conquer may find the            whole affair a bit too plodding and cerebral. For anyone who really            wanted to like Total War but found the whole affair a bit too            complex and involved, however, this is the perfect game - and for            anyone who's ever really wanted to command the armies of the North            and unleash hell, there's no better way to live that out than in            Praetorians."}
