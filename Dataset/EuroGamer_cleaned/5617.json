One such game is F/A-18E                 SuperHornet...                    SuperHornet is a flight combat sim based on one of the US Navy's            latest fighter jets, a sim that is apparently so realistic that it            is ~Used by the Navy~ according to the box. Which is high praise            for the game's developer, Digital Integration.                    The plot presented by the opening video (which wouldn't look out of            place in a low budget movie) is a classic case of East vs West,            with long time enemies America and Russia battling it out as usual.         All the features and missions can be                 accessed via the menu system, accompanied by some                 appropriately rousing music. Some of the buttons that control                 the menu screens are inconveniently placed though, and can                 lead to momentary confusion. And while the music is initially                 grabbing it rapidly becomes annoying...                    Once you get past these minor interface niggles, the game does            offer all the expected features though.                    There is the usual quickstart feature which allows for some small            tweaking before the game places you in the thick of the action. The            combat button takes you into the regular game, while the Pilot Log            switch allows you to chart the progress of your sorties.         To get you started there are also a few                 training missions, which cover the variety of missions that                 exist in the game such as air-to-ground attacks and                 reconnaissance missions.                    There are right ways to handle training missions, and wrong ways.            Flanker 2.0 got it right with fully instructed tutorials, while            SuperHornet really has the wrong idea. There is no real ~teaching~,            and you simply end up looking at a map that describes a simple            flight plan that is aimed to help you learn how to achieve the            training objective.                    Once you are out on the runway there is no guidance, and you are            expected to be able to fly the plane instantly. With the number of            controls required just to get the engines going, I feel that this            is a little harsh on less experienced players.                    Once you are in the air you are expected to be able to fly the            flight plan and then land back at the runway. Now granted this            isn't too tricky, but sometimes it is nice to get some help.                    There is a rather hefty manual that accompanies SuperHornet (a            pre-requisite for any flight combat game), and it could be argued            that one should really read the manual before just jumping in and            playing. Sadly though, the manual is no less harsh on the newbie.         Once you are familiar                 with the plane and its controles you can fly some proper                 combat missions. Select which theatre of operations you wish                 to fly in, select which mission type you want to undertake,                 and from there you can select an individual mission.                    At first I found it very strange to be able to pick and choose from            any of the missions in the game right from the start, but it is a            good idea. Instead of the player having to progress in a linear            fashion through missions which they may not want to play at the            time, they are free to pick whichever mission they like.                    The other strange twist is that you can change between the two            battle zones, as the game keeps a log of all the action your pilot            is involved in. While this is somewhat of a departure from the            regular style of play found in such games, it is an interesting            change that, in this case, works quite well.         Right from the start of the game                 it is clear to see that Digital Integration have worked hard                 to put the player into a quasi-real universe, in which the                 player is just one small part of the entire world.                    The actual missions are well designed, but unfortunately thanks to            the power of modern technology there is actually very little that            you have to do. Obviously you have to fly the plane, but when it            comes to a spot of aerial combat there is very little old fashioned            dogfighting involved.                    Hostile planes are locked onto at impressive distances, and as soon            as you are near enough the shoot light flashes up. I'm almost            surprised that it doesn't fire for you...         SuperHornet is certainly well endowed when                 it comes to graphics technology. The landscape flows                 beautifully along, clouds bathe the tops of tall hills quite                 majestically, and the models are detailed and superbly                 textured. In fact SuperHornet has the most realistic carrier                 that I have seen.                    On the sound side, there is support for 3D sound acceleration,            which is always good as it adds just that little bit extra to the            game. The sounds themselves are very clean and well done. It is            especially nice to have pilot chatter, especially when most of the            time it is very relevant to the situation.                    I do however have one gripe though. Whenever the player starts to            do something unexpected (I refrain from saying wrong), the pilot            screams at the top of his lungs. While this may sound like a good            warning system, even though the plane already has one of its own,            should you want to indulge in a bit of free flying you will be            serenaded by the screams of your virtual self...         As with all flight combat                 simulators, you are only really going to like SuperHornet if                 this kind of thing is your bag. There are some flight sims                 that manage to impress even the uninitiated, but unfortunately                 F/A18E SuperHornet is not one of these, thanks to a less than                 brilliant interface and poorly constructed training option.                    Despite this the game is likely to appeal to some of the more avid            armchair pilots, and I'm sure it will find its niche thanks to its            ultra realistic controls. On a general level it is hard to            recommend, but for any hardcore flyers out there (and you know who            you are), this is worth a look.
