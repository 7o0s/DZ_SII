From the flawless            voice acting to the maddeningly addictive rolling block puzzles,            Soul Reaver is a showcase to how great third person gaming can be.            The intelligent storyline, chillingly dark plot and stunning            visuals form an action adventure game that is currently without            peer on any platform. Buy it, play it and savor every evil minute,            this kind of game doesn't happen very often, make sure you don't            miss out.                        - Out Now"}
