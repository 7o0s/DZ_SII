As fans of the ~Elite~ series right back            to the original BBC Micro version of the 1980s, the idea of an            open-ended space sim in which you could be a pirate, trader or            bounty hunter was enough to get us excited.                    But then the game arrived, and the disappointment set in. The            controls were unresponsive, the pace glacially slow, the trading            system bizarre, the AI poor, and the central storyline relied on            repeatedly sending you backwards and forwards across the entire            game universe to make it seem longer than it actually was. After a            couple of weeks of playing it we described the game as ~dull,            tedious, repetitive, boring, and highly frustrating~. And despite a            backlash from the small but fiercely protective X fanbase, that's            still our opinion.                    Then word emerged that German developers EgoSoft were developing an            ambitious new add-on for the game, which promised to correct many            of the flaws which we had complained about in the original. In            fact, it was less of an add-on and more of a sequel, turning X into            a whole new game. And although it still isn't perfect, we're happy            to say that it does mark a massive improvement.                    X-Tension picks up where X ended, with the Xenon threat defeated,            the Goners redeemed, and you still stuck in the X universe with the            non-functioning X-perimental craft which stranded you there in the            first place, after a test of its revolutionary new jump drive went            horribly wrong and sent you careening out of control across the            galaxy from Earth.                    The good news is that the X craft, which was horribly unmaneuvrable            at the best of times, has now been sent off to a lab for reverse            engineering, in an attempt to discover the secrets of the frazzled            jump drive and rebuild it to send you home. In the meantime you            have been loaned a local ship known as an Argon Buster, which is            rather more functional, and also comes preloaded with all those            little luxuries that should really have been standard in the first            game, like a decent navigation system, a time-acceleration mode,            and .. um .. lasers so that you can actually defend yourself.                    Even better, you aren't stuck with that Argon Buster. In X you were            limited to your X-perimental craft, and couldn't trade it in for a            better model. In X-Tension you can fly anything from nimble scout            ships to giant cargo liners, with almost every craft in the game            available to buy or to capture in combat, and each with its own            unique cockpit and handling characteristics. This makes things much            more interesting, as you can now specialise to a much greater            extent, choosing whether you want to be a trader with an unarmed            Argon Lifter and dozens of cargo bay extension modules, or a            bounty-hunter with a heavily shielded fighter armed to the teeth            with plasma throwers.                    And although the Argon Buster is the standard starting point,            X-Tension also comes with a few pre-loaded save games, which allow            you to decide which ship and equipment you want to start with. My            favourite is the trader kit, which starts you off with an Argon            Lifter, a fighter escort, and a reasonable sum of cash to start            buying goods with. This allowed me to get into the game much faster            than normal, without having to waste the first few hours scrimping            and saving just to earn a few measly credits.                    The most obvious improvements when you load up the game for the            first time though are to the graphics and the interface. Many of            the ships and space stations which you encounter have been            redesigned since the original game, with more detailed models and            textures.                    New effects have been added, and the space in which you are flying            looks more colourful than ever, with gaudy nebulae and vast            planets. The visible seams which blighted many of these backdrops            in the original game are mostly gone as well. There are still a few            distracting little glitches, such as problems with culling which            make parts of some of the space stations vanish from sight when            viewed from certain angles, but apart from these few teething            problems X-Tension is now on a par with the very best space sims            out there when it comes to graphics.                    The new menu systems are also very well presented, and allow you to            easily access information about any sectors which you have visited            during the game, including a full map of the galaxy showing            everywhere you have been. Drop off one of the new navigation relay            satellites and not only will it instantly identify every object in            the sector, you can also view that map when you are in an entirely            different part of the galaxy. And if you have the new trade system            installed you can even see the prices at which goods are being            bought and sold in the various space stations in the sector,            whether or not you are physically there. This is an incredibly            useful new feature which makes trading far less hit and miss than            it was in the original game.                    It's not all about buying low and selling high though, and the rest            of the game has also been improved. You can still buy entire space            stations and so build up a business empire, complete with            AI-controlled support ships, but the new relay satellites mean that            you no longer have to physically dock with one of your factories to            check its progress or to change its pricing policies - you can            monitor and control everything from the new galaxy map.                    You also have better control over your fleet than before, and can            order ships to follow you, travel to another sector, transport            goods between particular space stations, or simply to buy a            particular commodity at the cheapest price they can find. Again,            you can use the galaxy map to give orders wherever you happen to be            at the time. You can even hop out of your ship in a space suit and            float in through the airlock of any other vessel in your fleet to            take personal control of it.                    If you fancy taking a more violent approach to life, the ability to            buy new ships more suited to your gung ho attitude is a giant leap            forwards, and the AI has been improved somewhat as well. Pirates            are more agressive now, and will often attack you if they think you            have valuable cargo which they can hijack. And although the            resulting fights are still not even in the same league as those            seen in dedicated space combat games like ~Starlancer~ and the            ~Freespace~ series, they are certainly much more satisfying than in            the original X. You can even buy tiny fighter drones to help defend            your ship, or massive defensive turrets which can be positioned            around your factory.                    The linear storyline has been thrown out the window as well, in            favour of random missions. As you fly around, other ships will hail            you to ask for help fighting off raiders, transporting goods to a            nearby space station or rushing supplies to a crippled ship before            its life support system packs in. You will be challenged to            checkpoint races, asked to                    And that's barely scratching the surface... X-Tension is a huge,            truly open-ended game, which gives you far more freedom and far            more fun than the deeply flawed X : Beyond The Frontier. It's not            perfect. The pace is still a bit sedate for my tastes, but at least            now you start the game with a time acceleration gizmo fitted as            standard, so you won't have to go and make a cup of tea while you            wait for your ship to make it to the next sector. Combat remains            unremarkable, and the trading system is still a little haywire at            times. Many solar power plants sell energy at below cost, making            building your own rather pointless. Other times you will see            factories trying to sell goods at a higher price than anybody else            is willing to pay.                    But if you already own X : Beyond The Frontier and loved it, then            this is a no-brainer - buy X-Tension now! If you own X and, like            me, you hated it, then X-Tension is enough of an improvement to be            well worth buying. And if you're new to the game but want something            more relaxed and free-form than your average space sim, then pick            up ~X : Gold~, which includes both the original X and the X-Tension            add-on.                    So .. one small step for space sims, one giant leap for EgoSoft.            Hopefully their next game will fix X-Tension's few remaining flaws,            and perhaps even include multiplayer support. Mmm .. now there's a            thought."}
