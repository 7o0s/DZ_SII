Then            again, any game that aims to make money by giving blokes a brace of            virtual Barbie dolls under the guise of a sports game will            obviously polarise opinion.                    But we've spent a lot of time with it now, and it seems that the            more you play it, the easier it is to appreciate why you should            play it. It's still a very simple game at its core, based around            some pretty basic activities (card games, hopping, volley-pong,            etc), but the sheer number of collectibles and their inconsistent            availability will have grown-up Pok\u00e9maniacs foaming at the            mouth, and the orgy of on-screen titillation will no doubt do the            same for some of the rest of us.                    As one of eight misled ladies, lured to Zack Island under the            pretence of a DOA fighting tournament, the idea is quite simply to            build up a collection of crap whilst cruising the sun-drenched            tropical plains in babe-ridden surroundings. There are all sorts of            knickknacks spread around the game's main boutiques (Accessory            Shop, Sports Shop and Zack Of All Trades), with all manner of            skimpy garments (fluffy-tailed swimsuits, anyone?) flanked by more            obscure items like Uzis (er, yes). As you play volleyball, compete            in mini-games or gamble in the casino, you'll earn island currency            which can be splurged on these various spoils, and often you'll            also find yourself rewarded for a hard day's volleying with a            DVD-style extra (videos of old DOA games, obscure literature and so            forth).        However, pretty much every gamer who clicked through to this            page is preoccupied with the graphics, and we're not afraid to            admit how lovely they are. Whether or not you find oodles of            bronzed flesh a bit tasteless, you can't fail to be impressed with            the animation, which covers pretty much every inch. Each lass            carries herself slightly differently - some, like Kasumi, have a            sort of delicate grace, whilst others like videogame-loving Tina            are a bit more headstrong and brutal. And when they're not leaping            around the volleyball court with seamless realism, they're            adjusting their bikinis, rolling around on deckchairs sunning            themselves and hopping across swimming pools. Ignoring the question            of how ~sad~ it is, we haven't seen much more realistic character            movement in a sports game, or indeed any other game. To put it into            perspective, the CG cut scenes look less realistic.                    And then there are the environments. In stark contrast to the            elegance of the ladies, some (like the casino) have a pre-rendered,            Resident Evil-esque feel to them, and some are basically just fancy            parallax scrolling. The jungle court, for example, feels totally            out of place. The barefoot, swimsuit-clad ladies of DOA feel            somewhat alien as they prance around on a floor of fallen greenery,            with several rows of lush foliage offering up the illusion of            depth. Other stages though, like the many beaches, either do a            better job of masking the effect or don't even rely on it - and            like Sega's Beach Spikers and Virtua Fighter 4 snow stages, the way            the sand parts beneath each of the ballers' feet is a nice touch            which adds plenty to the overall aesthetic.                    But it's the little details which make the difference, like the way            Tina stretches her quads at the start of a match, or Hitomi leans            on her knees before receiving a serve, and the emotive            juxtaposition of heartfelt celebration and frustration. It may be a            very voyeuristic game, with L selecting various pervy camera angles            and R zooming in unashamedly on the ~vital areas~, but Tecmo has            had no problem creating some of the most sumptuous, lifelike            character animation ever witnessed.                    The audio side of things complements the game's aesthetic admirably            to boot. Tecmo hasn't bothered to change the Japanese voiceovers,            which is vastly preferable in our minds to cheesy American nobodies            vomiting the uninspired scripting at one another, and there's a            custom soundtrack option - which, unless you like Spice Girls            B-sides, B*witched and the Baha Men's other songs, you'll want to            be using.        DOAX's main problem though is how much like a tech demo it            feels at times. Despite the complexity of the visuals, the actual            volleyball is surprisingly simplistic, and the inclusion of a            bizarre float-hopping mini-game and a casino full of slot machines            and card games is disconcerting. Windows 3.11 onwards has come with            a perfectly decent complement of card games, ta, and if we wanted            to play Blackjack with girly playing cards, we'd buy some.                    Out on the courts, it's equally underwhelming to start with.            Whereas Beach Spikers took many hours to learn and many more to            perfect, Tecmo is happy with receive and shot buttons and not much            else. On the defensive side of things, B will tee it up for your            partner and A will return directly, and on the offensive, B            performs a looping shot (useful for beating jumping blocks) and A            performs a spike. The camera is as peculiarly unconcerned with            giving you the best view as Beach Spikers', but on the whole the            game starts and ends with setting the ball and spiking it, so it            isn't so much of a problem as it was with Sega's more intricate            baller.                    The subtlety, they say, is in the timing. If you go for a spike,            holding the analogue stick and hitting A can produce a wide variety            of attacks depending on the precise split-second you do it. However            in practise, you'll find that spikes are as spikes do -            concentrating on the most effective timing is a bit silly when 90            per cent of the time you'll see it returned. You're better off            trying to overwhelm the opposition by receiving skilfully, or            faking out their blocks with a looping shot.                    In contrast to spiking itself, it's usually pretty easy to block or            receive effectively. Stand in a reasonably empty bit of court with            your teammate on the opposite side, and hit the B button as soon as            an opponent spikes and your character will receive comfortably or            dive to make up the difference. If you dive, most of the time you            won't get up quickly enough for your teammate to set your spike, so            the idea is to receive comfortably, set and then spike effectively.            Given the ease of control, rallies can last for stupid amounts of            time, and you'll feel genuinely aggrieved or exhilarated depending            on the outcome. And not just because of the sexy ladies\u2026                    For us, the volleyball in DOAX is simple enough to pick up and play            that you'll treat it a bit like a pickup game of FIFA or NHL.            What's more, winning is worth plenty of cash and if you really do            want that skimpy, gun-holstered spotted white bikini or a purple            one-piece then there's even more incentive.        One of the key reasons that the game is so accessible is the            quality of the AI - even if it's not immediately obvious. As you            start to play more and more, you'll have to bribe your fellow            holiday-goers to partner with you, and work hard to win those games            or you may end up partner-less, but on the court as well there's a            definite issue of morale to contend with. It's not just that you            lose composure after losing a couple of points either - it's the            circumstances that make the difference. If your teammate slams a            perfectly good spike into the net, or you completely misjudge a            lofted serve, you may well find the next serve banging into your            slumped head to compound your misery, unless you keep moving, and,            likewise, a particularly cogent duo will sometimes be reinvigorated            enough to overcome early deficits.                    There's a very noticeable difficulty curve too. As you start out,            serves are underarm, a lot of points go awry on both sides of the            net and things are generally sloppy. By the end of your first            virtual week on Zack Island though, served balls are being thrown            into the air and whipped across the net like tennis balls, and the            level of skill on both sides makes for some intense rallies.            Coupled with the way morale is handled, it's quite compelling - as            long as you're actually after the next swimsuit or DOA2 trailer.                    However, good though the AI is, we're certainly happy to take issue            with the idea that DOAX encourages 'notions of sisterhood', which            is an argument we've seen bandied around. We seriously doubt that            young ladies anywhere will be enticed by this bunch of scantily            clad, bribe-driven, twenty-something bimbos whose response to            failure is a petulant tantrum. If that's the world of women today            then I'm glad I moved to Brighton. Anybody who tries to argue the            merits of DOAX as a sort of virtual feminist retreat either has a            loose grip on reality, or a firm grip on his penis.                    As we said at the start, DOAX was always going to polarise opinion,            but ultimately the entire reward structure is based around the            collection of skimpy clothing, accessories and peculiar            merchandise. If you harbour kleptomaniacal tendencies and find            curvy polygons racier than we do, then the increasingly repetitive            bouts of volleyball and weakness in the rest of the package won't            bother you. However, if the screenshots peppered around this page            don't summon a nod from the little general, and all you wanted was            a decent volleyball sim, then we implore you to go elsewhere. DOAX            is the mindless, arcade alternative to Beach Spikers, and some            semblance of AI and mini-game distractions aren't enough to justify            \u00a340 - only a frank admission of wankerdom really manages it.
