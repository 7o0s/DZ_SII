THQ's licensed            adaptation of the film for GameBoy Advance therefore came as            something of a surprise. It's an original and highly entertaining            platform game, which has you playing the enigmatic James ~Sulley~            Sullivan, voiced by John Goodman in the film, as he attempts to            reunite the missing pieces of Boo's door with its frame and return            the cuddly mite to her true home.                         Sulley has to contend with the interests of the Child Detection            Agency (CDA) though, and those guys are merciless! Sulley has two            main weapons to counter the efforts of the CDA however; his roar            and Boo's laughter. Sulley can roar at any time and this is            effective in removing the idle threat of random CDA agents and            other monsters, but some of the CDA's best men are impervious to            simple roaring. To defeat them, Sulley has to collect cans of Boo's            laughter which can remove any agent it comes into contact with and            temporarily paralyses any other enemy in the vicinity.                         As the game progresses, you can increase the effectiveness of            Sulley's roar by collecting blue power-ups scattered along his            path, until it can knock down virtually anybody Sulley comes into            contact with. The game is targeted at kids who enjoyed the movie            though, and apart from getting a right royal treat of a game in            return for their pocket money, they also get a game devoid of death            and carnage. Sulley doesn't kill his enemies: he merely            incapacitates them.                    Graphically speaking Monsters, Inc. is fairly accomplished for a 2D            side-scrolling platformer, and unlike Mario Advance and similar            titles, THQ have even had a bash at the third dimension in places,            giving the game added visual depth and complexity. Furthermore,            vibrant colour schemes and easily distinguishable character sprites            coupled with some superb animation make for a nice overall effect,            although the repeating backgrounds can get a little tiresome. Many            of the film's locations are faithfully recreated as best they can            be, and the familiar and enjoyable soundtrack complements the            action satisfactorily.                         In terms of gameplay Monsters, Inc. is the antithesis of the            average videogame. Instead of fighting the monsters, you actually            are one, and this gives you a pretty big advantage over the average            rapscallions you encounter. But that doesn't mean you can simply            waltz through the game before lunchtime. The learning curve for the            game is practically horizontal but the final stages of the game are            very tricky, and if you're buying this game for a younger relative            he or she might require a little assistance! [Yeah, right. Nice            excuse - Ed]                         In fact the game's only major fault is its length. As its 20            levels (including bonus maps and mini-games) are easily finished in            under a day it represents a questionable \u00a335 investment, but I            found myself happily playing through it a couple of times over. As            a platform game though it stands out amongst the console's finest,            easily giving Super Mario Advance a run for its money.                    Monsters, Inc. is a fun game, based on a fun movie. It's been aimed            at kids, but I have a hunch (call it an Inc'ling), that the            developers knew how many Dads and older brothers would fancy a go            and worked with that in mind. It's a very accomplished and            innovative platformer in places, and I'm not accustomed to saying            that on these pages. It also shows that THQ are capable of doing            more than the bare minimum with their licenses, and that's a very            encouraging thought."}
