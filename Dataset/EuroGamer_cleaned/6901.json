{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-nyrace", "date": "15 Nov 2001", "game_name": "NY Race", "text": "Are PC gamers forever destined to be shut away in their dingy            corners playing RPG's and first-person shooters for the rest of            gaming eternity? Time after time it has been proven that the PC            doesn't really stand out as a bastion of varied thrills, despite            the hapless efforts of many (I'm still trying to recover from            Toon Car).            Arcade racers on the home computer, especially, haven't exactly            been known to push the envelope in terms of innovation, production            values or, indeed, gameplay quality, not since Wipeout and its            sibling arrived on the scene anyway. French developers Kalisto have            set out to redress the balance with their Fifth Element-inspired            racer, New York Race.                         It's important to take note of that word ~inspired~. Kalisto have            taken the first few minutes of the film and managed to expand that            into an entire game, which is quite a feat when you think about it,            however this is where the similarities end. NY Race takes the form            of a standard-fare futuristic racing game, and the options on offer            from the start indicate that the game is disappointingly shallow.            You can choose from championship, single race, multiplayer or time            attack modes, all of which are pretty self-explanatory.                         The core of the game lies in the championship mode, and when you            start out only the beginner portion of the game is unlocked for            playing, along with one vehicle. This seemed like a rather steep            level of limitation for a new player, forcing you to compete in the            championship before you can enjoy the luxury of driving a decent            vehicle on an interesting course. First impressions aren't terribly            promising, as you slouch around the track in last place, bouncing            off the walls of buildings and tunnels and wonder why everyone else            is moving twice as fast as you.                         Eventually, however, you begin to get to grips with the nuances of            controlling your free-floating car; you have the ability to strafe            in all directions, as well as perform speed-building nose-dives and            powerslide around sharp corners. The unpredictable nature of many            of the tracks demand that you make the most of your control set, as            opposed to holding down ~accelerate~ and turning every once in a            while. Aiding in your progress during your races are the obligatory            powerups of varying types, including fireballs to shoot up the            behinds of your competitors, and huge blobs of weird glue stuff to            slow down hapless tailgaters. The handling of your vehicle soon            becomes second nature, and it's then that you can begin to            appreciate the impressive amount of attention applied to the racing            environments.                    While a little too cartoon-like to draw comparisons with the visual            stylisation of the movie, New York Race is nonetheless graphically            splendid, and occasionally you really do get the feeling of            swooping around a bustling, future city in a cool Back To The            Future 2 stylee. Weaving in and out of skyscrapers, through railway            tunnels, through an aquarium and even an amusement park, you rarely            get the chance to stop and take in your surroundings, but there's            always something going on. Cargo trains whir along their            spaghetti-junction track networks, lanes of traffic obstruct your            progression and honk their horns as you hurtle past, and lifts and            pedestrian walkways seem to do their best to jump in your path.            This all adds up to an experience that is surprisingly            exhilarating, though slightly frustrating on occasion.                         Your success in a race can be startlingly random, and it's here            that the game falters quite badly. If you mess up the method of            getting a boost when the race begins, for example, you may as well            press escape there and then, since the opponents never get it            wrong. Ever. Even if you do manage fairly well for your first lap            or so, if you hit one single obstacle you can usually wave goodbye            to your pole position as the flawless AI opponents deftly shoot            past your struggling car and round the corner. This annoyance            becomes particularly evident in the later tracks, when the level            design becomes ridiculously random and obstacles seem to appear            from nowhere, leaving you to stop-start hopelessly towards your            inevitable finish in 8th place.                         Aside from the championship, which you can breeze through once            you've memorised the tracks after enough retries, the rest of the            game is a shallow rehash of the simple racing formula. There is            simply nothing here to warrant subsequent replays when the            championship is over with and you've unlocked all the vehicles. The            whole game actually reminded me somewhat of the equally            unfulfilling Star Wars Racer; while initially charming, the appeal            soon gives way to mounting frustration and eventually boredom. When            the production values are so obviously high in other areas of the            game, it's a shame Kalisto couldn't have spent more time thinking            of something more fun to do with it all.                    New York Race is a fun little arcade racer which oozes style, but            it's something you'll grow tired of extremely quickly and as such            remains fun only in short bursts. While the tracks are pleasantly            varied, the game dynamic grows stale before the impressive visuals,            and you're soon left with an empty experience devoid of any replay            value."}
