Thankfully we can spareyou the sight of high court judges in ladies underwear as it's verymuch the former that we're discussing here today.Now, those of you who know a thing or two about the noble gameof cricket will know that against all expectations and historicalprecedent, whisper it, England are actually rather good at themoment. One of the main reasons for their revival being ourtalented captain Michael Vaughan who generously lends his name tothis mobile title and to be honest, unlike certain licenses wecould mention, this time the game is well deserving of such highpatronage.Distinctive Developments have managed to distil the game down toits essential elements to provide a game that is instantly playablefor those who don't know Michael Vaughan from Johnny Vaughan,whilst offering a sustained challenge for the Wisden-totingfaithful. Wisely, they've shied away from a full test-seriesoption, concentrating instead on the shorter 20:20 game, a special10-overs per side tournament and a series of comparatively shortchallenges where you'll have to try and recreate or beat historicsituations, although there is also a one day international mode ifyou're feeling up to something more meaty.The game moves along at a respectable pace, so you don't have toarrange an official tea break in order to finish a match. Onceyou've picked your mode of play you can then select a squad from 16test nations, nominate your top 11 and depending on who wins thetoss decide whether you'll go into bat first or try and bowl outthe opposition. Both can be controlled one-handed via a joypad anduse the same down-the-wicket viewpoint which sounds limiting but isactually incredibly handy in helping you learn the best line tobowl or shots to play.Where batting is a matter of timing and shot selection (thereare 7 basic shots on offer accessed by tapping a direction once ortwice), bowling demands a little more finesse as you select afield-setting and type of bowler (spinner or pace) before thebowler starts his run up. Once the man in white (or rather blue,red or yellow - these are international kits) has startedmoving you need to stop a vertical then horizontally moving targetin exactly the right place before he hits the crease and launchesthe ball wicket-wards. Should the batsmen manage to make contactthe scene switches to an overhead view so you can see where theball is heading and whether there's a chance of a catch (or morelikely whether your field setting looks woefully badlyplaced).With straightforward bowl-outs, edges to slips and catches allmaking an appearance, there are plenty of ways to lose your wicketas you'll discover rather too often when you initially take thecrease yourself - batting is trickier than it looks. Indeed itdemands almost as much concentration as the real thing. Howeverpersevere and you'll soon be able to knock up a quick 50 beforeyour middle order collapse, and collapse they may well do, as thereseems to be a definite skills differential between top and lowerorder batsmen (as indeed there are between the internationalsides).Presentation is as solid as the gameplay, with well-thought outvisuals, suitably understated complimentary sounds and plenty ofnice touches such as the incidental animations for catches andumpire decisions and the appearance of Vaughan himself, popping upwith praise or caustic remarks after good shots or dismissals. Thegame isn't perfect though, batting sometimes feels far tooskittish, the lack of a 'save' facility is a very annoyingoversight and members of the balmy army would rightly decry thelack of lbws, varied weather conditions, tiring bowlers ordeteriorating pitches. None of these elements is really enough todistract from a thoroughly enjoyable game though, and most can befixed in later editions which hopefully should occur, and mostcertainly will if England manage to win the Ashes..."}
