Whenever times are dark, we can            always look to the master of the platform to rejuvenate our            interest in the console on the whole and force us to persevere with            the hard-to-see LCD screen.                         Golden Sun from Camelot Software Planning is a perfect example. As            50% of the platform's role-playing quotient (Breath of Fire being            the only other GBA RPG released in the west so far) it carries the            hopes of an entire legion of fans, and Nintendo can ill-afford for            it to fail dismally. Fortunately then it's a little stunner, right            from the opening scenes of the game, as Isaac awakens to find his            home town of Vale besieged by the worst storm in years and an            enormous boulder threatening to crush the town if the elders cannot            hold it back with their psynergy.                        Boasting an almost Final Fantasy-esque scale of events, the game            introduces you to countless new characters in these opening            minutes, including the nipper Garet, your best chum, and Jenna,            another companion. You also fleetingly make an acquaintance with            Felix, Jenna's brother, as he clings for dear life to a lone tree            stump in the river, lest he be ripped to shreds by the surging            current. Your first task is to find townsfolk to help Felix. Before            you can really do anything however, the boulder overcomes the            elders and cascades down the mountain, crushing and killing all in            its path.                    Emotions run high throughout mother nature's assault on Vale, but            not high enough for you to ignore the spectacular visual effects            for which Camelot is responsible. The only games that really looked            this good on the SNES - the usual comparison - were the late Donkey            Kong Country games. Subtly detailed buildings and landscapes with            lusciously rendered graphics and all sorts of borderline            technologies for the platform such as genuine transparency,            particle effects, sprite scaling and (particularly on the world            map) rotation.                         From the game's dramatic opening, the player is whisked three            years into the future, with the town rebuilt but the lives of its            inhabitants devastated by the loss of community figures like            Isaac's dad, the spirited Kyle and Jenna's brother Felix. Isaac and            Garet have bettered themselves however, and are now adept in the            skills of psynergy. Psynergy is Golden Sun's magic system, and            flows - like the Force I suppose, and that's not the only Star Wars            comparison I could draw - through every living thing, the theory            being that they are made up of the four elements; earth, wind, fire            and water.                         After overhearing two strangers (whom our heroes also ran into on            the night of the storm) conversing about Sol Sanctum, the sacred            temple in the mountain, Kraden - a wise old man befriended by the            trio - leads them there, sneaking past the guard and into Sol            Sanctum, where our heroes get their first taste of the game's true            action; random encounters.                    Whether you like random battles or not, you're going to have to get            used to them if you want to play Golden Sun. As our heroes work            their way deeper and deeper into Sol Sanctum they encounter puzzles            and monsters in abundance. The puzzles are usually quite            self-explanatory and take a few moments to complete, but they do            get fairly difficult later on in the game.                         The game's battle system also matures. Switching to the battle            screen for turn-based combat, our heroes can use basic attacks to            begin with. Each is armed with a melee combat weapon, but their            psynergy is used for benevolent and at times inappropriate spells            at this point - using 'move' is hardly likely to help your party in            a tough fight. When it comes to random encounters, players are            given the option to fight or flee, but it helps to fight these            battles because getting your party up to a reasonable level will be            crucial to success against the game's more demanding foes.                         It takes a couple of hours - and a few more bombshells - before            our heroes are ready to depart Vale on a greater quest, but by the            time they do the player will have caught up with their special            abilities and wielding psynergy will seem like child's play. Before            long out in the open though players encounter a Djinn\u2026 Djinn            are a bit like Pok\u00e9mon, you've gotta catch 'em all. These            creatures can be equipped to a specific player, and the first of            them which you meet can be used in battle to increase the potency            of Isaac's blade. Once used though, Djinn can then summon ethereal            spirits to really lay waste to the party's aggressors. The only            problem being that you have to let Djinn get their strength back            between attacks. As a result they add a degree of depth to the            game's combat system but also manage to avoid becoming the Guardian            Forces of the 21st Century. When Final Fantasy VIII was originally            released, many complained that summoning the game's GFs was -            before long - the key to winning every single battle without            hindrance. Because the Djinn tire quickly, other attacks have to be            used, and players grow in their own abilities as well.                    The quests beyond the search for Sol Sanctum are extremely            involving and take you all over the game world. As much as I would            love to gush about these quests, the trophies they bring you and            the people that join your party as a result, it would be extremely            unfair of me, because anybody in their right mind will rush out and            buy Golden Sun at the first opportunity and play it for themselves.            Suffice it to say, this is a semi-linear adventure with a lot of            distractions. One of the first sub-quests outside of Vale is to            help Ivan of Vault - who quickly discovers his strange abilities            are known as psynergy - to find a stolen artefact using his            mind-reading capabilities.                         Golden Sun's soundtrack and sound effects in general are also            straight out of the top drawer. A concerto of pan pipes and string            instruments helps to convey the safety and comfort of the townsfolk            whilst stronger, more exasperated music accompanies the party into            battle. On the sound effect front, we could hardly expect dubbed            voices on a GameBoy cart, but each of the game's occupants utters a            distinctive gibberish to accompany their text box, and although I            feared I would bore of this extremely quickly, I actually rather            liked it. Your mileage may vary.                         As an afterthought perhaps, Camelot have even included a            two-player mode. Restrictive though it is, you can actually link up            with fellow Golden Sun owners and challenge their party to combat.            This is a testament to the number of ways the average party can            develop within Golden Sun. It all depends on who you assign Djinn            to and whose psynergy you concentrate on. Oh, and what sort of            funny name you chose instead of 'Isaac'\u2026                    As far as handheld RPGs go, this is probably the pinnacle thus far.            Beating Breath of Fire hands down in terms of graphics,            presentation, sound and gameplay, the only thing one might            find is that the game is over somewhat quickly. Spaced out over a            few weeks of standard GBA play the average gamer will have no            complaints, and the 'save anywhere' feature is a comfort for            commuters, but going at it like a bat out of hell I managed to            scramble through the game in just two days. It was certainly an            awesome experience though, and if you have the stomach for random            encounters you should seek this game out on its release and play it            to death, if only because we need to encourage more of this sort of            behaviour from Nintendo.                        -                            Golden Sun screenshots                    Golden Sun screenshots"}
