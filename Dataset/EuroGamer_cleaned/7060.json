The PC            versions of Solitaire, Hearts and Freecell which have been included            with Windows since the dawn of time have for all intents and            purposes become the most popular computer games in history. Along            with Minesweeper, the games have defined gaming with a PC, and if            my own laptop is anything to go by, see more use than any            work-related program out there for mobile businessmen.                         As such it's really quite startling when you realise that before            Uno, the GameBoy Color had very little in the way of card games to            keep the player occupied. No wonder then that developers HotGen            decided to work on it whilst other programmers in the company            beavered away on the GBC conversion of Resident Evil, it's the            perfect stop-gap.                         But at \u00a320, it is just a card game. How worthwhile is the            expenditure at such a price? And how good an implementation of the            classic holiday card game is it?                    There may be those of you who have never heard of Uno, a            Mattel-licensed concept. Thankfully, it's very simple to get the            hang of, which no doubt sits in its favour as a pick-up-and-play            GameBoy title. The idea is that 6 cards are dealt to each player,            and the person who runs out of cards first, wins! The cards come in            four colours and are numbered 0-9.                         First of all, a card is placed on the table, and the first player            has to put down a card of equal number or the same colour, and so            on, round in a circle. If a player cannot do this, he takes a card            from the bottom of the pile and things continue. When a player is            down to just one card, he or she has to claim ~Uno!~ If you forget            to do this, your sly opponents get to chuckle maniacally and you            are forced to take a further two cards from the pile.                         If alarm bells are ringing in your head, don't be surprised. It's            played all over the globe, as the long nights draw in, usually in            summer weather on the south coast of France I've found, and can            easily be played with a standard deck of 52 cards, by using cards            Ace-9 or similar. The Mattel version is simply a little easier to            use, from a purely aesthetic point of view.                    On the GameBoy, there are two versions of the game to check out.            Both can be played against three other computer players or three            friends via link-up. First off is plain-vanilla Uno, except in            order to win you need to collect points. These points are the total            of the cards left in your opponents' possession, so the better you            are, the faster you win.                         In the other version, Challenge Uno, it's pretty much the other            way round. When you lose a round, you keep the points amassed from            your own cards, and when you hit a certain amount of points you            drop out. This works quite well, but often you end up with two            particularly unlucky players going out pretty much simultaneously.                         Nevertheless, both versions are entertaining and quite addictive,            especially with human players controlling the other cardplayers.                    However, Uno has three very distinct problems associated with it on            the GameBoy. Firstly, you are expected to hit the ~Uno!~ button            ever so quickly when you're down to one card, and on countless            occasions I would lose a round simply because I hadn't managed to            hit it in time. This is of course one of the quirks of the game as            a whole, but the amount of time allotted to this simple motion is            far too small.                         The second issue is down to the human factor, but is nonetheless            rather annoying. When you're playing Uno out on the patio with your            friends, you or one of your friends are in charge of shuffling the            cards, in full view of you, and you have no real qualms if the pack            consistently goes against you, since it's just bad luck.                         But if the pack goes against you very often when the computer is            the dealer you sometimes wonder just how fair the whole thing            really is. Although it's a physical impossibility to show the            computer shuffling and dealing the cards in front of you, you do            resent being treated with anonymity.                         Finally, in an attempt to bring some fun to proceedings, there is            an animated Uno card, which performs in-between rounds and such.            And it is the single most annoying thing I have encountered since            that sodding paper clip in Microsoft Office. You can turn it off in            the Options menu, and you will certainly want to do this. After            about three seconds.                    Although ultimately it's just a card game, it is a very addictive            card game. It's not like Solitaire in its approach; it's very            hands-on and fast-moving, but you do feel compelled to keep playing            for just one more round, and I've found throughout my time using            the GameBoy that there is no higher recommendation."}
