We've seen Tiger Woods-emblazoned alternatives from            Electronic Arts, an array of erstwhile competitors go the way of            the bunker, and all the while Microsoft has polished and buffed its            prize simulation to the extent that it really is golf through and            through. But such a perfect simulation needs a beautiful shell to            give it life, and unfortunately Links 2003 comes up short in that            department.        As far            as the yearly updates go, Links 2003 is probably the most            significant change in over five years. Significant development            effort has resulted in the real-time swing, which aims to compete            with the likes of Tiger Woods. The new swing system simulates a            golf swing through movement of the mouse - rather like Virtual Pool            simulated cue movement. Simply select the club you want and point            yourself in the right direction, then click the club icon and            control the swing in real-time by pulling the mouse back and            thrusting it forward again. The system works very well and takes a            lot of work to master - the ideal inclusion you might say.                    Well, yes and no. Of course it mimics that which has gone before,            but that can't be helped. Its inclusion is admission that those            systems worked well and that they deserve a place in Links. What            really irks is that MS hasn't included a horizontal swing option.            However accurate; however brilliant the back/forward system is,            there should be an option to move the mouse side-to-side instead,            which other games have been doing for a while.                    However, the real-time swing setup does come with an excellent            feedback system, which highlights faults in your swing and teaches            you the best way to thwack the ball. The game's suggestions            actually correlate to what you'd be told on a real golf course, and            that's a theme which runs throughout - Links 2003 is staggeringly            realistic. The ball movement and physics are almost perfect, and            the golf engine allows for almost every variable - we couldn't            think of anything it doesn't do.                    Perhaps disappointingly, there are only six new courses on offer            (with a separate course pack available for a few extra quid), but            five of the six are based on real courses, and all six are very            challenging. You won't waltz into the record books on these courses            - you'll have to fight to hit the green in regulation, particularly            on the harsh back nines. As for AI opposition - it knows how to            play, and will definitely keep you going for quite some time. At            the time of writing we've only hit the clubhouse below par on a few            occasions, and that's playing from the middle tees with conditions            in our favour.                    Sadly though, the conditions - and the environment in general - are            Links' biggest failing. The rebuilt graphics engine features fully            3D player models, thankfully spelling the end of motion-captured            golfers, and player movement and animation is spot on, helping to            give the game a more organic feel, but this attention to detail at            the tee-end of the game hasn't extended onto the fairways. The            problem is the backgrounds, which is all the courses are. In the            foreground we have the golfer, but once the ball leaves the club it            lands somewhere on the screen, as the camera sits and waits. There            is no zooming to follow the ball, no clever camera tricks, no            moment of excitement as you watch it fall handily. The engine just            doesn't support it.        What you do get is a            few seconds of waiting while the game simulates the ball's path and            then renders the next screen in sequence. It's very boring. When            you consider that the golfers spend time onscreen taking practice            swings and stretching between shots, the idea of a completely            unmoving course seems a bit alien, but there you have it. Links is            and always has been like playing into a postcard, and these days            that won't wash.                    That's not to say the backgrounds aren't a sight. Beautiful isn't            the word - these high resolution scenes are almost photographic at            times. It's just the feeling of detachment from reality that causes            problems.                    Audio is equally uninspired. Beyond the meaty sound of walloping            the ball and the swooshing noise the club makes, there is virtually            nothing. Oh, each of the golfers has a sound file which includes a            few choice witticisms and comments, and canned applause can be            turned on, but there is no ambient noise whatsoever. On the whole            the game feels lifeless to play, even though it's one of the most            calculating and downright realistic simulations of any sport to            date - a real shame.                    However easily the most damning thing about Links 2003 is the            lock-up bugs. On more than one occasion (four, actually), our            rounds were cut short by a hard lock-up, which left us with no            option but to reset. It's seemingly random, and it happened on two            separate machines - one Athlon and GeForce3-based and one P4 and            Radeon-based.        Moving back to the plus side though, Links does go one better            than its opposition with an online multiplayer mode. Although            Tiger's console-based hot-seating multiplayer is still a clear            winner, the ability to pick a fight with rival golfers around the            globe deserves to be taken seriously. You can even compete in            tournaments via email...                    And if all that still bores you, you can create your own            entertainment with Arnold Palmer's Course Designer 1.5, provided as            a bonus on CD3. It's quite tricky to get the hang of, but with a            bit of work you can create some really challenging and entertaining            holes. Packing them chockfull of hazards is usually a safe bet.                    All things considered, if you're a fan of Links, 2003 offers a very            nice update to your favourite golf title. Indeed, even if you're            not, this is unquestionably the most realistic golf simulation ever            offered on any platform, but the question you need to ask yourself            is, is that enough for me? After a few hours we found ourselves            longing to be playing Tiger Woods on the PS2 once again, with its            remarkable production values and attention to detail. The results            it produces may not be quite so precisely correct, but it's a lot            more 'fun'.                    Links 2003 is a postcard from the game engine revamp Links 2004            will hopefully deliver. If it does, it will be unstoppable. Until            then, it's same old same old.
