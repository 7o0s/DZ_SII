Unfortunately, like those            fantastic-looking Japanese RPGs that we can see but never touch,            it's slightly less exciting when you get your hands on it.            Described (mostly by the American press) as an MGS-killer, and the            sting in the Dreamcast's tail, Headhunter amounts to an immense and            beautifully detailed adventure through a near-future dystopian            society. It does live up to its billing. Eventually.                         Like Metal Gear Solid (and to a greater extent its elusive            sequel), Headhunter is an extremely deep game. In terms of story            and setting, it arguably has Solid Snake and the boys beat. The            game begins with what will turn out to be one of its staples -            off-the-wall news broadcasters painting their bleak picture of life            under the privatised Anti-Crime Network. In a culture where bodily            organs are more valuable than their weight in gold, and with so            little left to privatise, the government has handed over powers of            censorship, media control and propaganda to Christopher Stern. The            ACN quickly develops into a lucrative business, with a training            programme open to any civilian.                         It's into this picture that you - Jack Wade, a former ACN            ~Headhunter~ - now step. After watching a back-to-back showreel of            broadcasts plotting the life of Christopher Stern, the game begins            with his death. For reasons which aren't immediately clear, at the            same time you are bound to some sort of electric chair in the            depths of a supposedly governmental installation, and after ripping            yourself from the shackles and disposing of some guards you make a            daring escape against the clock, fighting to get out before noxious            gases overwhelm you. This is real ~thrown in at the deep-end~            stuff, and you find yourself running aimlessly through the            corridors until it becomes obvious that this tactic will leave you            dead.                    Escaping the installation is easy once you've learnt a thing or two            about firing your gun. The game's basic training mode will            introduce you to the controls, and should be your first port of            call when you start playing. It also introduces you to Jack. Jack,            like most of the denizens of his world, is tall and slim - rather            like the Todd McFarlane Spawn cartoons - and he has a reasonably            bushy beard. Jack can duck, walk and run, but like Solid Snake he            has a jumping deficiency, although he can dive into a roll from any            position. He can also press his back up against the wall in            crouched and standing positions, then using the L or R buttons duck            his head and pistol around the corner to fire on his enemies.                         Unfortunately, unlike Metal Gear Solid, Headhunter has a slightly            finicky control system. There are certainly lots of buttons to            learn in MGS, but they all do as they are supposed to. In            Headhunter, ducking round a corner requires you to be right next to            it; Jack doesn't just shuffle along. In standing position you can            make him edge gently closer using the analogue stick, but from a            crouching position you cannot. Sometimes under fire I have actually            had to stand Jack up, quickly move him left or right a few paces            and then duck him down again. Often behind a crate that barely            covers the crouching Jack model. Argh!                         One thing Amuze did get right about the control system is the            dramatic firing system. Once Jack is about to fire the game targets            an enemy, and you can use the X button to cycle through targets or            manually aim. Like in GTA3, the manual option is unwieldy at first            and you really ought to get used to the standard firing mechanism.            The cool thing about the guns though is their effect. Instead of            firing high-speed projectiles they have been developed - like the            other weapons in your arsenal - to disarm, maim and kill quietly,            without damaging vital organs. Now that's scary.                    Having mastered the controls and escaped the facility, Jack Wade            finds his way into an alley and collapses, only to come to later in            hospital. From there, he meets his old Chief, who sets him straight            on the game's premise. You are Jack Wade. You used to be the best            Headhunter in the game, but you lost your memory and your job.            Don't trust anyone.                         After the Chief leaves, another very important character emerges.            Angela Stern is the daughter of former ACN head honcho Christopher            Stern, and a quick trip to her home later (unlike today, hanging            around in hospital in Headhunter costs organs) you find out a great            deal about her. She went to MIT, she studied and rebelled            hard, both to annoy her father, and now she is obsessed with his            death and wants to know who killed him. She also gifts Wade the            other important aspect of his arsenal - the motorcycle. Now, Amuze            intended for Headhunter to be a game about stealth, action and            story-driven adventure, but they also wanted some roaring engines            too. The bike is driven in third-person mode and goes extremely            fast. Like normal bikes, its front wheels pitch up when you ride it            hard from standing, and this can make it somewhat unruly at first,            but you get the hang of it.                         With the plot dump over, your first job is to get LEILA-certified            by completing a series of examinations which explore both physical            and mental aspects of possible Headhunters. The LEILA system works            in steps, with different license tests in categories C, B and A,            covering firearms, stealth procedure and even motorcycle use. To            proceed you must reach at least grade C, constantly fighting the            clock to beat the LEILA times and also competing with burly,            girlfriend-less, dog-abandoning tosspot Hank, the city's current            number one Headhunter. Despite looking like a cross between Duke            Nukem and a grisly bear, Hank is a big girl's blouse. But he's also            mischievous, and you'll quickly find out that he's not the only            one.                    As you can tell, Headhunter is no flash in the pan. It begins            slowly and builds the player up. You are forever learning new            skills in the fight against crime, and the story is told through            scripted sequences and a mixture of in-game and CG cutscenes            (including further news broadcasts). The reward system which            regularly offers you new weapons and other incentives is enough to            keep players coming back for more.                        Unfortunately, as a Dreamcast title first and foremost, the one            area where a game with Headhunter's scope is bound to lose out in            is visuals. After walking around the tutorial for five minutes with            the hype still swirling around in my head, I did find myself            blurting out something rude about the textures. To be fair to Amuze            though, the game's character models are exemplary, to the highest            definition the Dreamcast permits, while the CG and in-game            cutscenes are admirable. Weapon animations are perhaps a little            rudimentary, and certainly don't have that satisfying thwock of            locking-and-loading a Counter-Strike gun, but they fit reasonably.                         There are three main areas I would complain about, however.            Firstly, brightness. Okay, I accept that not every city is a            smog-covered metropolis of towering skyscrapers and corporate            takeovers, but the futuristic world Jack inhabits doesn't do            anything to convey the sense of despair and manic capitalism that            one would expect to find. Given the game's credentials, the poor            character animation in places (which sees Jack arse-sagging            practically to the ground as he runs) is unacceptable, as is the            quality of the textures. Ultimately this is no Metal Gear Solid 2,            but was it ever going to be? The game does reach Shenmue levels of            detail at times, and in an obvious gesture for Kojima and co.'s            benefit, the first sections of the game boast a spangly rain            effect.                    Although visually less-than-sumptuous in places, Headhunter            compensates for its shortfalls by including a lavishly detailed            storyline and unpredictable gameplay. Unlike its main competitor it            also sounds the part, with some excellent voice-acting and            scripting. You won't find yourself clicking through the cutscenes            searching for some action in Headhunter. Amuze have created a game            which rivals Kojima's opus in terms of excitement and maintains its            pace and depth throughout, but it's hardly pick-up-and-play.                         Pick this game up with a head full of hype and you will wonder why            you bothered, but after a while the game hooks you and won't let            go. Anything conceivably possible in a world where vital organs are            currency and you have a beard, a gun and a motorcycle belonging to            a big-breasted billionaire actually happens. It's a dreadful shame            that the game won't be released domestically in the States, but we            implore any American readers to seek out a copy regardless. Along            with everybody else in possession of a Dreamcast. Quite simply, a            masterpiece of modern videogame development."}
