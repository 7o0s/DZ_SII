It's just that compared to the likes of Virtua            Tennis, it's complete pish. After a few rounds of Slam Tennis            you'll be moaning about awkward player behaviour, pitiful diving            motions, overly complicated serving systems, ridiculous ~super            shots~ which ultimately decide every point, the way the ball heads            towards your opponent no matter which way you hit it, and the fact            that ninety percent of the time you can barely see the ball anyway,            because in motion it's hard to pick out from the court surface. All            in all, bestowing the accolade of best PS2 tennis title on Slam            Tennis is a pretty harsh indictment of the rest of the genre.                         Fans of Pete Sampras (hrm), Andre Agassi (that's feasible) and            Anna Kournikova (well, yes) will also be disappointed, because            apart from Carlos Moya, Magnus Norman, English ne'er do well Tim            Henman and a couple of others, you won't recognise any of Slam            Tennis' protagonists. They all look roughly anatomically correct,            but the player models are pretty poor, and given how static most of            their surroundings can afford to be, this is a severe letdown. For            some reason, Infogrames Sheffield have wasted their opportunity to            harness the PS2's capabilities here and instead have chosen to            bookend every point with unhelpful replays of the last shot,            swooping scoreboard views and other pointless pageantry.                         There's enough to do here, with exhibition and tournament matches,            a training mode which has you blasting serves at blocks and other            nonsense, and a fairly enjoyable multiplayer mode, but all are            merely constituents of a fruitless could-have-been. It must have            been obvious that things were too awkward even to those working on            it - serving is a hit-button-twice power bar affair, but even the            slightest tug of the control stick back or forward on the downswing            will achieve a fault, a fine waste of the analogue stick. And            although building up a power bar and unleashing a lightning winner            might sound good in theory, it means that winning points is simply            about double-tapping the circle button at the right time. What's            worse is that you'll only win or lose points prior to super shots            by screwing up, because the ball is rarely hit anywhere other than            within slapping distance of the other player.                    These days, you can buy a Dreamcast and a copy of Virtua Tennis for            absolute peanuts, and I strongly suggest that you seek out Sega's            little beige box if you're after some tennis action and have forty            quid burning a hole in your pocket. If you absolutely must have a            PS2 tennis title, then this is the best so far, but I can't imagine            that I'll be playing it again any time soon."}
