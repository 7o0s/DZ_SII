The novelty graphics            are definitely the game's best feature, and the chances are that            the main thing you know about the game is that it basks and roars            beneath an elegant cel-shaded veneer; that speed lines are drawn in            front of you as you race through tunnels, neon cityscapes and leafy            autumn hairpin magnets; that the cars have been modelled as well as            they need to be, on the cream of Japanese motorsport, but without            inheriting every single unnecessary line, nook and cranny; and that            in-keeping with Capcom's recent pledge to treat hardcore gamers            with a bit more respect, it boasts both 60Hz and widescreen            options.                    What you won't know until you play it is that Auto Modellista is            split into several main sections; Arcade, Garage Life (career),            Replay Theatre and VJ mode, that it doesn't play as well as it            looks, that it's limited throughout and that it's far, far too            easy. But let's not get carried away just yet.        The Arcade aspect is split into single race, time trial and            head-to-head modes, and it shares its collection of cars and tracks            with Garage Life, which is where you unlock more of them. It's all            pretty self-explanatory, apart from the VJ mode, which allows you            to tinker with the way your races replay, like inverting colours,            adding pans, zooms, camera changes and special visual effects, and            even changing the soundtrack (complete with one of those            wonderfully comic sound test modes to try everything out).                    Garage Life mode is where you're expected to spend most of your            time. Auto Modellista's creators may not have worked on a driving            game before (which is more than evident elsewhere), but they            certainly know about wrenches, sockets, sprockets, cogs, wheels and            other bits of car [I'm not sure those were all 'bits of car'            actually, Mr. So-called Autophile -Ed]. Unlike Gran Turismo though,            you're not expected to work your way up the ranks, and can plump            for any car from a handful of Japanese manufacturers including            Nissan, Toyota, Suzuki, Subaru and Mazda. It's a bit disappointing            to see a complete absence of European and American cars, but            presumably Capcom didn't want to splash too much cash on its first            racing title. Expect to see a more varied selection in the            inevitable (hopefully improved) sequel.                    Once you've chosen your car (Subaru Impreza WRX sounds good to us)            then you can set about tuning it, altering suspension, balance,            weight reduction and other values (or leaving it up to the CPU) and            - once you've amassed some cash - buying new parts. You can also            create your own number plate, deck out your car in curious colour            schemes, or even develop your own. The game's producer Yoshihiro            Sudo went for a pink outer shell with a grey bonnet and a big Auto            Modellista logo at this year's ECTS demonstration, revealing that            he actually drives a car very much like it in real life. So, if            you're a boy racer with a souped up VW Golf circa 1980, which looks            like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang laced with LSD, then Auto Modellista            is probably the game for you. You can even put posters up in your            own personal garage, which is nice.                    Connoisseurs of finer automobiles may find the initial absence of            classy offerings a bit off-putting, but if you can put up with            driving a modern gas guzzler then you'll be rewarded after a time            with access to some truly lovely old concept cars and speedsters,            our favourite being the Nissan Fairlady 240Z.        Know though you may that Auto Modellista looks            good, it isn't until you trundle out onto the circuit for a single            race that the full impact of the game's cel-shaded visuals makes            its presence known. The cars look fantastic, aping real life            designs without relying on too much superficial detail to get the            point across. The bodywork gleams with the sort of multi-tone            cel-shading that, oddly, Zelda has been so warmly praised for in            the specialist press.                    Tracks are less consistent though - in many cases, your immediate            surroundings are cel-shaded, but buildings, bridges, trees,            barriers and scenery beyond the racetrack look decidedly drab. The            problem is that when a building stops looking like a cartoon, you            pay more attention to the blandness of the texturing (since most            cels are just blocks of colour), and the overall effect seems            poorer.                    Another problem is in collisions. Cars turn almost sideways at even            the slightest brush, and in the complete absence of appreciable            damage (either visually or in gameplay terms), it leaves the cars            looking like Day-Glo toys being flung together.                    There are some nice effects to take your mind off it though. The            weather and time of day varies, and Capcom has paid a lot of            attention to the little details, like the sight of little splashes            of water kicking up from the tyres in the rain and lights flitting            through the raindrops, the leaves which float up from the track in            your wake, the way the cars dip through tunnels before the camera            catches up (which embodies the pit-of-your-stomach feeling            peculiarly well) and the way speed lines emanate, sparks fly as            cars collide and things like wheelspin are represented on-screen -            it's all remarkably well done.                    Some people will draw too much attention to the little inadequacies            - even those for which the PS2 must shoulder the blame, like the            overly jagged look - but on the whole Auto Modellista is very            successful in its attempts to bring cel-shading to racing, and            Capcom is bound to improve upon it with the sequel.        So, given our stance in the opening folly, and the decidedly            upbeat tone since, you may be gradually wising up to where Auto            Modellista falls down. And fall down it does.                    We would have been happy for Auto Modellista to look a bit pants            for all its cel-shading PR, if only it had played like Ridge Racer.            If there was only one car and one track, and it played like Gran            Turismo, we would have encouraged people to rent or steal it. But            given the shape of the handling, AI and challenge, it's very            difficult to remain positive.                    The main problem is in the braking and steering. Acceleration is            easy, and manoeuvring through traffic at low speeds is also pretty            simple, but this is an arcade racer, and as such there's a desire            and expectation for players to paste the accelerator down and            expect to weave through hairpins as if they were slip roads on a            motorway. Sadly, it takes really heavy, speed-shattering braking to            make it through turns, and the handbrake behaviour is just plain            odd. Furthermore, turning is awkward at best with the brakes            clamped down, so the whole process of driving cars in Auto            Modellista is quite arduous and counter-intuitive.                    In order to balance this, the game is actually overly easy, too.            Track design varies from endless straights to tight clusters of            hairpins, but no matter how badly you drive, you can almost always            ease through to first place simply by driving very fast. With only            nine tracks (although you can race them forwards, backwards,            mirrored etc), you'll quickly tire of the environments, too, and            unlock everything the game has to offer.                    Auto Modellista would be an excellent game if all we did was look            at the pretty pictures and fiddle with car design, but Capcom has            singularly failed to keep the driving end up for us, and it hurts            the game. And in the absence of the previously promised            multiplayer, we're left with very little to recommend. It has been            suggested that a multiplayer disc may be released once PS2 has gone            online in Europe, but frankly we'd rather wait for Capcom to learn            from its mistakes and produce something truly memorable with the            sequel. Hiring some Ridge Racer fanatics to help with the design            wouldn't hurt, either.
