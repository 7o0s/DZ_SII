{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-soaf-pc", "date": "21 Aug 2002", "game_name": "Sum Of All Fears", "text": "Loosely based on the movie of the same name, which is in turn            loosely based on the Tom Clancy book, The Sum of All Fears is            exactly the type of material we've come to expect from Red Storm,            albeit in a hugely diluted form. I'd be surprised if we could get a            more straightforward, no-nonsense, almost FPS-like ~tactical~            shooter out of them.                         You take charge of a team of domestic counter-terrorism experts            formed from the best of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, and your            first couple of missions in the game take place as part of this            group. As you wrest control of a TV station from a West Virginian            militia group you gain the attention of the CIA though, and when            someone decides to let off a nuclear bomb at the Superbowl in            Baltimore your newly formed team is sent on a string of eleven            missions hopping across the globe to track down the perpetrators.                         The game plays very much like Rainbow Six, but has done away            completely with the preliminary planning stages, lacking even the            mid-mission map plotting of Ghost Recon. Instead you're sent off            with a set course to follow on your HUD map and two other team            members to work with. There aren't usually any other teams involved            in your missions, but when there are you have no control over their            actions and will only come into contact with them briefly as your            paths cross. Apart from these cuts, the only other major feature            difference compared to the Rainbow Six games is the inclusion of a            command menu. This works much like the menu we're used to from SWAT            3, and it works very well; commanding your troops to open a door            and flash the room couldn't be simpler, and they even crouch to            clear your line of sight.                    In general your team's AI is a mixed bag though, and agents            still occasionally exhibit problems negotiating doors and            the corners of furniture, leading me to wonder whether Red Storm            are ever going to iron out this niggle. By contrast the terrorist            AI appears to work a lot better; they scatter when you make your            presence known, negotiate the environment well, take cover and            shout for help. I couldn't tell if their behaviour was scripted or            not, but it contrasted sharply with that of my own team mates as            they took shot after shot and refused to run for cover or even to            shoot back.                         This might have something to do with the fact that Sum Of All            Fears is the first game to really let the Ghost Recon engine try            its hand at proper indoor environments. Frankly though, if it            wasn't for the fact that the main interface was exactly the same as            that found in Ghost Recon, I might not have noticed. Buildings look            like low-poly movie sets and there's no real sign of advancement            over the similar environments we were furnished with in Rainbow Six            and its sprawling family. I was expecting a lot more from the            engine to be honest, and what's here is merely okay.                         The texturing is probably the most impressive part of the package,            and the developers have done their best to paint a realistic world,            although this work is let down by low detail on the constructions            themselves. Character animation is another highpoint, as we've come            to expect from Red Storm, apart from some strange choices of death            animation; shooting someone in the back of the head only for him to            fly dramatically backwards as if caught in a grenade blast not only            defies the laws of physics (either that or he was just a bad            actor), but also looks incredibly silly.                    The Sum of All Fears isn't bad, but it isn't anything special            either. The whole thing has a cookie-cutter feel to it, almost as            if Red Storm have specialist software which randomly generates            games for them. It's also ridiculously short, with only eleven            missions that you'll easily finish in a single day's playing,            although the price does just about reflect this. I can't help            thinking that it really would have worked better as a mission pack            for Ghost Recon though, complimenting its large number of outdoor            missions with some much needed indoor action, because it simply            doesn't have the scale or depth we've come to expect from a            standalone game. If you're really desperate for some covert action            and you can't wait for Raven Shield then give it a shot, but I'd            prefer to recommend the far superior SWAT 3 if you haven't already            got it."}
