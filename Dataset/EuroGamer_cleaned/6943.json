But            with spuds. There's some kind of vague story about an inundation of            crazy space spuds from Mars mentioned in the manual, but what it            all boils down to is a puzzle game that lands somewhere between            Tetris and Bust-A-Move.                    Your rescue mission involves matching up the spuds in the street            with another one of the same colour, at which point the pair of            them run off together. If you get it wrong both spuds will continue            to stand around in the road, and a collision with your spud-firing            ~bus~ will cost you a life. The good news is that the spuds only            come in two colours, red and blue (here's a tip - don't eat the            blue ones). The bad news is that you fire three spuds at a time,            which leads to all kinds of frantic button-hammering as you rotate            and flip the two rows of spuds in your tray to get the three that            you want to the front of the bus ready to fire.                    The first few levels are fairly easy, but as you progress through            the game you will find the streets becoming increasingly crowded.            Speed markers at the end of each block allow you to choose how fast            your bus moves, and act as a kind of ersatz difficulty setting. The            higher the speed the higher your score will be, but go too fast and            things can rapidly get overwhelming. Meanwhile obstacles can make            the street narrower, leaving you frantically veering your bus from            side to side across the screen.                    Other street furniture includes bonus mats, which will give you an            extra life or score bonus if you can clear all the potatoes off            them. Your bonus can be increased still further by rescuing            multiplier potatoes, which multiply the number of points that you            earn from the next bonus mat by whatever number is printed on the            sign they wave above their head.                    The psychotic little green potatoes which occassionally show up in            your bus can also be useful. Fire one of these and it will run off            down the screen clubbing any potato it meets with a rolling pin,            clearing an entire column of spuds for you. All of which is            particularly important in the Score mode, in which you must get a            certain number of points to progress to the next level.                    The game also features a Mission mode with its own set of levels,            in which you must save several ~special spuds~ of a particular type            to continue. The special types include munchers, singers, workers            and bouncers, each of which has its own amusing little animation,            ranging from gobbling down food or reading a newspaper to bouncing            its own eyeball around on the street surface.                    It all sounds very stupid, and indeed it is. But it's also            curiously amusing, from the cute cartoon graphics and funny little            sound effects to the frenetic spud-smashing gameplay. The inclusion            of a proper save game system and good old fashioned high score            tables also gives it some extra longevity. Finishing each mode's            seven levels is relatively easy and will probably only take you a            few hours, but it's enjoyable enough that you may want to go back            and try to beat your own scores or see if you can finish the entire            game without dying.                    Hot Potato is not as addictive as Kurukuru Kururin (the GBA's other            puzzle game), but it's still a lot of fun for kids and            not-so-grown-ups alike.                        -        Kurukuru                    Kururin reviewKurukuru                    Kururin reviewThe                    Portable Avant-GardeThe                    Portable Avant-Garde"}
