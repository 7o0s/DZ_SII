Once dead, a bodystarts decomposing just a few minutes after breathing its lastbreath &ndash; so the zombies of Land of the Dead, who've been reanimated for long enoughto take over the world, are understandably pretty ripe. Laying intothem with a crowbar is like hitting over-ripe fruit with, well, acrowbar.Land of the Dead recreates the fully-fledged urban zombiedystopia of George Romero's cult film. A sideways-scrollingplatform game with an emphasis on shooting, you have to bothsurvive and collect food parcels for the remaining survivors of thezombie plague to live on. You can only carry a couple of these at atime though, so you need to pass the parcels through gaps in fencesto your buddies who drive around, following your progress.While this decayed urban setting and action might seem like arecipe for a rather repetitive game, the end result is surprisinglyattractive. Rather than being presented with a monotonousbackground of high-rise blocks, the game's levels offer variousurban landscapes, ranging from residential neighbourhoods to thegrim cityscapes that populate the film upon which Land of the Dead is based. It isn't the sort of thingyou'd expect to ever say, but there's nothing like a bit ofsplattered blood to brighten up a stagnant neighbourhood.Although there isn't a huge arsenal for you to use in the game,the options you do have are more than adequate. Most of the timeyou'll find yourself cycling between the crowbar, an AK47 and theoccasional Molotov cocktail for good measure.Occasional divergences from the standard gameplay stop mattersfrom becoming routine. For example, in one level you find yourselfin a pitch-black building, with only the light of gunfire toilluminate your path, so you need to be careful with ammorationing. In another, the action changes entirely as you control astatic gun emplacement where you have to take down a marauding packof zombies.And while Land of the Dead is certainly not what you would calldeep, a certain amount of strategy pays dividends &ndash; forinstance, when considering your ammo.Less attractively, although all of these elements arewell-executed, the game is painfully short and can be completed inunder an hour. And (spoiler alert!) the ending utilises the cheap'To Be Continued' trick that is especially infuriating when theplot, told through conversation snippets at the start of eachlevel, has been leading up to this moment for several levels. Inthe end, what actually happens is left as a mystery. As such, thegame feels more like an elongated teaser for a longer title than afull game.&nbsp;Also on the demerit sheet, the sound is pretty spartan andthere's no in-game music, although there is a decent gun soundeffect and a great snare-like thwack for the sound of crowbar onzombie skull.What you can look forward to though is a satisfying slice ofzombie mayhem. There are enough different zombie models for it notto feel like you are up against identikit copies of the same singleenemy &ndash; a commendable achievement when you find yourselfkilling literally hundreds of the hell-spawned blighters throughoutthe game.Although the lack of a satisfying climax leaves the plot aslittle more than a series of relatively unconnected events, thestory is enjoyable enough. But make sure you do enjoy Land of the Dead first time around, because while the gameboasts 11 levels, this includes several insubstantial tutorials&ndash; the game is liable to be over before you know it. Withnothing in the way of a high score system, there is little toentice you back for a second play, except any raw desire for a bitmore zombie brain-bashing.A well-made but all too brief nugget of zombie fun"}
