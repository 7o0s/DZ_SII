{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-nolf2-pc", "date": "24 Dec 2002", "game_name": "No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In HARMS Way", "text": "Ah, another belated review copy from Vivendi, but rather like those            contemptuous cinema ads from the mid-90s, this time... it's            laudable. Indeed, far from a hot potato that nobody wanted, NOLF2            was more like a Kylie calendar to the Eurogamer office, and there            were some pretty ugly scenes when it came to choosing the reviewer.            Fortunately, as a master of ugly scenes I triumphed over adversity,            and now I've triumphed over NOLF2, and, I'm delighted to tell you,            it's a bloody good game.        No One Lives Forever 2 has preserved                 everything that we loved about No One Lives Forever (which                 we're going to have to abbreviate from now on, partly because                 I keep typing 'Livers'), and not only expands on it, but cuts                 out all the junk that made it annoying! If only more                 developers did this. The only slight irritation is the                 adherence to a two-CD strategy. We have had this lovely DVD                 format for a long time now, folks - can we please use                 it?                    Beyond that though, NOLF2 is a technical poster-child. A quick            reference sheet listing all the controls (amazingly in a default            configuration we didn't even have to alter) fell out of the box            when we opened it, and upon installation we were presented with a            simple wizard-style approach to detail levels, and instructed that            Medium would fit our rig best - it did. Like the label on the tin            said, High detail was a bit beyond us. When exactly did PC            developers learn to be honest? Cripes.                    So, five comfortable minutes of disc-swapping installation and            configuration later, NOLF2 was up and running, and we sank into the            role of Cate Archer, '60s spy extraordinaire, once again. Cate is            still working for UNITY trying to thwart criminal organisation            HARM's dastardly work, which this time could lead the US and USSR            to nuclear war. Project Omega, as it's known, will have to be            undone in a campaign spanning twelve locations (Japan, America,            India, etc) with forty or so levels to overcome.                    Whilst saving the world (again), Cate will run into a number of her            old friends and enemies (everyone from Bruno, Santa and Dr.            Schenker to crazed Scot Magnus Armstrong) and not everyone swings            the same way as last time. Of course there are new and typically            witty additions to the fold, like the teams of mime enemies, led by            a wordless lunatic, and the legions of ninjarettes, who never seem            to give up, even when faced with a tornado in a trailer park...        One of the biggest changes to NOLF2 is the game's newfound            reliance on stealth. An oft-sidelined issue in the first game, Cate            will have to worry a lot more about avoiding detection, and the            game has changed shape considerably to allow for this. Naturally            UNITY has imbued our favourite pink-clothed super spy with all            sorts of new toys and abilities in addition to old faves like the            lipstick stun gun - new toys include a mechanical cat, on-screen            light indicators and an arsenal of new things to distract attentive            HARM employees with. Everything from banana peels and smoke            canisters to a motion-tracking dart gun.                    The light indicator pops up when you slide into one of the game's            ~hiding places~. These aren't marked but they're pretty obvious - a            narrow slit in the wall a few feet away from an enemy position, a            clump of bushes or a dark alleyway, etc - and when you step into            one an eye appears in the middle of the screen and turns from beige            to purple. Once purple, only significant movement, gunfire or            something equally oafish can alert guards to your presence. Other            new abilities allow you to lean round walls using Q and E and haul            enemy bodies off into the gutter and search them for toys - the            primary method for uncovering pick-ups in NOLF2.                    However well the stealth works in some areas though, it's let down            in others by shabby enemy AI and other shortfalls. Despite an            on-screen radar alerting you to mission objectives and so on,            there's no MGS2-style field of view for enemy soldiers, and they            can't always see you moving even if you're only a few metres away            directly in front of them. Your own speed and positioning (and            avoidance of bottles and other loud nuisances) is far more            important. Although you could let it go simply as 'another            approach', we prefer fields of view and more MGS2/Splinter Cell            style stealth mechanics.                    That said, the enemy AI perks up once they've seen you.            Henchmen/women gang up on you, scooting through shortcuts if you            try to run and even ambushing you. Sadly they still do stupid            things, like running up and standing in exactly the same spot as a            downed enemy, so you don't even have to adjust your sniper scope            later on, but on the whole the effect stands up, and this being a            NOLF game, you can always put it all down to their stupidity as            henchpeople. If their spoken dialogue (often alerting you to hidden            intel, mess hall 'issues' and female ninja sleeping habits) is            anything to go by, they're far too pre-occupied to spot Cate            waltzing slowly through their line of sight anyway.        Level design is fairly flexible and non-linear, with                 objectives scripted tightly around finding particular items,                 which are sometimes chained together. Finding a power coupling                 to restore the power to open a door can be boring and we're                 pretty sure this was the mainstay of games that pre-dated                 Half-Life, but if you can overlook the at-times identikit FPS                 level design, then you're in for a treat. Unfortunately it's a                 treat you'll earn at the expense of much backtracking                 (particularly in the larger levels) simply because you missed                 that one shred of paper or critical dropbox. Turning that one                 upside down, another of NOLF2's flaws is the way that                 presently indecipherable but clearly portable items can't                 often be moved - something borne out in the very first level                 in fact. Scooting through a Japanese village, we missed the                 briefcase containing the decoder, and thus the three                 question-marked papers we found dotted around had to be                 revisited once we had. Simply scooping them up and then                 applying the decoder in the menu would have been a bit                 easier...                    Thankfully, Monolith clearly understands that simply dipping NOLF            in an MGS2 acid bath isn't likely to result in a suitable            successor, and from hereon in the list of flaws grows short. And            for every wrong in NOLF2 there seems to be a right anyway - like,            in this case, the presence of a compass to track objectives, and an            excellent inventory system. Right-click is your use button,            context-sensitive, and the inventory, intelligence and weapons            menus are all almost seamlessly integrated - available with            one-button stab at any point.                    Another key improvement is the skill system. You earn skill points            throughout NOLF2 for collecting intelligence, killing enemies,            avoiding detection, finding secrets and lots more, and from these            you can boost your marksmanship, speed, accuracy, gadget skills,            you name it. Skill points also provide a nice incentive to scour            the world for bonus items - and the game is undoubtedly a lot more            engrossing and enjoyable if you do try and find every last scrap of            intel to flesh out the story. More often than not you'll get a            laugh for your efforts too.        And like an invisible car in an ice                 palace to all that has come before, NOLF2 looks stunning.                 We've not always been a bit fan of the Lithtech engine, mostly                 thanks to atrocities committed during its early years, but the                 draw distance, level of architectural detail and smooth                 running of this engine really helped keep NOLF2 in our good                 books. Just through choosing the appropriate settings at the                 beginning (literally four or five button-clicks), We ended up                 with a perfect balance all the way through.                    Even in the medium detail bracket (which we reckon is about where            the average rig will fall), the buildings, swaying grass, explosive            waterfalls, rippling reflections, real-time lighting and shadowing            and emotionally active characters help shape a world of pleasant            cartoon depth. We were particularly taken with the use of eyes,            which move individually and often prompt some amusing ~he's behind            you~ visual cues and eye-rolling at the cringeworthy script!            Character movement in general is also well handled, and weapon            designs and other incidental details are lovingly treated. And the            mechanical cat mews occasionally - bonus.                    In another boon over the original, extensive, pointless cut            sequences have been dropped in favour of curt, relevant ones, and            the rather boring Santa's Workshop escapades have been axed            entirely. Santa's back of course, but now he chats to you via            mechanical birds with glowing green eyes which pop up throughout            the game. Nauseatingly cute and Austin Powers-style funny.                    So, NOLF2 has most things licked - presentation, visuals, stealth,            level design, longevity. Anything else? Oh well yes, there's also a            nice little co-operative campaign mixing various bits of the            single-player game into a short-lived adventure, and the deathmatch            mode is straightforward and entertaining. However we reckon that            given the way the PC FPS genre has behaved lately, NOLF2 will skip            off into multiplayer obscurity pretty quickly.                    All in all, your mission-should-you-choose-to-accept-it is a very            enjoyable one. There are more spy film clich\u00e9s than the 1960s            managed and more dodgy accents than you'll see on the panto stage            this Christmas, but NOLF2 is an excellent game nonetheless. Flawed            in places? Yes, thanks to backtracking, repetition and some curious            design decisions, but fans of the original should be flicking coins            across counters to distract shop assistants immediately, and if you            like first person shooters and have a sense of humour, the only            other thing to stop you playing this game is the central role of a            pink-suited woman.
