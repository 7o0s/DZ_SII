At least, that'sthe conclusion we've drawn from Muppets Dance Party.The frog, previously happy to just be green, is now sportingsomething resembling a baggy T-shirt, droopy jeans and shiny whitetrainers. Can the downfall of Western civilisation be farbehind?We hope not, because we've had a blast playing Muppets Dance Party, a deceptively-named anddeceptively-difficult puzzler, on our mobile phones lately.It's set in The Muppet Theatre, which has been turned into aclub by Statler and Waldorf, the two grumpy, heckling old menusually found hurling abuse from the box seats. Now operating underthe guise of Wally-D and StatCat, they're laying down what theythink are hot beats, when, in fact, they're stinking the jointup.So it's up to the blinged-out Kermit and four of his furryfriends - Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and Animal - to setthings right by dancing their way out of the club and showingStatler and Waldorf what real talent looks like.Now, you might think that this would come down to abeat-matching game that's based on hitting different keys to therhythm of the music, and you'd be mistaken. Instead it's thefoundation for an incredibly challenging puzzle game.You're tasked with building combos from the coloured shapes thatemerge from Statler and Waldorf's DJ booths and directing them tothe three spaces above your dancing platform. You get points formatching colours (for example, three red shapes), shapes (threetriangles) or both, as well as other level-specificcombinations.You can send shapes to any one of the three spaces or blockthem, sending them crashing down onto Statler and Waldorf's heads.But block three in a row and the DJ's will throw in a remix,rearranging the shapes currently above your head like a fruitmachine. End up with a mix of three coloured shapes that isn't acombo and you'll hear it from the crowd, losing points and puttingyourself in danger of being booted off the stage.Get it right, though, and hit the required combos, and you'lltrigger a dance-off at the end of the level. Complete this and thetwo old grouches will get zapped with feedback from the soundsystem, leaving you standing (if not sweating) victorious.It's just as frantic as it sounds, and it'll take an hour or soof play before everything drops into place and you have an idea ofwhat's actually going on. It's worth persevering with thoughbecause the different objectives in each level mean you've got toadopt different tactics. Sometimes you'll need to concentrate onmatching colours, other times matching shapes.Muppets Dance Party is also a glorious feast for the eyesand ears. The game is as bright and brash as the muppets themselvesand the music, for a phone, is phenomenal; each muppet has his orher own particular background and soundtrack, as well as threeunlockable outfits.While it might look childish there's a strong element of humour,with Statler and Waldorf trading veiled barbs between each level(Waldorf: ~That girl's got chops~, Statler: ~Can I get mine withsome apple sauce?~) and, apart from the 'street fashion' thatKermit and co. are dressed up in, it doesn't play down to a kiddyaudience.Indeed, the only criticism to be made of Muppets Dance Party is that it's all over so soon. There areonly 15 levels in total (each muppet has three) and you'll havegained access to all five muppets within a few outings.What makes this briefness worse is that it's such tremendous funto play. We want more!"}
