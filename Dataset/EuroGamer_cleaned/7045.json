The most            famous configuration, mouse for shooting and directional movement            and the keyboard for movement keys, jumping, crouching and cycling            weapons, is also one of the easiest to get used to, and it's a            testament to its popularity that nowadays most shooters are            developed with it in mind.                         The mouse has of course come on leaps and bounds since the days of            Doom, with many gamers now flocking to some brand of optical            device, or Razer's Boomslang, but the humble keyboard was never            created with the gamer in mind, and as such many companies are now            working on alternative devices for the gamer's other hand, with the            intention of doing away with the keyboard completely, except for            in-game chat.                         One of the most recent additions to the gaming            keyboard-replacement market is a device from little-known            Australian outfit Ferraro Design called ~The Claw~. It's a simple            device that you place your hand upon very much like a claw, with a            button for each finger tip (two for the index finger) and four            buttons for the thumb. The idea is to allow movement to be            controlled by the fingers and things like weapons switching, radio            binds and other control keys to be dealt with by the thumb buttons.            The approach is logical, and the design is quite polished.                    It seems that Ferraro's primary incentive with ~The Claw~ has been            to make it ergonomically fit the shape of your hand. Their            curvaceous design is pretty universal, with moulded areas for the            fingers and a raised arch on the right to rest your wrist upon.            Ultimately this proved quite comfortable, despite initial concerns            I had about the possibility of an arch jutting up into your wrist            proving dangerous after prolonged use. Thankfully this isn't the            case, but ~The Claw~ certainly isn't without its problems.                         Firstly, the install procedure. Obviously I was expecting some            sort of USB connection to allow for ease of use, but the Claw uses            a bizarre PS2 configuration. You take out your keyboard's PS2            adapter (or AT, depending on model), and then plug in The Claw's            adapter. The adapter has two ends, one is PS2, one is AT, so you            can use either standard. You then plug the keyboard back, but into            a connected cable rather than your PC, so the keyboard cable            actually hangs loose connected to an adjacent cable. It took me a            few seconds to get my head around this, and of course all of this            has to be done with the PC off because you can't hot-swap PS2.            Wasn't USB invented to negate the need for this sort of thing?                         Regardless, soldiering on, I fixed everything up, and booted my            computer. The Claw beeps to signify that it's operational, and then            I got into Windows .. and nothing else happened. Consulting the            instructions, I discovered that The Claw needs no extra drivers to            work, and so, pleasantly surprised, I set about using it.                    The first thing to do is program The Claw. You can't just jump into            a game and configure it, it has to act as a mirror of keyboard            functions (hence the elaborate passthrough installation). It has            two memory banks, and you can either assign your game's            configuration to the pre-defined keys (a, b, c, d, etc), or program            them to mirror your config. I preferred this latter option, as I            didn't want to mess with my config.                         I thought I'd start by programming it to deal with my            Counter-Strike configuration. To program multiple keystrokes (which            is what I needed to do), you put the left switch to ~Program~, and            The Claw emits a continuous tone. You then press a button on The            Claw and it beeps, then an appropriate key on the keyboard that you            wish to assign, and it goes back to a continuous tone. You keep            doing this until you are happy, then switch it back to Play. My            configuration was a bit messy, because I realised quite soon that            my usual backpedal key, S, lay below the forward key, W, and yet my            middle finger control on The Claw only had one button.            Short-sighted. In the end I used one of my thumb buttons, but this            was uncomfortable.                         Playing CS proved somewhat difficult at first as I wrestled with            the controls, but as I progressed things gradually got back to            normal. The buttons aren't as instantaneously responsive as the            keyboard, which is a real shame, but strafing and moving forward            was easy enough. Nonetheless I couldn't really backpedal and            perform another thumb-controlled function at the same time. The            button for my little finger was used for crouching, and the four            thumb buttons were spread between the ~Enemy Spotted~ radio            command, jumping, backpedalling and using. Weapon-switching was            fine, since I use the mousewheel for that.                    After a while, things became a lot easier than they had been. I            still had to reach for the keyboard for further radio binds, which            rather spoilt the experience, but in games that required less team            communications (and indeed in single player games including Quake            2), I was quite impressed by The Claw.                         After a while the contours on The Claw's design start to dig into            your hand somewhat if you grip it tightly, which isn't terribly            pleasant, but if you angle it correctly it's fine. The coarse            rubber pads on the underside keep it in position, so it's just a            case of occasionally adjusting your position.                         One of the most interesting things The Claw has in its favour is            the way it allows you to sit with your hands closer together as if            you were typing. The effect is actually a more comfortable gaming            posture, and may eventually (when this new idea is developed a bit            more for the first person genre) prove more popular than the            keyboard and mouse option. At the moment though, despite The Claw's            obvious benefits, it just isn't that essential a piece of            equipment.                    Although it does offer a dedicated gaming controller, to be fair            the only thing ~The Claw~ has over a keyboard is that it doesn't            feature a Windows key to accidentally nudge. With the mouse, it is            what it is, an essential piece of equipment and irreplaceable; you            need a good mouse to get the most out of your gaming and            Windows use. With the keyboard however, it's already a perfectly            serviceable tool, and a replacement like this is rather frivolous,            and when it lacks a couple of important features like a decent key            for backpedalling and a scrollwheel of sorts for weapon switching,            the need for it is greatly reduced. A good try, but it needs a            drastic overhaul, USB support and other options before it can            really be taken seriously, especially when Microsoft have a very            similar device that does far more with many of the missing perks            for about the same price. A missed opportunity."}
