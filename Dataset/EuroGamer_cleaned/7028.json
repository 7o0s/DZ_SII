It is a war simulation with a great deal of realism -            soldiers can flee in fear, tanks can bog down in wet sand and            heroism is born of the desperation of knowing that you have the            English Channel at your back.                    The Cotentin Peninsula is an inspired choice of setting. The 44            maps offer a great deal of variety, from the initial invasion            beaches and glider landing fields to the villages and hedgerows of            the hinterland, ending with the attack on Fort Roux and Cherbourg            at the tip of the peninsula. There are churches and orchards,            bunkers and bridges, sea walls and hangars. By far the most            dominant feature though is the dreaded bocage, which consists of            ancient earth banks with hedgerows on top. It offers great            defensive opportunities, hampers the movement of armour, shields            the movement of infantry and offers numerous ambush points. Tanks            crossing the bocage may leave a crush of branches behind, or they            may throw a track. Infantry crossing an open field may find            themselves under withering short-range fire from an enemy            machinegun concealed in a nearby hedge. Above all, the close nature            of the terrain brings good combined arms tactics to the fore; the            days when you could send tanks off on their own across the Russian            plains in Close Combat III are long gone.                    The initial attacks actually preceded the beach landings - the US            82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions landed by glider and parachuted            in the enemy rear the night before D-Day. Here they will have to            hold the areas immediately behind the beaches from German            counter-attacks, but light infantry have their limitations, as you            will realise the moment your troops are faced by a German armoured            vehicle. There is not much rifles can do against a tank and bazooka            teams will be a prime target for enemy machineguns. The rest of the            Americans landed the conventional way, off landing craft, up a            beach strewn with barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles and littered            with mines. While the first troops ashore are of medium to good            quality, some of the following units are pretty green. These will            require all their heavy weapons if they are to make much impact on            the better German troops, though their mortar halftracks and heavy            machineguns should even the odds a bit.                    Invasion Normandy offers battles in three sizes - individual            struggles for beaches or villages, operations involving three or            four linked battles (such as the airborne landings of the 82nd            Airborne Division, or the defence of Cherbourg by Kampfgruppe            Mueller) and four larger campaigns including the initial airborne            strike and the attack on Cherbourg.                    Operations and campaigns add another layer to the traditional Close            Combat gameplay and you can move your regiments around a map of the            Cotentin in a manner similar to that found in the last Close Combat            game, the Battle of the Bulge. The system is clear and simple,            offering one significant improvement over the last installment - a            degree of tailoring of your combat units is now possible; indeed to            cope with the changing offensive and defensive situations it is            absolutely necessary.                    Close Combat III offered a points system that allowed the            successful player to put together a force of his choosing with few            practical restrictions. This led to unrealistic armour-heavy            Kampfgrueppe wiping the steppes of an enemy who had no such            freedom. Its sequel went to an opposite extreme - you took the hand            you were dealt. Invasion Normandy offers a third way - each            regiment has a restricted pool of units available, allowing you to            add a Sherman tank here, an 81mm mortar there. However, these            additions are limited, with only one reinforcement of each regiment            allowed per campaign. If you lose your contingent of flamethrowing            tanks in your first beach assault, you will miss them sorely a few            days later in the hedgerows. The Germans have a similar problem,            although for them it is perhaps wiser to commit resources earlier,            while the opposition consists of lightly-armed paratroopers and            infantry on open beaches. If you can hold or retake one of the two            invasion beach maps, you will put a powerful brake on American            expansion.                    The battles themselves are extraordinarily good, a marked            improvement over the last Close Combat game, and even better than            some of the magical battles on the Russian Front. To an            overwhelming degree this is due to map design, and the sheer            variety and size offer a richness of experience not found in other            games. In one battle your paratroopers will be struggling to            capture the only bridge that will let your armour break out of the            flooded fields behind the beaches, in another you will be capturing            a small town, fighting hand-to-hand in the houses, while in the            third you will be assaulting a major fortification and bunker            system.                    The AI will mount an active, probing defence that keeps you on your            toes, and your BAR team heading down the hedgerow may well be met            by some Grenadiere crawling the other way. Leave one flank            uncovered as you attack and you may find an enemy machinegun set up            in that church steeple before you know it. On attack the enemy will            concentrate his forces, moving from objective to objective until            you can muster a solid defence. The close ground prevents the use            of overlapping fields of fire, so you will need to put machineguns            on the top floor of every tall building you can find if you are to            offer any support to the squad in the next farm.                    There are easy kills to be had at the beginning of the battle as            you spot the enemy running across an open field, but once you have            given away your position by firing the picture changes and your            building will be stormed by determined soldiers supported by heavy            machinegun fire and masked by smoke grenades. All of this            encourages the player to use proper military tactics, with the AI            generally doing a good job here too - tanks are supported by            infantry very well, hampering close assaults and ambushes. In one            battle my Sturmgrenadiere were only able to destroy a Sherman ten            yards from their hedge when its three supporting squads had been            decimated by machinegun fire and suppressed by an intense mortar            bombardment.                    The artwork and sounds for Invasion Normandy are also outstanding,            which is all the more remarkable given the relatively low system            specifications the game will run on. The little troops run, crawl            and reload their rifles, and there is beauty in the puff of orange            smoke calling in an airstrike, or the flashes and clouds from a            naval barrage. Flamethrowers look appropriately devastating, as            demonstrated by the sheet of orange flame and the charred corpses            left behind.                    The game does not have a complex graphics engine; it has changed            little since its third inception, which is why it runs as well as            it does. The downside is seen in the functional dotted lines that            indicate machinegun fire, the static water and other features. This            game lives or dies on its gameplay though, and you don't even            notice the odd indication that this is still a 2D game as the            attention to detail is breathtaking. The little gaps in the            hedgerow you can squeeze a tank through, the sunken ship in            Cherbourg, the crashed gliders leaving furrows in the fields, the            dead cows... Yes, one of the abiding recollections of those who            fought in Normandy is the smell of dead and bloated livestock.            Thankfully that is not an experience which Atomic can accurately            convey.                    The battle effects are persistent and a building destroyed in one            battle will still be destroyed in the next. That burnt-out tank            blocking the road will still be there as well, along with the            shell-holes in the field. For a campaign involving 44 maps that is            nothing short of remarkable. The sound also builds on the excellent            tradition of the Close Combat series. The voice cues are spot on            and the troops sound as though they are in a battle rather than on            the high street. Weapon sounds are equally good, from the roar of            the Sherman's main gun to the weaker pop of the 37mm guns of the            French tanks, and the saw rasp of the MG34 contrasting with the            thump-thump-thump of the Browning .50 cal. Ambient sound is            probably the biggest single improvement over other titles in the            series though, with birdsong replaced by distant machinegun fire            and sounds of battle.                    Sadly, in a move of suicidal incompetence, the European            distributors of the game added a copy protection system which left            the first batch of CDs inoperable, disappointing many fans who had            been eagerly awaiting its release.                    But now that this problem has been remedied Close Combat : Invasion            Normandy is unquestionably a triumph, marking a great improvement            over the last game, which met with a rather mixed response. It            relies on gameplay rather than on cutscenes and ephemera, and the            variety and suspense of individual battles combined with the simple            but effective campaign system mean that it will stay on a good many            hard disks for a long time to come.                    It's not without its flaws. The lack of the old Battlemaker mission            editor is disappointing, the top-down viewpoint makes judging the            terrain's elevation by sight difficult at best and the removal of            most of the concealment attributes of anti-tank and infantry guns            makes them far less effective than in Close Combat III. But overall            this is an excellent return to form for the long-running series."}
