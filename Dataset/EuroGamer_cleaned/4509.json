Super Mario Advance,            for example, is simply not worth \u00a330 to most people, whereas            Yoshi's Island is a joy to play for gamers both old and new, and            having it on a portable is fantastic. What we'd really like to see            is more ports like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past - games            which make no pretence about having enhanced or expanded themselves            directly, whilst introducing a handsome helping of new content in a            totally new guise.                    But before we get too excited about that, let's tend to the past.        The Legend of Zelda            took a truly pivotal step on the Super Nintendo with the game            commonly known as Zelda III. There are a million and one different            things to praise about the game - the sheer size of the quest; the            diversity of inventory items and their applications in the game            world; the dungeon design and the subtle difficulty curve; the way            the game reinvents itself halfway through by throwing in a ~dark            side~ world, with all sorts of intricate past/present puzzles to            negotiate; the dow-eyed hero and the childish quest which invented            a lot of RPG clich\u00e9s; and the way that Shigeru Miyamoto's team            were always willing to go the silly route if it was more fun. One            of the first significant boss battles at the end of the East Palace            dungeon, for example, is a group of six bouncing knights who turn            the room into an energizer bunny convention, and the most annoying            obstacles in dungeons are cannon balls and electric blobs which            bounce around like Windows screensavers.                    And then there's the tech. Graphically the game can hardly stand up            to the likes of Golden Sun, but the cartoon-quality line work is a            much worthier precursor to the Cube Zelda than the grown-up-looking            N64 outings, and although the environments aren't hugely detailed,            there's never any question of what's foreground and background,            never any collision detection issues, never any dodgy clipping, and            even the changes made in order to scale the game to GBA are largely            unnoticeable. For example, there's a lot more scrolling now to make            up for the lack of screen space, but as the game was never much            about ranged attacks (the boomerang and bow work fine in closer            quarters), and the scrolling is handled so smoothly, you barely            notice it.                    However despite keeping 99.9 per cent of the code as it was,            Nintendo and Capcom couldn't resist gratuitously toying with the            odd bit here and there, and like their SNES ports in general, there            are good bits and bad. The worst is probably the audio update -            faced with a slightly tinnier output, the developer has            inexplicably made Link yelp every time he does something\ufffd            like swing his sword. Given how many times Link swings his sword            during the course of this 20-hour-plus adventure, and the ~Ya!~            sound he makes, it's no surprise that this rapidly becomes utterly            contemptible. But on the other hand, they've thrown in one of those            all-important Sleep mode functions for freezing the game state and            conserving power when it's inconvenient to save or switch off.                    And short of changing it to a licensed Jolly Green Giant game and            changing all the swords to walkie-talkies, Ninty would need to work            really hard to mess this game up. It's still stunning. You might            wonder what's so special these days about a map with a dozen or so            big dungeons to explore and lots of villagers to talk to in the            overworld, but then again Metroid's just a shoot 'em up to those            who can't be arsed to play it. Link To The Past balances plot            elements, dungeon trawling, puzzle solving, boss fighting, item            collection and sub-quests masterfully.                    It's like a gateway drug for the genre - largely thanks to a simple            control scheme (which maps perfectly to the GBA - shifting map            functions and item-tossing from the absent diamond buttons to the            shoulders), and thanks also to a gentle learning curve, and an            engrossing quest to avenge Link's father and rescue a beautiful            maiden from the depths of Agahnim's castle. Even a decade on, it's            still amazingly deep, with all sorts of sub-quests to complete -            it's one of those games which manages to be hugely accessible            without sacrificing depth, and let's you play it as thoroughly as            you want.                    On its own, A Link to the Past is worth owning. Unless you plan to            go back and play the SNES version instead (which will always be            fundamentally superior), it's probably worth owning whether or not            you've played it, rendering the ~new~ element from Capcom somewhat            moot. However, if you plan to ignore it once the single player            adventure is over, then allow us to humbly suggest you don't!                    Although it was never going to be as enthralling as a single player            Link outing, Four Swords is a remarkably enjoyable piece of work.            The premise is dutifully idiotic, with the fairies replicating            young Link four times over (one different-coloured hero for each            player) in order to rescue the princess in a quest that runs            parallel to the upcoming Wind Waker adventure on GameCube. The game            is split up into the usual slew of dungeons in four main stages,            and the design varies from obvious, one-man traditional Zelda            problems to the quandaries that really do require two-to-four            players to solve. All the while you're competing for the most            rupees and Medals of Courage with your fellow adventurers. There            are also new objects to get the hang of, like the Magnet Glove,            useful for grabbing shield-toting Links and yanking them across            chasms, and the design happily mixes elements of old Zeldas with            more up-to-date ideas. It isn't as grid-based as A Link to the            Past, either, allowing you to shrink down to a couple of pixels on            occasion to get through mouse holes and other openings.                    But surely if much of the game is built for four players, you can't            play it properly with less than four? Not so. The game actually            scales itself up or down depending on the number, and only gives            you appropriate dungeons, puzzles and items. And not content with            that, your efforts in A Link to the Past and Four Swords complement            one another - unlocking the Beam Sword attack in the former grants            you access to it in the latter, and finishing the latter unlocks            even more, GBA-exclusive sub-quests in the former.                    Admittedly it feels a little odd playing the finely detailed,            brightly coloured Four Swords after playing such a chunky,            thick-edged game as Zelda III (we mean it in a nice way), but            having them both on one cart is a stroke of genius. They're both            the perfect carrot for one another; depending on the gamer, one or            other is likely to lure you in and introduce you to the other. The            only problem is finding people to share the experience with - but            if you live with a like-minded gamer then we'd strongly recommend            you both buy it.                    The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past really is a contender for            the best GBA cart to date. If only it wasn't 90 per cent rehashed            then we would probably go that far. As it is, it's an indispensable            game, combining arguably the finest RPG/adventure the 16-bit era            ever produced (even compared to the likes of Secret of Mana and            Final Fantasy VI) with an expertly realised multiplayer rendition            of Zelda. Capcom really is getting a grip on these handheld Zeldas            now, and surely with Oracle of Ages/Seasons and Four Swords under            its belt, it is finally ready to produce the first, full-scale            original GBA outing for our green-clothed hero. Come on Nintendo;            sign the cheque."}
