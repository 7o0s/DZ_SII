{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/ho-thething", "date": "1 Aug 2002", "game_name": "Reviews", "text": "When we left them way back in 1982, Kurt Russell (MacReady) and            Keith David (Childs) had just stumbled out of the flaming wreckage            of their Antarctic base after an encounter with The Thing, a            terrifying alien lifeform able to imitate any living creature it            touched. ~Why don't we just wait here for a while, see what            happens~, MacReady suggests in the closing shot.                        Well, twenty years later we're about to find out whether this was            really a good plan...                    Computer Artworks' new videogame adaptation acts as a sequel to The            Thing, picking up the story from where the movie left off. A squad            of marines have been flown into the North 31 station to explore the            ruins of the base and, in true horror fashion, at first everything            is eerily quiet, giving you only glimpses of the terror to come. A            frozen corpse is still sitting in the burnt out hut from that            famous final scene (we won't spoil it for you by telling which of            the two survivors it is) and a mangled body lies in the remains of            the infirmary.                        Initially the game takes you into familiar territory, exploring            first the American base and then the Norwegian camp. MacReady's            final tape recording is still lying in the ruins of his shack, and            bits of Blair's notes on the Thing's biology can be found scattered            around the base as well, giving those not familiar with the film a            bit of background on what they are facing. Parts of the movie sets            have been recreated faithfully, and you'll be able to examine            Blair's underground science project and break into the room where            the Thing was first defrosted by the Norwegians.                        It's at about this point that all hell breaks loose and the game            takes off in a completely different direction, carrying you out            across the Antarctic to new settings such as secret laboratories            and scientific outposts. It's not just the settings which change            either - the gameplay varies from level to level, with some            missions being straight run and gun affairs as you take on hordes            of Thing beasts while others are more puzzle-oriented.                    These puzzles aren't particularly taxing, but they are ingenious in            places. As well as the usual collecting of key cards and passwords,            you'll also have to repair junction boxes to restore electricity to            portions of a base, use sprinkler systems or fire extinguishers to            get past walls of flame, and take control of CCTV cameras to read            the code number for a door from the whiteboard on the other side of            it.                        You can't do everything for yourself, either. Up to three            characters accompany you at any one time, and these often include a            medic and an engineer. Using the simple on-screen squad menu, you            can give basic orders to your men such as ~follow me~ and ~stay            here~, tell medics to heal a specific character, order an engineer            to tinker with a piece of equipment that's too complex for you to            fix yourself, and exchange weapons and ammunition amongst your men.                        In all there are about thirty human characters scattered throughout            the game, some of which must be kept alive if you are to complete a            level, while others are expendable. And, unusually for an action            game, all of them have their own unique voices and faces. These            aren't just generic Barneys, they're important to the success of            your mission and react to the shocking events around them in a            shockingly life-like manner.                    The game's NPCs are governed by two primary motives - fear and            trust. If somebody sees too many Thing beasts, mangled corpses and            blood-soaked rooms they'll start to freak out. Scared men will            cower in the corner, throw up, piss themselves, run away or (in            extreme cases) even commit suicide to avoid being taken over by the            Thing parasite.                        Trust is equally important, as men who no longer trust you will            question your orders. Again, this is something that players aren't            used to seeing in an action game. If you avoid fighting, take your            men's weapons away from them, leave them and wander off alone for a            long time, or walk around aiming your gun at them, they'll start to            trust you less. You also have to worry about whether or not you            should trust them, as your men can become infected in combat            without showing it. Only when they have you alone or outnumbered            will they emerge from hiding, and it can be a terrifying experience            to find some of your squadmates suddenly bursting out as tentacled            Thing creatures in the middle of a battle. Occasionally you can run            blood tests on other characters to check whether they're still            human, but otherwise it's up to you to decide if they're infected.                        Although the mechanics behind the trust and fear systems are            relatively simplistic, the behaviour that results from them can be            almost human at times. In one case, I saw a player lob a grenade to            clear a pile of crates, but the blast from the explosion            accidentally caught one of his men and knocked him over. The            wounded soldier walked up to his leader and politely asked him for            a gun, and when the player rather stupidly gave him one, the marine            promptly turned round and shot him in the face with it.                    It's not just your own men that you have to worry about - most            levels are crawling with Thing beasts, which come in a range of            gruesome shapes and sizes. There are tiny headcrab-style scuttlers,            inspired by the scene in the movie where a character's head            detaches itself and runs off on spider-like legs. Moving up the            scale, full size Thing beasts spawned out of infected humans may            have extra heads, holes in their body, acid spittle, giant claws,            tentacles or birth sacs which produce scuttlers. Finally there are            huge multi-stage ~eruptions~, like the one seen in the dog pen in            the movie, which act as bosses.                        By way of defence you have access to a range of weapons, from            pistols and shotguns up to machineguns and, of course,            flamethrowers. The sight of the flamethrower in action is            guaranteed to bring a smile to your face, and the real-time            lighting effects used by the crimson flares (again lifted from the            movie) are also beautiful to behold. As well as lighting your way,            flares can be thrown to ignite flammable liquids, either in barrels            or as slicks leaking across the floor.                        Although the creaky old E3 preview code for the PC was virtually            unplayable, we're happy to report that things have come a long way            since then. The controls in the more recent console builds which            were on display at a press event in London that we attended last            month are easy to get to grips with on PS2 and Xbox alike. The left            analogue stick moves and turns your character while the right one            strafes left and right. Other buttons within easy reach are used            for firing your gun, using equipment such as flares in your other            hand, and accessing the inventory and squad menus. There's a bit of            auto-aiming to help you target your guns with the gamepad, and the            whole thing is a joy to use.                    The Thing is rapidly becoming one of our most anticipated games of            the year. The graphics are beautiful on all three platforms, the            gameplay innovative and the John Carpenter pedigree unimpeachable.            If the rest of the game can live up to the high standards of the            levels that we've played our way through so far, we should be in            for a treat come September 20th."}
