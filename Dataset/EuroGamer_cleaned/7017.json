The            whole game has a polished and professional feel, and almost            everything - bar the game physics - are true-to-life. A huge array            of skaters from the pro circuit such as Bob Burnquist, Rodney            Mullen and Elyssa Steamer make appearances, as well as hidden            characters such as Officer Dick from the first game, and even            SpiderMan, who is of course the subject of Neversoft's other THPS            engine title. Even more impressive is the option to create your own            skater: choose the body (male only, unfortunatley), face, hair,            clothing, weight, skate style and array of tricks, grabs, jumps and            grinds, and you can have yourself on screen pulling off all those            moves you were too scared to do back in high school.                         And pulling those gnarly tricks off is no problem. The control            system is nice and easy to pick up, with a control system that's            both easy to learn and highly customisable. The main buttons are            simply jump, grab, grind and fliptrick. Simply get some air, then            press one of the buttons and a combination of directions on the            D-pad, and you'll be pulling off Japan Airs, Tailgrabs and 50-50            grinds in a matter of minutes. Sadly, the analogue stick doesn't            seem to make much of a difference to affairs, so I just stuck with            the d-pad. However, this is more than adequate, and pulling off            huge combos is a breeze. By doing a manual when you land out of a            trick, you can keep the trick multiplier going and get crazy scores            well into the millions.                         Although all the tricks and skaters are true-to-life, the physics            allow for improved balance and air time, so as well as being            realistic, the game retains a fun, arcade-esque feel, and it pulls            the balance off really well.                    As well as the obligatory option just to hit one of the many parks            and strut your funky stuff, the Career mode from the first game            makes a welcome comeback. In this outing, instead of five            objectives to complete per level, there are 10. There's still point            goals, collecting the five letters of ~SKATE~, and the Hidden Tape            to find, but there's also localised goals for each city. In the            aircraft hangar, you have to knock over 5 oil drums. In New York,            you have to grind your way down some rail tracks. Also making a            return are the various competition stages, where you're given 1            minute to accumulate as many points as possible, being penalised            for falls and repetition. The career mode is the most fun way to            play: by building up money you can buy new decks and tricks, and            customise your skater even more, even raise his or her skills.            Plus, by completing these objectives you open up more and more            levels, and by completing them all with a character you get one of            the many hidden cheat modes, such as Disco Mode, Perfect Balance            and Wireframe Mode.                         Numerous other modes are included too, particularly in the            excellent 2 player feature. In 2-player Horse, you and a friend            must out-trick each other in various parts of levels, the person            who falls or does an inferior trick earning a letter. The first one            to spell out HORSE (or any other word, me and my friends like to            use ~MOFO~ or ~JACKASS~) is crowned the loser. In Grafitti, every            time you pull off a trick on a ramp or rail, it will be ~tagged~            with your colour, until your opponent does a more impressive trick,            and whoever has the most tags at the end of two minutes wins. Of            course there is the basic Trick Attack, and a 2 player free skate            mode, for boring traditionalists.                    More levels are available this time around, with a whole new set of            worldwide skate parks to hit. From Marseille to LA, and from            Montana to Mexico, each park is full of detail and absolutley huge,            compared to the prequel. There was a whole hidden section in Philly            that took me a long time to find, and it was worth it. The same can            be said for nearly all the settings. You can grind down handrails,            jump buses, hit the world's biggest half pipe in Mexico, and score            some big air in a schoolyard. It will take you a long time to            uncover all the secrets and stunts in each level, but there's an            incentive to do so. Each track has a huge list of designated            Transfers and Tricks that you have to hit in order to totally            complete the game. The cryptic names of each can be viewed from the            Option screen, so you can hit the park and score them all. This            gives a huge amount of replay value, and is a hell of a lot of fun.                         Even more of a come-back factor is the groundbreaking Park Editor.            Using 4 predefined themes, you can add ramps, bowls, ledges, rails,            hills, walls, basically anything within the capabilities of the            surprisingly impressive editor. Sadly, these can't be as big as the            in-game parks, due to the memory situation, but it's a fabulous            feature nonetheless, and you can make some devilish 2 player            levels.                    The game looks wonderful, as well. Far more detailedand polished            than its Sony counterpart, the Dreamcast allows the visual aspect            of the game to flourish. The animation is as fluid as a perfect            540, with all the skate tricks being recreated faithfully. The            frame rate is pretty much constant as well, and the smoothness of            the textures is more impressive than the Playstation could manage.            Overall the conversion of amazingly well carried out; the fuzziness            of the menu screens being my only complaint.                         The soundtrack features many punk, pop-punk and hiphop acts            compared to the mostly one-genre offering of the previous game. Bad            Religion, Rage Against the Machine and Powerman 5000 head the            lineup of acts offering yet more authenticism to the skate            experience. In between this and the ambient sounds of a New York            street or a Marseille skatepark, it's a truly immersive            experience... until your skater lands gonads-first onto a rail            while he's admiring the lighting and detail.                    Neversoft have bettered their best, with even more secrets, tricks,            courses, options and skaters than before. While some simulations            lose sight of fun in their quest to provide yet more realism and            features, this cannot be said of THPS2. With a veritable plethora            of secrets and hidden areas, and an easy-to-pick-up control system,            it's hard to have anything but fun while playing this. The best            skate sim ever, and one of the best sports or arcade titles ever on            the Dreamcast. Essential, even for owners of the first game."}
