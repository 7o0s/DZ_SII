Like some kind of mutant bible-bashing double-glazing            salesmen, they hammer on the front door, demanding that we learn            the ways of the next generation gaming experience. Mr Pac-Man            appeared the other day, babbling phrases like ~retro futurism~,            ~adrenaline fuelled~ and ~insanely addictive~ at us. The next day            it was General Contra, brandishing a weapon in the vain hope of a            respectable review score. But after the Defender incident with the            bodysnatchers, we'd had enough and installed an intercom.                    So when Bub and Bob knocked on the door we had great pleasure in            laughing maniacally at their weak talk of spiny backed reinvention.            Really? Are all the original ideas so bad, and so commercially            unviable that rehashing an old hit is the only way to get gamers            excited? Whatever the commercial reasoning, the fact is that most            of the results of this passionless grave robbing are poor to say            the least. On this basis, the 'revived' game is, for the most part,            on to a loser before we've even got it out of the shrink wrap.        But nagging at the back of our minds was the slim chance that            the publisher and developer responsible actually have the resources            and the talent to make its cash cow franchise even better in            some significant fashion. At least in Mortal Kombat's favour, the            3D beat 'em up is a proven genre, thanks to Namco, Sega and Tecmo's            sterling efforts over the years. With the obligatory next gen            makeover, unlockable content and multiple game modes, how could it            fail? Hmm, probably best we don't ask questions like that out loud,            and instead tell you a bit about why grown men and women are acting            so violently again.                    Two evil ~powerful sorcerers~ Quan Chi and Shang Tsung have joined            forces in a mwahahahaha-style quest for ~supreme immortality~,            meaning it's your job via a character of your choice to show them            who is, indeed, boss and kick their collective arses, thus            restoring peace and harmony to the world - presumably until Midway            decides its time to cash in on the franchise once again.                    The game features the usual selection of game modes; Arcade,            Versus, Practice and Konquest. The first three are self            explanatory, while the latter gives players the opportunity to            really get to grips with the intricacies of each of the game's            characters, while earning plenty of 'Kurrency' in the process. It's            well worth ignoring the Arcade mode for the first few hours of            Deadly Alliance and just dive headlong into the Konquest levels, as            not only does it strip away the initial mysteries of the control            system, you'll come out of it a much better player as a result.            Each character has ten challenges to perform, mainly consisting of            simple 'press these three buttons' type tutorials, but gradually            building up to complex combos which require extreme patience and            repetition to crack.        To its credit, MKDA attempts to            introduce a more comprehensive and strategic combat system than its            many rivals. Each fighter has three distinct fighting styles to            choose from at any time during bouts, selectable via the L1 button            - one armed, and two unarmed fighting styles. Symbol buttons deal            with the usual low/high kicks/punches, R2 blocks, while R1 delivers            the very satisfying special moves. Meanwhile, an element of            strategy comes into play in MKDA when fighters choose their armed            fighting style; while they inflict more damage when armed, they            also take more damage. It's often a fine balance to determine which            one is more effective, and as such adds an enjoyable layer to the            gameplay.                    The combo system also feels somewhat different from the            competition, thanks to its general tendency to rely more on quick            presses of the buttons (for example, square, circle, triangle, L1,            triangle and up) rather than the usual D-pad quarter turn/button            mash mechanic of every bash 'em up since SFII. It's a tricky            transition at first, and we're not convinced it feels as natural,            but at least it feels like Midway is attempting something slightly            different.                    As you'd expect from this goriest of beat 'em up franchises, each            character has its own unique Fatality move, giving you the ultimate            finishing move - if you can work out how to pull it off, that is.            Needless to say, these are as gruesome as you'd expect, with the            highlight we've witnessed undoubtedly being the ability to rip the            entire skeleton from your defeated opponent.                    However, while the Fatalities are nicely implemented, the general            level of gore present within the game is completely ham fisted by            comparison. Each hit, however tame, nearly always results in a            ridiculous splurge of ketchup that borders on farcical, and the            lack of progressive damage to your opponent's torso is            disappointing. We're sure Midway could have done better in this            department, although maybe it steered away from realism in the            belief that the censors would've had a hissy fit. Worse still comes            when you floor an opponent in the traditional fashion (i.e. not a            Fatality) - every single time they slump to the floor in the manner            of a felled tree, no matter how impressive your death blow was, and            if this happens near the predetermined edge of the arena, they            mysterious judder forwards as if being pushed by an unseen force.            While this is in keeping with how opponents collapse in every            Mortal Kombat game ever, it just looks plain crap in a modern beat            'em up.        The general visual quality also suffers in comparison to the            majority of next gen beat 'em ups, being merely competent in            virtually every single area, rather than pushing any boundary. Also            the restrictive 'invisible wall syndrome' means characters are            regularly colliding with artificial barriers at the edge of arenas,            rather than spectacularly crashing through scenery and plummeting            through multiple levels in the style of Dead Or Alive. The            characters are, in the main, detailed and well animated, although            what the hell is going on with the wobbly jelly animated breasts?            Ew ew ew. While you may come away from MKDA reasonably satisfied            about the way it looks, you'll hardly be ringing your mates up            evangelising. Instead, you'll more likely be defending the game's            lack of visual prowess, pointing out that it does have face saving            innovation in the combat area.                    But while the combat system does strike us as reasonably innovative            - and quite interesting at first - the chances are you'll have to            practise for a very long time for the combos to really become            second nature. Even when you know what you're doing, the game            demands such exact timing in terms of the intervals you're expected            to press each button that it's often beyond frustrating. There's a            very specific mid point between pressing the next button in the            combo, and it's fair to say that it's exacting; press too soon, and            the game just fails to register you've pressed it at all. Wait too            long, and the wrong move will result, and you have to start the            sequence of buttons over again. And when we say ~wait too long~            we're talking milliseconds, and frankly that kind of precision            demands too much from all but the most committed beat 'em up fan.            If that's you, then MKDA will no doubt present a great deal of            enjoyment.                    Supposing you do have the stomach for the battle, then there's            plenty to keep you going while we wait for the cold winter nights            to politely go away. For a start, the Konquest mode features an            epic 218 levels to fight through - although to be fair you'll blitz            through most of them in a matter of seconds, so basic are the early            challenges. For your pains, fortunately, the game rewards each            successful bout in both Konquest and Arcade mode with Kurrency            which you can spend in the Krypt opening up one of the 600 Koffins            - each of which hold a mystery item, from the tedious 'Koncept'            sketches, to more interesting extras such as extra characters and            costumes (or Kostumes, presumably).                    The game has already leaped into the nation's charts at No.3, and            enjoyed a decent spell near the top of the US charts over            Christmas. That tells us that the audience for the Mortal Kombat            franchise is very much alive and well, but does that make it a good            game? It's certainly not a bad game, by any means - it just never            excels at anything it does to warrant its placing above any of the            other contenders out there. It mixes it with the big boys in the            early bouts, but it's never going to go the distance.
