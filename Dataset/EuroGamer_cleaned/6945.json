So it came as no            great surprise to discover that one of the GameBoy Advance's launch            titles featured the little green plastic soldiers. What did            surprise us though was that Army Men Advance is actually rather            good...                    Once again it is up to you to foil the evil Plastro and his            amusingly named Tan Army, this time taking control of Vikki or the            Sarge and guiding them through twelve levels of top-down            plastic-melting mayhem. Plastro's latest scheme for global            domination involves using alien technology, but apart from a couple            of trips to Area 41 (presumably just down the road from the            well-known Nevada test site) there is little evidence of this            outside of the briefing screens.                    Instead you are faced with settings varying from toy-sized            buildings and military camps to a giant bathroom. There are a few            simple puzzles to solve, but mostly it's a case of shooting            anything that moves and pressing every button you can find. Luckily            the level design is inventive enough to keep your interest. In the            bathroom, for example, the little pools of water on the floor have            been electrified by the Tan Army, leaving you tip-toeing around a            maze of lethal puddles until you can get close enough to the power            source to blow it up.                    The same ingenuity hasn't been applied to the enemies though, and            machinegun grunts make up the majority of the Tan Army, with a few            bazooka and grenade soldiers thrown in for good measure, along with            occasional appearances from giant insects and beetles. Luckily the            button-pounding action is fast and furious enough to overcome the            lack of variety in the cannon fodder.                    A few boss encounters and amusing little sub-games have been            included to break the run and gun monotony as well, including a            tricky Frogger tribute in the garden which involves hopping between            logs to cross a series of streams. You will also get to drive a            tank down the hallway and pilot a boat in the bath in arcade-style            shooter sequences, with the shoulder buttons of the GameBoy Advance            rotating the turret independently of the direction which you are            steering the vehicle in. Both levels are very short, but they're            fun while they last.                    Sadly the same could be said for the rest of the game. I completed            the entire campaign on the medium difficulty setting in under three            hours, and the total lack of multiplayer support means that the            game will now be gathering dust on my shelf until I feel like            giving it another shot. Which is a pity, because some form of two            player co-op mode with one player as Vikki and the other as Sarge            could have been quite entertaining.                    Army Men Advance is probably the most entertaining game in the            series to date, with the bright cartoonish graphics and            larger-than-life settings proving a perfect match for the GameBoy            Advance. Unfortunately it lacks longevity, and given that GBA games            are rather pricey at the moment, \u00a335 for three hours of            entertainment is perhaps a little steep.                        -        Army                    Men Advance screenshotsArmy                    Men Advance screenshots"}
