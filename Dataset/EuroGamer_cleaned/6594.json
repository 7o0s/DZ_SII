However Red Storm seemed disappointingly keen to continue milking            the first two titles in the series with absolutely no shame, with            mission pack after mission pack slowly diluting our enthusiasm for            the fine originals. Now, at last, Raven Shield - the sequel to            Rogue Spear - sets out to offer fans of the genre what they've been            gagging for all these years.        Rainbow Six            games have never been great at storytelling, and Raven Shield is no            exception. It attempts to set up the tale of a neo-fascist plot to            take over the world or something like that, but it's just a weak            frame on which to build a string of missions that have little or no            significance to the story. This we aren't too concerned about; we            don't play Rainbow Six for the complex, emotional plot or exquisite            character development and wouldn't have expected it now. Where the            games did need work, though, was in the visuals department, as Red            Storm's proprietary engine simply wasn't cutting it against the            competition any more.                    Thankfully, the employment of next-generation Unreal technology has            lent the series a much-needed facelift; the whole game from the            environments to the weapon and character models feels a lot more            solid than before. The use of rag doll animation on the characters            means that downed tangos and soldiers alike crumple to the floor            and roll down stairs with convincing aplomb, and when at rest limbs            will dangle lifelessly over ledges, all of which enforces a deeper            realism that hasn't been present in Rainbow Six titles gone by.                    In fact, atmospherically the game has come along leaps and bounds.            The lavish textural and structural detail that has been expended on            each of the game's maps is impressive, and coupled with the            brooding incidental score and ambient sound effects, the game            rarely fails to grip.                    An assault on a cartel mansion, for example, became wonderfully            theatrical as we wormed our way down to a huge, plush lounge area.            Muffled opera could be made out ahead, and as we got close and            swung the door open we were greeted by a grand piano behind which a            terrorist was taking cover, along with a couple of friends on the            other side of the room. The radio warnings started up at the same            time as the terrorists shouting for backup, and as the firearms            began to ring out the piano sang random notes with bullet strikes            all to the operatic strains, amounting to an inspiring moment of            gameplay. There are little moments like this scattered throughout            the game, and it's worth playing through all the missions just to            savour them alone.        Oddly though there isn't a learning curve as such. You're            pretty much thrown in at the deep end, and newcomers to the series            are going to be surprised at just how challenging the game can be,            particularly with the lack of a mid-mission save feature.            Personally, we can do without one, but some are going to see this            as a major flaw when they have to restart some of the trickier,            more daunting missions over and over.                    There is also a startling lack of variety in the scenarios; you'll            usually find yourself rescuing hostages, neutralising all the            terrorists, rescuing hostages and neutralising all the            terrorists, or in one infuriatingly hard mission that            recalls the villa mission from Rogue Spear, entering a house and            planting bugs on a phone and laptop and exiting again without being            discovered. Granted, this is what counter-terrorism teams usually            do, but more variety from the ~enter building, shoot people, exit            building~ dynamic would have been welcome.                    The implementation of the AI in both your teammates and enemies is            again hit or miss, as seems to be the standard for Rainbow Six            games. Soldiers still have door navigation issues when a large            group of them are trying to fit through, but seem to find their way            around each map fairly well when there isn't anything lying around            to obstruct them. They are generally adept at covering your back            though, and only very rarely lapse into insisting that they all            pile through a door and get shot one after another. Enemies seem to            exhibit a curious mix of deviousness and cunning; defending            themselves effectively before becoming completely oblivious to your            presence again - despite the stream of unsilenced assault rifle            bullets streaking into the wall mere inches from their faces.        Multiplayer is easily as absorbing as the            single player campaign, probably more so, and just about manages to            urinate on all contenders from a great height because it's just so            damn compulsive. This is what Raven Shield is going to live on for            the next couple of years we should imagine, and that's no bad            thing.                    Nothing can really beat the thrill of the team-based survival            matches, but there is also all-against-all survival, a            Counter-Strike-style escort-the-VIP (or in this case, pilot) game            type, bomb activation/defusing, and hostage-rescue modes to play            with, alongside co-operative versions of the single player            missions.                    The network code is pretty solid when it's not telling you that you            have an invalid CD key (Red Storm, sort this out now), and            the community has thus far proved to be a polite, co-operative            bunch, actually interested in playing the game properly, instead of            getting some kind of perverse thrill from filling their buddies            with lead [unlike Ghost Recon on Xbox Live, then -grumpy Ed].        What is really surprising about Raven Shield though is how            little the game has changed in the last five years. Here we have a            game that manages to achieve some truly inspirational moments, yet            singularly fails to build upon the standard it established. Even            the planning stages before each mission remain just as impenetrable            as ever and barely changed; you're probably better off just loading            the pre-packaged plans as they tend to work well enough. If you're            really unhappy with the way a mission pans out, you can always take            the time to tweak the tangled mess of waypoints and go-codes, but            starting from scratch seems... well, masochistic.                    There are some functional improvements, certainly; namely the            contextual menu with which to communicate rudimentary orders to            your team - to open doors, flashbang suspicious rooms or clear them            out, etc - and the replacement of the HUD-based planning map with            visual, first-person waypoint indicators was a good move. Also of            note is the inclusion of ~fluid movement~; toggling this and moving            the mouse up, down, left or right allows you to precisely raise or            lower your body position, ideal for popping up Time Crisis-style            and slaughtering firmly entrenched opposition without getting            'headshotted'. Sadly, though, there's rarely ever a convenient            moment to actually use this feature properly, apart from the            tutorial.                    Overall, there just isn't much evidence to suggest Raven Shield is            pushing the tactical action genre forward. We suppose the question            is 'should we care?' Probably not. Frankly, Raven Shield is an            absolutely tremendous game, and there is no denying it that. We            haven't played a more atmospheric single or multiplayer tactical            action game since SWAT3, and despite its shortcomings there is            still nothing that comes close to rivalling it for sheer            breathe-down-your neck tension. It may not drive the genre in a new            direction, but it has almost everything you could expect from it,            whether you're an anal-retentive gun nut or just an FPS fan up for            a weighty challenge. See you in a few months for the first mission            pack."}
