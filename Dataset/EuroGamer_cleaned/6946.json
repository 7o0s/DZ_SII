That's not me trying to            take something away from Krazy Racers, it's an opinion, and I also            believe that I would be giving Krazy Racers a lower score if            Nintendo hadn't delayed their showpiece racing extravaganza until            Christmas.                         Still, in its own right Krazy Racers is a very good game. It            pushes all the right buttons and uses a mostly familiar line up of            Konami's stars. Amongst those eight names are Goemon of Mystical            Ninja fame, Moai, the stone head from Gradius, Dracula from            Castlevania and a host of others. The game features 16 tracks, link            cable support for four players and battery backup, unlike GT            Advance from THQ, which we chastised accordingly.                         Konami knows the score on these kart games, even if it's the first            time they've bothered to do one. They've got the physics, the            powerslides, even the tight track design with no room for error,            and in terms of controls they've adopted the Nintendo (de facto)            standard right down to the shoulder button mini-hops.                    Power-ups are available aplenty, and amongst these are speed boosts            (mushrooms), invisibility (ghost), time bombs (new!), missiles (red            and green shell variants), lightning (similar, but not quite) and            the pig power-up, which turns people into, uh, pigs. You collect            these power-ups by hunting for Parodius bells. These set your metre            spinning and they randomly award you items.                         Like Mario Kart, using these power-ups is crucial to your success,            and outdoing your opponents pretty much relies on this. The track            design is pretty fidgety, and avoiding obstacles often throws you            off the pace enough that a little extra is required. Graphically            everything looks nice and cartoony, with a Mario Kart            super-deformed style of character design. It's tremendous fun for a            single player and even more for two to four.                         The issue with multiplayer though is that beyond two players, it's            not officially supported. Weird that may sound, but            nevertheless it's true. With two players, link cable play is            faultless and very enjoyable. Introduce third and fourth players            (which if you read the manual you won't believe possible), and            things are a bit slower and the game has a tendency to lock up or            exhibit bugs. It's peculiar to see this sort of thing in a console            game.                         Still, the multiplayer modes themselves are excellent fun, with            race and battle modes. Race mode is obvious, but battle mode            (despite its name) does not follow the convention of mimicking            Mario Kart. It's more like hot potato. You have to ram into the            other players to pass them a bomb, and the player with the bomb            when it explodes is the loser. There's also a weird one where you            play chicken by trying to get as close as possible to a cliff's            edge. Peculiar, I thought, but still fun. Unlike Mario Kart, you            can play these battle and chicken modes against the computer, but            they aren't half as much fun like that as you might expect.                    Konami Krazy Racers is a tremendous game to sit down with on the            tube, or play while perched on the couch suffering in the gap            between your two favourite TV programs. It's debatable as to            whether or not Mario Kart will do much to usurp it; they are            virtually the same, but at least in the mean time you have no real            excuse for denying yourself this game. If you can afford it, buy            it. Otherwise, make do with what you've got and wait for Mario            Kart.                        -        The Portable Avant-GardeThe Portable Avant-Garde"}
