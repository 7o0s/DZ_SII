Add a cast            of bizarre aliens, from your standard grey Reticulan to giant            four-armed purple hippies and swimsuit-wearing sirens. Throw in a            healthy dose of humour inspired by the late great Douglas Adams,            and garnish with pop culture references to the likes of Star Wars            and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Simmer gently for three years, et            voila - Startopia!                    Hand-crafted by the natives of exotic Guildford, Startopia puts you            in charge of refurbishing a network of donut-shaped space stations            which were abandoned during a recent war. Starting with just a few            maintenance robots, an energy collector and some loose change, you            must take control of your station deck by deck, segment by segment,            constructing industrial facilities, space docks, security stations,            holodromes and luxury hotels to attract visitors.                    In all there are more than forty different types of room to            construct, not to mention a wide selection of furniture ranging            from operating tables and Z-ray scanners for the sick bay, to big            fluffy chairs and lava lamps for your love nests. You will also            need to hire the right staff, as each of the game's nine main races            has its own speciality, and your workers will automatically assign            themselves to the appropriate tasks. For example, the Groulien Salt            Hog is your average working class alien, doing the dirty work in            recycling plants and factories, while the Greys are naturally adept            at medical procedures, having spent most of the last few decades            probing surprised looking humans.                    Each space station is divided into three decks, the outermost of            which is the engineering deck, where passing ships dock to trade            and unload passengers. It houses your industrial, security and            medical facilities, and more importantly your energy collectors.            Energy is the game's main resource, and as well as powering your            rooms it also acts as a currency to buy supplies, construct            facilities and hire new staff.                    This can be something of a problem unfortunately, because a spate            of deaths can leave you with negative energy thanks to            compensation claims from the victims' families. At this point            everything on your space station will shut down, including your            power boosters (which normally increase the amount of energy you            generate), space docks (where trade is carried out) and ports            (where foot passengers disembark). Isolated from the rest of the            universe, you will soon find your aliens suffering from hunger and            disease as your sick bays and food dispensers go offline. And as            more aliens die, you just spiral deeper and deeper into debt.            Luckily this doesn't happen very often, but when it does it can            obviously be a little frustrating, and usually the only way to            recover is to quit the mission and restart from an old auto-save            position.                    Combat is also a little hit and miss, playing a bigger role than in            most sims but lacking the control of a real-time strategy game. Up            to four managers can be fighting over a single station, and sooner            or later you will need to occupy their territory, one segment at a            time, using security droids to breach bulkhead doors and gain            control of computer systems. Some of your aliens will join in the            fight as you invade the enemy segment, but all you can do to direct            them is to set up muster points and frantically click on the aliens            and buildings you want your troops to attack. It's far too easy for            an enemy security droid to sneak past the brawling aliens and shut            the doors again before you can destroy it, and when this happens            any droids caught on the wrong side of the doors will            self-destruct, and any of your employees that get left behind will            abandon your cause and stay there. As a result battles can be            rather chaotic, and if you have the money it generally pays to hire            first and ask questions later - the more aliens you can pour into            the enemy sector when a fight breaks out, the better your chances.                    The rest of the game is played at a slightly more sedate pace            though, and you can often find time to chill out and watch the            flowers grow on the bio deck, or follow your aliens around the            hotels and bars of the entertainment deck.                    Mucky Foot have done a great job of bringing the space station to            life, and it looks even better in motion than it does in the            screenshots. Your aliens are always up to something, moshing in the            disco, chatting with each other, stopping to admire a statue,            enjoying a swift pint at the local bar, or running away screaming            (silently - this is space, after all) as a giant black beetle that            appears to have escaped from Starship Troopers drops in for a            little light refreshment.                    The flexible camera helps to put you right in the middle of all            this action. As in Black & White you can zoom right in to view            your inhabitants up close or pull way back through the windows of            the bio deck to see the entire space station spinning through the            void. Unlike Black & White, the controls for the camera are            incredibly intuitive, especially if you have a three button mouse.            There's even a great shoulder cam option which tracks an alien as            it wanders around the station, showing you where it goes and what            it sees.                    Introducing you to this toroidal world is a series of short            tutorials which teach you the basic controls and economics of the            game, easing you into the action one step at a time from building            your first rooms to hiring staff, landscaping the bio deck and            fighting off rival space station managers.                    Startopia also includes a series of ten longer missions which see            you working for each of the game's alien races, with tasks            including evicting squatters, setting up a hospital station and            turning your bio deck into a veritable horn of plenty. There's a            nice smooth learning curve throughout, and each mission opens up            new technologies and alien races to you. By the time you've            finished the campaign (and been treated to the amusing Empire            Strikes Back parody in the closing cinematic) you will be ready to            sink your teeth into the piece de resistance - the sandbox mode.                    This allows you to customise the game to suit your own tastes,            setting how much energy you start out with, how many rival managers            (if any) are on the station with you, whether you can engage in            open warfare with them, and how frequently random events like            starquakes and solar flares will occur. You can also adjust            finishing conditions - earn a certain amount of energy, occupy            enough segments of the station, research new technologies etc - or            simply leave the game open-ended. And if pounding the AI gets            boring, up to four players can battle it out online, with the same            wide range of options available.                    Startopia is more of a toy than a game in the traditional sense of            the word, and playing with your aliens and messing around in their            world can be a lot of fun, even without the pressure of rival            managers to defeat. It's not a game that takes itself too seriously            either, from the parody of 2001 in the opening cinematic to the            alien visitors who list their hobbies as mutilating cattle and            hovering over Mexico City. And although every station is exactly            the same size and shape, the variety of missions included and the            endless permutations available in the sandbox and multiplayer modes            mean that you aren't likely to get bored in a hurry. One of the            best strategy games we've seen so far this year, and also one of            the funniest."}
