And how. There have been three multiplayer map packs, and three title updates that rebalanced the game, not to mention a few weekend events that introduced custom playlists, like ticker-packed Horde sessions to celebrate Independence Day. Although we tend to forget about that one over here.Tomorrow though, three map packs doesn't just become four, it becomes four and then some, as Gears of War 2: Dark Corners introduces seven new multiplayer playgrounds (with typically macho names like ~Allfathers Garden~) and, perhaps most excitingly, a new single-player and co-operative chapter called Road to Ruin. Dark Corners is available for 1200 Microsoft Points (\u00a310.20 / \u20ac14.40), or you can gather all of Gears of War 2's existing DLC together in a single bundle called All Fronts Collection, which goes for 1600 MSP (\u00a313.60 / \u20ac19.20).Given that it's not out until tomorrow, however, it's been difficult to find opponents for the new multiplayer maps, and it seems unreasonable to try and review them off the strength of a few snatched games. Not wanting to leave you without any guidance though, Eurogamer's own Coaliation of Ordered Governments (that's me and former editor Kristan Reed) took to the internet over the weekend to play through Road to Ruin and bring you impressions.Road to Ruin begins with a short video introduction by Epic design director Cliff Bleszinski, who explains that sometimes sections get cut out of games for various reasons. A cynical individual might point out that this one appears to have been cut for the reason of making 1200 Microsoft Points. Whatever - it's being billed as a ~Deleted Scene~, and can only be played out of sequence. This means that it does checkpoint your progress as you go, but doesn't offer actual save slots, so if you want to stop playing you will need to pick it up from the start next time.From that you might infer that Road to Ruin is insubstantial, and that's true, but it's still an interesting concoction. It's set between Dom's unfortunate reunion with his wife and the assault on Nexus, and offers you the choice between marching along the Locust highway that takes you to the Locust Queen's palace all-guns-blazing, or borrowing some dead Theron Guards' salmon-pink death-armour and adopting a stealthy approach. And it really does offer it: in classic Gears 2 style, left trigger chooses stealth, right trigger chooses ultraviolence.There are no new weapons or enemy types to worry about, but then Gears 2's campaign was celebrated not only for those, but for its impressive level design, which forced you to react to terrain and cover points that sometimes changed over the course of a fight, rather than boxing you into a fairly basic battle over and over again like the first game. Road to Ruin continues in this vein, splitting the action into a series of large-scale encounters bookended by massive Locust checkpoints, which consist of chunky metal blast doors and behave like locks on a canal, only allowing you to progress once you've closed the door behind you.The first battle is a straightforward crate-to-wall-to-crate dodge along a flat and fairly narrow causeway, but things get interesting in the second and third big encounters, which include massive opposing staircases, a torture area that branches off in two different directions to open your flanks, and challenging use of the game's many enemy types: boomers supported by beast riders charging down a hundred-foot staircase towards you are pretty overwhelming, and in a manner the host game didn't attempt."}
