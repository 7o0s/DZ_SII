Heck, most of you probably            have virtually no musical talent whatsoever! I certainly don't. As            much as I like listening to the odd beat while I'm working, give me            an instrument and I'll make some embarrassing twanging noises            before handing it back. My musical education ended with grade two            piano, and yet with Music 3 I could create a unqiue, fairly ornate            sound without breaking a sweat.        Watching Jester's Tim Wright toying with Music 3 at a recent            meeting in London, I was completely in awe. Jester's team has            looked at the musical capabilities of the PS2 and built on them.            Where they wanted more sound channels or a higher sampling rate,            they found a software solution, and because certain aspects of your            average PS2 game are insignificant to Music's makeup, the software            is able to offer 20MB of space for samples and sounds - 3 minutes            38 seconds - by clawing memory away from other vital areas, like            graphics.                    The interface is very simple to use and consists of two main panes.            On the right you can see the song in block form, with each square            corresponding to a particular aspect within that bar. The left pane            is used for browsing sounds, samples and instruments, and a simple            (and tweaked) drag and drop will add them to a particular bar. At            the top you can see the track's progress in seconds, and unlike MTV            Music Generator 2 - Music 3's oddly named predecessor - you can            access virtually every menu at your behest from this one screen.            Creation is a very simple task.                    That's not all you can do, either. The main track pane on the right            can be toggled for something else, like the recording pane. Using a            microphone (plugged in via a USB dongle), Tim whistled a tune and,            much to my delight and his relief, Music 3 tunefully whistled it            back at us, having understood it - not as a bit of data, but as            actual notes - and recorded it. A couple of clicks and it was part            of our song.        Styles and melodies span virtually every genre imaginable.            Hundreds of musical riffs are available in garage, trance, pop,            dance, rap, hip hop, indie, new metal and other categories, and            there are more than 16,000 sampled instruments in electronic,            acoustic, orchestral, rhythm, vocals, sound effects and countless            other categories. It would take months to explore everything, and            with 64 simultaneous song channels to popular (a cut above the            PS2's default capabilities, eagle-eyed readers will note), there's            plenty of reason for that. Other effects at the composer's command            include reverb, chorus, delay, phase and resonant filters, and as            with everything - be it riff, effect, or what-have-you - you can            always record your own. The USB sampler will hook up to CD,            Minidisk, vinyl, guitar, the aforementioned microphone, and            virtually anything else you can imagine. You can even pop your own            CDs into the PS2 and record from them.                    Mixing is another important aspect of the program, and this has            seen a serious change from its predecessor, now including six decks            on one screen. The interface for adding and subtracting various            styles is so simple even I managed it, with options to simply raise            and lower volume, perform fades both in and out and change tempo            amongst others. With all six decks on one screen, scratching away a            tune is easier than writing an Atomic Kitten single.                    There were a few things still hanging in the balance over the code            we saw. For a start, featured artists are promised, but a roster            has yet to be produced, and furthermore ports to other consoles            could be in the offing. As you might expect, it all comes down to            the size of the audience - the Xbox may have a hard disk, which            would be a huge boon for a program like Music 3, but unless you all            go out and buy one in preparation, there isn't much point in a            concerted development effort to support it. Nevertheless, even on            the relatively restrictive PS2, the opportunities are almost            endless, and though we may all be gamers at heart, as far as            alternative uses for our PS2s go, Music 3 looks to rank pretty            highly amongst them."}
