It doesn't take a genius to            work out that licenses like this are hacked together in fifteen            minutes by marketing 'geniuses' just before they all knock off to            some seedy club for the evening. As a fan of the Simpsons for as            long as I can remember, it irritates me that some fabulous            characters have to be put through the mill like this - just            leave it alone.        'First of all, we'll            take Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and ruin it.' And they have; using the            RenderWare engine, the designers have proceeded to suck the basic -            and I mean basic - mechanics of THPS and present them to the            unwitting audience with all the style and grace of Liam Gallagher            taking ballet lessons. On each level there are the usual assortment            of objectives required for unlocking subsequent levels like letter            collecting and object locating, although unlike THPS there is no            clock for the session, only for individual challenges. Accompanying            each level is a trick tutorial and a competition round, although            the latter is unreasonably hard due to the former's complete            inability to be of any use to anybody whatsoever, only teaching you            the simplest of grabs and grinds which are printed in the manual            anyway.                    The stages are huge, but perversely this is another down point as            timed challenges (e.g. find five kids skipping school) become            ridiculous goose chases trying to find objects in the over-large            levels. Despite the enormous working space, the level designers            also seem to harbour a complete inability to create a decent            skating line and so interesting combos are an extreme rareity.            However, even if the developers had been able to design            properly, the controls are so damned unresponsive that you'll be            hard pressed to pull off even the most rudimentary of lines,            particularly with a mysterious manual function that seems to make            its own mind up as to whether or not it's going to work.                    As if the gameplay weren't bad enough, it's coupled with some of            the most truly abysmal graphics we've had the misfortune to see            moving in a long time, and a whimsical non-event of a soundtrack -            why couldn't they have incorporated the proper Danny Elfman theme            and elements of a decent comedy cartoon score instead of shoving in            some dodgy pieces of synthetic Ska crap which sound like they were            hashed together in five minutes with Dance eJay? The voices are the            game's only saving grace for about five minutes, until the spot            comments from your boarder and the constant repetitive quips of            commentator Kent Brockman begin to grate as much as the rest of the            game.                    It's a simple conclusion really: avoid at all costs. Simpsons            Skateboarding is a cash-in in the purest sense of the term. There            are barely any redeeming features, it's practically devoid of any            humour, the graphics, levels and physics are terrible, and it            simply exhausts any entertainment value it does harbour in about            five minutes flat.
