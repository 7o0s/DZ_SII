With the            exception of Wave Race 64, there are but a smattering of titles one            would call good, and very few if any that one could call excellent.                         Surf Rocket Racers, as the title suggests, is more of an arcade            surf 'em up than a simulation. Treating the game as a simulation            might have given it the edge over its already skeletal competition,            but compared to tarmac, water is a fairly unpredictable variable,            so it's understandable that developers CRI are reluctant to deal            with it in the same way they might treat Formula 1.                         And it's partially due to this reluctance and partially due to            inexperience that Surf Rocket Racers misses the mark. It's quite a            pretty game; the framerate is a fairly constant 30fps and the water            effects are reasonable, but at first it's actually difficult to            establish if you are really floating on water or on some sort of            rollercoaster suspended in a trough. The liquid your rider and his            jetski floats upon is more jelly-like than fluidic, and although            frequently the competition dash into turns and whip spray up into            his face, he never really looks wet.                    The character models in SRR look all right, and the animations are            nice and efficient as well. You can choose from 6 racers, although            you can't select their craft for them, which is a shame. Each racer            has varying attributes, presumably as a result of fitness and            build. Options include top speed, acceleration, handling,            durability and grip - finding the sweet-spot rider isn't all that            important though as in practice only one or two of the racers            really lag behind in most situations.                         At times the jetski you are perched upon looks like it could do            with some attention, but graphically speaking things are            consistent, with some particular detail paid to the backgrounds,            which depend on your location. The game ships you all over the            world, with a stint in the Bahamas (including lovely glass-clear            waters), a trip up the Manhattan River and even a journey through            the muddy waters of the Amazon. Slightly confusing is the presence            of Rome and its narrow canals. Surely Venice is far more renowned a            setting from the perspective of water-works?                         Unfortunately there are a few more notable eccentricities that            also deserve your attention. For instance, a characteristic of the            Tricks section is a mid-air turn as your rider flies off the            nearest ramp, but the motion of your rider looks almost robotic. At            times the water seems to kick up for no apparent reason too, in            stark contrast to your own actions and at obscure angles.                         It would have been nice to see something a little more exciting            and original too to flesh the game out, perhaps like the legendary            speedboat road-jump in the James Bond film Live and Let Die, or            shortcuts through built up areas, as with the introductory sequence            to The World is Not Enough. As an Arcade game such possibilities            were hardly out of the question either, but CRI have chosen to            stick strictly to the waves.                    Surf Rocket Racers is quite simplistic when it comes to structure.            The objective is always to finish as high up the rankings as            possible. In Championship Mode this isn't strictly true, as during            the heats placement only has to be above a certain point to ensure            safe passage through to the next round. As the field narrows the            requirements to progress steadily increase however.                         There are alternatives to Championship Mode though of course. Time            Attack is a good method of building yourself up to the tougher            races, and VS Battle is also quite good fun for two players. The            split screen mode doesn't encourage a loss of framerate either,            which is pleasantly surprising.                         Tricks & Techniques, mentioned fleetingly in an earlier            section, offers mini challenges that require you to perform certain            tricks and twists, including flips and other daring feats, while            Hazards & Obstacles, in spite of the name, is actually about            running over coloured balls in the water and doing so while staying            in the lead. Extras include a Replay feature that allows you to            track back over your performances and work out either where you            went wrong or what you can do to improve your standing.                         Needless to say, a lot of this stuff isn't the sort of thing that            happens in real life, but I do feel that a lot of what does happen            in real life is missed out here also.                    It's all very well being an arcade game, after all, but even arcade            games need a bit of depth to attract players over again. Beyond the            tricks feature very little of the game actually deviates from the            'race this way, do it faster than these people' formula. The            mini-games that make up Tricks & Techniques are entertaining,            but couldn't hold a candle to those found in Crazy Taxi.                         The other problem is that Surf Rocket Racers, despite the large            intervening period is still no better than Wave Race 64 was when it            was released five whole years ago. Attacking an under-populated            genre only really works if you have something new to offer -            perhaps a simulation is the next step. As it is, the boundaries of            the watercraft racer haven't even been touched upon, so from a            programming perspective the game is quite a cowardly experiment,            which is a pity, because developer CRI (who are also responsible            for the AeroWings series) aren't likely to want to repeat what they            will view as a mistake.                    Although pretty useful at what it does, Surf Rocket Racers is by no            means the best in its sparsely populated field, and has difficulty            keeping up with a game released nearly half a decade ago. The            simplistic style actually works against it, and with so little to            do, if you'll pardon the pun, it's just too shallow for its own            good."}
