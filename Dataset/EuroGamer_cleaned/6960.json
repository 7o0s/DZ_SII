The point and click horror genre has morphed            into the survival horror genre, where staying out of arms' reach of            ghouls and ghosts and keeping the pace is just as important as            finding out who killed the Colonel in the Billiards room with the            candlestick.                         Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, only the second AitD game to            grace the PSOne, has been pretty well advertised - even on            Television - as the next step in horror gaming. After the            atrocities of Fear Effect 2, publisher Infogrames couldn't have            picked a better time to release it, and it hits home all the            sweeter for it.                         The subject of the story is once again supernatural detective            Edward Carnby, whose adventures bring him to Shadow Island to            investigate the mysterious death of a close friend. Together with            anthropology prof. Aline Cedrac, the quest for his killer takes            them over his notes and research on the sinister island, and the            game earnest begins with their unfortunate plane crash on the edge            of the island, from where you decide which of the two leads to take            control.                         The pair uncover all manner of disturbing ills, including the            terrible truth about the dead fellow, gruesome scientific            experiments, suspense and excitement. It sounds odd, but it's            rather like Indiana Jones crossed with Hellraiser. The story is            rich and unfolds in an interesting and consistent manner - I've no            complaints about the way the game drags you around and spooks you.            There are a nice couple of twists in there too.                    Although both Aline and Edward make it to the island successfully,            they wouldn't be Alone in the Dark if they fought it together, so            you get to choose which you play for certain scenarios, and their            paths cross every once in a while. In-keeping with the excellent            narrative, both have individual reasons for investigating the            island and Edward's pal's demise. The story varies from one            character to the other, but so does the gameplay, with Aline taking            a more pacifistic approach to matters that Edward might just blast            his way through.                         The inventory that the pair each control includes things like            weaponry (a modest amount for Aline and a decent arsenal for            Edward) and tools. One of the most useful items in the pair's            inventory is the humble torch. Both of them have one, and far from            illuminating a comic-like spotlight on the wall, it brightens murky            rooms and casts eerie shadows. Even the modest PlayStation with its            ancient graphics chip makes a decent go of things here.                         Another useful item is the walkie-talkie, which helps keep Aline            and Edward in touch with one another. The good thing is, you might            be stuck looking for a vital clue to find your way past an            obstacle, and your partner might be lurking just on the other side            and in a position to help you. If at any point you hit the contact            button, the other one pipes up and if there's information to be            shared, a conversation brews. It's a clever way of synchronising            the two adventures without having them intersect if they don't need            to.                    On the whole, visually The New Nightmare is quite consistent, but            it does show up the design's teams hastiness to get it out the door            at times. Take for instance, the aforementioned shadow casting. It            looks all right, but there's almost too much darkness, and you            wonder why Edward doesn't just whip out some more batteries. It's            meant to be moody, not black and white. The PlayStation itself is            to blame for some of this, but there are times when you think they            could have tried a little harder.                         If the in-game sections are a little lacking at times though, the            easily distinguished CG sequences are outstanding. The animation is            spot on, with some lovely lighting effects and tremendous detail            given the ailing PSOne hardware. The colour is surprisingly rich            too, unlike other survival/horror games where an absence of life            usually means an absence of detail. Gore is red, not grey, as they            say.                         Interestingly, if you're in possession of a PlayStation 2, you're            more likely to enjoy Alone in the Dark 4, because of the console's            ability to apply crude anti-aliasing effects. The jagged edges on            some of the polygons that make up The New Nightmare are hideous.            Chuck the game in a PlayStation 2 however and it's a whole new            ballpark, moving the game up a notch from a good looking            PlayStation game to a very good looking PlayStation game. Granted,            the Dreamcast and PC versions will lose some of the graphical            obscurities, but there's no reason to go upgrading to enjoy this.                    Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, is less survival horror and            more adventure horror. There's plenty to keep you jumping out of            your skin, mostly thanks to the tremendous sense of atmosphere that            brims from every pore, but there's a narrative side to things too.            The audio is eerie and awkward too, the perfect accompaniment.            You're in the game, and it's in the game with you.                         Although any adventure game is going to lose a lot of its            excitement once you know how things pan out, there's definitely            scope for people to go back and still enjoy it, particularly given            the two characters' different reasons for visiting Shadow Island.            This makes the game somewhat unique amongst its adventure cohorts.                         I've deliberately avoided spoiling puzzles and upsetting much the            plot here, and I've managed to keep the various creatures that lurk            in the shadows under wraps too, but hopefully you'll appreciate            that - there's an excellent adventure game here, marred only by a            few jagged polygons in places, and unless you're some sort of wussy            cushion squirmer, you'll want to make it part of your collection."}
