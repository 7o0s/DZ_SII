{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/sonicadventure-dc", "date": "4 Dec 2012", "game_name": "Sonic Adventure", "text": "The thing is, for such an understated success, Sonic relies on a            very weak storyline. A big fat geezer called Dr. Robotnik spends            his time snooping around the world searching for these things            called Chaos Emeralds, of which there are seven. These emeralds            hold the key to running the entire planet, obviously, and as either            the blur of blue, Tails (the little orange Fox with two tails) or a            few other characters, it's your job to save it again. Despite this            weakness, I didn't feel put off playing the game at all.                         Differences between Sonic Adventure and its predecessor are            numerous and expansive. For example, the game isn't just a long            trawl through speedy horizontal levels; while it is still made up            of Action fields and Boss fields, new Adventure fields help to take            the focus of the game away from the anonymity and towards a more            involving plot-line.                         Sonic Adventure's most immediate progression is the change from a            2D to a 3D setting. If you'd have told me this a year ago, I would            have chuckled and muttered something about Mario 64 for animals,            but the sceptic in me has been silenced once more. The speed of            Sonic's movement doesn't lower the framerate across the board,            although in a couple of areas I noticed it on occasion.             Audibly, the game is surprisingly                 good. A blazing rock soundtrack seems a little misplaced at                 first, but it grows on you. Each character has his own theme                 tune, heard within the in-game cutscenes. The character voices                 are annoying, but only because they're so American. After a                 few days of listening to Sonic's drawl and Tails' rather                 pathetic squeaking, I suppose it's passable, but I would have                 been happy to live with a muted hedgehog. The lip sync doesn't                 do much to help its cause; complacent as it is at times.                         Speaking of sync, the control system seems like another good place            to stop. Control of Sonic and his entourage via the gamepad is            simple and effective. I've been increasingly more and more            encouraged by the control Sega's 'pad gives me and none more so            than by Sonic Adventure. While he flies across ravines and            landscapes, I am in total control, never feeling let down by bad            sampling or other things I sometimes wondered about in Tomb Raider            and the like on the Playstation.                    The first 10 minutes of Sonic Adventure are odd and mildly            confusing, especially so if you've played the previous versions!            The player is shown a cutscene where Sonic squares off against a            bullet-proof foe made of water. Then a brief Boss section where            this puddle of pain must be subdued is included, before he slinks            off down the drain (literally).                         Then the game whisks you off through the city to Sonic's pool-side            retreat, where he observes young Tails ditching his biplane ~in the            drink~, you take the reigns and shoot off down the beach and            through the glades for a few minutes at about 200MPH in the game's            first Action field. Upon finding the little chap, you can see that            he's found a Chaos Emerald. Then after some drunken dialogue, he            heads off to his place at the Mystic Caves, to where you must            follow.             Initial control of Sonic around                 Station Square, as I've already mentioned, is fluid and                 pleasingly easy to master. You enter the train station                 building and hear an announcement that a train is leaving.                 After rushing, well, Sonic does little else, toward the                 platform, you hop onto the train and depart.                         This is pretty much the tone of the proceedings from henceforth. A            single player game though Sonic most certainly is, you won't tire            of it. From the outset, there's a definite path that you take, via            key locations, such as Station Square, Sonic's home town and the            Mystic Caves, amongst others.                         Although the action is broken up by the frequent loading screens            (most noticeably thanks to the overlying soundtrack cutting in and            out accordingly), the game is easy to get into and hard to put            down.                    One of the most creative aspects of the Dreamcast is the VMU. Sonic            Adventure puts it to very good use. In the Station Square hotel            building where Sonic starts off is based a Chao Garden. Inside are            some eggs, which must be nurtured before hatching. Then the            occupant, a cutesy little animal called a Chao can be placed on a            gamepad-shaped box in the corner. From there it is uploaded to the            VMU, where it can be grown and pampered, just like a Tamagotchi in            fact. This can actually have some bearing on the course of the            game, as you need to collect more Chao and grow them in the Chao            Garden for use in battles and such. Those eggs that you find around            the world can usually be transferred back to the Chao Garden by a            teleport or uploaded to the VMU via a localised gamepad-shaped            thing, just like the one found in the Chao Garden.                         Oh, and if you have a friend who has his own Chao-laden VMU, you            can square both of them off by connecting the VMUs and selecting            battle mode.                         That's not all; sub-games like Sonic Pinball punctuate the action.            As with Soul Calibur (also on the Dreamcast), the game is packed to            the brim with little extras and details that breathe pure            excellence.                    I once read that with the Star Trek films, a general rule of thumb            is that the even numbered ones are worth watching and the odd            numbered not. This is kind of reminiscent of the Sonic series now.            The original was good but vastly too easy; the sequel doubled up on            its predecessor, offering twice the fun. The third in the series            disappointed on a grand scale as it simply tried too hard for the            platform, but the fourth, Sonic Adventure, represents a return to            fortune for Sega, just as the Dreamcast seems to have done.                         If you've ever enjoyed a platform game, this should appeal to you.            Aside from a few lip synchronising problems and a slightly weak            plot, the game reels you in and never casts you out. Much more than            the Sunday afternoon stopgap that I had hoped for.                        - Out Now"}
