They produce accessories for home                 consoles, including the Playstation, N64 and Dreamcast, and                 they also run off a group of Gameboy Color bits and pieces.                 Their trademark seems to be to undercut the prices of official                 units and try and alter the design of the official ones                 slightly, for the better.                         Third party controllers never really appeal for me. The garish            neon designs and fluorescent buttons just look out of place on my            carefully laid out desk, and the controllers have a tendency to            break, too, from experience. For example, I bought an official            Super Nintendo controller a few years ago, and an unofficial model            from some cowboy accessories outfit. The official model works, to            this day, but the other unit is unresponsive and damaged. Not to            mention blister-inducing.                         Still, you can't judge modern day products by yesteryear's            standards. There's every chance that these companies will have            learnt from their mistakes, and capitalised on the time in between.            Probably.                    The units I were given to play with were matching green and orange            Joytech Controller Plus 'pads for the Dreamcast. Both came in nice            cardboard packaging, which looked and seemed professional. First            impressions are always important in this industry, and I felt            suitably contented by mine.                         Upon opening the box, I was presented with a fairly light (but not            tacky) plastic controller, nicely packed. The packaging came away            easily and I was left with the controller. Gripping the pad, my            initial reaction was that it was larger (both in breadth and depth)            than the official model. The official model gives your palms space            to breathe, but if you're reaching around the shoulders of the            Joytech, you'll find that you're fully extended. My younger brother            could barely get his little paws around it at all!                    Unlike the official model, the Joytech has leather grips where the            base of your thumb rests, which is surprisingly unobtrusive, even            after a few hours of use. The surface is much smoother than you            might think from a quick visual inspection, and is hardly abrasive            at all - just enough to prevent it slipping.                         Again not like the official model, the Joytech deprives your palm            of oxygen and you get rather sweaty under there, but your thumbs            remain perfectly dry, rested upon the leather grips. However, the            design is such that unless you have particularly large hands, you            may strain your fingers moving them across to press the Start, Slow            and Turbo buttons.                         Such is the positioning of the latter two Joytech-only buttons,            that its also very easy to accidentally depress them and start/stop            the function. I don't like the function of those buttons either, to            be honest - the Slow button Pauses and Unpauses the game in quick            succession, creating a stop-starty ~slow-mo~ effect. This is            distracting, rather than useful, though. Turbo is slightly more            worthwhile, although a dastardly cheat in games where quick button            tapping is the objective, as it basically takes away the need to do            so.         The usual four buttons sit on the                 right hand side of the centre, overshadowed by the new Z and C                 buttons. I'm not sure what the situation is with these                 buttons, whether you can reprogram games to use them or                 whether they just mirror the action of the shoulder analogue                 buttons, but they're easily accessible and the same size and                 shape as the other four.                         On the left hand side is the usual D-Pad/Analogue-Pad combination.            The D-Pad is bulkier than its official counterpart and somewhat            chunkier. However, the buttons depress with a much more satisfying            click, and are more intuitive to use than the official ones in            games such as            Soul            Calibur and Marvel Versus Capcom. The analogue pad is basically            identical in feel to its official adversary, but for some reason,            unbeknownst to this reviewer, it has a little concave indentation            in the centre. This causes blisters like nothing else and is the            only real design fault in the whole pad.                         Unlike the disastrous analogue pad, the shoulder buttons are an            improvement. There's more resistance to the compression of said            buttons and this makes them seem more tangible than their official            competitors, which click down with little opposing force.                    Aesthetically the pad is nothing phenomenal, but it's hardly ugly.            The fluorescent colours mentioned previously are rather 1995, but            the marginally translucent effect (half showing the circuit boards            beneath) are more up to date and quite eye-catching. The centre of            the pad is elevated a tad, with a curved half-moon shape whether            the memory pad screen is viewable and a Joytech logo just beneath.            The memory pad screen hole is flanked by a vertical texture in            grey, with lines interspersed between the grey to catch and reflect            the light.                         To the eye, the Joytech is a pretty model. The reverse is a            slightly less translucent white and is standard to every model. The            main translucent cover on the front changes between the green and            orange model.                    After a few hours, I can report on the pad's performance in several            different genres. Firstly, in Crazy Taxi the pad holds up very            well. Both the default and my own personal control set-ups are very            easy to use on the Joytech. The extra breadth of the pad subtly            allows you to widen your arm span, and as such is moderately more            comfortable, as your arms curve in a more natural position.                         Soul Calibur revealed much the same, with the D-Pad actually            proving preferable to the official model's.                         The biggest major design difference between the two pads though,            also proved to be my favourite. On the official pad, the cable that            connects the Dreamcast to the pad comes out of the bottom and            curves under, toward the console. Joytech have modified the cord so            that it actually protrudes at the top of the pad. By doing this            they have solved the one design flaw that I found in the official            option. The cord will not strain and bend so much, and thus the pad            will last for a longer time than the normal one, in theory at            least.                    Personally I prefer the new Joytech range of Dreamcast controllers.            The pads are very comfortable to use for the most part and the            control lead comes out of the apex, not the foot, meaning the cable            won't develop loose connections so soon. Available in a whole host            of neon-like colour schemes, the pads are fairly cheap and            cheerful, but also pack a lot of value to their punch.                         If you need to stock up on a new pad or two, you could do a lot            worse than pick up a Joytech."}
