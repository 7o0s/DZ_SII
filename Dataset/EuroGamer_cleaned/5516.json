The block-stacking video game took the world by storm and soldhundreds of thousands of copies and a good many Nintendo Game Boyhandheld consoles in the 80s. Considered by many in our offices tobe one of the founders of pocket gaming, its simple graphics andaddictive gameplay ensured it appeared on just about every formatand in many variations, most of them copyright-infringing. Indeed,its success was matched only by the subsequent battles over whoactually created it (Alexei Pajitnov if you're interested) and moreimportantly who owned the rights.No such doubts remain here, however, as this is the officiallylicensed version from Jamdat, which means we're back to theoriginal selection of 7 coloured shapes - known as Tetrominoes ortetrads - that fall from the sky and into the play area at asteadily increasing velocity. En route they can be moved androtated via the joypad so that upon landing they link with othersto form a solid wall. Manage to form one or more lines in this wayand they'll disappear, allowing the blocks above to move down thescreen. Leave gaps and the Tetrominoes keep building upwards untilyou touch the top of the screen and its game over!So far, so familiar then, but as the suffix would suggest,Tetris Ultra teaches this faithful old dog a few new tricks. Inaddition to playing for as long as you can before the screen fillsup, your head hurts or, more likely, your phone's battery runs out,there are also two snappier new pocket-gaming friendly modes,'Ultra' and '40 lines'. In the former you have 3 minutes to accruethe highest score you can and the latter charges you with gettingrid of 40 lines in the fastest time possible. As special multiplierbonuses are awarded for taking out 2-4 lines at once, in practicethis means trying to assemble 3 or 4 line structures as you awaitthat long, thin piece to complete your plans. And you might nothave to wait too long either, as another gameplay tweak allows youto hold a piece in reserve by pressing the '0' button, which youcan then re-introduce into the action. Although far fromrevolutionary, the addition of this feature and the listing of thenext 5 pieces to fall undoubtedly provides for a little moreforward planning and strategy than in the original game.When all the blocks have fallen and the dust settles though,it's still ultimately Tetris, even though it does have a few newbells and whistles and, if you feel you've already invested enoughof your life organising those coloured blocks, you might want togive this a miss. For the rest of us puzzle-lovers though, despitethe myriad options out there (some of which offer a fresher andmore varied challenge) Tetris Ultra is still an essential purchase.The years have been kind to the classic formula ensuring that theblock stacking challenge is every bit as addictive today as when itfirst arrived."}
