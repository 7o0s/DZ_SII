Although it's fair to say that most            gamers can list Monkey Ball's influences off the tops of their            heads, it remains one of the more exciting games to appear on            GameCube, and we've been itching to try out UK-based developer            Realism's ~Junior~ port ever since we found it tucked away on the            Nintendo stand at E3 11 months ago.                    What we have here is a surprisingly faithful and complete port of            the original Monkey Ball, rehashing many of its levels and            retaining some of its infamous party games. There are four            difficulty levels (including an unlockable 'Master' option), which            comprise a total of about 65 levels plus bonus stages - the latter            group accessed by surpassing the summit of each without shedding a            single continue. Of the party games, Monkey Fight, Bowling and Golf            remain, with a Monkey Duel option for link-up. Sadly we couldn't            test this last option in the absence of a second copy of the game,            but we're assured it's a ~multi-cart~ feature, and the others are            all up to their usual high standard.                    As big Monkey Ball fans (and having recently polished off the Cube            sequel), we've been tirelessly scouring the rest of the game with            much vigour, and we hope Realism gets more projects like this,            because if its brief was to emulate then it has done a sterling            job. Everything is present and correct - chequered, polygonal            landscapes; the individual monkeys and their respective animations;            the rippling finish line tape; the aggravating pinball buffers; the            floating, tilting and whirling platforms and even the jolly old            soundtrack. On the party games front, each is as fully featured as            its Cube predecessor, and in the case of Monkey Golf (the nine-hole            'crazy golf' variant, rather than the Links wannabe from Monkey            Ball 2), it's almost more relaxing to play it this way. As for            Monkey Fight, it's quite startling how true it is to its Cubey            counterpart; it's fast, furious and all goes on at an impressive            pace.                    Of course there have been casualties of the downscaling process.            For a start, we're no longer watching the game scroll past in            glorious 60fps at high resolution. It varies depending on the            stage, as tight and twisty levels with broadly distributed            platforms do OK in most areas, but given the long, sprawling levels            which rely on speed and a straight line, the framerate can slow to            what feels like single figures. Then again, after about two or            three hours it all feels surprisingly comfortable. It's irksome,            perhaps, but hardly a major concern.        Indeed, major            concerns are thin on the ground. It's all really rather good. The            physics engine has suffered in places - it's true - but perhaps            necessarily. As the pins in Monkey Bowling are now sprites and not            polygons, you don't get those classic moments of adrenaline-fuelled            joy, as the final straggler topples under the momentum of a rolling            colleague to secure a vital strike, but on the other hand Realism            has stuck buffers alongside the bowling lane to keep you on track.            It may sound rather self-defeating to boost players' chances like            this, but it's still a level playing field when you're swapping the            GBA between friends on a bus, and ultimately it stops you hurling            abuse at your console in public. Well, more abuse.                    The only significant problem with Monkey Ball Junior, such that it            is, stems from the original code - specifically Sega's obsession            with a frustrating camera. We've always been torn between love and            contempt for this camera. On the one hand, it's a barometer for            Monkey skills, picking out those who can manage its quirks on the            fly from those who can merely keep the stick pointed in the one            direction for each task, but on the other it rarely faces in a            useful direction and the rules it follows are a bit random. And if            you hated it before, you'll hate it even more now, as the game has            a propensity for agonising angles, and the GBA's directional pad is            not built for absolute precision. Often controlling your monkey can            be quite frustrating, even if like the framerate you gradually            adapt to the differences after a few hours.                    And you will continue to play it for many more after that. We'd say            that Junior offers substantially more gameplay than many of its            neighbours on the shelves of your local game shop. Even if you can            conquer the beginner (10-stage) and advanced (20-stage) levels in            an evening (as we did), there's still the brutal, 30-stage expert            campaign and a master mode full of evil tricks and diabolically            narrow ledges to traverse - and thousands of play points to keep on            unlocking. With each session you pick up more and more, and the            prizes vary from party games to begin with to extra continues (up            to a maximum of 9 per session before you unlock infinite            continues), the aforementioned master mode and extra courses for            Monkey Golf. The reward structure will keep you coming back, as            we've seen on the Cube twice now, by rewarding new approaches and            better stage times, and throwing in better and better-designed and            thoughtful levels like confetti. What's more, the requisite            practise mode means you can keep trying to master those troublesome            stages before attempting to complete them all in sequence.                    Although some will find fault with it, on the whole we couldn't be            more impressed with this port. It's got the looks, the sounds, the            depth and the reward structure, not to mention oodles of gameplay            and one of the most endearing multiplayer 'party' dynamics ever,            which still works in a 'hot-seat' capacity on the GBA and            particularly the go-anywhere SP.                    And as we munch on our final banana of the evening, it's difficult            to find some inspirational words, because all we want to do is rush            off and play Junior some more. It's always great to have an excuse            to play Monkey Ball, and it's a bloody mission not to push back the            deadline in order to keep doing so - surely the sign of a great            game, and this is one that every GBA owner devoid of motion            sickness and availed of a pair of hands should own. We demand you            buy it instantly."}
