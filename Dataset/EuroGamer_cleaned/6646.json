It doesn't really have the same kick to            it as ~WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth~, does it? There's none of            the flamboyance, egotism, showmanship and outright lunacy of a            SmackDown title in the words ~Legends of Wrestling II~. As a brand,            it sounds more like one of those 60-minute-long videos full of            cheap archive footage, which you only see advertised on second-rate            digital TV channels. And if you do buy it, you have a 30 day no            quibbles money back guarantee, as long as you can get hold of the            company before they leg it with your dosh.                    Oh well, at least it's consistent.        As you might expect from our depressing intro, Legends of            Wrestling II is by-the-numbers in all but a handful of areas.            There's a career mode, which has you fighting to win through            territorial qualifiers by whipping the crowd into a frenzied mob,            with simple storylines and largely predictable outcomes. Beyond            that, there are the obligatory multi-player and create-a-wrestler            modes. The latter is a bit of fun, but since you can't play with            the model's height and girth, you'll soon lose interest and go            running back to SmackDown. This is a recurring theme.                    Right: next up, before we part the ropes and hit the canvas, let's            address the so-called innovation that runs through the heart of            LoW2; the ~IPS~ system. And no, sorry, we don't care what it means.            IPS is a simple principle, which drives every bout in the game.            When you get into the position to reverse an opponent's move or            extend your own combination, a little meter pops up and you have to            jam a button when a dancing pointer hits the shaded area. Do this            and you'll reap rewards. Besides this, the basic gameplay consists            of grappling (triangle/circle) and then sliding into piledrivers,            suplexes and other moves to inflict damage.                    However, as you'll quickly see from your AI opponent's adeptness            with IPS, victory in LoW2 is all about timing a reversal and            engineering it into a combo - by hitting a button at the right            time. Success is a matter of using the meter to your advantage more            often than your opponent can, flatly ignoring for the most part the            rigorous task of learning arsenals of moves and developing            strategies. You could plug away until the rest of the game is            second nature and moves, modifiers and combos flow from your            fingertips like a river of milk and honey, but why bother when you            can just stab a button in the right fraction of a second to greater            acclaim?                    Naturally, the IPS system also strips the multi-player game of much            of its entertainment. Once you both get the hang of it, matches            turn into long, drawn out affairs which only end when either your            opponent's or your own hand-eye coordination give way too often. Or            if you take to physically attacking them.        Visually, Legends II it's the closest            thing to those old chunky action figures everyone had as a kid,            with huge, disproportionate muscles and menacing looks. Sadly            though, frustrating problems with collision detection mean they            behave a lot more like action figures than real wrestlers.            Characters occasionally fall beneath a blow but rarely line up            correctly, failing to lock horns in a natural manner or even lock            eyes particularly convincingly.                    Then there's the age-old issue of waiting for animations to            conclude before accepting more input. Ye gads, why in the hell is            this still a problem in 2003? All right, it has its applications            (in footy titles, for instance), but it's an obstacle here.            Meanwhile, shove more than two wrestlers in a ring and you suffer            the hateful slowdown you probably expected at some point (which            seems unreasonable given that, besides the characters, nothing in            LoW2 looks either high resolution or particularly detailed), and            the camera tends to fly off into the distance, making it very            difficult to judge distances and respond quickly.                    So what is there to recommend about LoW2? The graphics? No. The            sound? The first peeling throbs of tedious nu-metal piping through            the speakers should be enough of an answer. The gameplay? Not            really. The problem is that wrestling ~back then~ was about            emotional drama (Brett Hart trying to win his first belt from Mr.            Perfect, for example), and not so much spectacular athletics, which            leaves LoW2 clutching at straws right from the get-go. The            multi-player? It's one big stalemate. In fact, the only thing we            really enjoyed about LoW2 was the DVD extra-style interviews, and            they're certainly not worth 40 quid.                    To be honest, Legends of Wrestling II will never live on anyone's            recommended list, but pitched between December and February it            might have found some comfort in the arms of lonely gamers. As it            is, we're just itching to get it off our desk so I can tuck into a            plethora of February and March-bound games of a much higher            calibre. And therein lies the game's problem: it's pretty average,            nothing special - and it's nothing special in a genre which already            has a very handsome, throbbing king, aptly named SmackDown, and            it's nothing special due out in the same month as some really            highly anticipated titles across all formats.                    Unless you have some peculiar obsession with ~the good old days~ of            wrestling before it grew into a peculiar over-exaggerated American            soap opera, or idolise the likes of Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks,            then don't let curiosity get the better of you. Legends of            Wrestling II is onto a loser from the outset and doesn't even make            the best of what it has. SmackDown retains the belt.
