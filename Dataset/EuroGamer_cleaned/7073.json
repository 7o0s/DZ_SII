I want a massive house, 17            cars, an endless supply of Smirnoff Ice, and more young ladies            clamouring for a place in my will than I could possibly dream of.            And the only realistic way I can attain that kind of status is            through a television game show that has ensnared millions of ITV            audience members like the mindless cattle that they are. But enough            daydreaming about possessing untold riches (and trust me, as a            writer I have to dream about money a lot), let's get on to the game            where oodles of beautiful virtual cash awaits us, shall we?                         You should know what this game is all about by now, but for the            benefit of those of you just resurrected from the dead I'll go over            it for you, pointing out the video game additions as I go. A            contestant enters their name and is promptly presented with their            first multiple-choice question of 15, with no real messing about -            Tarrant's occasionally frustrating natter is kept to a pleasant            minimum, and you don't even have to look at his face. The musical            score is right on par as well, and if you've ever seen the TV show            you'll feel right at home as the tense ambience is recreated            faithfully.                         As you progress past your first question, the amount of money you            earn increments gradually with each successful answer until you            reach your fifth, which is a kind of checkpoint. This means that            whatever happens, you can leave with a minimum of \u00a31000. This            happens only once more when you win \u00a332,000, at which point            you have to either gamble big money on questions, or tap the ~walk~            button in order to leave with whatever amount of cash you've            gained. It's around about the \u00a31000 stage that the questions            become noticeably more difficult, and the use of your lifelines            come into play in order to aid you progression into double-figure            sums. You have three of these lifelines at your disposal - 50:50,            Phone A Friend and Ask The Audience.                    The 50:50 lifeline eliminates two of the wrong answers out of the            possible four; however, the chances are it will leave behind the            two answers you were pondering over the most, occasionally making            life even more difficult.                         Phone A Friend doesn't actually let you phone a friend, but            instead it plays back a pre-recorded voice (with hilariously badly            acted regional accents - absolutely nobody sounds normal), which            offers its opinion on your question. More often than not they are            completely unsure of the answer, so you are best advised to use            this up first to give you more of a chance later on.                         Finally, Ask The Audience is a poll of the ~studio audience~,            where you can find out what the most likely answer to the question            is. In actual fact, the developers polled 100 real people to gather            the statistics for these questions, and it's by far the most useful            lifeline.                    As you can tell, there's not a great deal of complication involved            in playing the game, and you'll probably wonder where the longevity            factor might come from. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? is a fairly            robust party game as it happens, although the boredom soon sets in            when the questions begin to repeat themselves. There are just over            1000 questions in the game, but they seem to rotate alarmingly            quickly, shortening the life of the title a great deal. You'd think            for the PC version at least (perhaps even the Dreamcast version)            there'd be the opportunity to expand the question database via a            website, but a clear lack of forethought means the game will be            dismissed to the cupboard within two or three weeks, easily.                         The differences between the three versions of the game available            are purely cosmetic, with the PC version obviously offering the            much more lush, higher resolution graphics, and the PlayStation            stumbling in with the least impressive and frankly quite shoddy            looking display. The interface, however, remains the same across            the board, aside from the fact that on a television screen the text            is disastrously small, forcing players to huddle around the            television in order to read the questions - I really do wonder why            things like this ever slip past the quality control tests.                         The different pseudo-multiplayer modes on offer really do little            to motivate further play. There's the Fastest Finger mode whereby            each player has to answer a question, putting the answers in the            correct order in the quickest time possible; the fastest player            goes through to play a round whilst the other sit out and.. watch.            Joy. Alternatively, you can compete against other players in a kind            of knockout tournament, with each player taking their turn to            answer one question at a time, which is basically a more tedious            version of the single-player experience - not exactly rich gameplay            pickings, to be honest.                    This game will be popular over the Christmas season, you can be            assured of it, and you can also bet that a lot of families are            going to feel ripped off at paying full-price for a product that            only offers the limited appeal of a budget title. It's alright for            a laugh when you start off, but come a couple of weeks and you'll            have soon forgotten about it."}
