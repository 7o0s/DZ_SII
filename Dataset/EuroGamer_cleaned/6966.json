With the falling prices of Athlons and            memory, the only outstanding question is how stable the DDR            platform is for gamers, but we'll save that for our appraisal of            the various motherboard chipsets another time. For the moment, the            performance freak inside of us needs a workout.                         First thing's first though, lets go over the history of the famous            DDR acronym. The first time AMD applied those three magical letters            was two summers ago with the original Athlon, which transferred            data back and forth to the rest of the system twice for every clock            cycle, doubling the theoretical bandwidth at its disposal. Since            then the processor has retained that throughout further            generations, receiving its second injection courtesy of DDR-SDRAM            or as we will refer to it today, simply DDR memory, towards the end            of the Thunderbird's days. Following NVIDIA's lead with the            GeForce, AMD created a system architecture that truly took            advantage of 200 and 233MHz front side buses.                         Now, the thing that has confused a number of people is the way            JEDEC, the standardization body for this sort of technology amongst            others, have classified DDR SDRAM standards. Unlike the previous            days of PC66, PC100 and PC133, the denotation here does not focus            on maximum clock speed, but the theoretical memory bandwidth, hence            PC1600 and PC2100. The large number indicates that the memory can            handle X number of Megabytes data per second under ideal            conditions. PC1600 deals with 1600Mb/s at 200MHz, while PC2100            deals with 2100Mb/s at 266MHz.                    Of course, the Athlon's closest rival, Intel's Pentium 4 (which is            bound by agreement to use RAMBUS RDRAM), is effectively quadrupling            its data rate, with a 400MHz front side bus, but in practice the            Athlon holds its own more than adequately. Lets examine that            phenomenon just briefly.                         The first thing to point out is that although the Athlon's DDR            front side bus has a theoretical upper limit of 2100Mb/s, the            Pentium 4 beats it in memory performance every time, because it has            a theoretical high of 3200Mb/s. In fact, if you look closely at the            benchmarks (they're not exciting enough to warrant a space-filling            image, so take our word for it), then you can clearly see that the            Athlon system falls far short of the target. Switching the            Pentium 4 RDRAM for a lower speed variant, reducing its theoretical            high to below that of the Athlon DDR system, the result remains in            the Pentium 4's favour. Now, it would be nice to have some way of            explaining this away, but in reality it simply looks as though the            Athlon can't quite take advantage of its own available bandwidth            just yet.                         Even so, as remarked just a paragraph ago, in virtually all real            world benchmarks, clock for clock the Athlon tramples all over the            Pentium 4. The reason for that, some argue, is that SSE2, which the            P4 thrives upon, isn't implemented in any real world programs yet.            Suffice to say, it's this factor which will keep AMD ahead of Intel            even when the latter's clock speeds eclipse those of the former by            several hundred MHz.                    So what do we know? We know that clock for clock Intel is not a            competitor, but we also know that AMD's chips don't fully take            advantage of the memory bandwidth on offer. This is slightly            worrying, because it means that the introduction of DDR memory into            an Athlon system may not provide the mesmerizing benchmarks one            would hope for, while with the increasing clock speeds of the            Pentium 4 and its likely move to DDR SDRAM within the year may well            do so.                         The only way to prove anything is to do some testing, so we built            a DDR system using some of the best components we could find and            gave it the run around. Equipped with an AMD 761-based ASUS A7M266            motherboard, a 1.3GHz (200MHz FSB) or 1.33GHz (266MHz FSB) Athlon            and a GeForce 3, we tried our system's hand at some nasty            benchmarks, alternating between 256Mb sticks of Crucial-branded            PC1600 and PC2100 memory. For comparison, we chose an Athlon system            using the KT133A platform (ABit KT7A-RAID) alternating between            256Mb sticks of Crucial-branded PC100 and PC133 memory.                         The first test is the obligatory Quake III workout using the            recent demo127.dm3 timedemo benchmark.                    Although beaten by its DDR-driven rival, the KT133A platform            demonstrates its worth. The AMD761 equipped DDR system beats it by            a mere 6%.                         3DMark 2001 is a benchmark we have been itching to put to good use            for a while, so lets try that next.                    Although both DDR systems pull ahead slightly, the difference in            performance is even smaller than the Quake III figures. As the            person who sat there and watched all four runs of 3DMark, I didn't            feel any was terribly lacking in terms of performance.                    How about some real world benchmarks to test general performance            though? One a lot of you probably want to know about is MP3 ripping            performance. So as to eliminate the CD-Rom drive's capabilities, we            converted from WAV to MP3 using the same 50Mb file on all four            systems, then measured the time, as reported by Audiograbber. The            encoding speed varies so much that it seemed largely irrelevant. We            used version 1.88 of the ~lame~ MP3 encoding DLL.                    Stalemate. The conversion process is very FPU intensive, rather            than bandwidth intensive, so some might argue that it has no            bearing on our conclusions. As an everyday user of Windows though,            I'd argue that any purchasing decision I make has to be based on a            number of factors, and if MP3 encoding speed is one of those, it            matters a darn sight more than how many numbers it scores in            situations I will never be in.                         The best real world benchmark of a new system is how it feels to            use from day to day. As a long time user of the KT133 and KT133A            platforms, I know that they can handle a lot of multitasking but            tend to drop off a bit on bandwidth-heavy tasks. Using the DDR            system feels, sadly, almost the same. In fact, moving from KT133A            to AMD761 was pretty unnoticeable. The only difference came in the            ever-so-slight gaming benchmark improvements and during heavy            multi-tasking, when things seemed a little less hectic.                    Although our DDR memory is rated to 100MHz, 133MHz and CAS 2.5, we            thought it would be fun to push it as far as it would go using an            unlocked Athlon. The highest speed our memory achieved was 160MHz            at CAS3 (both sticks managed this, but the PC2100 POSTed slightly            higher than the PC1600 would go). At CAS2 our memory was as stable            as we would expect, falling over quite a lot at 150MHz, but            seemingly fine at 133MHz. Using CAS2 didn't make a world of            difference to our benchmarks - no more so than changing the CAS            timing with regular SDRAM. If you want to learn more about the            different settings and their meanings, have a look at our            Performance Memory article from last            month.                         It's also worth noting that we achieved slightly higher speeds            with our 1.33GHz ~AXIA Y~ Athlon using the KT133A platform. That            said, the ASUS A7M266 and the ABit KT7A-RAID are vastly different            motherboards, so it's difficult to tell what is at fault. ASUS            boards are renowned for their stability over their performance,            after all.                    When DDR memory first became available, a lot of people dismissed            it as an expensive fad because of the relatively minor performance            increase. However, if you're in the market for a whole new PC,            upgrading from anything but high performance KT133A / PC133            equipment, the market is in such a state that opting for DDR SDRAM            is actually just as cost effective as choosing a regular            SDRAM-powered machine. All things being equal (and judging by            current memory prices which put DDR at a mere \u00a35 more than            SDRAM per 256Mb stick, they pretty much are), you have no excuse as            a new PC buyer for choosing less. In the future, one would argue            that your DDR SDRAM will be a more important thing to have than            your SDRAM\u2026                         The only thing preventing me from issuing a whole-hearted            recommendation of the Athlon DDR platform is stability. We haven't            had the chance to play around with our AMD761-based motherboard for            long yet, and although we have noticed relatively few quirks            compared to some KT133A boards, there are far more people            complaining about DDR motherboards and chipsets on the Internet at            the moment than there are clamouring at the KT133A's door. Our            advice is to wait and see how things pan out. With hobbyist            favourite ABit still to produce an Athlon DDR motherboard, things            are not yet set in stone.                        -        Performance                    Memory ShowdownPerformance                    Memory ShowdownApril's                    Marching MotherboardsApril's                    Marching MotherboardsKT133A:                    Performance for LessKT133A:                    Performance for Less"}
