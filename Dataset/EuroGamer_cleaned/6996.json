While most anime seems to involve giant robots, schoolgirls, big            hairy demons or preferably some combination of the above, Perfect            Blue is an entirely different beast though. A tense and at times            utterly surreal psychological thriller set in contemporary Tokyo,            it follows the life of Mima Kirigoe, a 21 year old J-Pop idol who            leaves kitsch girl band Cham to forge a new career in acting.                    But as she comes under increasing stress and her role in the gory            TV series Double Bind becomes darker and more confusing, so her            grip on reality starts to slip. Where does the show end and her            real life begin? Who is the obsessive fan stalking her, and how            does the website ~Mima's Room~ know so much about her? To make            matters even worse she is haunted by her former pop idol persona,            and a string of brutal murders is starting to scythe its way            through the people who have worked with her since she left Cham...                    The plot is labyrinthine to say the least, with more twists and            turns than a whole shelf-full of Fight Clubs. The imagery is            dream-like and full of false awakenings, meaning that you are never            entirely sure how much of what you are seeing is ~real~, how much            is part of Double Bind, and how much is simply happening in Mima's            head.                    The result is a disturbing and thought provoking film that is more            than a match for many of the live-action thrillers to come out of            Hollywood in recent years. This is no Lion King - the violence is            pretty gruesome even by anime standards and there is full frontal            nudity in places, not to mention two fairly graphic rape scenes            (one of them staged for Double Bind, and one of them presumably            real).                    None of it is particularly gratuitous though, as it all adds to the            growing sense of unreality surrounding Mima as her life fall to            pieces. The violence is usually highly stylised, at times owing            more to Hitchcock than it does to other anime movies, from a brutal            stabbing in front of a projector screen showing stills from Double            Bind to the scene in which posters of Mima on the walls of a fan's            bedroom start to talk to him. Overall the effect is little short of            stunning.                    Although the actual animation in Perfect Blue is mostly well above            average by anime standards, it's not consistent throughout. A few            scenes are so sparsely detailed that it almost looks as though a            place-holder shot has been left in there by mistake, with virtually            flat-shaded faces and little or no movement. To be fair these are            mostly unimportant crowd shots and the like, but it can be a little            jarring if you are more used to Disney than anime when it comes to            cartoon movies.                    Apart from these few lapses though the art quality is generally            excellent, with some great use of reflection, focus and lighting,            especially when the ghostly pop idol version of Mima puts in an            appearance, bouncing along with her feet barely touching the            ground. The soundtrack is also impressive, from the cheesey upbeat            pop of Cham to the dark brooding electronic background music that            accompanies the rest of the film.                    Overall Perfect Blue is something of a triumph for the Japanese            film industry - a serious adult anime movie with excellent            direction, an imaginative script and some beautiful animation. The            frequent sex and violence means that it's not for the faint of            heart or the weak of stomach, but if you are looking for a thriller            with brains (and we're not just talking about the ones splattered            all over the walls), this is well worth a look.                    The Region 2 release from Manga UK features a ~digitally            remastered~ version of the movie. Given that Perfect Blue is only a            few years old and should have been fine as it was we're not            entirely sure what this means, but the result is generally pretty            good, spoilt only by a few minor blemishes in a couple of scenes.                    On the audio side you have a choice of the original Japanese            soundtrack (with optional English subtitles) or a dubbed English            version. Anime purists will no doubt appreciate the presence of the            Japanese version, but to be honest the English dubbing is so good            that there's little reason to watch it in its original language -            after all, lip-synching has never been a high priority in anime for            some reason, and so it makes little difference which language you            watch it in. The only real disappointment was the rather silly            voice of ~Mr Me-Mania~, but otherwise the dubbing is faultless and            at times better than the rather squeaky Japanese dialogue.                    The disc also features a whole plethora of special features, most            of which are grouped in a ~Mima's Room~ menu based on the fan site            in the film. This features a gallery of stills from the movie (~my            favourite photos~), adverts for other Manga releases (~my favourite            DVDs~) and interviews with the film's director and some of the            voice actors used on the English dubbing. There is also a video of            a J-Pop band in the studio singing one of Cham's songs, and another            option marked ~English Title Song~ that locks up when I try to            access it, which could be down to a faulty disc.                    Otherwise the DVD is a solid effort from Manga, and well worth            getting hold of if you don't already have this movie in your            collection.
