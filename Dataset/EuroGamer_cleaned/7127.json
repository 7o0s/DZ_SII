So when Diablo II, the long-awaited                 sequel to their 1997 smash hit RPG, was finally released                 earlier this month, it sold over a million copies in two                 weeks, making it the fastest selling game of all time on the                 PC...                    The storyline for the game is interesting and diverse, unravelled            through much adventuring and talking to NPCs. In order to restore            good to the land, and to end the threat of Diablo once and for all,            you must journey through four acts, featuring a series of dungeons            and battlefields for your chosen character (Sorceress, Necromancer,            Paladin, Amazon or Warrior) to explore.                    The graphical performance is impressive, and even on my fairly            modest system the framerate didn't falter except during the most            hectic of encounters. Even with the hero's shadows being cast in            all directions by the dynamic light sources, there was barely a            hiccup.                    Diablo 2 retains the old isometric display system of the original,            but the overall look is much smarter and infinitely more detailed.            Enemies writhe as they fall to the ground, while the sounds created            by assorted nasties lurking in the dungeon alerts you to their            presence, their spine-chilling groans allowing you to make good            your escape or close in for the kill.         The variety of enemies is also appreciated, and                 it's easy to spot distinctive foes amongst the swarms. When                 you target them, information on their special abilities                 appears at the top of the screen, which helps you to pick out                 the main threats. With the clarity of the NPCs, it all makes                 it rather easy to focus on the main troublemakers of a                 dungeon.                    And unlike the perpetually dark setting of Tristam, in this game            the settings are diverse and interesting throughout the four acts.            For example, the second village is set in a dry desert, and has the            feel of an ancient Ottoman Empire outpost .. except that its sewers            are crawling with the undead.                    The map system included in the game is updated on the fly, and a            transparent layover makes exploring easy. All the major landmarks            and NPCs are marked on the map as you see them, so there is little            chance of becoming disorientated. Of course, some may argue that            this presents little real challenge, and that it cements Diablo 2's            role as an ~RPG-Lite~, but there is enough challenge in exploration            and surviving as it is.         One of the features that helped to make the                 original Diablo so popular was the multiplayer support,                 although this is also where it becomes clear that the game is                 not a hardcore RPG. Often I have joined servers to find people                 talking totally out of character, or not speaking at all and                 just cutting down reams of enemies in a race to become the                 highest level player on the server.                    Sometimes you can find a few others interested in roleplaying, but            most of the time it's more like Quake than Everquest. Of course,            depending on your taste this might not be a bad thing. And when you            are fighting, you won't have much time for idle chitchat - the            game's real-time combat is especially hard on the melee fighters,            with dozens of enemies converging on you at once.                    It's imperative to carry several healing potions with you, and even            more important are Scrolls of Town Portal. These can teleport you            to the nearest town, and the portal stays there so that you can            immediately gate back when you are finished healing, or selling the            treasures which you have picked up on your travels. This keeps            downtime to a minimum, and has already won over several Everquest            fans who got bored with the constant sitting-and-resting and            going-to-bank routine of other online RPGs.         Some of the treasures you collect contain                 magical properties, and must be identified to show their true                 properties. Even when you have found out what your new staff                 does, you may not be able to use it - certain items have a                 class or stats limitation.                    For example, a warrior with a high strength will be able to wield a            giant two-handed axe, while a weakling sorceress won't. Conversely,            a necromancer can wield a magical wand, while it would break in the            warrior's hands. As a result, trading magic items with other            players is one of the main online features.                    At the end of the day though, I don't think I will still be playing            Diablo II a year or two down the line. It simply doesn't have the            complexity of Ultima Online, Asheron's Call or EverQuest, and is            missing the little touches that give an RPG its long term power.                    But this doesn't take away from the sheer fun which can be had with            the game. The graphics are a treat, the sound suitably atmospheric,            and the soundtrack perfectly matches the scene. If I ever want to            just blast some skeletons and take out my aggressions online            without worrying about inventory loss or lag, this is the game to            fire up.         Diablo II is really a meld of an action game and                 an RPG. The wealth of NPCs, settings and items make it                 comparable to a role-playing game, but the hack-n-slash combat                 system owes more to Gauntlet than Ultima.                    Although I haven't always liked cross-genre games, Diablo II            carries off its role as an action RPG very well. The wealth of            online servers, the randomly generated dungeons, the difficulty of            missions, not to mention the three difficulty modes which change            the way you have to fight to survive, all add some staying power to            the game.                    If you are looking for serious role-playing I suggest you look            elsewhere, especially if you plan on taking the game online. But as            an ~RPG-Lite~ it's a damn fine game - go pick it up!"}
