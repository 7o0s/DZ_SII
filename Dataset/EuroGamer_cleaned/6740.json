And with support for keyboard and mouse, this needn't be any less significant than its PC forefather, right? Right?            Commandos 2 is a terrifically complex game at the best of times.            You control a pack of commandos, oddly enough, fighting with the            resistance against the evil Nazis. The game is played from an            isometric perspective, and you control each character individually,            using them in tandem to solve problems, outwit guards and complete            mission objectives. On the PC, it was a bloody difficult but            ultimately very satisfying game. On the PS2, the learning curve is            like that cliff Tom Cruise was climbing at the start of Mission:            Impossible 2, and the satisfaction fails to displace the player's            pent up frustration.                             When I realised that there was no keyboard or mouse support in the            PS2 version, I groaned. And I was right to groan, because            relearning such an intricate control system on a totally different            peripheral has cost me several long, arduous, profanity-packed            hours of my life. Even the simplest of things, like switching            between Look and Interaction modes, becomes a chore, and having            utilised every imaginable combination of buttons on the pad,            someone deserves a kicking for not simply allowing frustrated fans            to plug in a keyboard and mouse.                             Another area which has suffered in the transition between PC and            console is the visuals. Of course the PC needed whopping great            resolutions to provide enough detail to really get your head round            Commandos 2, and the PS2 version is lumbered with about half the            sufficient detail. This means that your characters are too small,            and it's often quite possible to lose them in the scenery and only            find them when they start drawing fire from sharp-eyed Nazi            troopers. The camera doesn't help by behaving erratically, and            given how much saving and reloading you'll be doing anyway due to            trial-and-error, this only compounds your misery and frustration. I            know how to complete most of the levels, and yet I found myself            hurling the pad around in disgust on more than one occasion - what            does that tell you?                    It's a shame that Commandos 2 doesn't work as well on the PS2 as it            does on the PC, but then it was never likely to. Graphical            shortcomings and control issues aside, it's a good game, but I            can't imagine anybody wanting to put themselves through the            experience to siphon off the entertainment. As it is, tactical            action fans should buy the PC version or buy something else - this            is a courageous effort, but it doesn't really work on a console."}
