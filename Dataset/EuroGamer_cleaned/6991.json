Most people            will tell you that the sweet spot of the market at the moment is            the GeForce MX, which retails for a smidgeon under a hundred notes            and provides you with all sorts of popular features like            dual-monitor output, Digital Vibrance Control for improved imagery            and the NVIDIA Shading Rasterizer, which incorporates per-pixel            shading to make sure 3D elements look and behave like their            real-life counterparts.                         Others will tell you it's the GeForce 2 GTS. After all, with the            GeForce 3 due to launch at a colossal price, you really ought to            buy something that will last you until Christmas when the market is            reasonable again, at which point you'll want one of them.            And if you're not a fan of Ge-tech, you'll be advised to            seek out the ATI Radeon, which embraces most of the features            hardware gurus have come to know and love, like Transform and            Lighting, at a reasonable price/performance ratio.                         The thing is, whoever you talk to, no-one seems eager to discuss            NVIDIA's ~other~ GPU, the eponymous GeForce 2 Ultra. As the            forerunner to the GeForce 3, the Ultra functions very much like the            TNT2 Ultra - it's fundamentally a spruced up vanilla GeForce 2,            with a higher clock rate, more memory, faster memory and on the            whole a featureset to die for.                         The reasons for the Ultra's lack of popularity are twofold: there            is no demand for it, and it's hideously overpriced. Which is a            shame, because even with only a few weeks to go until NVIDIA's            first big release for quite a while, the Ultra is still top of the            tree.                    When NVIDIA launched the GeForce 2 Ultra, it met with critical            acclaim. Some worshipped it for its performance, others scalded it            for its unreasonable price tag, but rather unfortunately, nobody            bought it. Having tracked down one of the top-line GeForce 2            Ultras, the ELSA Gladiac Ultra, we sought to find out why for            ourselves.                         The first bombshell is that the Ultra's architecture is actually            identical to that of the GeForce 2 GTS. It's not a new card. The            four familiar rendering pipelines happily co-exist, and like the            GTS, the Ultra can process two textures per pipeline per clock. The            difference is that the GPU on the Ultra has been subjected to a            souped up fabrication process that yields chips capable of higher            clock speeds. The core clock speed of the Gladiac Ultra is 250MHz            DDR. The 64Mb of memory on the card is 4ns SDRAM clocked at 460MHz.            In our limited experience with overclocking the Ultra, the memory            reached over 500MHz before imperfections started to manifest            themselves. The memory is covered by ~RAMsinks,~ which help prevent            overheating. The application of these is certainly better than the            rather shoddy job done on the original Hercules 3D Prophet II GTS,            which we felt were rather unhelpful.                         Unlike some Ultra designs, there is no space for a TV/out unit,            nor a DVI output. The board is fairly featureless as Ultras go,            although it does ship with the ~Revelator~ 3D glasses, but these            proved difficult to configure using any of the monitors on our            testbed. Apparently if your monitor isn't amongst those supported,            you can look forward to all sorts of quite literally            headache-inducing trauma getting them up and running. The            Revelators work by fooling your eyes into seeing depth, hence three            dimensions. The effect when we eventually got it running was far            from optimal, but proved an interesting enough diversion for a            rainy afternoon.                    ELSA's drivers are pretty basic - the only reason to install them            at all is to add support for the Revelators, which regrettably            don't work with the reference ~Detonator~ releases from NVIDIA.            Once we'd finished with the Revelators, we exchanged the ELSA            drivers for the Detonator 3s, version 6.50, which are NVIDIA's            currently approved release.                         A point of note here - if you do intend to use the ELSA drivers,            be aware that they restrict a lot of resolutions that you might            want to use. Here on the testing line we tend to go for the            proportionally-correct 1280x960 for everyday use, but the ELSA            drivers lock you down to either 1152x864 or 1280x1024, which            squishes things ever so slightly on the vertical. A minor point for            many, but worth mentioning.                         Anyway, for our tests, we pitted the Ultra against another ELSA            card, the Gladiac 2 GTS, and a competing card, the 64Mb ATI Radeon            DDR, using a 1GHz Athlon and a 750MHz Athlon. However, it's fairly            obvious from our experiences that the GeForce 2 Ultra is the            best-performing card on the market at the moment, so these            benchmarks prove fairly arbitrary.                    One of the things we found most impressive was the Ultra's            performance with FSAA. Using the most load-heavy FSAA options in            800x600 with 32-bit colour, the card turned an incredibly            respectable 60 frames per second in our Quake III benchmark on a            1GHz Athlon. At 1024x768 things got a little hectic, with the rate            dropping to about 35-40 fps, but on the whole the effect was            startling. The image quality that the GeForce 2 Ultra offers is            second to none in the current market.                    Despite the impressive benchmarks and the figure-hugging stats            though, we don't think the GeForce 2 Ultra is worth the money. At            \u00a3350 compared to only \u00a3250 for the Gladiac 2 GTS... the            benchmarks speak for themselves. Can you really justify a mere 15            frames per second extra at 1024x768 for a price hike of \u00a3100?                         The problem for the Ultra is that everybody to whom it should            appeal already owns a good enough graphics card. You really have to            scrape the bottom of the barrel before the Ultra looks like a            viable proposition. People who own TNT2 Ultras and Voodoo3 3500s            could just about warrant the expenditure if they are not prepared            to wait for the GeForce 3 to drop in price, but to anybody who owns            even a GeForce SDR, the cost is absurd. This writer's own personal            GeForce 2 GTS replaced the Ultra a couple of days ago, and in the            games regularly played on this system; Quake III and Half-Life:            Counter-Strike, the difference in performance was negligible.                         The GeForce 2 Ultra serves one purpose - to offer an extremists'            choice in video cards. Like the TNT2 Ultra, it's impossible to            justify the cost based on the performance defecit between the            vanilla GTS and the Ultra, especially with the GeForce 3 merely            weeks away and with so much more to offer than this. If you are            wondering whether to take the plunge now or wait for the GeForce 3,            we implore you to take our advice and wait. The GeForce 3 will            feature an entirely new GPU and judging by the recent            demonstrations with John Carmack of Doom 3, will be the card to own            in the next year. We foresee it being much easier to justify the            extravagance when there is a genuine improvement to speak of, but            with the Ultra, we're looking at a few new stats - nothing more.
