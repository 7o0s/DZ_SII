Thief II is essentially more                 of the same, but as the original was so good that isn't                 necessarily a bad thing...                    Once again you take on the role of the cynical master thief            Garrett, a man with an almost supernatural ability to hide in            shadows, making him all but invisible in darkness.                    The world in which you live has changed though - it is now the            Metal Age, and there is a definite Jules Verne vibe going down.            Steam powered robots clank around, mechanical heads scan for            intruders, and one mission even features a vast submarine which            looks as if it has escaped from ~20,000 Leagues Under The Sea~.                    Led by the fanatical Karas, a new faction called the Mechanists has            risen to power. A radical off-shoot of the religious Hammerites            from the first game, they are responsible for many of the bizarre            new inventions that fill the city, and rather more besides...                    You will also face a corrupt new Sheriff who has decimated the            criminal population and now seems to have it in for you, as well as            running into your old friends the Pagans, who you defeated in the            first game.                    Once again the game's story is pushed along by excellent            cartoon-style cut-scenes between missions, and the plot is as            gripping and labyrinthine as ever, leaving you unsure of who your            friends and enemies really are as it leads you towards a climactic            showdown in an overgrown Mechanist cathedral.         As in the                 original, the emphasis in Thief II is on stealth rather than                 violence, and your arsenal reflects this, although you still                 have arrows, a sword and your trusty blackjack if you feel the                 need to cause some grievous bodily harm.                    Moss arrows spread patches of moss on impact, helping muffle your            footsteps if you have to cross tiles, stone or metal. Water arrows            can put out torches and gas lights to give you more shadows to hide            in. And noisemaker arrows do exactly what it says on the tin,            making them useful for distracting guards with.                    Rope arrows can be fired at wooden surfaces, trailing a length of            rope for you to climb up. Thief II also adds vine arrows, which are            essentially the same but supposedly able to attach themselves to            more surfaces. In practice they don't work very well though, and as            this is the sole new ~weapon~ it's something of a disappointment.                    Luckily there is plenty of new equipment though. You now have a            mechanical eye which allows you to zoom in and take a closer look            at distant objects. There are also ~scouting orbs~ which act as            remote cameras, allowing you to throw out into a room to scope it            out without having to put your head round the door.                    If you need to drop down into a room but are worried about breaking            your legs in the process, there are now ~slow fall potions~. There            are even potions which render you invisible for a few seconds,            which can be useful for getting you past guards in well lit            corridors.         Thief II features fifteen                 massive levels, most of which will take you at least an hour                 to complete even on the easiest skill level. Settings range                 from the surreal maw of chaos to a police headquarters, taking                 in a huge warehouse complex and an archaeological dig along                 the way.                    The missions are varied and interesting, calling on you to plant            evidence, follow a blood trail, kidnap a man, steal antiques from            an art exhibition, and break into a bank vault. There are also            rather less of the shambling undead than in the first game,            although you can still find a selection of skeletons, zombies and            ghosts if you look hard enough.                    Design is generally top-notch and the levels are truly impressive,            even though the graphics are more Rainbow Six than Unreal. Sadly            many of the levels suffer from sloppy texture alignment in places            though, and a few feature magical furniture that floats in mid-air            a foot or more off the ground. I wish I could find some of that at            my local Ikea - it would make cleaning so much easier...                    Rather more attention has been paid to audio cues though, and            guards now have even more things to grumble about. There are also            more Half-Life style scripted events, and you can eavesdrop on            conversations, listen to ghosts, and watch guards hurl abuse at            each other across the roof-tops.         Meanwhile the Dark Engine which                 powers the game has been given a much needed face lift.                 Although it's still hardly state of the art, it does at least                 look presentable now.                    Coloured lighting has been added, and is used to great effect in            several of the levels. Clouds now flit across the sky as rain            drizzles down on you, thanks to a bizarre code transfusion from            Flight Unlimited of all places. There is also fog, though sometimes            it seems to stray into the buildings instead of lingering in the            streets where it belongs.                    The levels are a little less barren and rather more spaceous than            in the first game, and the character models have all been carefully            reconstructed with a higher poly count and new skins to make them            more detailed as well.                    Even the already excellent sound code has been given an update to            introduce support for EAX 2.0 and A3D 2.0, bringing echo and reverb            effects to those of you with recent Creative Labs or Aureal            soundcards.                    Of course, this doesn't all come free, and the system requirements            have risen rather sharply since the first game. You will need a            mid-range Pentium II or better to really make the most of it.         Thief II had some                 mighty big boots to fill, and the good news is that apart from                 a few minor flaws it seems to have largely succeeded.                    At first sight it was rather too similar to the first game for            comfort, sharing most of the weapons and equipment, many of the            character models, and even some of the settings from the first            game. But with more interesting and varied missions, bigger and            more detailed levels, new enemies (and allies), a few new toys to            play with, and some vital tinkering under the bonnet, Thief II            stands on its own merit."}
