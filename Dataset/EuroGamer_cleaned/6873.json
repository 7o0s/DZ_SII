Gothic is a game that took me completely by            surprise, in much the same way that Deus Ex did. I became so            completely immersed in its intricately constructed fantasy world            that I lost all track of time and ignored my body's pleas for food.            The world in question is called Myrtana, and you assume the role of            a convict thrown into a prison colony contained within a magical            barrier. This work camp was founded after the land became ravaged            by marauding orcs, and the prisoners interned there were to mine            ore for the construction of new weapons to defend the kingdom.            However, problems arose during the creation of the magical barrier            and the mages who built it became trapped with the prisoners.            Taking advantage of the fact that nobody could come within the            barrier to collect the ore, the prisoners traded the vital            resources with the king for food, drink, women .. anything they            wanted.                         In-fighting soon drove the colony into rival factions though. The            first of these, the Old Camp, was perfectly happy working with the            king, exchanging ore from the mine for goods. Later a New Camp was            formed by lawless thugs, while other prisoners claimed to be privy            to strange visions and dreams and left to form their own            settlement. The members of this Brotherhood worship an unknown            entity called The Sleeper, which they are convinced is the key to            their freedom.                    When you first enter the game, the depth of the story is not            immediately apparent. You are merely handed a sealed letter which            you are asked to deliver to the mages within the colony, and off            you go. You would be right for feeling daunted in the early stages,            as you aren't presented with any options as such, other than to            explore the vast landscape ahead.                         Getting used to the interface is the first major hurdle, and            Gothic's control set is convoluted and crude. For some reason the            developers decided to opt for an almost completely keyboard-based            command system, and the only mouse control available is to rotate            your character. Even the inventory forces you to use combinations            of keys to shuffle items around - what's wrong with using a            click-and-drag method of interaction? The controls almost ruin the            start of the game, and a new player may be completely put off by            this sloppiness as it renders Gothic an extremely tough game to get            into.                        Having got to grips with the awkward controls and set off on your            journey you come across a few weapons thrown aside - a pickaxe, a            couple of rusty swords - and these come in handy for battling off            your first threats, until later in the game when the opportunity            comes to buy stronger weapons and armour. Unfortunately combat is            also extremely clumsy. Fighting one opponent is hard enough, but            when you've got three bloody huge bird-like creatures hopping            around and pecking at you, you hardly stand a chance, particularly            when you're weak and armourless in the early stages of the game.            There are sidestep keys to aid you in dodging an attack, but having            to use a combination of action and direction buttons to swing your            weapon means that you are usually forced to stand still and flail            your weapon helplessly in the direction of the advancing beastie.                    Once you get moving though and begin to take on tasks and missions            from some of the many inhabitants of the camps, the control            problems are overshadowed by a tremendous character-driven story.                         Your primary goal is to become someone of importance, and this            involves influencing those in the right positions by fulfilling            jobs and carrying out favours for them. These can be as mundane as            searching for ingredients for a chef's broth or delivering a            letter, but other characters you meet have more to offer and in            return can train you in essential skills such as combat and            thievery.                         All of the characters live in a hierarchy, or a network if you            will, and by completing tasks for certain people or factions you            may be stepping on the toes of someone else. Almost all of your            actions have far reaching consequences, and gossip about you will            spread beyond your control. Should you get caught stealing from            someone's hut, for example, not only will you be beaten to within            an inch of your life by the victim (who will then steal your            precious ore and leave you to stagger away with a bloody nose) but            people will soon start to distrust and even fear you. It becomes            essential to build relationships and make friends and enemies if            you are to progress.                    One of the most pleasing aspects of Gothic is the fact that it            doesn't rely too much on established role-playing dynamics. Indeed            it leans more heavily towards adventuring and exploration, which is            why I could draw comparisons with the likes of Deus Ex rather than            other more traditional role-playing games. There aren't huge swamps            of statistics and fantastical mumbo-jumbo to wade through either;            instead the emphasis is on actually getting into the role and            immersing yourself in the world.                         Visually Gothic is a splendid title with just the right level of            eye candy to stop you getting bored with the browns and greens of            your medieval surroundings. The full day and night cycle and            changing weather conditions combine well with the inhabitants'            individual activities and the huge areas available for exploration            to create a completely believable environment in which captives bed            down in huts for the night or sing songs around campfires before            setting off for a day's hunting or mining when the sun rises. The            sound is of a lower standard than the graphics, but the music is            pleasant and sits in the background nicely while the voice acting            .. well .. it'll do.                         Gothic is a game which developers should look to as an example of            how a role-playing adventure should be done. Floating on the            surface of a deep storyline is a superb fa\u00e7ade of            light-hearted humour and adventuring, which is sure to attract less            hardcore genre fans. The only real gripe is with the primitive            interface, and had this received more attention it would have been            a marked improvement on an already tremendous title."}
