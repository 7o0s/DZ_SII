F1 2002 fares better than the lamentable 2002 FIFA World            Cup did earlier this year, but then we prefer bouncing a ball            against the radiator in the front room to playing that game.            F1 2002 is certainly not decrepit, and it's beyond competent, but            is it beyond its competition? In a word: no.                         Upon firing up F1 2002, the most obvious thing to do is hop into a            car and race around your favourite F1 venues, and thanks to the            ubiquitous Quick Race option you can do just that, with            Silverstone, Hockenheim and Monza available from the get-go.            Achieve a top six finish in the four-lap exhibition and you can            unlock more circuits, and this gives you a nice grounding for the            rest of the game.                         A better introduction is provided by the excellent Challenge mode,            which teaches you the basics, the moderately difficult stuff and            the things that make modern F1 drivers cringe, with gold, silver            and bronze Gran Turismo 3 style ratings dependent on your            performance. You may find yourself cruising through the first few            tasks, but then starting off, braking and simple cornering aren't            exactly rocket science - even my unwieldy Volvo can manage those.            When asked to handle chicanes and hairpins though, one requires a            bit of instruction, and the demands of dry and wet weather            conditions and pit stop protocol are certainly in need of some            explanation. F1 2002 does a good job and takes things a few steps            further, introducing you to advanced features like damage control,            oil leaks, how to employ manual transmission and even when and how            the various penalties and flag warnings apply.                    Once you emerge from boot camp you should be fully equipped to deal            with the 17 circuits, but applying your newfound skills is more            difficult than simply peering down the track ahead of you. With            this in mind, EA has included detailed flybys of each circuit to            case every turn and nuance of the courses, which as you might            expect are authentic right down to the colour of the tarmac. This            wealth of detail is impressive throughout, and the game makes a            meal of the whole race weekend tradition, with practice sessions            followed by qualifying sessions on Friday and Saturday, and then            warm-up laps and the full race on Sunday, complete with busty            models prowling the pits and a roaring crowd of spectators.                         This detail is reflected in the graphical side of the game too,            which is mostly good with a smattering of bad. As you would expect            from EA, the cars are all perfect replicas of their 2002 season            counterparts, and circuits likewise are beautifully modelled and            detailed. The real highlight though, as with the likes of Moto GP            and Wave Race Blue Storm, is the presence of Mother Nature, with            rain batting down at an angle throughout, while raindrops settle on            the windscreen and refract your view of the world. It's not            torrential, nor unrealistic, but it can transform a relatively            sedate spectacle into something more challenging. Cars obviously            receive damage, and the game can cope with pretty much any part of            the vehicle giving up the ghost and falling off, and the fact that            there are gameplay implications with every splinter makes all the            difference.                    Despite a strong showing so far though, F1 2002 suffers at the            hands of incessant slowdown, which persistently punctuates            high-speed encounters on tracks like Imola and Monaco, and cuts            through the tension and realism like Michael Schumacher through a            Silverstone tyre wall. Sounds are good, with roaring engines and            splintering metal, and although there's no official commentary we            reckon we would have hated it anyway, so that's no big loss.            However, whirring and revving can't make up for a jerky product.                         The depth of F1 2002 tries to return to its rescue, and as you            flee the shuddering track in search of a little repair or            refuelling, the pits come to life. This is an area of true strength            for EA; you can simply duck in and out again, just as you can            enable assisted cornering, traction and braking, but this leaves            you with a flawed arcade racer, so the advanced simulation features            come as a relief. Here you can tweak tyre pressure, wing angles,            brake bias, gear box ratios and all sorts of other things, and the            game even tells you why you should or shouldn't. Unlike Grand Prix            3, which can be overwhelmingly detailed, F1 2002 makes a strong            argument for ~almost realism~.                         Sadly though, almost realism turns out to be less than you might            hope for. With all its optional assists, EA has created a pretty            good on-the-rails arcade racer, and for those in search of more            than just turns and crashes, it's a competent enough simulation as            well, but F1 2002 is surpassed by the ageing Grand Prix 3 in both            respects, and the much anticipated sequel from Geoff Crammond is            due out on Xbox this summer, with the PC version already available.                    F1 2002 lets you tone down the realism, but then so does GP3, and            GP3's on-the-rails racer is effectively more realistic and more fun            than its counterpart here. Similarly, you can go for the most            possible realism with no cog left untweaked, but where F1 2002 lets            you play with the brake bias, GP3 practically invites you to            redesign the braking system. EA picked the wrong fight here, and            even the 2002 season date with the Toyota team and proper,            life-like vehicles can't save it, because most would argue that F1            has got progressively less exciting anyway, so the older the data,            the better!                         It's also a little sad to see EA hiding the advanced features            behind the Gran Turismo style tutorial mode, because it's not a            piece of cake to finish, and it does mask some of the best elements            of the game. I feel the need to be equally disparaging in my            assessment of the AI, too. It's good, but not without fault (a            pretty accurate description of the game as a whole), and most            drivers are apparently programmed to cause problems for themselves            to simulate driver error. The fact that I never found myself too            far off the pace to recoup my position was also a shame, but then            the fact that I could overtake easily at all could be considered            unrealistic...                         There is some added value to consider in the shape of the            multiplayer mode, with up to four player split-screen racing, but            trying to render four times the action on one screen when the game            couldn't even handle it reliably the once makes the whole thing            resemble a slide show.                    Ultimately, what it all boils down to is this: in playing F1 2002,            you can simulate F1 to the nth degree, and the high standards of            presentation and authenticity are important gimmicks, but as            anybody in F1 will tell you, you can't give the opposition            anything. In Geoff Crammond and his team, EA's competition is the            proverbial Michael Schumacher of the circuit, and in the end,            Michael doesn't make mistakes, and F1 2002 makes plenty."}
