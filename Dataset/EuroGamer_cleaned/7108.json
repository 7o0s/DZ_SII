Anyone familiar with the genre will feel instantly at home. There            is the disparate group of brawlers, the cute little girls, the            buxom wenches and the muscle bound brutes. Each pilots their            building sized mech, which in the case of one Polin & Bolon,            really is made of several buildings, and a boat, and a bus amongst            other things!                    It will be a while and a lot of fights before the newcomer works            out the bewildering array of moves, countermoves and combos. Even            then, fights can take place and you will wonder just how the result            came about.             Capcom having taken to renaming                 the buttons on your game pad and cluttering the screen with as                 many meters, gauges and icons as it could muster. There are                 gauges to register armour strength, damage and a special gauge                 for those extra special attacks that can be unleashed at key                 moments.                         The 3D playfield is thankfully unobtrusive; it is actually little            more than window dressing, backgrounds being little more than            static and interactive scenery a handy source of power ups and            additional weapons. The game is played in either story or challenge            mode. The former wraps short story episodes around each fight and            establishes new characters, the latter is much the same without the            offbeat antics of the over amorous contestants.                         The former is where this reviewer headed to first, playing as the            already mentioned Polin & Bolon. Is it possible to determine a            person's character from whom they gravitate towards? I hope not. A            small pink haired girl with helium enhanced vocals and a heart            emblazoned dress, he can assure everyone, not his preference and            further still from any personal likeness, honest. [Nobody's            convinced Chris! -Tom]             Points scored during each battle are amassed from fight to fight            and can be used in the development room to unlock the many hidden            items and extras, including mini VMU games, new characters and more            besides. Such is the size and breadth of the development room and            its many sub rooms, more time could easily be spent playing with            new discoveries than actually fighting.                    Capcom have hardly revolutionized the beat em up genre with this            new installment, but since when was revolution part of the deal?            What they have done is produced a well polished videogame, the            presentation is slick and reminiscent of the anime that makes it            way out of Japan.                         It could be argued that the last thing the Dreamcast needs now is            yet another beat em up. But as this comes from the most prolific            developer in the genre, and surprisingly, doesn't feature their            most famous intellectual property, some extra attention is due.                         Tech Romancer makes a worthy addition to anyone's videogame            library, its solid game play and quirky humour are a good antidote            to the usual po-faced beat em ups of late.                        - Out Now"}
