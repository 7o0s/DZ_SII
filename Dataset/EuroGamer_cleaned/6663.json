So it should come as no            surprise to see a new 'franchise' appear that attempts to carve            itself a slice of this lucrative worldwide market.                    The star of the game is a chirpy, matey, cuddly Tiger from            Tasmania, called - you're ahead of me here - Ty. And he's on of            those 'heroes' that you just know has gone through countless focus            groups over recent years as the creative committee attempted to            conjure one of those gaming characters that's cute enough appeal to            as broad a gaming 'demographic' as possible; non threatening,            adorable, but with 'attitude'. Argh. And our hero has the            unenviable task of reclaiming five Talismans from across the gaming            world for some hardly worth repeating reason.        To give you            a flavour of what it's like to play, just try and imagine the kind            of 3D platformer that a creative committee would come up with. Give            yourself a minute or two. Maybe grab a pen and paper and jot down            five games you'd choose as inspiration and a few features that            you'd have in them, and you won't be a million miles away from the            game that is Ty The Tasmanian Tiger, one of the games keeping the            nation's charts warm this Christmas sales period. So, yes. You            collect items, negotiate platforms, run, jump, swim, and kill            numerous baddies in all the familiar ways. But all voiced by one of            the most irritatingly unendearing voiceovers in videogaming            history. It's almost damned before you even start. Almost.                    Normally we'd take one look at a game like this and be so bored at            its utter vacuousness within seconds that we'd be unable to prevent            ourselves zoning in on the PS2's eject button. But given that it's            the quietest time of the year for new releases, and that it's been            selling in worryingly high numbers, our curiosity was aroused. And            after all, we're not afraid to admit that we love a bit of spangly,            childish platform fun. Some of our favourite games of the past 12            months have come from this overused, much abused genre, including            Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and of course Super Mario            Sunshine. To put it mildly, EA has some heavyweight competition.                    As we've already mentioned, the voiceovers are bad. Not just            because of the whiny Tasmanian accents that make a Brummie accent            seem an appealing choice, but because the characters are so            hatefully scripted and generic that you'd be hard pressed to stop            yourself from screaming fouled mouthed abuse straight back at the            TV. They're so inoffensively offensive; any attempt to feel            something other than contempt is futile. But no doubt the            developers would scream indignantly ~But it's not made for you~.            And that may well be true, but that doesn't stop us giggling            inanely at every Pixar movie ever made. It's just bad. Bad            characters, bad script, bad voices. Surely the game itself can't be            as bad?        Fortunately            for EA, Krome Studios hasn't made a bad fist of making a platform            game. It hasn't made a good fist of it either; it's just somewhere            between the two that avoids being completely terrible by borrowing            lots of things that made other games in the genre really good.                    Its most obvious inspiration is the utterly sublime Jak &            Daxter - a game we appreciate even more, a year down the line.            Although it never gets anywhere near close to matching it for            technological prowess, much, if not all of J&D's mission            structures have been borrowed - no make that copied to the letter.            In fact the more we think about it, the more it's painfully obvious            that Krome spent much of the design stage of this game realising            that J&D had a ton going for it. So, in Ty, we get to run            around picking up Opals (instead of eggs), of which there are 300            per level to seek out, five of Ty's 'Bilby mates' to rescue            (instead of spirits), and eight Thunder Eggs per level (instead of            orbs), as well as 10 Golden Cogs. Honestly it's a kleptomaniacs            dream. And as with J&D, Ty comes across a few characters every            level, which have some spurious task for you to achieve in exchange            for a Thunder Egg. Likewise sub games break up the proceedings, so            you'll find yourself racing head to head or other fun interludes            that help break up the regular platforming action.                    But unlike its illustrious rival, there's nothing going on in the            technology area to keep seasoned gamers marvelling. The levels are            based around the old fashioned 'portal' system, so the need to load            in every level is blatantly apparent - and in no way comparable to            the impressive 'no load' system that Naughty Dog so skilfully            pioneered. And not only that, the graphics, while not bad, are not            standard setting. It's all very colourful, cute, bright, and            functional, but never anything more than that. It looks rushed and            cheap next to any of its rivals, and when you're a newcomer to the            scene, the engine is the one area that you need to impress a            discerning audience with.        The controls, unsurprisingly, make no            attempt to bring anything new to the proceedings. The movement is            directed by the left stick, with cameras controlled by the right            stick. The main four buttons take care of jumping, firing, biting            and activating, while the shoulder buttons add extra functions            including switching to a first person targeting view to dispatch            those awkward beasts easily. There's not much to criticise here,            apart from the camera's tendency to wrestle control from you,            'helpfully', but that's the perennial bugbear of any 3D platformer            - Ty is no worse an offender than any other, but it's certainly            worth pointing out it's another area that will get on your nerves.                    Despite Ty being one of the most generic, formulaic games we've            ever seen, its thievery of the Jak & Daxter mission structure            makes it a much more compelling prospect than you could possibly            expect, given all the obvious lack of inspiration on display. The            obsessive compulsive kleptomaniac in us just couldn't help but want            to explore the vast sprawling maps within the game. There's            something cruelly satisfying in clearing stuff up within games that            we're sure only Freud could explain, and despite our better            judgement, we could barely stop being so foolishly addicted to even            write this review!                    But that's probably a bit like a tidy minded refuse collector            getting job satisfaction from taking a leaf sweeping job on the            side. You know it's pointless, you know there will be more leaves            in the morning to wreck all your good work, but there you are,            trudging around clearing more mess up, for no good reason at all.                    And if that still sounds entertaining to you, then good luck to you            and Ty. You truly deserve one another. The rest of us will get            along just fine with dozens of other much better games, thanks.
