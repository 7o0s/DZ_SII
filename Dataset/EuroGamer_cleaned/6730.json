Almost every one of our SNES favourites has appeared or is in transit, and with a few exceptions, they haven't changed much. Of course some games have - Mario Kart being the prime example - but in the case of games like Disney's Magical Quest, changes are negligible, and to be completely honest, they weren't terribly good in the first place.            The real reason Disney's Magical Quest exists at all on GBA is its            big brother, Disney's Magical Mirror. This original Cube title from            Capcom will partner up with its little brother to some end, but as            neither game is going to brush shoulders with Mario for the            platforming crown, this isn't too important. Magical Quest is a            simple six-level platformer with a number of sub-sections in the            oldest of old school traditions. Mickey races around these levels            bopping bad guys on the head and negotiating platforms, bosses and            various, mercifully brief sections of plot. One change from the            original formula here is the option to use Minnie - a totally            superficial change, mind.                           The plot is the usual platform dross, and because it's Disney it's            simple enough to make sense to the kids. This is no Kingdom Hearts.            Pluto has been stolen by the evil Emperor Pete, and Mickey has to            go and get him back. Along the way he becomes steadily more magical            with the assistance of an old wizard, and his costume and abilities            change accordingly. Later on, for example, Mickey can fire magic            bolts out of his fingertips and latch onto platforms with a hook,            but to begin with it's simple bop, bop, bopping along without much            imagination or variation.                    That's not to say the design is bad, it's just so-so. You            bop enemies on the head and throw them at others, you use special            propeller fruit to climb into the skies, you ride boulders across            beds of thorns, and you head-bop bosses who zip around the screen            until they dissipate into nothing and lead you onto the next            section. And in an unfortunate blow, the GBA port has a few            annoying leap-of-faith moments right from the get-go - a harsh            situation given the game's audience, and harsher still given its            die-and-start-over approach. Falling through a gap you couldn't see            off the bottom of the screen is unfair.                           In order to try and spice up proceedings, Capcom has included four            mini-games for single player and link play, but these seem to have            been an afterthought and suffer accordingly. Each game is based on            one of Mickey's special abilities, and challenge Mickey to race to            the top of a steep climb or something like that. Playing in            multiplayer is possible on one cart - a good move - but the actual            gameplay is tedious and uninspired, and what's worse, you have to            turn the GBA off and on again to change game!                    The GBA has had its fair share of clangers, and a large number of            the almost-good. Disney's Magical Quest falls into the latter            category, and it's a shame, because if started afresh, Capcom could            have done something interesting with this. Sadly, it was a three or            four-hour long adventure with little to add to the platform stable            when it was a SNES title, and as a port it ranks amongst the            mediocre and the unremarkable."}
