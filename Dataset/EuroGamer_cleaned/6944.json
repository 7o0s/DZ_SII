Like            your fellow workers, you don't exactly view this as a dream            occupation, and the cramped work and living quarters do little to            keep you happy. Enter the eponymous Red Faction, a rebellious            uprising of your mining colleagues led by the mysterious Eos which            seeks to usurp power from the evil corporation that enslaves the            miners, from the Cohaagen-like figures at the top right down to the            security staff.                        Once you've broken free of your shackles you take part in the            uprising, arming yourself to the teeth and fighting for your            freedom. As you advance so does the plot, in a round about way, and            rather like Half-Life steady sequences of action are punctuated by            impressive encounters with larger entities. Volition deserves some            kudos here for not simply tailing things off with a marginal boss            encounter, since there is plenty of longevity in here and a fair            amount of nail-biting combat sequences.                    Unlike Half-Life though (and certainly unlike Total Recall) this            red planet adventure grips you only sporadically, and as you            progress there are a lot of occasions when you think ~this must be            it~, only to discover that there is a huge chunk of the game still            to be played. Red Faction isn't the sort of game where you're            looking for an excuse to put it down though. If you aren't gripped            by the story 100% of the time, the action will fill in the blanks.                    The much vaunted Geo-Mod technology is an excellent addition to the            formula, and really does mean that virtually every wall is            destructible in some way. Put simply, Geometric Modification (or            Geo-Mod to its friends) means that things get wrecked in real time.            Everything you have ever wanted to do in a first person shooter is            now possible. You can shoot the root of a lonely stalactite and            watch it crash menacingly to the ground, you can shoot holes in an            aquaduct carrying molten rock and let it pour down dynamically,            engulfing a pair of guards, or you can simply blows holes in things            to reveal shortcuts, secret items or little camp-worthy cubby            holes.                        Geo-Mod also gives players a choice in their adventures. There are            some ~find the key, open the door~ type puzzles, but a less            painstaking Parker can simply whip out his rocket launcher (with            thermal imaging target system) and blow a hole in the wall right            next to it. This is particularly entertaining when you get hold of            the Rail Driver, which boasts an infra-red zoom rather like the            railgun seen in another Arnie film, Erazer. Using the enhanced            sights you can pick out an enemy on the other side of a wall and            put a piece of supersonic metal through him. Quite compelling.                        Another set of toys you will want to get acquainted with is the            selection of vehicles strewn around Red Faction. Things like a            hoverpad, a drilling machine, a jeep with an independently            controlled machinegun turret, and even a submarine pop up along the            way, and players will get the chance to try them all out. They're            great fun to fight against, but even more amusing to direct against            your enemies.                    As you approach the latter stages of the game though, precision            becomes just as important as power, and your remote charges and            other tools become vital. Which unfortunately highlights one of the            games flaws, which is the control system. Using the Dual Shock            controller is tricky, my main issue being the juggling of two            analogue sticks as you try to remember what they both do. Binding            R1 to fire is useful since it's like a trigger, but it doesn't come            all that intuitively for some reason.                        The bottom line is that although it is perfectly possible to            complete Red Faction using the controller, you know as an            experienced PC games player that things would be much easier if you            had used a keyboard and a mouse. Sadly Volition hasn't even            included the option to introduce a keyboard and mouse to the            proceedings. Inexcusable? Nearly. This does at least mean that            there is something of a level playing field in the game's            multiplayer mode though.                        Speaking of which, multiplayer is a bit of a mixed bag - more            exciting than TimeSplitters multiplayer, but with its own ups and            downs. The weapons selection is a bit too top heavy, and someone            with a rail driver is always going to beat the bloke with a            shotgun, because he doesn't even have to be in the same room to            kill him\u2026 This certainly leads to some interesting matches,            because as you gormlessly prance about, desperate to avoid the            attentions of your mate in the rail driver room, he can scratch            that itch on his head while he dispatches you one-handed without so            much as getting behind cover.                    Despite its drawbacks and the lack of a three or four player mode            though, Red Faction multiplayer is a delicate souffl\u00e9 of            action with some astounding attention to detail. The bots boast            impressive path-finding AI and are quite a challenge on the medium            difficulty levels, and the deathmatch maps are actually very good.            Geo-Mod can be brought into play and makes a big difference,            particularly in manned battles, giving you the chance to do things            like blowing a chunk out of a platform which your opponent is            racing across. Meanwhile secret rooms usually harbour the rail            driver or another particularly vicious implement of mass            destruction, and camping is never an option, since you know full            well that a little thermal imaging from your opponent can reduce            you to toast!                        Visually, Red Faction is a perfect demonstration of the PS2            hardware. I've never seen so many shades of red in a single            environment before - the textures and interiors of the various            locations are wonderfully vivid. And Red Faction has the enviable            honour of being the first console game in a long while not to just            paste, repeat, paste, repeat ad nauseam when it comes to colouring            a corridor, doing a remarkable job of staving off that ~another            bloody tunnel~ feeling which I suspected it would propagate. The            computer generated movie sequences that fit in between action            segments are also well animated and, although I wouldn't describe            them as perfect, the character models and animations are quite            nicely done, even if their faces are rather elongated.                    Ironically though, the biggest problem Red Faction faces is its big            brother, the PC version of the game. When it eventually hits the            streets (some time in September according to THQ), it will boast            everything we have seen here coupled with a PC control system. This            defeats one of the key purposes of a killer app; to sell whatever            system the game is delivered on. If Red Faction for the PC can do            everything here with a proper control system and online            multiplayer, who's going to care about the PS2 version?                        Potential buyers only need to ask themselves one question, can they            put up with a Dual Shock driven control system? If the answer to            that is yes, then Red Faction is an absolute must-have. Otherwise,            you might want to wait for the PC version in September. Either way,            Volition's shooter is arguably the best first person shooter to            grace console screens ever.                        -        Red                    Faction PC PreviewRed                    Faction PC Preview"}
