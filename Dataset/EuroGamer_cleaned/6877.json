Platform games are a tired concept and            its all too easy for developers to knock them out for the GBA            without batting an eyelid, casting aside any thought for concept,            innovation or design. Thankfully then Nintendo have bucked the            trend admirably with Wario Land 4.                         The story sees Wario heading off to a recently discovered golden            pyramid containing untold riches which have of course attracted the            attention of our greedy anti-hero. So this is basically the excuse            you get for leaping about in jungles and lava-filled caverns            collecting coins and jumping on the heads of a cast of meandering            adversaries. The sacred pyramid acts as a hub for each of the            game's levels and is separated into six sections of four levels,            plus boss rooms for each section. It's not a case of simply running            through a level and moving on to the next though, there is a twist            on the usual mechanics of the genre.                         Wario must locate four gem pieces throughout each level in order            to unlock a door to the next, then leap on a switch to open a            portal back to the pyramid. Jumping on the switch also triggers a            timer, and you need to get back to the portal, often on the other            side of the level, as quickly as possible. This shifting of pace            offers the game a great sense of dynamics and intensity that hasn't            really been seen before. Naturally you are also able to pick up            coins during your exploits and, as well as being able to buy your            way into the sub-games with them, you can also buy items in a shop            in order to aid your battle against each boss.                    Wario Land 4 is aesthetically quite simple and doesn't come close            to pushing the GBA to its limits, especially when you square it up            against the likes of Rayman Advance. However, what the title lacks            in superficial eye candy, it certainly makes up for in sheer            imagination and intriguing design. While it isn't exactly            groundbreaking (there's only so far you can go with platform games            after all), it pushes the boundaries with the aid of some frankly            ingenious level design and problem-solving concepts. Wario doesn't            just run and jump, you see; when he comes into contact with various            enemies, his form shifts slightly to momentarily give you a new            ability. For example, if a wasp stings him, Wario's head bloats and            he begins floating upwards until he touches a surface, allowing you            to access higher areas of the level and giving him the ability to            drop from a great height through surfaces that are otherwise            unbreakable.                         There are ten different states for Wario to get into besides his            neutral form, such as setting him on fire to burn through walls or            turning him into a zombie to dissolve through floors. These all            lend a strategic element to your progress through the levels and            the design facilitates a great deal more thought about your            approach than your average run-of-the-mill platformer. This is also            apparent in the breakable areas of levels; often huge masses of            scenery are made up of breakable blocks and it takes careful            consideration of how to go about your progress as opposed to            blindly smashing your way through, which will usually result in            hindrance.                         Your persistence in the main platforming sections is rewarded with            the ability to buy entry into three mini-games which are intended            to pad out the action slightly. With the coins you collect during            your adventure you can pay a princely sum to have a go at these            frankly weak efforts to momentarily sidetrack you from the main            game. Wario Roulette is a kind of photo-fit game, where you need to            match pieces of a face to a picture you're shown beforehand. The            Wario Hop sees you leaping over obstacles whilst rolling along on a            barrel, and finally there's Home Run Derby where you turn the GBA            on its side, and have to hit as many home runs as possible when a            pitcher, ahem, tosses his balls at you (sorry).                    Although things can begin to grate in the later stages of the game,            the level design is mostly superb and the gameplay offers an            interesting and fun take on the genre. Wario Land 4 is an            above-average stab at progressing the genre whilst maintaining            Nintendo's platform pedigree. It's nice to see such innovation and            clever design in this notoriously stale area, and you could do a            lot worse than to pick up a copy for when you need a little light            gaming relief."}
