Asheron's Call is            the latest to arrive in this God-forsaken land (aka England),            having proven to be a big success in the USA over the last few            months.                    Like so many games of this type, Asheron's Call is set in a            mysterious fantasy world of swords and sorcery, in this case called            Dereth. Basic gameplay consists of wandering around killing things            and looting their corpses, gaining money and experience as you go.                    And while there might not be any of the usual array of pointy-eared            tree-huggers, most of the fantasy cliches are present and correct -            magical swords, flowing robes, platemail armour, and a range of            hostile humanoids that could easily be mistaken for orcs, trolls            and goblins if you didn't know better...                    Despite the high goblin factor though, the selection of monsters in            the game is wide and generally very imaginative, making a            refreshing change from the usual fantasy stables. Armoredillos are            spiny creatures that roll along the ground at a frightening pace,            acting like biological circular saws. Shreths are a nightmare cross            between a rottweiler and a gorilla, and about as friendly.                    And there are also some rather less lethal creatures inhabiting the            world, including vast numbers of rabbits that make easy, if rather            unrewarding, prey for newcomers to the game.         What really sets                 Asheron's Call apart from other online RPGs though is that the                 world you are inhabiting is highly dynamic.                    At the end of the public beta test last year the entire world was            destroyed in a hail of fire, and then in January Dereth was covered            in snow. Spring saw the snow retreating back to the mountains,            flowers covered the plains, and the rabbits started to breed like            .. well, rabbits. A magical bridge appeared spanning a river in the            north of Dereth, and giant spires rose out of the ground to hover            eerily in mid-air near several towns, abducting passing adventurers            to question them.                    New events begin every month, meaning that there is always            something new for even the most experienced players. Combine this            with the truly vast scale of the game world and the variety of            monsters, weapons, equipment, and spells, and the game rapidly            becomes highly addictive, swallowing entire evenings as you try to            raise your character by another level, reach a nearby town, or save            up enough money to buy that platemail breastplate you've had your            eye on all week.                    The game is also frequently patched, fixing any remaining game            balance issues and adding new features. Recently melee combat has            been changed to make pursuing monsters easier, several monsters            have been given a face-lift, and coloured lighting support has been            added to make the dungeons in particular look far more atmospheric.                    Of course, this does mean that you find yourself downloading            megabytes of new data every month before you can enter the game,            but the whole process is automated, and even on a modem it doesn't            take too long.         Asheron's Call is powered by an impressive 3D                 graphics engine that allows for vast open areas filled with                 rolling hills, forests, snow-clad mountains and ancient ruins,                 and you can play the game from either an ~in eyes~ first                 person view, or a fully adjustable third person view which you                 can zoom and rotate around your character.                    The skies are beautiful, with clouds drifting lazily overhead and            the sun and moons shining down on you. The game sports a full day            and night cycle, so you can sit on a hillside and watch the sun set            over the ocean as the sky explodes into a spectacular twilight of            reds and golds. If you're that way inclined.                    Monsters look detailed even up close, although some of the game's            older models can be a little blocky at times. Player models reflect            the clothes and armour the character is wearing and the weapon they            are carrying, giving you a quick visual indication of their likely            power and career. And although the basic player model is the same,            the range of skin and hair colours and facial features available            helps prevent the game looking like two-for-the-price-of-one day at            the local cloning center.                    Towns are filled with shops and NPCs to trade with, and are often            swarming with other players during peak hours. Even on a relatively            modest computer the game remains playable during rush hour, though            your frame rate can drop off if the crowds get too much.                    When overcrowding becomes a real problem, the game triggers a            ~portal storm~ to disperse the crowd, randomly teleporting people            away from the area if they don't leave voluntarily after a while.            This can be annoying if you're just trying to do the weekly            shopping, but it does mean that the servers and your own computer            don't get too overloaded.         Of course no game is                 perfect, and Asheron's Call is no exception. Although the                 outdoors scenery is truly stunning, dungeons tend to be a                 little blocky and derivative, although the recent coloured                 lighting patch has made them rather more atmospheric.                    Combat is rather hit and miss, particularly in a chaotic melee,            where selecting the right target can be difficult at times. Lag            doesn't help either, and sometimes monsters seem to be attached to            the end of a bungee rope, sliding towards and away from you as your            computer tries to work out where they really are.                    Unfortunately the servers are currently all based in Seattle on the            west coast of America, and there are no plans as yet to set up new            ones here in Europe. Hopefully if the game takes off over here            Microsoft will relent, although the game is still perfectly            playable even with a second or more of lag, largely thanks to the            fairly basic combat system.                    With a huge dynamic world to explore, a wide range of monsters to            kill, a constantly evolving storyline, thousands of other players            to interact with, and an impressive array of weapons, equipment,            and spells to collect, Asheron's Call is definitely a winner.                    The game is truly vast, and without taking up another five pages I            can barely scratch the surface of it with this review. I haven't            told you about the magic system that makes spells less powerful the            more times you and your fellow players use them. Or the political            system that allows you to pledge allegiance to other players and            help build vast in-game clans, some of which now have literally            hundreds of members.                    Or the player killer server, perfect for the more bloodthirsty            elements amongst us. Or the flexible skills system that allows you            to create fully customisable characters instead of just sticking to            the stereotypical preset classes. Or...                    Asheron's Call is probably the best massively multiplayer RPG            currently available, and if you have the time and money to put into            it you won't be disappointed.
