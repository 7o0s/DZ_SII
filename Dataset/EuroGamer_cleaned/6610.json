The concept in itself isn't a bad one; after            all, not everyone has the time, the skill, or the energy required            to become competent at Pro Evo. A pick up and play equivalent would            seem like a worthy aim, apart from the fact that since the series            made its PS2 debut back in the latter part of 2000 it has served            only to highlight the yawning gulf in class between PES and ISS.            Add to that the sudden return to form of FIFA, and suddenly Konami            has much to do to compete. Third time lucky, perhaps?                    Despite PES' obvious gameplay depth and brilliance, it features            possibly the worst presentation of any modern videogame. It's as if            Konami is doing it on purpose. Oddly, it seems to have saved all of            its efforts to spring clean ISS, and from the word go ISS3 creates            the right impression with an impressively clean, intuitive front            end that puts PES to shame. Shame that Konami has to spoil the            effect by continuing to commission tone-deaf monkeys to provide the            audio, with a buttock-clenchingly cringeworthy intro tune that had            us laughing long and hard into the night. Keep it up Konami; one            day someone will induct the composers into a videogame Hall Of            Shame. There's twisted humour at work here, surely.        Another small but            important addition to the latest ISS is the FIFPro license,            allowing Konami to finally include real player names for over 90            teams. No more Oranges 007, or rip off data disks, or torturous            editing to give the teams any sense of credibility. You can still            edit, should you wish to, but at least the team line-ups now            closely resemble real life - at least in name terms. The player            avatars vary from the passing resemblance of the likes of David            Beckham, to the puzzling (almost everyone else). It's hardly a            major issue to pull ISS3 up on, but it would be nice if a publisher            went to the same lengths as EA to make things at least look            convincing.                    The animation is nowhere near the standard of PES or FIFA, and            therefore the range, flexibility and unpredictability of moves is            restricted accordingly. While stringing passes and flowing moves            across the pitch is far more straightforward, the game quickly            becomes a comparatively straightforward affair. Scoring goals is            certainly a whole lot easier. Within a couple of games we were            routinely bagging at least six goals a game between us - a far cry            from the endless, scoreless efforts that you experience when you            first cluelessly pick up PES. Quick passing attacks were possible            with the minimum of fuss, whether down the flanks or via neat            midfield play. This might appeal to those frustrated by the endless            bobbling realism of PES, but anyone with experience of footy games            will start to pine for the more progressive approach of ISS'            brother. It just feels like playing footy in a straightjacket. Or            like how footy games were a few years back, except with flashier            visuals.                    Attacking is certainly straightforward, but that's mainly down to            the fact that defending is made all the more difficult by some            over-zealous refereeing. Almost every single sliding tackle is            punished with a card, while the opposition gets away with cheating            time and again. This inability to usefully employ the hard tackle            (except as a last resort) means the opposition players can easily            run rings around you, especially as the conservative tackle            requires you to be virtually on top of your opponent to stand a            chance of winning the ball back.        There are a few            interesting additions to ISS3, however. Chief of these innovations            is the Close Up mode, which allows the attacking player to switch            into a blurry slow-mo mode once you're near the penalty area by            pressing L1 when it flashes up on the screen. At this point, the            camera pans in directly behind your player, and gives you a few            moments to pull off a special move with R2, be it a feint or spin,            allowing you to slip past the defender and bear in on goal. Midway            introduced a similar system in its scandalously underrated Red Card            last year, but the effect is nowhere near as impressive here, and            more than a little confusing to master to begin with.                    Certain key players allegedly have distinct capabilities, such as            being able to spray defence splitting balls, or being dead ball            specialists. On the latter subject, the taking of corners and free            kicks proves to be the usual lottery - and a massive step back from            ISS2. When will a developer come up with a decent system that            actually works? Wishful thinking, perhaps? In ISS3 it starts            off confusingly and even several hours later you're almost better            off not even bothering. Ho hum.                    One neat addition, however, is the new Mission Mode, which gives            players a series of challenges to overcome, ranging from            straightforward ~beat the opposition with just seven players on the            pitch~ to more tricky tasks such as scoring a free kick. Success in            these missions awards the player with a set number of points,            although it would have been nice to be rewarded for scoring more            goals: a one goal victory is deemed enough. Once you've accumulated            enough points, these eventually result in the unlocking of new            content and options. It's certainly a novel feature and proves            extremely challenging, but it can't hide the failings of the core            of the game.                    Even the commentary - always good for some unintentional comedy -            fails to lift the game out of its trough. John Champion and Mark            Lawrenson burble away, but it's repetitive, banal, uninformative,            and often just plain wrong.                    It's not that ISS3 is a bad game by any means. KCE Osaka tries hard            to inject something extra to the package, but in the end there will            be very few people who could look you in the eye and tell you to            buy this over PES 2. Even the most fearsome, EA Sports-bashing            bounder couldn't claim that ISS3 was a better arcade-tinged footy            title. Apart from the rather inspired mission mode, the whole            package just lacks in almost every area when held up against its            many rivals.                    In the post match analysis, ISS3 neither looks anything special,            nor has the flair to captivate you with its gameplay depth. It's a            respectable game, and you wouldn't be devastated if you were bought            this as a present, but it does little to justify itself as a            companion title to PES. If you really want a companion title to            PES2, just buy FIFA 2003, seriously.        ISS3 screenshots (PC)                ISS3 screenshots (PC)"}
