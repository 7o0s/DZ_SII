Obviously seeing a prime opportunity to make a bit of            extra cash on the back of this tremendous success, EA have seen fit            to furnish fans with the Road to Rome expansion pack - can it            successfully pick up where DiCE left off with the original BF1942,            or is it more of a pathetic stumble in a vague forward kind of            direction?        The original set of maps included with            BF1942 haven't aged particularly - the experience is still just as            exhilarating as it was on release, perhaps even more so with the            tweaks introduced by the recent patch. The single player game has            become a legitimate and worthwhile feature with the introduction of            some semblance of intelligence in the AI controlled soldiers, small            arms have an actual use these days, you can't be sniped with a            machine gun from hundreds of feet away any more, and everybody is            generally happy. So what are we getting with Road to Rome that            makes it a worthwhile purchase, when we're quite happy with what            we've got?                    Well, EA's official feature list says it all: six new maps from the            Sicilian and Italian campaigns. Eight new vehicles including the            German BF-110 and British Mosquito fighter bombers, British and            Italian tanks, and anti-tank guns. Two new fighting forces: the            French legionnaires and Italian forces. Three new weapons including            a rifle grenade launcher, the British Sten SMG, and bayonets. And            that's your lot, basically. Frankly, a compliment of six maps and            some extra toys is pathetic, and does not constitute an ~expansion~            in my mind. Eight ~new~ vehicles may seem a significant boost, but            to call them ~new~ is stretching the meaning of the word, as they            don't particularly bolster the game with fresh new vehicles,            they're effectively new models for existing ones with tweaked            off-ence and defence statistics.                    This isn't to say the content here is by any means bad; the maps            that have been included are fantastic for the most part. Monte            Cassino in particular warrants a special mention for creating such            a frenetic and tense battle, as French forces attempt to storm            Germans entrenched within a monastery, all the while the crack of            thunder mixes with the booming of anti-tank shells. With a            relentless assault on the part of the Allies, and strong defensive            positions for the Germans, it's a battle that could swing either            way very easily. It's this type of map that reminds us why we loved            BF1942 in the first place; it really feels like you're part of a            war. This is easily the strongest map in the pack, although hardly            worth the admission price alone, and some of the other maps pale in            comparison, with the Anzio and Salerno missions coming across as            particularly weak.        So we have a curious problem here. The content is actually            really very good; the new models are great, the new forces have,            er... pretty uniforms and funny accents, most of the six            (six!) maps are excellent, and of course there are the            bayonets - cool. The single player game, with the addition            of the extra missions, feels a little fuller than before, but is it            worth the money for an expansion that doesn't particularly, well,            expand?                    With the mod community still in its infancy and a noticeable lack            of extra missions available on the internet, it seems wise for            hardcore Battlefield addicts to grab a copy if only to satiate            their cravings for a while, and that's who it seems sensible to            recommend this patch - sorry - pack to. Then again, you're not            going to pass up the opportunity to play it even if I tell you to.            For the rest of you casual players, unless you've really got            \u00a318 burning a hole in your wallet, it would probably be wise            to steer clear if only to show EA that this kind of blatant cash-in            is pretty unacceptable.                    This is the sort of content that should be made available to            faithful customers absolutely gratis, and it's a shame EA feel the            need to charge their swelling community for the privilege of            getting their hands on a smattering of new missions and models            which should have been in the game in the first place. Meanwhile,            Digital Extremes today releases a six map pack for UT2003 - for            free. Then again, if you're prepared to fork out your hard earned            for a patch, be my guest.
