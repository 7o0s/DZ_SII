Five courses are            available to play on, each one with a distinctive style of play.            The fairly basic and flat Japanese course offers a gentle            introduction to players, while the gusty islands that form the            Scottish greens offer a real challenge to the more experienced            player. The meat of the game for the solo player is the massive            world tour against computer players around each of these courses,            but the free play mode has additional tournament, match and stroke            modes for added variety. A choice of player character is offered to            you, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, with values for            statistics like power, luck and spin to consider. Then there's a            choice of which set of irons, woods and even which ball type your            going to take with you out to the green, although I have to admit            that this was getting a bit too involved for me, it does illustrate            the depth of options that are available if your brave enough to dig            that far.             Once on the tee you'll find the game a real            breeze to control. The analog stick aims the shot, the Y button            will give you some nice camera angles to view and the A button will            begin the swing. You can switch clubs using the D-pad and you've            got the choice of making a more powerful normal short or a short            range, but very accurate cautious shot. Spin can then be added to            the shot using the analog stick while the swing is in progress. The            easy interface and cute graphics actually disguise what's really a            relatively complex simulation, with a large number of options            available for each shot. The accuracy and power of the shot is            judged using a traditional golf game 'swingometer', using the            three-tap system that should be familiar to anyone who's played a            golf game before. One tap to start the swing, another to set the            power, and a final tap of the button at the bottom of the            swingometer to make the shot. It's a good system, but here its made            a little too easy by the slow speed of the dial, making miss-swings            rare. A successful shot must take into consideration the distance,            lie of the ball and the strength and direction of the wind, so its            not critical that the emphasis isn't also on lightening fast            reactions as            well. While the game is visually great to look at, with            the courses rendered cleanly and the players very pleasing to the            eye, the landscapes are rather short on detail. There's none of the            frills like spectators or grandstands that can be found in other            golf titles, and while this doesn't detract from the gameplay at            all, it does make the courses a little dull. The pre round course            flyby is smooth very well put together however, and has to be the            most useful flyby in any golf game I've played.                         A welcome addition to the all ready feature filled package is the            slightly weird G-ball game. This variant completely replaces the            grass and trees of a traditional golf course, and places the            players in futuristic VR style floating arenas to play a ball            through the hoop game that most closely resembles crochet. This            plays and looks so radically different from the main game that its            almost a complete title on it's own, and adds a level of variety            and value not often found in golf or indeed any other sports based            titles.                    What you have here is a highly entertaining golf game. A real            rarety for those of use who aren't particularly into the sport            itself. It's not hugely challenging to play in single player, but            the multiplier games can be far tougher against anyone who's played            the game for even a short time, and offers great fun for up to four            players. The cute visuals might be a turn off for hard core            golfers, but for the rest of us they simply add a bit of sparkle to            an otherwise dull genre, and do a great job of enticing people who            wouldn't normally play golf games to have a go. Add to that the            wonderfully intuitive control system and a fine range of game modes            and options and you've got an almost perfect golf package, and one            of the best multi-player games available on the Dreamcast to date.                        : Out Now"}
