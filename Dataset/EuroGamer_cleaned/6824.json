{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-jsrf-x", "date": "25 Apr 2002", "game_name": "Jet Set Radio Future", "text": "Having invented cel-shading, it seems a mite unfair that Sega's Jet            Set Radio didn't capitalise on the technique's popularity with            roaring sales. Poor performance on the Dreamcast hardware and what            I like to think of as the world's first vertical learning curve            meant many players got sick of the game before they really got            their fill. However, hoping to avoid that situation the second time            around, developer Smilebit has dumbed down the long overdue            successor to an almost infantile level, and we're still not sure we            prefer the new approach.                         Like the previous game, Jet Set Radio Future gives you control of            one of several skater teens, whose sole objective in the game is to            cause trouble. They hang out at ~The Garage~, although unlike the            first game this is now a rather enormous skate park with routes to            all the game's major levels and lots of things to grind. At the            centre of the skate park you can chat to a desperately annoying            robot who saves your gave and gives you training objectives to            complete, as well as acting as a doorway to the options menu and            customizable graffiti. Missions begin with erstwhile DJ Professor K            and his pirate Jet Set Radio station broadcasts. These usually            consist of the mad professor bopping to beats and laying down your            mission objectives, whether it's to (literally) paint the town red            or knock down some Rokkaku bad guys.                         Unfortunately these short scenes are nowhere near as punchy as            their counterparts from the original game, and they are completely            unskippable. Thanks chaps. Beyond each unfathomable cutscene lies a            sprawling level which is effectively split into a number of large            areas which can be linked as you tick goals off on the objective            list. As in the Dreamcast original you collect paint cans and use            them to graffiti anything with a marker on it, but spraying            graffiti no longer requires awkward analogue stick combos. This            removes one of the toughest elements of the game, and manual tricks            such as those witnessed in Tony Hawk allow you to skate slowly past            marked areas spraying the whole thing in one go.                    The streamlining continues elsewhere, and there's even further nods            toward Neversoft's interminable skating franchise. The time limit            for each level is gone, and the cop battles are no longer an            ongoing distraction, now consisting of fenced off areas where you            can bowl troopers over and spray them as they lie dazed on the            ground. The joy of JSR was the way it gave you a lot of objectives            and obstacles to overcome and gradually revealed the layout of the            level as you completed them. The same is true of Future, but the            challenge has been sapped, replaced by a series of connected ~wow~            moments punctuated by annoying cutscenes.                         Once again you have to recruit people for your skater gang the            GG's by matching their skills on the street. This is often a case            of grinding large areas of the level without putting a foot down,            and thanks to the simplistic control system (no Tony Hawk style            button to initiate a grind here - hit a rail and you're off without            a hope of spilling) you're in a position to follow their lead            without any difficulty. Sometimes the little nuts want a race to            the finish, and that's a piece of cake too. Find a rooftop path            which, once again, has been made drastically easier with the advent            of grinding up telegraph poles, and you can't really lose.                         One further objective is to collect Graffiti Souls. Now, these            souls are radio-shaped translucent white icons hidden in impossibly            obvious places along the various paths you take. The game is quite            generous, displaying the location of the souls after a while for            confused players. In fact, presentation is generally of a high            standard. The menus and speech bubbles are nicely drawn and            in-keeping with the game's ~funky~ dynamic, although a plain old            ~cancel-the-hell-out-of-all-menus~ button would have gone down a            treat. As it is you can save your gave quite easily and there are            mid-level save points too, which reveal themselves once you've            sprayed the relevant area.                    The most challenging aspect of the previous game was chasing down            rival skater gangs, and this tug-o-war over territory endures.            Poison Jam return, along with the Love Shockers, the Immortals,            Zero Beat and others. There's a degree more storyline than JSR            sported, but it's all very tongue-in-cheek. Taking out your            competition is no longer an epic struggle, either. Having zipped            through all of the game's main levels without even having to glance            at the training area, I overran Gouji, the final boss, as though he            were a first episode nasty.                         Compare some of the tasks in JSRF to those in Tony Hawk's seminal            skater series and you begin to see why Smilebit want to make the            distinction between the two so very significant. Or do they? Much            to my chagrin, apparently they don't. Players are now encouraged            (by way of bonus objectives) to amass points and tricks. Tricks are            simple things like doing a 180 on a grind and hitting buttons            during a jump, and obviously tricks amount to point before long.            The difficulty here is that unlike Tony Hawk, the game won't throw            you to the ground if you fail to keep the cursor in the right            place, so if you find a loop of grinds (as with the 99th Street            level), you can just keep going round and round forever. It's            pretty pointless, and feels like a cheap gimmick to make the game            ~more accessible~.                         Ultimately that's the impression this Xbox version of Jet Set            leaves you with. It's a stunningly easy game, thanks in no small            part to the simplistic control scheme (with jump, trick and spray            buttons about as complex as it gets) and the consistently forgiving            design. And although it seems like an obvious idea, there is no            ~hard~ level or veteran's mode. If you fought your way through JSR,            as I did, this is a slap in the face.                    Technically though, JSRF managed to impress me quite a bit. The            cel-shaded visuals, for instance, are the nicest application of the            effect I've ever witnessed, crushing rival efforts and knock-offs            like the cheap cash-in products they are. Smilebit hasn't confined            itself to a cartoon world, either, embellishing the funky white            dust clouds and spark-spitting grinds with all sorts of particle            effects and a boost effect that sees the colours bleed into one            another to create the perfect illusion of speed. Apart from that,            the character design has been tweaked to the nth degree and            virtually everybody walking or skating around the game is minutely            detailed. This is a 3D cartoon tour de force - developers currently            working with the cel-shading technique would do well to pay            attention.                         But just as they give themselves a break, the developers plunge            themselves back into the quagmire from whence they came. I am,            frankly, completely flabbergasted by the degree of slowdown present            in Jet Set Radio Future, not so much because it's a game beyond the            Xbox, and not so much because it's still present months after we            complained about it at Xperience, but because it doesn't need to            be there. If Smilebit hadn't been so darned overambitious with            the design this thing would be as smooth as Teflon coated shit off            a shovel, but apparently it didn't occur to them to do this when            they were mapping out important areas like the Garage, which slows            to a crawl if you go near the central island, nor the game's most            iconic setting, the Shibuya Terminal used in the first game. Even            the press briefings and the damn introductory movie are afflicted.            Heaven help me.                         On the audio front, there are some 30 tunes of mixed interest.            Some of them I enjoyed, like tone-deaf oddity Birthday Cake, which            just sort of worked for me, but others I could barely endure. On            the whole, with so many tunes you're bound to find a few you like,            and you'll just have to put up with the rest. Sadly there's no            jukebox mode that I could find, but you can set your Garage            background music to a specific tune.                    As you may have guessed, I'm disappointed with Jet Set Radio            Future. There's a great game in here, but Smilebit has once again            failed to strike a proper balance between technology and gameplay.            It's agonizing, as a fan, to watch them fluff it up for the second            time. Terrific graphics and diverse sounds have been woven together            to unrivalled effect, but the slowdown, complete lack of any            discernible challenge from start to stop (it took me about 12 hours            to finish) and lacklustre padding leave me disenchanted on the            whole.                         If you really sucked at the last one, you'll find a reasonable            amount of gameplay and a welcome adjustment on the difficulty side            of things, but please, don't buy the console to play this. And if            you already bought the console, give it a rental to make your mind            up.                        -        Jet                    Set Radio Future screenshotsJet                    Set Radio Future screenshotsJet                    Set Radio Future previewJet                    Set Radio Future preview"}
