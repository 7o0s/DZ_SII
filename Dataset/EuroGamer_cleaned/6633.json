If you're releasing a game into this            market, you'd want to be certain that it's either so stunningly            good that nobody can afford to ignore it, or that it has a very            unique and interesting new approach on offer.                    Impossible Creatures goes for the latter approach, giving players            the chance to build up their own army of unusual hybrid animals by            combining body parts and attributes from different species. It's            certainly an intriguing concept (if not an entirely original one),            and going to war with a batch of vaguely cuddly genetic mutants            makes a nice change from sleek jets, elven archers and phalanxes of            cavalry. The setting of the game - the early 20th century - is also            out of character for an RTS game, making Impossible Creatures into            one of the most immediately interesting games to cross our desks in            quite a while.        These impressions continued when we first started up the game,            and were greeted not with stirring martial music or a dramatic            orchestral score, but instead with a rather catchy honky-tonk jazz            style piece over the top of a slick menu system. In fact, the team            at Relic seems to have been perfectly happy to throw out all of the            stylistic conventions of the strategy genre, and we're glad they            did; the presentation of Impossible Creatures is a joy to behold,            and a hugely refreshing change from what we're used to in modern            videogames.                    For example, the strongly narrative-based single-player game is            interspersed with comic book style cutscenes and amusing banter            between the lead and incidental characters, and from the            aforementioned jazz music on the menu system to the flying            locomotive that serves as your base and the main character's            ridiculously square-jawed design, the whole game simply feels            light-hearted and fun.                    The presentation of the game is almost flawless. In fact, and it's            obvious that Relic spent a long time working on it to make sure            that it was exactly right. The spirit of 1930's movies and music            has been captured perfectly here, and despite this careful work and            slick interface, the whole game never feels like it's taking itself            too seriously - a trap which it's all too easy for Real Time            Strategy titles to fall into, it seems.        Any            game with such careful attention to its visual design could easily            be let down by a sub-standard engine, but that's certainly not the            case here. Impossible Creatures' visuals remind us a lot of            WarCraft III, albeit with a fair bit more detail on many of the            units and significantly more camera control (you can zoom out to a            sensible level, or zoom right in to peer at your creatures close            up, as well as all the usual panning and rotating controls).            Comparisons with the recently released C&C Generals are            inevitable but a bit unfair, as the games are trying to do            radically different things with their graphics; however, Impossible            Creatures doesn't ever feel like the inferior game in graphical            terms, even though it doesn't have C&C's stunning explosions            and whatnot.                    Much of this is, again, down to the amount of effort which has gone            into the presentation of the game. Every creature, every character,            every building and every animation in the game has been crafted            beautifully; even the animations where your workmen build new            structures are fun to watch. The excellent graphics engine is only            the picture frame to hold the remarkable work that's been done by            the designers and artists who worked on Impossible Creatures, and            once again we were struck by how utterly different the game is to            almost every other RTS we've ever seen.        The            central plot of the game - which is amusing in a Saturday morning            cartoon sort of way - revolves around our hero, Rex Chance, heading            out to a remote chain of islands to search for his long lost            father, a brilliant scientist. As it transpires, he's worked out            how to combine the genetic information of animals to create            ferocious fighting creatures, and lo and behold, a nasty man (the            truly hamming-it-up Upton Julius) has captured him and is using the            technology for his undoubtedly evil purposes. Guess what? You now            have to breed creatures of your own, battle the evil forces, and            rescue your Dad. More corn than an Odeon giant bucket, but it            serves its purpose and the script is generally amusing and            well-written, not to mention well acted.                    The gameplay, then. This revolves around three elements; collecting            genetic samples of wild animals, combining those samples to create            deadly cross-breeds, and then battling it out RTS-style with these            cross-breeds. Unfortunately, this is where Impossible Creatures            starts to fall down a bit. Collecting the samples, in effect,            involves sending Rex out with his gun to shoot animals with            collecting darts at the start of each mission, although sometimes            you may have to wait until you can build a few creatures to clear            bad guys out of areas with valuable animal species in them first.                    Next comes the meatier task of combining these animals to create an            army. Sadly, this really isn't as much fun as it sounds. For a            start, you can only combine two animals at a time, so any wilder            combinations you have in mind are out the window; however, you do            get the option of choosing which elements of each animal your new            hybrid can use, so you might choose to combine a scorpion and a            porcupine, giving it the spikes of the porcupine, the many legs and            lethal tail of the scorpion, and the head of the porcupine for a            biting attack. However, after a bit of amusement in messing around            to see what these combinations look like, you'll often find that            you discover that there's only one sensible way to combine creature            attributes without making a creature that's fundamentally not very            useful.        This, then, is the fundamental problem with Impossible            Creatures; as amusing as the concept itself is, the ability to            create your own creatures doesn't actually change the gameplay much            from that of a standard RTS game. You effectively end up making up            your own versions of standard units from other games, and sticking            with those - so there are animal close combat melee units, animal            fast scout units, animal ranged attack units, animal naval units,            animal air units... After a few hours, suddenly you discover that            you're playing Command & Conquer with furry tanks and planes,            and not a shockingly good version of Command & Conquer at that,            when pure gameplay is taken into consideration.                    In fact, the gameplay is almost entirely and unashamedly ~tank            rush~ based; there aren't a lot of very clever strategies to be            employed here, because despite the apparently vast range of            creatures you could create, there aren't really all that many worth            creating. A few have attacks which provide useful status effects,            such as the skunk which can cause a stink that hampers enemy            movement and attack speed; but in reality, you'll find yourself            relying on units with lots of hit points and powerful attacks            rather than anything even remotely subtle.                    That said, it's not all bad, and multi-player games in particular            can be quite good fun - but this is strictly lightweight stuff,            with even large games generally ending in under an hour. The            single-player is also a very engrossing experience even after you            realise that the creatures aspect is something of a gimmick, simply            because it's an amazingly well-presented and designed single-player            game which has a beautifully tuned difficulty curve and plenty of            incentive to keep on playing.                    Do we like Impossible Creatures? Somewhat grudgingly, we'd have to            say yes. While acknowledging that the gameplay of the title isn't            going to be remotely interesting to hardcore strategy fans, the            fact is that the game is extremely charming and (dare we say it            again) beautifully presented, and will have massive appeal to more            casual PC gamers who feel a bit left out in the cold by very            hardcore RTS titles, or who want a fun game that won't tax their            machine massively.                    Ultimately, we were disappointed by the game's lack of depth, but            we very much enjoyed playing it - and that, at the end of the day,            is far more important than anything else. It may indeed be a case            of style over substance, but in this instance, there's just enough            gaming substance there to justify the style.
