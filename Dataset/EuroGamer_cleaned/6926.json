He stumbled upon Clusterball.com in            the dead of night on Friday evening, downloaded the game and before            the end of the next morning had blown a wad of cash at the            developer's website to get hold of extra arenas. Clusterball is            unique amongst shareware, with marketing based almost entirely on            word of mouth and a revenue structure that focuses on added extras.            Players get the game for free, but initially only a few playing            fields are open to them. A few pounds gets you another though, and            then a few more another.                         So many people have now succumbed to Clusterball that developer            Daydream Software have finally found a publisher and started to            distribute the game through retailers. Thanks to Koch Media's            Virtuoso group, the game will shortly be arriving on your local            gaming emporium's shelves at a wallet-friendly price, and if you're            sick to death of mind-numbingly repetitive first person shooters            and real time strategy titles, you might want to give it a go.                         Clusterball is a future sport, but not in the classic sense.            Instead of taking away your legs and giving you an orb, or putting            you on skates and forcing you to play hockey with electric tazers            or something, the game sits you in the cockpit of a highly            manoeuvrable aircraft and asks you to collect as many floating            magnetic balls as possible before depositing them in a nearby            scoring hoop. After an interval, the balls respawn and the mad dash            begins again. Up to eight players can be on a server at once, and            to make things interesting pilots can also spend time collecting a            plethora of weapons and power-ups scattered about the arena, so            that if he spies wily pilot number one heading towards the scoring            zone with a few balls in tow, he can head him off and pinch his            load.                    This simple sporting concept is backed up by flawless execution and            some entertaining distractions. The cunning thing about combat in            Clusterball is that you can't just blow up a ship using air-to-air            missiles and laser fire, only by direct contact. You have to coax            them into crashing of their own accord if you want to steal their            balls.                        As such, most of your weapons are diversionary and most of the            power-ups are turbo boosts and the like. My favourite has to be the            reverse control missile - shrugging off the interests of a nearby            fighter is damnably troublesome if your left key sends you veering            off to the right and by pitching up you nose-dive into the            deck\u2026                         Generally speaking, the level design is based around hypothetical            'runs'. Each player pilots their craft along a particular route at            breakneck speed, avoiding its obstacles and scooping up its bounty.            The more efficient your path through the various runs the more            likely you are to score, and with up to eight other players in your            face at any one time, things can get pretty hectic. Add in the            unpredictability of a turbo boost for instance, and you've got a            fight on your hands.                    Each area is superbly modelled, be it Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal or            the Arctic circle and the texturing, while extremely simplistic, is            also extremely suitable, because picking out your enemy or your            goal against the backdrop should never be difficult in a game like            this. Engaging visuals aren't really the focus of Daydream's            efforts; the gameplay of the title is what determines its success            or failure.                         And this is unfortunately an area marred by a glaring            imperfection: the physics engine. Frankly, it doesn't do enough to            make you feel like you are in an aircraft, and as a result the game            isn't as exhilarating as it could be. You feel as though you're            piloting a little chase-cam from Counter-Strike rather than an            actual aircraft. This may take a bit of getting used to if you are            approaching the game from a flight sim background, but curiously            it's very intuitive to the first person shooter fans. Perhaps the            recent slump in decent multiplayer FPS games is the major reason            for Clusterball's success.                         The thing that really sold Clusterball though is the network code.            Clusterball is not a single player game. There is nothing you can            do without a network or Internet connection. Of course, a network            is best in terms of atmosphere, but there is virtually no            difference between network and Internet play in terms of            performance. Amazingly, thanks to their new network API ~Autobahn~,            Daydream claim that a server can be hosted on a 56Kbps modem,            because clients only need 9.6Kbps to play. And lo, although it took            a while to get it working, limiting my ever-dignified Pace 56Kbps            modem to a pitiful 9600bps baud left me still quite capable of            hooking up to a server running on a friend's ISDN. It wasn't            perfect, but to my amazement it was vaguely acceptable. Slap it on            the ADSL line and you could host plenty of Clusterball servers,            making it the perfect game for those frustrated by the slothful            rollout of broadband in the United Kingdom.                    One of the biggest complaints that fans of the game have cited is            the in-game advertising. It's another part of Daydream's            exceedingly clever revenue structure - selling 'live' advertising            in game servers (which of course can be updated during a game from            new data on Daydream's servers), but it is rather intrusive, and            some might argue spoils the experience a touch.                         Clusterball really is a success on the whole though. You can pick            it up fairly quickly, and unlike a lot of recent games that            threatened to be promising in multiplayer but failed due to lack of            players, the Internet is teaming with interest!            Clusterball.com, the            centre of the whole experience, is home to thousands of users, and            I've never had any trouble finding a game. Thanks to the low system            requirements, low bandwidth requirements and addictive gameplay,            the retail release of Clusterball should be an enormous success,            and as I said at the outset, if you're bored of defusing the bomb            and saving hostages, you'll find some respite here in the run up to            Christmas."}
