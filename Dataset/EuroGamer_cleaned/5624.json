With Sega's Dreamcast            now with us, we are told that that situation should dramatically            change. With a            PowerVR            Series2 chip at its heart and running Windows CE, it is            supposed to be a doddle to convert DC to PC and vice versa.                    The first game to cross the divide is Trickstyle from            Acclaim. Having enjoyed            massive success by being one of the few titles available at launch            for Dreamcast, can developers            Criterion Studios look            forward to similar success on the PC? Let's see ...                    The game is set ~sometime in the future~ where the latest sporting            craze is hoverboarding. If you ignore the token storyline, the game            promises loads of fast-paced thrill'n'spills, huge air and            impossible tricks as you zoom around like Michael J. Fox in ~Back            to the Future Part II~.                    Cool.         Fire up the menu, and first impressions are            of disappointment and annoyance. Trickstyle really shows its            console roots merely from the way you have to navigate the menu.                    For starters, if you accidentally select the wrong option, you            can't just push the ~Escape~ key - you have to move down to the            menu option ~End~. A small point maybe, but then salt is added to            injury when you go to type in your Player name - you have to select            it letter by letter from a large alphabet grid.                    This is fine for console controllers with only four buttons, but us            PC gamers have keyboards is it too much to expect some new program            code to allow us to type in our names?                    With the annoying formalities out of the way, the first game screen            loaded. WOW! Trickstyle might have a dodgy console menu system, but            damn it is good looking. Choose one of nine characters, each with            various strengths and weakness in the different skill categories,            and head on out to the main arena.                    Thankfully sparing us from more atrocious menus, Criterion have            taken the novel approach of a 3D menu - you can fly around            practising some stunts, talk to your trainer to get some advice and            take one of his 16 skill challenges, or head towards one of the            themed race zones for some action.         The 15 ~tracks~ are divided into 3            regions: UK, USA and Japan. Each has 5 races and a Boss level, and            you must win your way through the early stages to unlock the latter            ones.                    Unfortunately, each zone is really just one huge level, and the 5            tracks are just different routes, with areas blocked off, or            similar layouts but in reverse. This spoils any surprises on later            levels, as you can usually remember the obstacles from previous            races.                    While the graphics are good, each zone is your typical stock            futuristic city, but with a few characteristic features. For            example, the UK is the same as USA, except the former has a couple            of London buses, a token Big Ben, and something vaguely resembling            Tower Bridge, while the latter has a subway and a harbour tunnel.                    On the plus side, the arenas are well laid out, and there is            usually two or more different directions you can take to reach the            same destination, even within the restrictions of the barriers. A            lot of fun can be had by exploring the rooftop routes, or the            hair-raising rides to be had by riding a Magnorail.         The racing is a bit of a mystery - take                 a big spill and no matter how far behind you get, you always                 seem to magically catch up to the pack. And despite leading                 the whole race, the dash for the finish line is usually hectic                 and winning margins are fractions of a second.                    I decided to test this by giving everyone a 45 second head start. I            was last by a mile! Within another 45 seconds I was into 2nd place,            but finished 5th despite not making a single error. Very            strange, I'm sure you'll agree.                    Once you learn the general layout of the track and take note where            the handful of crucial obstacles are, winning most of the races is            a mere formality - I had won 10 out of 15 in just 3 hours.                    The long-term playability of Trickstyle is seriously questionable.            Once you have completed all the races, there are 16 skill            challenges to complete, and that's it. I can't see many people            playing the races over and over just to improve their winning time.                    The multiplayer options again suffer from the console conversion,            being limited to a two player split screen mode. Not only is this            fairly pointless, but it again shows how little thought has been            put in to conversion process to make the game more PC friendly.                    Why should we miss out on multiplayer on a network or over the            Internet just because this is a console game? (Note - this should            change once Dreamcast Online launches in the Spring)                    Control is via keyboard or joypad - the latter is infinitely            preferable, not only to mimic the console-playing experience, but            because most keyboards only recognise two or three simultaneous key            presses, sometimes leaving you in a pickle.         All in all, Trickstyle is a good bit of fun in the short term            - some mindless action free from the complexity of Unreal            Tournament or Tiberian Sun.                    It may be perfect for a quick blast on a console, but PC gamers            expect a little more from their games, and so the lack of variety            and the ~too-easy~ difficulty settings mean that you won't be            playing Trickstyle into the wee small hours.                    In fact, if you did, you would probably complete the game in one            sitting. Well, almost - it took me a day and a half on and off.                    Ultimately, gameplay loses out to stunning visuals - once the sheen            wears off, there is very little left to make you come back for            more. Let's hope conversions of other top Dreamcast games are not            merely direct ports, and tailor the experience for PC gamers'            tastes...
