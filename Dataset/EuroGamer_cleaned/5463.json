{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/pocket-140", "date": "17 Oct 2006", "game_name": "Puzzle Bobble", "text": "Put aside the basic questions that confront any newcomer toPuzzle Bobble (like who trained dragons to use bubble-firingweaponry, why don't they just breathe fire on them and who attachedthe bubbles to the ceiling in the first place?) and you're leftwith a very simple puzzle game premise. Link together three or morebubbles of the same colour and they disappear, fail to link themtogether and they build an ever bigger chain which eventuallyreaches the bottom of the screen, at which point you die and your miniature onscreen dragon cries.Now there's nothing wrong with a simple premise - most of ourvery favourite mobile titles are simple to pick up and play. Nor isthere anything especially awry with the presentation here - thevisuals are as bold and colourful as they were on the consoleoriginal, there's a jaunty sound track and the screen is bright andclear. Yet there is nonetheless something amiss here, or morepointedly something missing which prevents you from really enjoyingyour time spent bursting bubbles, and makes it unlikely that you'llreturn.In part this could be down to the control system. The subtlemovements of the aiming arrow, which worked effortlessly on thebigger screen, feel rather clunkier on the micro mobile playingspace and more complex shots like bouncing the ball off a wall intoan empty space prove more miss than hit.More problematic is the lack of any variation in play as thegame is essentially played out on level which you can never reallyclear. Although you may successfully group and pop most bubbles,when you've fired a certain number the screen starts to shake and afrustrating new line appears at the top. Hence, in place of theusual gaming frenzy rewarded by a small satisfaction break from acleared level, here you're constantly fire-fighting and have nofresh challenges to look forward to. This is further compounded bythe lack of multiplayer challenges that added playtime to theconsole version.Hence, though there this maybe a relatively good conversion, allbut the real die-hard fans will find Puzzle Bobble is rather toomuch like the diminutive dragon hero, cute but lacking indepth."}
