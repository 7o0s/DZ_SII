So many boxing games in the past have            promised so much, but failed to deliver the crushing punches            expected of them. Unrealistic, sluggish boxing titles simply won't            sell.                    Codemasters have the enviable license to create a game centred            around one of the most successful boxers of modern times Prince            Naseem Hamed. Until recently the short and cocky mean machine had            clocked up no less than thirty-four wins out of thirty-four fights,            thirty of which were straight knockouts! So with this in mind, you            would think we have a recipe for a power packed boxing title on our            hands.             As you would expect Naseem            Boxing gives you the quick game 'VS' option to either play            head-to-head against a human opponent or computer controlled. This            is where you will discover problem number one; the load times. It            takes an absolute age to get into the action, as there is one load            for the boxers introduction by the annoying ring announcer, and            then another albeit shorter load to actually get into the fight            itself. The ability to skip the former entirely would not have gone            amiss!                    Once in the ring I could not help but be disappointed at how bland            the arenas, rings and boxers looked either. I know the PlayStation            is showing its age graphics wise, but you can push the old beast a            bit further than what is on show here. A fairly impressive range of            stadiums are available for your slugathons, and the selection of            boxers is also good, with the Prince himself being one of the            wisest choices if you want to get anywhere at all. One thing I            found with the 'quick game' option is that the opposition are            felled far too easily. Alarm bells were ringing!                    Thankfully there is one saving grace for Prince Naseem Boxing and            that is in its 'World' simulation mode. This area of the game is            fairly entertaining if a little lacking in features. Your task is            to take a rookie boxer up through the ranking system to eventually            be the titleholder, all this with Prince Naseem as your coach. A            regular check must be made on your training schedule along with            your food intake, so that you will be the exact weight and            physically fit for your next fight. Though Naseem will guide you as            to what is the ideal training regime, you can opt to push yourself            a little further. Be careful not to overdo things though, you may            well be too fatigued to be of any use in the fight itself.         It would have been nice for            the training mode to offer a little more variety, perhaps even            allowing you to do the training yourself in true ~Sydney 2000~            style. In the end though it isn't all about adjusting your training            and eating habits according to Naseem's directions. The fun comes            in taking your rookie for his first few fights!                    If you played the quick game mode and found it too easy, this next            phase will come as something of a shock. Your fledgling boxer finds            even the most inept of opponents a tough hurdle to jump. This is            where you realise how well the training regime works in toughening            up your fighter step by step.                    I admit, the first few fights I had were nothing but demoralising            defeats, but as you train harder so your strength and agility            increase. You will then find you are winning rounds, maybe not the            match, but the small improvements are there to see. When you make            that first leap up the ranking chart, it almost makes it all            worthwhile!             For a            full-blooded boxing match the bouts are just too slow, with the            boxers shuffling around looking more like they are gliding than            stepping. Particularly in the lightweight division, the fights            should be fast and snappy but instead feel like you are playing in            treacle.                    Despite your best efforts you will find your boxer misses more than            he hits. Every missed punch contributes to a 'special punch' meter            for your opponent, which when used will severely reduce your energy            putting you nearer to the KO limit. Decidedly unfair to say the            least when the computer rarely misses a shot. It's not that the            controls are poor by any means, the array of punches are easy            enough to execute, and when you land a quick succession can be            quite adrenaline pumping.             With            the Ready to Rumble and Knockout Kings series on the scene,            competition has never been so hot in the console boxing world. The            Naseem license is one that puts you in a 'can't lose' situation you            would think, but the reality is that Prince Naseem Boxing is a            wasted opportunity and is nothing more than an average slug-out            that never really gets past the first round.                    The game as a whole is just bland, lacking any sort of draw to keep            you coming back for more. One to miss."}
