A product of Acclaim Studios Cheltenham, Dakar 2            dramatises the race from Paris, France to Dakar, Senegal with less            gusto than mid-90s Skoda salesman, and all the visual splendour of            a mucky day in Bognor Regis.        Right, we're going to list all the            things we like about Dakar 2. They should fit in one paragraph            without too much difficulty, even if we continue to pad it out with            mutterings about how abysmal the rest of the game is. First of all,            there's the 'five little pieces of cheese' progress meter in the            bottom left. Each chunk is gradually coloured blue as you move            between checkpoints, and each chunk turns red/green depending on            how your time matches up to the qualification minimum. The design            limits you to five checkpoints per lap or race, but you'll be            thanking the game for every second away from the so-called gameplay            anyway. Um, and that's it - all there in one paragraph. All one of            them.                    What makes Dakar 2 so bad is much easier to pinpoint. It's just no            fun to play. The Campaign mode is basically one big Time Trial            (which won't come as much of a surprise if you have any idea how            the actual rally works), and players get to choose from cars,            trucks and motorbikes to take through 12 stages spanning desert,            bush and mountain. There are also Arcade/Quick Race modes, which            behave more like traditional races, a split-screen multiplayer            option (horizontal or vertical) and a fair variety of things to            unlock. However you won't be much inclined to unlock them for a            multitude of reasons. Firstly, the handling on each vehicle is            woeful, with physics that allow you to slip 50 feet down an almost            sheer cliff-face on one stage only to crawl back up. In a truck.            Elsewhere, the bike rider feels like he's on a unicycle, and the            way the vehicles steer sharply as if on an invisible turntable, and            react to track furniture as though it's spring-loaded, makes the            game feel like a cartoon stuck on fast forward. Ironic really,            because there's virtually no sense of speed when you're moving            between turns, and no 60Hz mode either, tech-heads.                    Track design consists of regular twists and turns, most of which            can be taken at full pelt (including some hairpins), but you'll            want to avoid even the slightest nudge of scenery, because a few            parps here and there will leave your engine incapable of escaping            second gear. Once or twice, the game throws in some variation to            the circuit and linear racecourses, with what the packaging            describes as ~unique GPS navigational levels~. These are basically            Smuggler's Run-style offerings, which have you tearing across the            desert in one direction before forcing you to turn left and drive            off in another direction to find the next checkpoint. It's smooth            sailing for the most part, but occasionally you have to navigate            round an extra-tall sand dune. Or avoid a sea of            suspension-knackering shrubs (helpfully coloured the same as the            other, non-destructive shrubs).        What stands in the way of            entertainment above all else though is the total lack of difficulty            in some areas, and the complete opposite in others. This writer            waltzed through the Campaign mode on the default Medium difficulty            in the ugliest truck imaginable without failing to qualify - or            even not coming first - once. However, throwing one's self            into the mix with a bike is a much more fearsome proposition.            Though you can't unseat AI riders with a truck to the face, a            slight gust of wind in the wrong direction is enough to put the            player's face in the sand. Coupling this wildly inconsistent            challenge with the lack of any opposition (except from the odd car,            truck or bike racing their own race), the monotonous track design,            the woeful physics and the hideous oversteer, and the only thing            missing is uninspired graphics. Hang on, missing? Au contraire -            they're out in force.                    On the whole, the game looks bland and unremarkable, and as though            it's been squashed from widescreen to 4:3. The vehicles all look            like late-PlayStation offerings, each as unimaginative and low-poly            as the next, and each is covered in plenty of low-resolution            textures advertising various things we've never heard of. We spent            the entirety of one race trying to count all the ads on our truck,            although we reckon we double-counted some of them. This was more            fun than paying attention to the game properly, but we still won            the race.                    The tracks themselves vary from unashamedly insipid desert            offerings, with the same repeated sand, rough sand, dark sand and            powdery sand textures, to slightly greener/browner circuits with            trees and rocks blocking the sides. There's little of particular            merit - the draw distance in the desert stages is pretty good, but            what's being drawn rarely lives up to it, and occasionally you get            rain effects, but they're so insignificant that you'll just think            something's wrong with the TV. On the other hand, there are plenty            of things which could be described as symbolically awful. The            bikes, for example, are basically plastic toys with glued on riders            who, should they come unstuck, roll around on the ground in the            brittle, legs-askew posture of a deceased mutt.                    Dakar 2 is a very bad game, which should be reserved for children            under five, and that bloke from The Fast Show who thinks            everything's brilliant. It's not exaggeration to say it's the least            fun of all the games we've played this year. While we can            appreciate that Acclaim yearns for a hit game like the desert            lusting after the rain, we can't see how throwing substandard,            undercooked, multi-platform tat at the problem is going to solve            anything. Do not buy this. Ever."}
