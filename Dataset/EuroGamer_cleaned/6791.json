Everything looked slightly shinier, and the kids had            different faces, but all the teachers, their lessons, their methods            and the various things I disliked had endured in my absence.            Coincidentally, that pretty much sums up Gun Valkyrie.                         Gun Valkyrie is the oldest of the old school. Developed by            Smilebit, it's a single player 3D shoot 'em up which throws scores            of practically identical bad guys at you en masse in various            locations and demands their complete obliteration. As you progress            through the game's ten massive levels, blasting aliens and            rocket-hopping around like a crazed gazelle, you are given the            opportunity to upgrade your kit based on how many GV you receive            for your endeavours. Each mission rewards you with a certain number            of GV, dictated by factors including speed, kill volume, secrets            uncovered and so forth. You can upgrade guns and your gearskin            (mech suit), and you can also buy single-use items to recharge your            shields and abilities mid-level.                         The game is set in the Victorian era. Unlike our timeline,            everything from automated food dispensers to space travel has            already been invented thanks to respected scientist Dr. Hebble, and            the British Empire still controls most of the world. Unfortunately            though, Hebble's gone a bit loopy and has attacked the human colony            of Tir na Nog in deep space, and a team led by his daughter, Poe,            has been dispatched in his fiery wake. The team consists of two            mech-suited jet-packed marine types named Kelly and Saburouta, and            you can play as either throughout the game. Their abilities and            weapons differ only slightly, but Kelly is considered the easier of            the two to play.                    The most obvious thing that stands between Gun Valkyrie and stardom            is its beleaguered control system. Your most critical apparatus,            the jetpack, is controlled using the left trigger, which first has            you jump into the air, and then struggles against the realities of            gravity in trying to boost you further. It's useful for getting out            of a tight spot, but not much else. You can augment this simple            leapfrog approach by clicking the left thumbstick to 'dash' and            hover, whilst by itself the thumbstick moves you back and forward            and strafes left and right.                         The idea is to move with the left side of the pad and then aim            using the right side, but it doesn't really work. The right            thumbstick controls looking around and is intrinsically important            to juggling movement and dashing (and yes, we all hate clicking in            the thumbstick whilst trying to manoeuvre), but for some reason it            won't let you turn around properly as you move. There is a method            for turning on a pinhead, but it's even more complex. Most of the            time, you have to put up with the direction you're facing and watch            as the camera and your character both refuse to respond to your            turning arc properly.                         It would be an easier problem to deal with if you had a small            radar screen plotting your enemies' positions, but if you want to            know where the bad guys are concentrated, you have to hit the white            button to bring up the map. But this doesn't let you see other            sections of the level, so if you're trying to round up the last few            remaining enemies you still have to trawl the whole level looking            for them. Thankfully, handling the weapons is an easier task to            perform. You select one of your three possibles using the face            buttons - with the basic unlimited blaster on button Y, the plasma            grapple hook on B and a Halley's Comet special on button X - and            then fire with the right trigger. Alas, if only the rest of the            control system were this straightforward. Yes, Smilebit, the story            behind the game takes a different path through history, but that            doesn't mean you have to shun recognised control systems in favour            of this unwieldy menace.                    It may not handle particularly well, but Gun Valkyrie certainly            looks nice, and it also sounds at least reasonable. Graphics are            stunningly detailed throughout the game, and the main characters            are beautifully rendered, right down to Kelly's rather revealing            elasticised underwear, and even the menu interface has a            characteristic polygonal look to it. Background music is passable            (and almost reminiscent of the Transformers movie soundtrack at            times) and the sound effects (blasting of guns, braying of            monsters) are quite fitting.                         Levels take place both indoors and outside, and look good in both            cases. Outside it's a world of wreckage-packed canyons,            dysfunctional satellite arrays suspended across gorges, and giant            mushrooms for reaching higher ground. Indoors the player is treated            to huge Victorian-esque metallic designs with neon pink bounce pads            in the more frustrating levels and lots of little intricate            archways and corridors. Enemies are mostly arachnid or insects in            different shades of red and black, but they too are nicely            detailed, and die convincingly before fading away into nothing,            while effects like motion blur and heat haze add to the already            hectic fight scenes. As you upgrade yourself, you develop some            truly awesome moves to light up the scenery and bust open your            foes. At first you can just click down on both thumbsticks and            pirouette, killing everybody in the direct vicinity, but before            long you end up with the Meteor Crash attack, which is as            devastating as it sounds.                         A distinct lack of scenery pop-up or slowdowns is another plus.            Imagine fifty Magma Spiders from Devil May Cry standing over you,            with a huge rolling landscape behind them, and that's pretty much            the effect you get in Gun Valkyrie. Enemies tend to get clipped            after a certain distance, but it's a long way off and it's usually            not a problem, as you can't lock onto them from there anyway.                    If you buy into the old school shooter mythos and purchase Gun            Valkyrie, you'll soon learn the true meaning of frustration. First            off, it's inexcusably hard. The later levels rapidly degenerate            into one big attempt to stay away from the sea of bad guys on the            ground by fighting the various airborne enemies (a terrible            inclusion, given the combative control system), and level design is            in complete disarray for the most part, although thankfully you can            often pick between two or three missions instead of having to            replay just one over and over again until you crack it.                         Worse still, the graphics sometimes obscure your objectives and            enemies. For the most part this doesn't matter, but for some            reason, the motives behind which I won't even begin to speculate            on, Smilebit has included a handful of levels involving freefall            descent down huge circular tunnels laced with enemies. Once you've            mastered hovering this is slightly easier to do, but even so, it's            a process of falling down and picking off as many as possible with            your lock-on and early warning system going mental trying to keep            track, before bouncing back up on a neon pink pad and doing the            same again until they're all dead, at which point the door at the            bottom will unlock. It's frustrating, it's daft, the fact that you            can't see much is almost entirely the fault of graphical            over-complexity, and it didn't need to be included at all.                         Often, graphic detail is actually mistaken for secret items.            You're supposedly searching levels for secret blue Halley orbs on            the side, each of which contains the soul of a colonist, but by the            fifth or sixth level I completely gave up trying to find hidden            extras, as I had absolutely no desire to painstakingly trawl every            single recess or rocky outcropping in search of the bloody things.            I have no desire to play through those levels again either, meaning            that the scoreboard for level rankings is somewhat redundant. The            highlights of the game are actually the boss battles; each boss is            a typical shoot 'em up finale character with recognisable patterns            and weaknesses, and the final boss is possibly the greatest ever            conceived in terms of sheer size and resilience. But you'll            probably give up before you get to the second one. Given the            choice, I would have\u2026                    As much as I like the game's storyline and relentlessly impressive            visuals, Gun Valkyrie is marred by feeble level design with huge,            trussed up rooms connected by pointless corridors, and a control            system which redefines the word 'awkward'. And it's too hard. I'm            not bad at games, but even I've only beaten this one with Saburouta            under absolutely perfect conditions. If you fancy a casual blaster,            this just isn't it, especially when it will cost you anything up to            \u00a345. If you must buy absolutely everything that Sega ever puts            its name to then go for it, but for the rest of you, unless you're            a die-hard shoot 'em up fan, steer well clear. The Xbox has much            better games than Gun Valkyrie."}
