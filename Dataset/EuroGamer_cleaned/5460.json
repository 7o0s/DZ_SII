It's a hot summer night and the setting suncasts sheen across the barren ahead. You however are the epitome ofcool, lounging in your bucket seat, clutching the throbbing wheelof your shiny souped-up racer. You rev the engineand stare menacingly across at your competitor who's evenshinier, more souped up vehicle could be yours if you can beat himto the finish line. Suddenly the assembled throng quieten down andpull back from the streets. The engines gun more fiercely. Thelights turn green. Your foot hits the floor and adrenalin takesover as you scream up the road, wheel-to-wheel each convincedyou'll get the inside line on the first corner......now forget that image completely, because Juiced is not evenclose.Although this mobile version of the home console game puts allthese basic elements and more into the blender, the resultingconcoction is decidedly weak. The idea of addinga role-playing dimension is undeniably a good one,allowing you to progress through challenges against otherstreet-racers, earn cash, respect and new cars to race on newcircuits, but the sad reality is that you're unlikely to bother with it for very long.We don't believe all racing games should aspire tothe 3D delights of Asphalt GT or Midtown Madness on mobile, but we do believethey should give top-down arcade gems like Supersprint arun for their money. The viewed-from-above vehicles have adistinctly bricky quality, and this is matched bythe handling. Car control is limited to turning left and rightin 22.5 degree increments (e.g. 4 taps to turn 90 degrees)with acceleration and gear change handled automatically. Whilstthere's nothing wrong with this per se, the execution feelsdecidedly un-vehicular with skittish taps replacing smoothcornering arcs. Then again, as all the corners are 90 degree angles(think track design by Tetris!), cornering doesn't actually presentyour biggest challenge here and you'll soon be taking virtually allturns at top speed without tapping the pinball style barriers.No, the real challenge here lies in overtaking the field of 4-8other cars which in true arcade racer style all start aheadof you and speed away at the first lights. In fairness this isquite a challenge - their aggressive attitude combined withthe clunky controls leaving you little option but to stay outof their way on straights and to try and duck past on corners.Meanwhile, if you win a challenge you'll open up a follow-up drag race whichis actually rather good fun and transfers attention fromdirectional control to properly timed gear changes. Succeed hereand you can race the leader for his car, although again what shouldhave been a tense finale is somewhat destroyed by the fact that youdon't actually lose your car or indeed anything should yoube defeated.Win this race and you open up another slightly different car(usually faster with a poorer turning circle) and get to pick upthe gauntlet from a new gang of racers.In between races you can make yourself more competitive by usingwinnings to upgrade your engine to add more power and even slap ona nitro boost to increase acceleration (at the price of a shaky screen),which in tandem with the ability to swap cars in your garage doesundeniably add a little strategy to proceedings, as do the changingweather conditions with cars skidding a little in the wet.Ultimately though, this isn't enough to lighten up theuninspiring driving experience and keep you coming back once youstart to lose races. Overall it feels like an opportunity missedon virtually all fronts, and the overall lack of care is summed upperfectly by the game's inability to even remember your name,leaving you to enter it every time you break a lap record."}
