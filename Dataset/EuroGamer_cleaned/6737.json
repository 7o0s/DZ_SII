Adventure On Soccer Island, you thought it was going to be awful. All the signs were there! Rage's less than stellar output of late, the other Beckham games, the... odd looking screenshots. Fortunately, this is a very different and much better game than any of the others, and it's all thanks to the genius of Scottish developer Denki.            Anybody who has spent some time with Denki's previous release,            Denki Blocks, will be immediately familiar with the interface. A            little fella with a dodgy moustache is coaching the young Beckham            on his trip to Soccer Island, and instructs him by means of a            speech bubble in the bottom right. From here, the moustachioed one            teaches Beckham about dribbling, running, jumping and using the            ball to collect coins and defeat enemies. When he has the ball,            Beckham can kick it straight along the ground by holding down and            hitting B, or he can angle it upwards by picking a some other            direction first. Monsters require a couple of hits, once on a weak            spot and once again to vanquish them, but Beckham has to be careful            to keep control of his ball.                             The more you run, jump and kick the better Beckham gets at these            key abilities, and you can also pick up ~spells~, which translate            to enhanced ball skills. In the third training level, for example,            you pick up a star which enhances your heading control. As the ball            comes down, instead of bouncing away the ball drops helpfully at            your feet. Other special moves include enhanced dribbling, trapping            and shooting skills, naturally, and it wouldn't be much of a            Beckham game without a ~bending~ skill. Make of that what you will,            eh?                    As you would expect from a Denki title, the graphics are cute,            cuddly and beautifully realised. The tones and thick outlines are            very fitting and extremely agreeable to the eye. And the developer            hasn't been afraid to play with finer detail either - this is the            sort of graphical approach that all those rampant SNES porters            could do with paying attention to.                             The adventure itself is set across 40 or so levels in five zones,            which effectively translates to various graphical changes and not            much else, but the level design is consistently engaging and more            than a little reminiscent of some excellent 16-bit platformers of            old, like the James Pond series and Super Mario World. Beckham goes            about booting enemies off the map and securing skills and coins,            before activating a goal and then popping the ball in it to finish.            Admittedly, the ball-kicking approach to defeating enemies and            collecting items isn't altogether new - we've seen it in games            across the ages from Plok to Rayman under various guises - but the            implementation is excellent, and it would be harsh to criticise            Denki for being unoriginal. They were, after all, charged with            making a decent David Beckham game for the GameBoy Advance, and            they most definitely have.                             The only real criticism I can level at Beckham's adventure is that            it's a mite too easy. Of course from the, cough, ~plot~, it's easy            to work out that this is aimed at those south of my age group, but            even so, I did find it a bit too easy to get past some of the            bosses and when I did finish it, which took only a handful of            hours, I did lust for a bit more.                    It may have an annoying name, and it may star a cute version of one            of the girliest sounding footballers in the country, but he keeps            his mouth shut and what's in a name anyway? Go!Go! Beckham!            Adventure On Soccer Island is probably the best original platformer            released on the GBA this year, and even if you hate football and            hate Beckham, it's definitely worth slipping into his boots."}
