It's            been quite a while in the coming for some reason, but now it's            here.. and very little has changed.                         For those of you who cannot be bothered to go and read my original            review (shame on you!), MRT is a racing title inspired by the Mario            Kart generation. In other words the story is irrelevant to the            action, the action itself is frenetic and half of the challenge is            to make cunning use of the powerups and shoulder-button-jump            powerslides. What is gained by adding a third dimension to the            Mario Kart formula however is also lost against the often            insurmountable challenge and the glitchy graphics.                         MRT places you in the shoes of Chip and Dale, the Chipmunks            (although you can play as other Disney characters too), and            unfortunately for Disneyland you have accidentally dropped some            acorns into the ~magic machine~ that deals with the fireworks            display. As such it has vomitously discharged its electrical            innards and expects you to go and find them again in time for            tonight's show! This is all lovingly explained to you by Mr. Jiminy            Cricket, who appears in beautifully rendered cutscenes and provides            hints in reconstructing the machine on the status page. We still            don't understand why this collecting of pieces takes the form of a            series of races against other Disneyland occupants nor why some of            the races take place at night despite the ~before tonight's show~            emphasis. It's all in the name of fun for the children though, so            we won't knock it.                         What we will knock however, is the graphics, sound, gameplay and            challenge, in that order.                    Our little furry friends have all been gloriously recreated and            look very happy sat in their little choo-choo trains on Thunder            Mountain and so-forth, but there are several issues pertaining to            the graphics that trouble me still. For instance, why do certain            tracks have intricately detailed and textured extras while others            look like they were decorated with finger-paint? Space Mountain,            one of Disney's most expensive and impressive rides has been            desecrated for MRT by artists who believe space travel is visually            reminiscent of two textures flashing over and over.. and on Splash            Mountain too; according to those artists, waterfalls involve blue            sprites that partially obscure the screen and pixels flashing at            the bottom to indicate froth. Thankfully these are targetted            complaints and for the most part the game looks far nicer on the            Dreamcast than it did on the PlayStation, but areas like those in            which the polycount isn't necessarily all that high anyway could            have done with some attention, methinks.                         What was next? Ah, sound. Yes, tricky one this. Developers Crystal            Dynamics are given full reign over possibly some of the most fluid            and entertaining musical scores in the history of anything. Disney            soundtracks are chock-full of memorable tunes and many of them are            to be heard at Disneyland, with ambient speakers picking up from            one another as the people are hurled around the rides. However,            instead of preserving these musical gems, Crystal Dynamics have            sliced them up into little soundbites that are played over and over            again. For example, on Splash Mountain, your ears are pierced by            the soothing melody of the ~Zippadee-doo-da, Zippadee-ay~ tune..            over and over again. The soundbite consists of the opening four            lines of the song repeated throughout and eventually it gets so            tedious you give up in disgust. This is the same for pretty much            all of the tracks. I turned the music off after a couple of levels.                         Now, one area I feel it's a little unreasonable to overly            criticize is the gameplay, since I have already described MRT as            doing ~enough to the karting genre to keep it afresh~ and I            admitted that ~you can't help but feel endeared to it~. Despite            having played it a month or two ago, I still feel the same; MRT is            excellent fun. The way the designers have modelled the tracks            around twelve real Disneyland courses is truly commendable, even            with relatively new attractions like ~Dinosaur~ featured. The only            gameplay-related aspect of MRT I find disagreeable is the level of            difficulty. The other competitors on the race track seem to outwit            and outpace you quite easily, which is a disappointment, and as            such the core audience of children who would lap this game up may            be unable to play it.                    Despite the considerable amount of work that has gone into Magical            Racing Tour, it shoots itself in the foot on several counts. When I            reviewed it some time ago on the PlayStation I gave it an overall            rating of 8/10, pointing out that it has Disney's inimitable charm,            but it was let down slightly by its difficulty level and sound            issues. Further on in the year, much better alternative racers are            starting to appear, and as such it's harder to recommend than it            was. The graphics are definitely an improvement on the PlayStation            version though, and the multiplayer is still good, harmless fun, so            ultimately I'm going to give it the same rating. Check it out if            you don't own the PlayStation version and have a yearning for a            Mario Kart-a-like."}
