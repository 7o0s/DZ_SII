How many videogame characters are            recognised ahead of Mickey Mouse? Just one. It's his instant            accessibility and the courageously groundbreaking design of his            platform games which continues to excite and astound fans of the            series.                    With Super Mario Bros. 3, Nintendo created an iconic platformer            with beautiful design, intelligent pacing and flawless execution.            With Super Mario World it did it all again on a new platform            employing a completely different structure. With Yoshi's Island, it            managed to sideline the character who drives the series and still            produce one of the best 2D platformers to date, and with Super            Mario 64 it shattered illusions and sold a million N64s. How can            Super Mario Sunshine possibly hope to compete?                    As it happens, it can do more than hope.        Ignoring for the            umpteenth time previous conventions, Super Mario Sunshine is set in            the aftermath of Mario 64, as our hero and his entourage depart            Peach's castle and embark on a much needed vacation to the            beautiful tropical island of Delfino. But trouble is afoot as soon            as our heroes' feet touch the runway. A silver brush-wielding Mario            has emblazoned the entire island with graffiti, and unleashed            terrible paint-spewing monsters to transform the delicate setting            further. This will not stand, of course, but before Mario can do            anything about it of his own accord, he's thrown into jail, accused            of performing the heinous act himself, and sentenced to clean the            entire island. The only way to prove his innocence is, ironically,            to carry out his sentence, and to try and figure out along the way            just who or what is responsible.                    To aid the cleanup operation, Professor E. Gadd, who you may well            remember as the mad gadget-building scientist in Luigi's Mansion,            has equipped Mario with a water gun backpack, which can be used to            fire water in a stream ahead of the plumber, or be shot down            underneath him like a jet pack. The two modes are toggled by X, and            the pressure-sensitive right trigger is used to control water flow.            As with Mario 64, the left thumbstick controls Mario's movement,            from a tiptoe through to full pelt, and in Sunshine it's also used            to direct the water cannon. When the R button is fully depressed,            Mario stops still and the thumbstick allows him to direct the water            precisely. The water pressure runs out after a short while,            although the water store is quite expansive - however, a quick trip            to a drinking trough, lake or even the ocean and a tug on the R            button refills and rejuices.                    Other than that, the controls are very much the same as Super Mario            64. Mario can perform the same three-stage jump he could in Mario            64, he can perform a backflip jump - useful for reaching high            platforms in confined spaces - by running one way then quickly            snapping the stick back and jumping the other, and he can pound the            ground by jumping and then pressing the L trigger. Furthermore, he            can slide around like a demented penguin on ice, and he can also            scale heights by jumping from wall to wall - very Crouching Tiger.        Of course, the            control system is about as perfect as we could have hoped. Mario's            adventures still involve performing otherworldly tasks in peculiar            settings to collect stars (or ~shines~ in this case), and control            of him is very simple and easily picked up. Even the addition of            the water backpack doesn't cause any difficulties - you'll quickly            get the hang of switching between modes, hovering over gaps and            using the jetpack mode to reach areas you didn't think possible.            You even develop clever little shortcut moves, like performing a            backflip jump and then using the jetpack to climb a few extra feet            onto a bit of netting in the harbour level, or performing a            three-step jump to get maximum distance and then jetpacking the            rest of the way across a ravine. It's all very intuitive and you'll            fall in love with the changes as if they'd been there since the            very first Mario titles.                    Sadly though, Super Mario Sunshine's one major failing is in the            control department, specifically the camera. The camera in Super            Mario 64 was almost perfect - the several step technique with the            yellow ~camera buttons~ as they became known wasn't quite perfect,            but it was very close. Sunshine's camera gives you more freedom,            allowing complete rotation via the C-stick, but it never quite            gels. The camera always needs minute adjusting, and so you feel            like you're playing with two thumbsticks and not one - and juggling            face button moves like jumping and backpack modes whilst keeping            the camera in check can be maddening, and leads to failure more            than enough times throughout the game. The camera also has a            tendency to clip into scenery here and there, and all in all feels            a bit too messy and unreliable. Not something we're used to in            Mario releases.        Fortunately, Shigeru Miyamoto's minions haven't failed to            produce a lengthy, compelling single player adventure. Some felt            that Mario 64 was simply too easy, but Sunshine is paced somewhat            peculiarly to give you challenge whilst always offering something            simpler. The level hub this time around is the capital of Isle            Delfino, which sits in the shadow of a volcano with a huge sunshine            gong in an arch towering over the town and providing light.            Countless buildings are dotted around, as well as an inlet for            ships - including a boat which will take you out to the furthest            islands if you hang around - and throughout the town lurk a variety            of plump Delfino residents, some of whom will bat you about the ear            for polluting paradise, and some of whom will help you or even            challenge you, which can lead to your winning various bonus shines.                    Levels are not simply hidden in houses and behind portraits though            - Mario has to first collect enough shines that his nefarious            counterpart will expose himself and open up another level. The            first few times, levels are opened as M-shaped portals on statues            and buildings. Mario finds a big splotch of paint, defeats a            painted plant mini-boss and then unlocks the portal, allowing him            to visit various areas of Isle Delfino and continue the cleanup            operation. After a while though, level portals vary from sneakily            hidden green tubes to human cannons and even peculiar sunbeams.                    Level design is typically Miyamoto. Unlike Mario 64, objectives on            a given level have to be completed in a certain order - although            you can tackle levels in any order once you've unlocked a few - and            levels literally morph into different versions of themselves with            each shine you collect. For example, journey to the top of the            windmill on the first level and usurp a petulant paint-spitting            plant and you'll come back to find the entire lake splattered in            paint, and have to use lilies as makeshift rafts in order to get to            coins and other platforms.                    Naturally, there's a great deal more to Mario Sunshine than beating            bosses, bopping enemies on the head and cleaning paint. The sheer            variety in level design and objectives will keep you coming back            for more even if you think you're bored. Complete a series of            objectives which goes something like boss encounter, elastic band            puzzle, flying plant encounter, metal lattice climbing,            octopus-taming and fruit juggling, and you'll find even more            variety in the backpack-less levels. Mario's nemesis, whose            identity is borne out in an explosive rollercoaster ride (no            exaggeration) of a boss encounter after a couple of hours,            occasionally steals Mario's pack and leaves our hero to fend off            obscenely difficult old-school 3D platform levels. These gradually            get harder and harder, with moving platforms, spinning blocks to            climb and hugely tricky, pixel-perfect jumps to perform, and after            a while they go completely mad, taking place in a Pachinko table,            on the back of a flying sand-block bird and worse. You'll run            through lives like confetti as you battle to beat them, but you            always seem to have accrued just the right number to beat them...        The two things we haven't            bothered to go into yet are Mario's graphics and sound. Of course            the gameplay is the defining aspect of the game, and we've been            happy to let you imagine the game in a Mario 64-style setting            because, whether you're happy about it or not, that's what we have            here. The graphics are post-Mario 64 but only by a short distance.            At its heart, apart from increased resolution and a bit more            texture and character detail, the game looks ostensibly the same,            but it's the fine details which keep the game fresh and exciting,            and the way Nintendo's artists have chosen to wield the Cube's            power.                    The first thing you'll realise is that it runs at a smooth 60            frames per second, and that the draw distances are absolutely huge.            Levels are enormous, and unlike the N64, the Cube can handle almost            the entire vista on screen at any given time, with islands in the            background, countless enemies patrolling the screen and palm            fronds, frothing water and shiny reflective platforms. The water            effects throughout the game are certainly stunning - from the way            it flows and trickles as commanded from Mario's backpack to the way            it laps up on the beaches and parts in waves as Mario wades or            splashes into it, and the softness of the reflections - it's a real            eye-opener.                    Elsewhere, character and enemy animation reaches a new high. Mario,            the Princess, Toad, Yoshi and others all look incredibly cute as            they move, and Mario's shiny nemesis is like something out of            Terminator 2. Mario's movement is perhaps the best though -            tiptoeing is exaggerated like a cartoon, whilst walking is            energetic, chest puffed out, and running full pelt sees limbs            flailing and the tippy-tap-tapping of his tiny shoes on pavement,            grass and wood. Like every aspect of Mario Sunshine, the graphics            and sound effects are familiar, yet captivatingly fresh. And the            soundtrack is typical Nintendo - mixing old tunes and new to create            a tropical crescendo - and backs every level with almost unfettered            success.                    Mario is a long game, too, and that's important. Mario 64 was only            criticized for being too easy for all its efforts, and Luigi's            Mansion, not to mention Miyamoto's comments on the subject all            seemed to point to shorter games, more often. Fortunately, Sunshine            is a lot longer. There are 120 shines to collect, and a stupid            number of blue coins, which also make a difference to the end            sequence. To fetch them all is probably going to take the best part            of 20-30 hours, and that's if you don't spend hours exploring the            intricacies of the various levels. We wouldn't like to say how many            hours we've clocked, but it's more time than we've spent playing            the rest of the games which live in Mario's pile on the top of the            TV. Hey ho.                    To say that there has been an air of expectancy surrounding Super            Mario Sunshine is like saying that plumbers don't wear ties. It            seems almost pointless to draw attention to something so glaringly            obvious. This is the sequel to Super Mario 64, the game which            launched a platform and reminded the world that Shigeru Miyamoto            makes the best platform games. Super Mario Sunshine couldn't hope            to shatter boundaries and reshape the genre for a second time, but            it could and has managed to provide one of the biggest and most            entertaining platform games since its illustrious predecessor. The            best game ever? No, but you'd be a fool not to buy it."}
