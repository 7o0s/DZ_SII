The Fou            Empire of the west and an alliance of counties in the east spend            many years fighting over their irreconcilable differences, until            both sides' military power is literally exhausted and a reluctant            armistice is called. Before long though things start going wrong,            and Princess Elena disappears. In order to maintain the peace            accord the desperate efforts of forces in the east to send out            large-scale search parties are thwarted, and it is left to the            Princess' sister Nina to find out what has happened, on her own.                         Breath of Fire IV is the second game in the popular RPG series to            make it to the PlayStation. Unlike Final Fantasy and other Japanese            RPGs though, Capcom's Breath of Fire series takes a more practical            approach, relying on enjoyable gameplay rather than a            groundbreaking story or original characters. Throughout the series            Capcom have recycled Ryu (no relation to the Street Fighter) and            Nina, and for the fourth iteration they are joined by several new            characters; the paranormally gifted Fou-Lu, responsible tribal            leader Cray, paranoid armour-suited Ershin, mercenary soldier Scias            and middle-class leader of the Fou Empire, Ursula. You start off            with control of Nina, who discovers poor Ryu dazed and confused in            a desert basin, and from there you join forces with various            characters you bump into on a quest to unearth the plot behind            Elena's peculiar disappearance.                         Initially fans of the game will probably find it quite tedious            dealing with the relationship between Ryu and Nina for the fourth            time, even though Ryu's powers of metamorphosis and other abilities            are now far more exciting, but as players delve further and further            into Capcom's latest RPG they will find something to excite them.                    The biggest change from the last game is the scale of battles. In            previous games, characters had a maximum of 999 hit points, but for            the fourth game characters can have a total of 9,999 if they play            long and hard enough. As you make your way through the game you            develop attacks which rustle up damage figures of 500 hit points            fairly quickly, while in previous games that sort of damage was            unheard of. Battle sections are often fairly drawn out, with huge            hit point totals to bring down and a real sense of strategy to get            used to. The battle theme is also a lot more stirring than in            previous games.                         Your party members can combine spell attacks in battle to defeat            enemies with greater ease, and once again Ryu can blow a lot of            magic points turning himself into a dragon. But let's face it, you            don't have much defence against a dragon, so generally this is            saved for larger encounters. Morphing into a winged fire-breathing            beast to deal with some of your more casual enemies is rather like            trying to swat a fly using a sledgehammer.                         Although a lot of battles occur through random encounters and boss            encounters in larger towns and monuments on the world map, there            are occasional question mark areas that Ryu, Nina and band can            descend upon. These areas are almost uniformly occupied by large            nasties, but often yield some more interesting items to help deck            out your companions. They are entirely optional - you can wander            past all of them if you're in a hurry - but it's worth stopping off            to build up your characters. As a rule there is barely any reason            to turn down a fight in Breath of Fire IV. I suppose if you spent            the entire game avoiding combat you would be forced to pick and            choose your fights for fear of almost certain destruction, but            that's not how to play a role-playing game now, is it? Especially            not Breath of Fire, where a great deal of the game's poise and            sophistication is found in these encounters and not the storyline            or FMV reels.                    It's a very good thing that Breath of Fire IV endears us with its            battle system though, because it's occasionally let down by its            presentation. As far as the storyline is concerned, compared to            Final Fantasy or Chrono Cross I could take it or leave it - it's            nothing special - but Capcom have concentrated on the battle            system, the spells and characters, and not for instance the            subtleties of full motion video or intricate character detail.            There is a certain amount of FMV, but it's hand-drawn rather than            computer generated, and I doubt it takes up more than a fraction of            the CD, cropping up here and there but by no means everywhere - a            far cry from the award-winning FMV that forced Squaresoft to use 3            CDs in the making of Final Fantasy VII.                         The game's visuals on the whole are very dated. Capcom have used            plenty of polygons in the game's more detailed settings, but have            used sprites throughout for the anime-inspired characters. It's            probably a better effort than Breath of Fire III, but I wasn't            especially thrilled with that. On the other hand, Capcom's latest            does introduce some particularly fine boss characters who are on            the whole generously detailed with some exceptional animation. The            bosses grow in size and ferocity as you plough through the game,            providing a welcome distraction from the claustrophobic confines of            the towns and villages, which polygons or no, look rather grainy            and dated.                         Completing the experience is a much finer soundtrack and            complement of sound effects. Battle accompaniment is much nicer,            and the game introduces harsher tones as the moods of the            characters change. Capcom have used all sorts of instruments,            plucking, blowing and lolling the hell out of them for the sake of            some excellent music, and the sound effects for the big attacks and            such are perfectly fitting. There's even the odd war-cry in battle;            gotta love that.                    It's the little extras that make Breath of Fire IV so compelling            though. Sections of predictable plot development are interspersed            by some amusing sub-games and quests, which drag our characters            into bars and across deserts. One of my favourites was the game of            balancing an old man's drinks and food at the local tavern in one            of the villages. Many of you will recall the fishing sections from            Breath of Fire II on the Super Nintendo forming an almost fanatical            following on their own - this game is much the same.                         Capcom have perhaps let themselves down by releasing Breath of            Fire IV on the PlayStation. It will certainly sell, retailing at a            wallet-friendly \u00a319.99 and featuring some hours of absorbing            gameplay, but I almost wish they had taken the bare bones of the            game and polished them up a bit, perhaps as a PlayStation 2 title.            It's extremely compelling, and certainly a good alternative to a            couple of rounds at the Boot and Slipper, but with new consoles            just around the corner and the Christmas rush to buy PlayStation 2            sure to scupper interest in 'old' PlayStation titles, it may be a            bit of a missed opportunity. That said, there's tremendous scope            for a PS2 disc compilation of all four games. If Capcom's marketing            department is listening - we'd like that, we'd like it rather a            damn lot!                         It seems only fair to end on a bright point, so it's with some            trepidation (and fear of having it shoved in my face actually) that            I'd like to express my delight over the translation from Japanese            to English of the game text. Breath of Fire games have (and this is            where I'm sure I'll cop some flak) been an almost unequalled source            of translation blunders. You only have to read back over some of            the old Breath of Fire II reviews, complete with whole boxouts            dedicated to listing the most disturbing errors, to realise how            much apparent interest they commanded at Capcom. With Breath of            Fire IV though, there's very little to criticize. It might just as            well have been written in English to start with.                    At \u00a319.99, there isn't much excuse for not buying an            RPG like this. Lord knows we barely have enough of them. It may not            have the looks and sheen of Final Fantasy, and it certainly doesn't            equal it in tale, but Breath of Fire IV remains an extremely            compelling and often rewarding RPG, and one certainly worth adding            to your collection.                        -        Breath                    of Fire IV screenshotsBreath                    of Fire IV screenshots"}
