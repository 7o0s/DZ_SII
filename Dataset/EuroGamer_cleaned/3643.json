In the meantime, the 2009 season is getting a run out on Wii and PSP, courtesy of Sumo Digital, another UK studio with a glowing reputation behind the wheel stretching back to its sublime 2004 Xbox conversion of OutRun 2. If the fear is that Codesmasters is simply using the 2009 games as a practice lap for next year's main event, the publisher is determined to demonstrate how seriously it is treating the sport on every platform. Hence the unprompted defence of the Wii version's integrity on a platform that, yes, isn't well known for detailed simulations of anything other than standing on one leg on a plastic tray.F1 2009, then, as you'd expect, is focused exclusively on the season currently dominated by Jenson Button and the Brawn team. The debate Codemasters is having about double-decker diffusers is instructive. Pre-season, some F1 teams included these in their cars to enhance performance, while others didn't bother, assuming they'd be made illegal. Then the FIA decided they were okay and everyone without them scrabbled around with greasy spanners trying to catch up. ~That will be reflected in the game,~ says Waters. The team hasn't quite figured out how; but it's just one of the many '09-specific details being fretted over. Car designs and details are being updated down to the wire so the final product is as accurate as is practically realistic. ~We're cutting off about now in terms of how the cars look and they perform,~ says Waters, speaking to us between the Spanish and Monaco GPs.This is part pursuit of authenticity, and part dealing with the uncompromising, WAG-like demands of a strutting FIA and its teams. Codemasters is far too polite to say it out loud, but it's obvious that getting anything to do with F1 approved is teeth-grinding agony of a magnitude far greater than anything the studio has experienced with its rally games. But that's not to say the F1 teams haven't been helpful. Codemasters says it's visited every team at least once on research and data-gathering missions, with ~cars up on cradles testing engines so we can get audio for them,~ as Waters puts it. ~Their engines pretty much break our audio equipment every time. It's just so, so noisy.~In-game, all this is reflected in a vast and comprehensive set of options to fiddle with. If you care about such things as front anti-roll and spring strength, there are status bars for you to adjust to your heart's content. If your appreciation of mechanical engineering extends no further than ~Ooh, that's a pretty car!~, then you can happily ignore all of this and race with presets. To bridge the gap between ignorance and expertise, we're told your pit crew will explain in real terms the difference any fiddles and tweaks actually make. Which, if handled correctly, could offer valuable insight to the less tech-savvy F1 addict. This also has a wider impact on presentation. ~One of the things we want to move away from is this TV approach to F1,~ explains Waters. ~We want to take the drivers' approach. For example, when you're driving along, instead of hearing commentary like you would on TV, the main information you get about the race is from your race engineer. We've had a number of the real F1 race engineers who put their hand up and said, yeah, we'd like to be involved in that.~The easiest way to look at the game is that F1 is there in as much or as little detail as you care for. You can choose tyre types, and change your fuel stop strategy, for instance. ~If you qualify at the back of the grid, you might want to go heavy on fuel, only do a two-stop strategy,~ says Waters. ~We'll have all of that in-game.~ Or simply let the game take care of that for you. There are 15 driving aids, each of which can be manually applied, from a racing line indicator, to vehicle damage. And this being the Wii, concessions are of course being made to the yoga hardcore."}
