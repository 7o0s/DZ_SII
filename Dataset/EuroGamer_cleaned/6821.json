If you spent a large sum of money on importing the Cube and            its three major releases, you will certainly feel that way. The N64            version of Wave Race, chaperoned through development by Shigeru            Miyamoto, whose name is so synonymous with high quality releases            that even our word processor recognises it, was heralded as a            breakthrough in aquatic visuals and the first truly impressive            jet-ski game.                         Blue Storm does wonders with its legacy, even if the game is            effectively an update, comprising the N64 version's four original            courses, as well as a peculiarly named addition, Ethnic Lagoon and            a few unlockables. The original courses have been reworked            slightly, and new weather effects add variation and depth to the            experience.                         The single player game consists of a single Exhibition            (qualification) round, followed by a series of three circuits,            which I am happy to describe as intermediate, hard and impossible.            Players take up the mantle of one of eight characters, each with            their own coach and unique character attributes, and race in these            circuits, unlocking the next challenge if successful. The idea is            to amass points by placing respectably, and thanks to the weather            system there is a degree of strategy to consider. Each circuit is a            certain number of days long, with a race set on each, and weather            forecasts are offered for up to three days in advance. The trick is            to choose the tough ones to complete on the clear days, saving the            easier races for tough conditions.                    In terms of visuals, Blue Storm lives up to its ancestry. Like the            N64 version, the rolling waves and bobbing riders will have your            jaw firmly glued to the floor, and although the PAL version of the            game runs at 50Hz, the virtually borderless display and            optimisation has rescued the game from its predecessor's fate, and            load times are mercifully short. In clear conditions it's often            possible to see right the way to the bottom of the lake, ocean or            lagoon upon which you race, and choppy conditions mist the water            over, while rain creates a fancy speckled effect on the lens of the            third person camera following your rider, rather as though you were            driving through a storm.                         Even in the grip of a Tsunami (which can happen), the GameCube            copes admirably with the framerate and detail including rider            reflections, hand gestures and multiple jet-skis. Killer whales and            dolphins, citizens of the oceanic kingdom, race along beneath you,            occasionally surfacing to produce an obstacle, all the while your            coach is yelling instructions and encouragement in your ear and            alerting you to their activities.                         However there are a few problems, visually. For a start, the            backgrounds are noticeably low resolution. Huts and vegetation            looks quite shoddy racing around an island, and rocks, icepacks and            floating wooden crates in the harbour level look a bit blocky.            Admittedly, often you are far too busy racing to concentrate on            problems like these. However on some tracks, notably the new Ethnic            Lagoon, if you race through the finish line too close to the left            side of the track, the cameraman, who pans round to capture your            celebration or frustration from the side, often clips through            scenery.                    The control system is, like the N64 version, fairly simple and            intuitive, with a degree of depth for those who like to showboat.            The left analogue stick will not only turn you, but moving the            stick forwards or backwards changes your rider's position, useful            if you need to affect a tight turn or you don't want to drop too            much speed to perform a simple adjustment. Acceleration is handled            by the A button, but you won't want to be holding that the whole            time, and the B button provides a useful crouching facility,            improving aerodynamics and thus, providing a useful augmentation of            your rider's speed racing down straights. A new addition - the            Turbo boost, accumulated by passing a number of buoys correctly -            is activated by Y or Z, and a tug on the left or right            pressure-sensitive triggers will see your rider lean in that            direction. Turning too sharply while leaning can unseat him. Or            her.                         Tricks are possible, and the manual dedicates a generous four            pages to listing them. These can all be learnt in the helpful            in-game tutorial mode, which will take you through the basics, then            the hard stuff, then the impossible stuff, with useful pre-recorded            videos to illustrate techniques. Putting the tricks to use in the            single payer game may be a bridge too far for some, but fortunately            a dedicated Stunt mode is included, giving you a lap on each of the            courses with added jumps and hoops to manoeuvre through instead of            buoys to slalom. Learning lots of tricks will help you to rewrite            the high score leaderboard, allowing you to demonstrate to any            upstarts who question your Stormy crown with overwhelming authority            that you are, in fact, the man.                         Further to the single player tasks, up to four players can take            part in a split-screen multiplayer race, and while the game does            sacrifice some detail to achieve this, it remains an object of            visual splendour. Splashback on the PlayStation 2 has difficulty            looking this good, for instance.                    The overall feel of the game is extremely tight. You do seem to be            racing a jet-ski across a body of water, and the water is teeming            with life, sometimes froth and often your unseated rider. Apart            from coming unstuck regularly, you can also look forward to losing            speed and Turbos if you miss a buoy. The physics can be extremely            unforgiving as well, and the game doesn't make any effort to point            your rider in the right direction as he clambers back aboard after            a spill, which often helps to convert a five second lead into a two            second deficit, but the game is meant, at least in part, to            be a simulation.                         The occasional frustration of an undignified exit from the top            three is waylaid, if you ask me, by the game's unparalleled depth.            It's true, N64 fans will be disappointed to see rehashes of old            courses instead of new environments to explore, and the number of            possible shortcuts in each track is quite small, with harsh            penalties in store for those who deviate and fail to make them            properly. But the dynamic nature of a lot of the courses, with new            obstacles popping up throughout the races thanks to the tide,            weather conditions and wildlife, more than make up for this. And            supplementing this diet of salt water and wipe-outs is a replay            system which spits out videos almost as impressive as those seen in            Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec, particularly after stunt sessions.                         The difficulty, from the average gamer's perspective, is that            (along some might say with Rogue Leader) Blue Storm is            disproportionately hard when placed next to the likes of Luigi's            Mansion, Super Monkey Ball and Pikmin. And racing on water can be            extremely frustrating. It certainly had me swearing profusely on            more than one occasion, as my elderly neighbour will probably be            able to testify. She's a bit hard of hearing, too. But even I had            difficulty discerning the soundtrack music from the roar of engines            and the incessant nagging about buoy orientation from the coach in            my ear. The fairly boring techno beats do little to complement the            action, although do offer some faintly perceptible background noise            besides the lapping of the waves\u2026                    Blue Storm provides a nice challenge for those of you who have been            waiting since the 64-bit version to take it for a burn, but casual            racing fans may want to steer clear. The controls, physics and            visuals are all of the utmost high quality, and the engine noises            and audio accompaniment, both from your coach and the track            announcer are crystal clear. There's even a chap with a British            accent, so bonus points there. There are a lot of extras to uncover            apart from the tricky single player circuits, and overall it's an            accomplished release. If jet-ski racing tickles your fancy, buy            this."}
