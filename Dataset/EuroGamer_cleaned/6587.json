While it's true that his            games are relatively good fun, up until recently the formula was            set in stone, sealed in a ten-inch thick steel casket and buried            400 miles below the surface of the earth, and we got bored of it            with Mega Man 7 on the SNES. But thanks to the Legends and Battle            Network series, we're starting to enjoy life as a blue-suited,            laser-armed loony with a thirst for justice once again. So you can            understand our initial frustration with Mega Man & Bass, which            is reading from the old script.        You            know how it works by now. You've got a selection of well-designed            but ultimately predictable platform stages, packed with enemies to            blast, and a boss robot, whose attack patterns you'll have to undo,            and whose particular weapon you'll attain afterward. These days            though, it would take a multi-screen-filling, Death Star equivalent            super-boss to keep us on our toes, and MM&B's efforts are a bit            lacklustre compared to what we'd like at this stage in the series.                    Changes this time obviously include the name checked Bass, whose            abilities differ to our traditional hero's, and unlike previous            Mega Man titles (Mega Men?) there are 100 CDs scattered across the            game worlds which obviously need collecting. Graphically, it's            pretty obvious fare - lots of smoothly contoured sci-fi worlds with            no-frills, SNES-level visuals which offer little by way of            inspiration but rarely put a foot wrong either. The fundamentals of            the game engine haven't changed in ten years, so if you've ever            played Mega Man then this will seem familiar.                    However, it's not just the fundamentals that don't change, because            although we don't have time to go through all the other games to            confirm it, we'd swear on the graves of our collective Mothers that            we've faced a couple of these bosses before. Some of the levels            look familiar too. Surely Capcom isn't recycling the same old crap            pixel-for-pixel now?                    On the whole, Mega Man fans will find plenty to do here. It's a            goodly-sized adventure with plenty of stages, and countless games            have given Capcom a chance to hone the graphics and level design to            near-perfection. It can be quite difficult, but it's never            fiendishly so, and there's still plenty of creativity within the            old formula. It's just that it is so very old, and with the much            better Battle Network series about to spew out another hopefully            excellent GBA game, Mega Man & Bass seems like a silly thing to            buy. If you want a Blue Bomber game for your new SP or something,            wait and see how the next Battle Network title turns out. If by            some bizarre twist of fate it turns out badly, buy this."}
