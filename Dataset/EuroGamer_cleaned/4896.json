For some                 reason Europe received what was described as a ~patched~                 version, but that just makes me shudder to think what the                 original was like...                    The trip back into Britannia in the latest episode of the            long-running Ultima series is a sumptuously detailed and very            involving one. The game is expansive and engaging, with hundreds of            NPCs to interact with a balanced mix of action, puzzle-solving and            adventuring.                    The problem is that only a very small quantity of players will be            able to enjoy it, since even the most advanced computers take a            severe performance hit from the game.                    Here's an example; my home system is a PIII-450, 256Mb RAM and a            32Mb GeForce DDR - nothing to smirk at, and yet I was bewildered to            get a mere 10 frames per second, or even lower at times. The game            is just not enjoyable.                    Those of you who own a decent 3dfx Voodoo card are in luck, as the            game performs much better on that platform. My own Voodoo3 2000            card (a much less impressive card than the GeForce DDR under normal            circumstances) squeezed a more impressive 15-20 frames per second            out of the game, though I shouldn't be forced to change my machine            around in order to play this tripe...         I shall try not to                 mention the abysmal framerate again, instead I'll focus on the                 rest of the aspects of Ultima Ascension that annoy me                 vehemently, while trying to iterate how much of a love-hate                 relationship I have with this game.                    As the Avatar, you begin the game in your house on Earth, viewing            the proceedings from a third-person perspective. Having located            your journal, backpack and other items, you manoeuvre the Avatar            around the back of his house, admiring the splendiferous texturing            along the way. The sound effects (although stuttery on my ageing            SoundBlaster card) were very well sampled and the overall effect            was extravagant yet simplistic.                    Walking into a nearby cave gave me my first taste of battle, with a            few oversized rats which were dispatched with alarming ease, rather            like the bunny rabbits that litter the fair plains of Asheron's            Call. Apart from the inherent problems with control due to the bugs            and such, Ascension's interface is impressively simple to learn.                    Entering the portal to Britannia was preceded by an interesting            conversation with a Gypsy, who posed seven questions to determine            Avatar's role in Britannia. Entering the portal was where the game            truly began in earnest...         The framerate was a                 big crux here - the sprawling land of Britannia made the game                 utterly unplayable, so I lowered the draw distance and about                 every other setting I could find in an effort to increase it.                    It started to look visually unappealing, and the improvement in            frame rate was negligible. I haven't had an opportunity to try it            out on my friend's Pentium III 800 machine, but I am reliably            informed it's no better on a machine of that spec, even with a            high-end Voodoo3 3500.                    Conversing with the NPCs was rather irksome as well, largely due to            the missed frames as the camera panned from character to character.            It's not just underperformance either; the game is actually rife            with software flaws and bugs. You can be dumped back to Windows            simply for attempting to load a game (a flaw I was assured wouldn't            present itself in the European revision of the game), and I was            often rendered defenceless by an arrow supply that magically            diminished whenever it felt like it.                    The clipping is totally bizarre as well. Creatures and enemies            needn't hide behind trees or anything, they can simply hide            in them! Or within the walls. Hell, they can just magically            appear from nowhere; if the game wants to stack the odds in favour            of your opponents, it may as well do so with impunity.                    Creatures repeatedly beat the living daylights out of you before            you can get a shot off, and even when you do, you run the risk of            an arrow simply passing through them. Never place your backpack on            the ground either, unless it's in the middle of a clearing,            otherwise it may just vanish through a wall, completely out of your            reach.         For all my disgust at the incomplete state Ascension is in            though, it is a fantastic RPG. The interface, hotkeys and system of            play is very impressive and intuitive, and despite the fact that            you can't see them properly most of the time, the special effects            are charming.                    In fact as an RPG, assessed for its story, characters and game            world, Ascension is unequalled. Even my beloved            Final            Fantasty VIII is on an altogether much lower plain. Yet the            game is so severely crippled and hindered at every turn by bugs and            programming errors, that it is impossible to recommend its purchase            to anyone. We shouldn't abide this sort of complacency and general            disregard for the paying public.                    Amusingly, the game is not content with just being buggy and            impossible to play though, it also suffers from several design            flaws. Like your inability to view which items Avatar is equipped            with, and the way that you are only informed of how much health you            are being deducted when fighting enemies.                    If you own a well-specced machine with a 3dfx-based chipset at its            heart, you may well enjoy Ascension, but don't be fooled into            thinking that it's just got a frame rate problem - the game is full            to the brim with bugs and glitches, and no amount of hardware            improvement can eliminate them.                    At the end of the day, I abhor Ascension and what it's become, and            by buying it you are allowing unprofessional developers to make a            profit on the gullibility of the gaming public. I doubt you want to            be a part of that..."}
