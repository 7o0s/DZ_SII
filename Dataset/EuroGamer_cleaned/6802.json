In the videogame of the same name - now            available on Xbox - it's piloted by a librarian of a Jedi Master            named Adi Gallia. Adi's tale begins with an assignment from the            Jedi Council to investigate a disturbing trend of unrest in the            Karthakk system, a system under the suspected leadership of Count            Dooku and teeming with Trade Federation types. Something odd is            going on there, and Adi has to go and find out what, allying with            tentacled space pirate Nym, the only surviving playable character            from Jedi's predecessor Star Wars Starfighter.                         Obviously the game has had to move from the Dual Shock to the Xbox            controller, and it's a surprisingly painless transition. The left            analogue pad controls pitch and the right analogue rolling and            centering on surface levels, whilst the shoulder buttons allow you            to adjust your speed, A controls basic lasers, B handles secondary            weapons (for Nym) or Force powers (playing as Adi), and the other            face buttons switch targeting. You can pick from the two views,            external and nosecone, using the 'Back' button.                        Overall the system works just as well as it did on the PS2 because            there is little need to reach over the top of the face buttons and            brush X or B accidentally, although as with the PS2 version, the            Options menu doesn't make it clear whether inverted pitch is on or            off by default, and you can easily pick the wrong one and then have            to exit and go back in to make the change. For your reference,            pitch is inverted by default - stick with it.                    The Xbox port of the game has also picked up a handful of            improvements. The greater power of the console has given LucasArts            the opportunity to iron out some, but not all, of the single player            slowdowns, and to enhance the various explosions and other minutiae            with a blurry white translucency, which is an improvement over the            blocky, insubstantial blasts from the original. Thankfully they've            also smoothed out the previously clunky menu interface, but other            than that it's graphically the same as the PS2 game. That isn't a            huge problem though; ships are reasonably detailed, and the larger            vessels have moving turrets and other surface attractions, which            can be destroyed individually to soften the ship up for juicier            bombing runs.                        Furthermore, Xbox owners are privy to a new multiplayer level set            on Coruscant. LucasArts would have you believe it was kept over for            the Xbox version, but we suspect it was simply too judderingly slow            on the PS2 hardware to be playable. Available as a prize for            achieving one of the bonus objectives in the single player game,            the Coruscant level is a kind of capture-and-hold game with            commentary from the annoying two-headed sports announcer            fromEpisode I, and even on the Xbox it chugs. It may feature the            Slave 1 (in a total mismatch against one of the allied ships from            the single player game), but the framerate is too poor and the            screen too busy for it to be all that enjoyable.                         However, the rest of the game is. The three episode single player            game gives you a fair mixture of levels in Adi's Jedi Starfighter            and Nym's Havoc, and the plot is quite engaging thanks to the            vastly differing personalities of the cautious, mindful Adi and her            gung-ho Han Solo-cast comrade Nym, and the voice-acting throughout            from virtually every character hits the spot, both in-game and            during the competent cutscenes. Mission objectives change as you            play, bathing the adventure in excitement and giving it a very            unpredictable feel, and there are some terrific cameos from            recognisable ships like the early Star Destroyers, Trade Federation            capital ships and even a planetary ion cannon!                    Jedi Starfighter has made a perfectly reasonable transition to the            Xbox from its previous home on the PlayStation 2, and now occupies            the position of the best Star Wars game on the Xbox. It's a            completely different proposition to the Cube's Rogue Leader, and a            lot easier to boot, although a mixture of difficulty levels, a            two-player co-operative mode and a huge number of secret bonuses to            unlock (including various ships for use in the single player game,            like the X-Wing, TIE Fighter, TIE Advanced and Slave 1) mean that            you will certainly need to allot a good deal of time if you plan to            complete it thoroughly. As an accompaniment to the movie, this is            first class, and as a game in its own right, it makes a Forceful            impression."}
