{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/i-ball-review", "date": "26 Oct 2007", "game_name": "I Ball", "text": "Most of the time, the whole 8-bit budget software scene was a bit of a bad joke on those stupid enough to waste their pocket money/ paper round on them. You generally got exactly what you paid for: crap, derivative pap with cheap cover art, an inlay with barely any instructions, and a game on cassette knocked out by novice coders trying to make a name for themselves. But now and then, Firebird or Mastertronic would unearth a real gem that was easily the rival of games retailing at four times the price. I Ball was definitely one of the best examples.With the prolific Rob Hubbard twiddling the audio knobs, it grabbed everyone's attention by announcing itself upon loading, screaming ~I Ball! I-I-I-I I-Ball! I Ball!~, before one of Hubbard's trademark stomping tunes goaded you to play this wickedly addictive vertically scrolling shooter.But unlike so many of the boring me-too shooters in this crowded genre, I Ball had a quirky visual style on its side, and some rather curious gameplay mechanics to help differentiate it from the sludge.The general idea was to guide I Ball (literally a ball, with, um, an eye) through a scrolling enemy infested and trap-laden environment, from the bottom right to the top. Armed with a sort of bubble gun that fired front and rear simultaneously, you could slip past enemies while they were shimmering the colours of the rainbow - but you become vulnerable as soon as they become solid. So the game felt slightly unnatural because you were constantly brushing past enemies and giving them the slip - something you'd never normally do.Set across 16 levels, it was fairly repetitive stuff after a while, but the amusement value gleaned from hearing him scream ~Oh no!~ when you died, and ~Game Over!~ at the end were the stuff that teenage kicks were made of back in the late '80s."}
