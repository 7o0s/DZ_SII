In their last                 game, Codename Eagle, you played a British agent with the                 unlikely name of ~Red~, who was revealed in an                 (unintentionally) hilarious cutscene half way through the game                 to really be the rightful heir to the Russian throne.                    Their new game, Tzar, sees you taking on the role of Sartor, a            simple villager who discovers one day that he is actually the son            of the slain King Roan, saved from the ruins of his father's castle            and hidden in the village to keep him safe. Things go downhill from            here on in, with much talk of magical crystals, evil messiahs,            ancient wars, dark forces, and powerful mages...                    The ~plot~ (such as it is) is presented by in-game cutscenes, using            on-screen text with a little picture of the character who is            speaking next to it. Clicking your way through the poorly written            script is dull and tedious, and to make things worse the            characters' faces have all been put through Kai Goo a few too many            times, leaving them looking bizarrely deformed.         And the game                 itself isn't any better... Infinite Loop seem to have set out                 to clone Age of Empires II, but failed miserably somewhere                 along the line.                    The units and buildings on offer are eerily similar, but lacking            the wider variety and meticulous play balancing that made Age of            Empires II so much fun. Orcs, dwarves, mages, and other            stereotypical fantasy units are added to the mix, but don't really            add anything new to the game.                    The resource system is identical to the one in Age of Empires II,            with gold and stone to quarry, wood to chop, and food to get by            farming, fishing, or raising livestock.                    You can build a market (sorry, tavern) which allows you to trade            one type of resource for another. You can build lumber mills and            storage yards to house the wood, stone and gold you are producing,            and which also allow you to research improved technologies, many of            which are lifted verbatim from Age of Empires II as well.                    The unit graphics and animations are actually very good, but the            buildings are crude and cartoon-like in comparison. One nice touch            though is the game's day and night cycle, which changes the            brightness and colour of the world as the sun rises and sets.                    The sounds are repetitive and stunningly mediocre for the most            part, and to cap it all the stereo option doesn't seem to work            properly - all the sounds came out the wrong speakers, and there's            no reverse stereo mode unless you go into 3D surround sound. MIDI            music didn't work either, and although there is a CD music option            there didn't seem to be any music on the CD...         The single player campaign is made up of twenty                 missions, though the first of these is essentially an                 overblown in-game cutscene that drags on for far too long. The                 later missions can take an hour or more to complete though,                 and often get tedious and frustrating.                    The AI is uniformly poor, and the game relies on outnumbering you            by ten to one to make the single player campaign challenging. Play            the computer on a random map in skirmish mode with fair starting            conditions and it will flounder, putting up little or no resistance            as you take control of the map.                    Pathfinding isn't much good either. Units sometimes get completely            lost, or get stuck on a small piece of impassable terrain and are            then seemingly unable to find a way around it. Group together            several units and try to move them and they will attempt to stay in            whatever ~formation~ they happen to be in, even if they are just            randomly scattered across the screen. This soon gets frustrating.                    And the stupidity doesn't end there. Instead of running for cover,            enemy units will just stand dumbly in the line of fire of ranged            weapons such as catapults, archers and cannons, unless they can            find a direct way to attack them.                    In one mission I managed to completely block the only bridge over            which the enemy could reach my base with a stone wall, and for half            an hour the computer just kept massing his troops on the far side            of the river without thinking to try and demolish it. Meanwhile I            had built several towers, which promptly picked off all his troops            one by one without any resistance.         Tzar is a mediocre real time strategy game which                 tried to pilfer the best features of Age of Empires II and                 Warcraft, but ended up as a soulless mish-mash that fell far                 short of its aims.                    Tzar isn't a bad game as such, just utterly unremarkable and            unimaginative. It really doesn't bring anything new to the genre,            and given that it is so uncannily like Age of Empires II, you might            as well just go and buy that instead..."}
