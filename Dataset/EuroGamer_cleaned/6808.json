Now, I'm afraid            we've had to reject your application for best football game ever.            I'm sorry son, but in the areas of control, authenticity, graphics            and AI, your big brother Pro Evo still has you beat. I know you            were hoping to come up with a nice arcadey alternative, but it            hasn't happened. Even at its lowest level, Pro Evo is yer daddy.            Fortunately for you though, things are looking up with your latest            outing. I'm impressed by the speed at which you move, particularly            at your ability to get on with the game instead of wasting half a            minute per stoppage, and in addition I like your player modelling,            which in terms of size, facial expressions, mouths, eyes and            whatnot actually outdoes FIFA!                         What I would say you need to work on is the lack of close control            exhibited throughout, the repetitive long shot-save-corner cycle            and the number of options for custom leagues. I also think you            could do with a custom cup feature, especially since you've only            gone and popped up five minutes prior to World Cup 2002! You also            need to tone down your excessively flamboyant interface; I mean, we            all like a bit of glitz, but let's not waste the player's time, eh?            And furthermore, that repeating grass texture with LOD .. it looks            like that late-night snowstorm effect off the TV. I'm not kidding,            lad.                         Perhaps the most aggravating aspect of your application though is            the things you've almost got right. You've opted to include            a practice mode, but surely you need a keeper? And what's all this            constant restarting from the centre spot? Daft if you ask me, pal.            You've tried to get some commentary sorted out I see, but John            Champion is a tit who can't string words together at the best of            times, and in your application he's a tit who repeats the act of            not stringing the same words together over the course of several            minutes. Mark Lawrenceson was a good choice though, even if he also            repeats himself quite often.                    Chin up though, eh? I like the way your app feels, even if the            camera bobbles a bit in the close-up sections, and if you ask me,            using the same control system as Pro Evo was a stroke of genius. I            knew exactly how to play it from the first whistle, and it's not            often I can say that! The lack of a learning curve for people            who've had a go with ya before is going to be a big plus point            'ere, because most of us just want something accessible to kick            about during the World Cup, and you can fill that hole            marvellously. Okay so you don't have as much transition animation            as Pro Evo, but who does? You've still got some top player models            on your side and you've got the way the ball and the keeper move            more or less spot on.                         And okay, your AI is pretty dreadful, refusing to run towards the            most obvious of balls with no excuses about the stats being            responsible, but at least it's consistent. It's hard to beat them            on the toughest level, even for a Pro Evo vet' like me! You've got            all the world's teams, even if only 'alf the players have their            real names thanks to FIFPro, and you can pick your ref, your            stadium, your match length and all that. It's a nice package. Slap            it into multiplayer and there's a real hoot to be had, too.                         The best bit of the whole game though is your free kick and corner            system. The 'orizontal power bar looks stupid to begin with, but            it's really versatile. You pick yer direction and the height you            want to hit it, then you hit the button once to set the ticker            movin', another time to choose the power behind it and then once            again when it comes back to the start to actually boot it, with the            final cursor position on either side of the starting point adding            the curve. Different players have different skills in this area,            and it's much better than the virtual lack of an interface in Pro            Evo\u2026                    You know son, I think there's a market for you out there, I just            don't think you should have aimed so high. You've not got the legs            on your brother, and all this fancy pants dilly-dallying with grass            textures and interface is a red herring. You're quick and            accessible though, which is a darn sight more than some others I            could mention, and you're the only game I've seen where a Beckham            free kick looks like a Beckham free kick beyond the run-up, and            even hits the back of the bloody net half the time too. Lots of            goals, lots of glamour and nippy gameplay. Enough? Not up to you            now, lad..."}
