Although you could (and, ahem, we did) spend more time            playing GTA3 than most of the rest of the PS2's back catalogue put            together, DMA Design's, sorry, Rockstar North's inspirational            genre-blender was ripped to shreds by fans within a matter of            months. They wanted more. We wanted more. Now we have more. And            we'll make no pretence otherwise: Vice City lives up to the hype.        Before we get into the whys and wherefores though, we'll take            you on a short (and probably rather unnecessary) refresher course            in what to expect. After guiding a nameless, muted escaped con            through the streets of Liberty City, this time we've been given            control of a character with something to say for himself. Tommy            Vercetti is fresh out of the clink, and mob bosses in Liberty have            sent him packing to Vice City to try and get a handle on the drugs            business (and keep him out of the way). When that goes awry, Tommy            is forced to press his connections with a crooked lawyer and            various local kingpins to try and eke out those responsible for his            misfortune. On the way, he'll handle work for a number of bosses            all over town, whilst causing untold mayhem on the city streets and            playing all sides against one another. No surprises there.                    The plot that runs through the game is a lot stronger than GTA3's,            mostly thanks to Tommy's inclusion. The narrative is nicely            scripted, the missions forming a cohesive part as always, and like            GTA3, allegiances change with the wind. Characters from GTA3 are            woven into play here and there - you'll hear Toni manning Flash FM            (the cleverly named precursor to Flashback FM), Fernando            plying his trade on Emotion and there's an amusing entrance for a            young Donald Love. And it's not just the characters - you'll still            be searching for unique jumps, standout weapons (like the sniper            rifle) and even hidden packages, of which there are the requisite            100. We had thought these were absent from Vice City, until we            found one the other day - the realisation of just how much more            there was to find and do was quite startling.        On the whole, Rockstar has done plenty to catch the attention            of GTA3 fans, whilst filling the game with extras. Gary Penn,            formerly of DMA Design, often used to bang on about a Digital            Toyset, and to extend the metaphor, Vice City offers a Christmas            morning's worth of additions. The most talked about are motorbikes,            which range from the amusingly named scooter-alike, the Faggio, to            some monstrous Harley Davidson types and speedy superbikes, and            helicopters, which also play a larger part, with Tommy taking up            the role of passenger in an early mission, sniping cartel members            from their rooftop perches, before grabbing the controls later on            for himself. Choppers are a fantastic addition, and you'll enjoy            the build-up prior to getting hold of them. In one mission, you get            to practice the controls you'll later rely on by guiding a remote            control version with bombs attached to it - very clever.                    Other, lesser additions which have perhaps slipped us by include            the ability to take over small businesses to supplement your income            and act as safehouses, to acquire your former bosses' tenements            having offed them, the ability to leap from moving vehicles            (incredibly useful, and roaringly cinematic as you charge, engine            blazing, into certain death only to scramble aside at the last            minute), and the chance to swap rags. Like dumping, switching or            respraying cars, changing clothes at one of the various boutiques            around town will give you a better chance of evading John Law.            You'll also have to dress in various get-ups for certain missions,            perfect for convincing the Haitians that the Cubans just whacked            their leader, or conning your way onto a golf course to perform a            golf buggy-riding hit.                    And as you would expect, there's a greater arsenal of weapons, from            melee additions like the hammer, meat cleaver and golf club to            heavier duty tools like the Ruger assault rifle. The police            continue their six-star assaults, although they seem a lot smarter            in this incarnation, causing untold trouble even at a 2/6 wanted            level. We're also a bit concerned about Ferrari-driving cops, who            drive like lunatics and pack machine guns. Ouch.        Like GTA3, you start off with a small environment and have to            branch out by completing a number of missions. Come away from the            first chopper-based mission and you'll have the city's second            island to play with, and various new bosses to talk to. Some will            call you on your cellular phone (which is suitably chunky for the            day), which you pinched earlier on, whilst others will request a            private audience. However the cut-scenes that once served so            uniformly as mission briefings now edge closer to cinematics, with            actual (and, brace yourself, amusing) dialogue between Tommy and            his employers, who all seem rather taken with his masochistic            tendencies. This is largely thanks to the work of a team of            sterling voice actors, which includes such luminaries as Ray            Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, er, Jenna Jameson, hrm, that            Tubbs bloke out of Miami Vice, and plenty more.                    And for once, the main character isn't alone in his pursuit of,            well, money. Various non-player characters (including the            charismatic, sports car-driving Lance 'Quentin' Vance) will work            alongside Tommy, showing up at odd moments.                    And missions are a lot better in Vice City. Some of the missions in            GTA could be quite boring, if it's now safe to say it, but you            never get that feeling in Vice City. You can of course continue            with vigilante, fire-fighting, ambulance and taxi missions in your            spare time, and there's even a sniff of pizza boy about some of it,            but that's only if you're bored. And you won't be. Some of your            objectives are absolutely ludicrous, but there's always huge            diversity in what you can do - to take an arbitrary point as an            example, you could find yourself faced with a turf war mission.            This has you killing lots of Haitians (including a mean sniper) and            hauling their drugs van back to base camp. However, you could            instead opt to work for the Haitians by retrieving their            drug stashes from around town before the police get there. Or you            could just work for one of the mansion-bound drug bosses with a            golf course for a front garden, who wants you to whack somebody. Of            course, you'll only find yourself in this position if you can get            round a number of checkpoints in two minutes to impress the locals.            In a speedboat - did I mention that?        Missions are spread all over both islands, and your hotel (the            game's only save point early on) is located on just the one, so            you'll often find yourself with a hefty drive to pick up some work.            Indeed, if you find yourself wasted and left outside a hospital,            you could have to travel for five minutes to pick up some hardware            from Ammu-Nation, five more minutes to go get the job and a further            five to get to the battle. However, buying up one of the many            properties that are available for sale and the save points begin to            open up, while taxis park outside hospitals to take you straight to            the mission you've just failed. It's nice touches like these that            make Vice City even more compelling.                    There are definitely criticisms to be made, and plenty less            incidental than the above, but then that's hardly surprising. The            islands are perhaps a bit flat compared to Liberty City - you'll            never fly 200 feet straight down off the top of a dam, for example,            and you won't hurtle down bendy avenues with the cops in tow, but            there are some tremendous hidden (and not so hidden) jumps to            enjoy, not to mention a plethora of multi-storey car parks and            countless humpback bridges to fly off.                    But you can't make something this big this quickly without a few            rough edges showing through. Significantly, there are some beastly            load times in there, but then we can put up with a dodgy waiter            when the main dish is so delicious. We could also point an            accusatory finger at the cameraman from time to time, and it's a            little maddening to see that character animation and models haven't            been smartened up at all. Still, it takes more than a few flies to            spoil a broth this good. One such fly, or bug,            though, is the ability to get stuck in terrain whilst on the cell            phone, and you'll also spot a few glitches, like odd character            behaviour in the opening split-second of cut sequences, and            occasional clipping issues - such as when a whole road vanished            beneath us when we drove. Ugly, but of little consequence.        But the good outweighs the bad by miles. It may look almost            identical to GTA3, but it builds on the game in almost every way.            (And in strict fairness, the visuals are very nice in places, and            everything looks suitably '80s, particularly the clothing, and the            way the sun flits in and out of your eyes is genius, with rain            spots on the camera too). But dialogue is indeed richer, the            soundtrack is much, much better (and well worth buying for            \u00a329.99, we'd say), the radio banter is just as funny and            there's more of it, the cars are often juicier, the bikes are speed            demons, there are seamless new additions like the way your body            hurtles over bonnets as you crash, and the way you leap out of cars            in mid-air, the missions objectives are much more diverse and there            are in the region of 80 of them, the weapons are meatier and the            targeting's slightly better (albeit still fiddly). All that and it            took us about 30 hours to top off all the main missions. That put            us at about 40 per cent complete on the 'stats' page, with loads            more to worry about.                    However, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is, in our opinion, the            developer's clearly rebellious nature. As you edge past cars on the            highway by night, glancing up at the phallic skyscraper in the near            distance, you'll realise it's even more phallic for the giant meat            and two veg implied by the illuminated windows. And it's Rockstar            North's obsession with detail that will see Vice City emerge as            another big winner. Most of the fun you'll have in Vice City is            down to what you can find off the beaten track - beach balls,            destruction derbies, and much more. Hopefully temptation won't get            the better of them, and we will get a proper sequel next time, but            as far as one-year-mission-packs go, Vice City is the finest of            all. And since you've already bought it, we'll simply wish you bon            app\u00e9tit.        Tom's Rating - 10/10                        When Vice City was first announced to the world, it sounded like it            would be a nice stopgap release to keep the millions of GTA3 fans            happy. Little did we know just how far Rockstar would go to make            this 'filler' become the most anticipated new release of the year.                    But there is a massive difference between how you'll feel playing            GTA3 and Vice City for the first time. For one thing, when GTA3            came along it was a bolt out of the blue, and a heady voyage of            discovery as you realised just how deep the game really was. There            was no hype, no build up, no hysterical previews, no review code,            just a finished game, in a box, you and your PS2.        This time around there's a reputation to live up to, and not            only that, Rockstar has oiled the PR machine so that magazines            everywhere have been devoting huge sections to preview coverage,            and subsequently have thrown around 97 per cent review scores like            confetti. There have been spoilers literally everywhere, so            essentially a lot of the element of surprise that you had playing            GTA3 will be replaced by an excited sense of expectation.                    Your initial experiences of Vice City will reveal only a few subtle            changes from its predecessor, but this is most definitely not just            GTA3 with new missions. For a start, the frame rate and speed of            the faster vehicles is noticeably quicker, making car chases even            more insane than before. You can explore indoor locales (albeit            with a small load delay), the weapon and vehicle count is mind            boggling, the visuals have a smarter sheen to them, (with cars            shimmering with a heat haze that looks gorgeous), the scripting is            even better (and at times hilarious), while the seven Radio            Stations are simply stupendous.        The            licensing of over 80 tracks from the 1980-86 era is a masterstroke.            It sounded good in theory, but to experience it in practise            elevates the game even further. If Rockstar had merely licensed a            few old duffers, it might have been good, but somehow it has            managed to pull classic after classic out of the bag, most of which            have dated sufficiently to really make you feel like you're driving            around in the Summer of '86. There are, of course, some absolute            howlers in there too - plenty of execrable soft rock that were only            hits in the States (The Outfield, Night Ranger) but even these make            you chuckle, because they came from the era that not only fashion            forgot, but irony forgot.                    It's all very easy for us to laugh at the clothes and the music            from that pastel shaded time, especially if you're old enough to            remember buying said items. But the thing that was so            utterly hilarious about the '80s was that all these fashion,            musical and cultural faux pas were conducted with a seriousness and            an attitude that has long gone. Now it's all knowing winks, kitsch            and irony, but you only have to check out A Flock Of Seagulls to            realise just how completely ridiculous the era really was - because            they really were being serious, although they'd doubtlessly            deny that now\u2026                    With this in mind, the attention to detail on the cut scenes,            combined with the most well realised dialogue and scripting ever            witnessed in a videogame make the game all the more enjoyable for            it. And with such a heavyweight voice cast, is this the shape of            things to come? Games with real voice actors in it, rather than            some geezer who makes the tea at the developer? Thank the lord.        But this is all, ultimately, window dressing. What about the            game? Vice City delivers here too - in obese portions that it would            take the best part of 40, 50, maybe 80 hours of your life to gorge            upon. 10 hours through and you think you're making headway, but            check out the stats and you're, like, 15 per cent through! But as            with GTA3, much of the game's completion lies in off the beaten            track sub missions that you may or may not wish to hunt down.            Whatever. It's all there if you want it, which is the important            point. Vice City doesn't force you into doing anything, but you'll            reap the rewards if you do.                    And believe us, you'll want to reap the rewards, because Vice City            has the same compelling, addictive qualities of GTA3, albeit with            some of the more glaring flaws dealt with, if not ironed out            completely. Targeting is finally somewhere near fixed, with the            ability to use a first person mode on some of the weapons, which is            a welcome addition. Combat will still get on your nerves from time            to time, let's not kid ourselves here, but it's a big step in the            right direction.                    Another slightly irksome issue that has followed GTA3 is the camera            system, which when close up against buildings can go completely            berserk and leave you not knowing where the hell you are, which            when you're in the midst of a mission can mean the difference            between success and failure. Fortunately it doesn't happen all that            often, but when it does you'll be cursing, especially if it's the            third part of a mission and will cost you another ten minutes to            get back to the same point.        As we mentioned in our first impressions piece, certain aspects            of the engine are looking tired next to recent advances in            technology, especially the rather rudimentary approach to texturing            - in particular plants and bushes. Stand up close to any of the            many bushes populating the city and you'll know what we mean, as            they obscure the screen in a vile blurred green mess.                    Meanwhile, we're sorry to see the wonderfully realised            train/underground system be stripped from the game, while the lack            of any sense of persistent state has been inherited, so that often            wrecked cars will disappear if you go away and come back, likewise            pedestrians, etc, but really, in terms of affecting your enjoyment,            it won't make a jot of difference. That said, we're certainly            looking forward to playing a Grand Theft Auto in an environment            that is as advanced as the gameplay. Maybe GTA4, eh?                    Nit picking technical grievances aside, Vice City is every bit as            good as we thought it would be - if not better. When a game can            keep you as consistently entertained as this one, you'll be glad of            the depth, and you really won't want to stop playing it. But don't            expect to be constantly surprised, for much of Vice City is a            retread of old ground, and if you didn't like the last one, then            Vice City probably won't change your mind. But bear in mind that's            rather akin to being a footballer and deciding that you'd rather            not play with a ball today. Do yourselves a large favour and buy            this game, or as Rockstar once advocated, steal it.
