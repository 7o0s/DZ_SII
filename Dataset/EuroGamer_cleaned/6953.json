In its heyday, it demonstrated well and truly            for fans of Sega's Master System just who was boss, and that spiky            blue upstarts like Sonic would have to work a hell of a lot harder            to outdo Mario.                         Following the release of Super Mario All Stars on the Super NES,            it shot to fame once again, and stayed there. When Nintendo            announced that Super Mario Advance would be a conversion, people            immediately assumed that SMB3 would be selected, although some            petitioned the company for Super Mario World or Yoshi's Island.                         Then Nintendo told people about Super Mario Advance, and jaws hit            the deck.                         It turned out that although popular and certainly capable of            working under the GameBoy Advance, Nintendo had opted not to            convert the time-honoured Super Mario Brothers 3, instead favouring            its less popular predecessor, a game that hadn't even started life            as a Nintendo project. After the muted success of the official            sequel to Mario in Japan, Nintendo snapped up popular competing            platformer Doki Doki Panic, swapped some sprites around and            shovelled it onto Western plates. The original SMB2 from Japan then            became The Lost Levels, a much more difficult continuation of the            original Mario adventure, which didn't arrive in the West until            Mario All Stars immortalised it along with the other three several            years later.                    Doki Doki Panic, when it became Super Mario Brothers 2, gave the            Mario franchise a new breathe of life. The Americans didn't            particularly like it, but it had a lot going for it, with            well-designed levels, four equally important main characters, and            most important of all, the way that it branched out in places and            helped prevent the Mario series from funnelling itself into the big            pot of dull formulaic platformers. It offered a bit of originality            and a bit of surprise, and helped Shigeru Miyamoto realise that we            wanted more than running and jumping in our videogames. Cue Super            Mario Brothers 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario Kart, Yoshi's            Island, Super Mario 64 and so on.                         Fabulous though we thought it was, it was still difficult            to come to terms with Super Mario Brothers 2's failure in the West.            A slightly more thoughtful game, it involved pulling plants out of            the ground and using them as weapons rather than bopping the            underside of floating brick platforms looking for powerups, and it            replaced the plodding Koopas with hopping purple birds and little            creatures in red coats that looked like natives ripped from            Tatooine in Star Wars called Shyguys.                         What a lot of people ignored about the Super Mario Advance            factsheets was that it also featured classic Super Mario Brothers            arcade multiplayer as well, effectively making it half of the SNES            classic Super Mario All Stars. If we were being excitable, we might            wish for a Super Mario Brothers 3 / Super Mario World crossover for            Christmas.                         Super Mario Brothers 2 is a brilliant Mario adventure, with lively            graphics, finely detailed characters and a lot of things fans of            ~classic~ Mario won't expect. Things like bouncing carrots for            enemies, POW blocks which eliminate every enemy on-screen when you            hurl them to the ground, and of course magic potions which when            dropped produce a door that deposits you in a dark mirror world for            several seconds. Quirky, bizarre, but wondrous.                    In terms of additions to the adventure, Nintendo have taken a            controversial step and added digitized voices to the four            characters; Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and cute little Toad.            Mario and Luigi sound fine and the Princess sounds royal, but Toad            tends to squeak and jibber in a rather annoying manner with his            Whoops and Yippees. The sound quality of these voices, like the            rest of the game's audio is surprisingly good, and like the            graphics the audio is crisp, despite the constraint of the GameBoy            Advance's single speaker.                         Unfortunately, new additions to the levels (which we identified by            setting up a SNES with Mario All Stars next to the GameBoy Advance)            rarely herald anything interesting other than an extra life or a            POW block. One addition though is Yoshi's Challenge, which is a            short-lived egg hunt that may catch your attention, but there's no            reward for completing it. As others have already pointed out to            Nintendo, you added Yoshi here, why not turn him into a playable            character?                         The multiplayer version of classic Mario Brothers is based on the            arcade version of the same, so don't be expecting two sprawling            single player adventures. The battle arena can hold four little            characters, and the objective is to headbop enemy Koopas from            underneath the platform and then kick them into the other Marios to            score some points. You only need one cartridge, which downloads the            data needed to the other consoles via link cable, so this is far            more accessible than multiplayer life on the original GameBoys. The            graphics have been improved quite drastically here, as you would            expect for a game of 15 years or so, and amongst the inclusions are            additional animations and altered music. Ultimately it's not            exactly Super Smash Brothers, but it can be a lot of fun.                    It's strange to think that Super Mario All Stars is now eight years            old, and even stranger still when you realise that SMB2 itself has            now been around in various forms for 13 years. It's high time it            caught the public's attention again, and the few changes here and            there are nice, but even with the addition of a multiplayer Mario            Brothers game and Yoshi's Challenge, the game is still pretty            tired.                         If you've never played it then you have absolutely no excuse for            not buying this, and if any of your friends have bought the GameBoy            Advance, you should hunt down a copy of SMA simply to try out the            multiplayer linkup option. With Christmas only six months off            though and something better bound to turn up by then, you might            like to wait a while on this one. After all, the games do cost            \u00a332.99, and choosing Mario over the likes of Castlevania and            Tony Hawk's is quite a tough decision to make at this price.                         We can't hide our disappointment at the choice of Super Mario            Brothers 2 over 3 or Super Mario World, and we make no apologies            for that. Thankfully Super Mario Advance is a good game and one            well worth playing, but it does feel as though we're playing it            because it's Mario, and because we have nothing better to play, and            that's an unfortunate state of affairs for the game that's supposed            to sell the console.                        -        The Portable Avant-GardeThe Portable Avant-GardeRecord-breaking                    GameBoy Advance salesRecord-breaking                    GameBoy Advance salesGBA on                    the streetsGBA on                    the streetsSay                    hello to my little friendSay                    hello to my little friend"}
