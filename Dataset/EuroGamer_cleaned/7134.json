Combining football management with raw arcade                 play, it seemed like the dream ticket.                    If you had read my            preview            back in January, you will have read of my fears regarding this            marrying of styles though. My primary fear was for the balance            between the two to be just right - something that I think is            virtually impossible to achieve.                    At the time I only had screenshots to go by, and for sure things            certainly looked impressive. Crisp in-game graphics, along with a            neat looking menuing system, promised to make the game a joy to            play. The proof is always in the playing though. Can ELF see            through the full 90 minutes, or will it be substituted at half            time? Read on...         I don't know whether I've                 just been unlucky, but there doesn't appear to be a manual                 with the game. You get the English league handbook, which                 shows squad details for all Premier and First Division clubs                 .. but that's it.                    This would be fine, but the menu system is a little confusing to            begin with, and some pointers would have been rather nice. Anyway,            it doesn't take too long to get to grips with how it all works. The            menu system is very neatly presented, but you can easily become            lost amongst all the windows. I also found the transitions from            screen to screen to get very annoying after a while. Thankfully            these can be disabled though, so that each screen simply flips into            view rather than fading in and out.                    The game begins with a short video introduction, and then drops you            at the main menu. There is a whole range of options to choose here            - you can opt for 'Virtual Competition', which allows you to set up            any match of your choosing, or you can head straight for            'EuroManager', the main game itself.                    You also have other features like 'History', showing you all the            winners of all the cup competitions since their conception, and            'Database', which is a comprehensive list of all teams in the            English divisions, along with their players. Finally 'Football            Quiz' gives you a pub style A, B or C game.         Your                 first task in the 'EuroManager' option is to select the team                 you are going to represent, and your name. Once this is done                 you must ensure you check through your entire squad first.                 This is important so that you can ascertain early on who is in                 need of extra training, who is unhappy, and who looks good to                 keep.                    You will almost certainly find that your squad could do with two or            three extra players, particularly in the lower division teams. Head            on over to the transfers section and put your name down for some            players. It can't hurt, and who knows, you may just snap up the            bargain of the season. After all, part of the game is keeping the            board and, more importantly, the fans happy. Sadly the transfers            section is fairly weak, and I found it really easy to get the            players I wanted. In the real world there is nearly always a tussle            for a player's signature, but pretty much any player I wanted, I            got.                    You must also visit the staff roster - I found I had three or four            key roles missing, including training staff. Training is an            essential ingredient in the development of your players.                    Before and after each match you should always check the manager            screen for any messages from members of staff. The person you will            have most dealings with is your personal assistant, who lets you            know the gossip from the dressing room first hand. You also have            frequent reports from the training staff, the club psychologist,            and medical expert. If a player is injured, the medical consultant            will inform you accurately of how long you can expect to be without            your precious players.         You can opt to play the entire match from the dugout,                 playing the game as a football management simulation only.                 This isn't really the point of ELF though, so get your boots                 on and play!                    Annoyingly I couldn't get my Microsoft Sidewinder to operate, so            was confined to keyboard play. Grumble. When the game has loaded in            its various elements, you are greeted with a panoramic view of the            stadium and an introduction from Dominik Diamond.                    Kick off! The player you are currently controlling has a circle            underneath him, and you can tap the selection key to change to the            next nearest player at will. Slide tackles can be performed, along            with short or long passes, but that is it - there are no special            moves from what I can tell.                    I would have loved to have tried the game on a pad, as I found the            keyboard controlling to be awkward and imprecise. Far too often you            will intercept the ball, run past it, and experience a tedious            couple of seconds to stop and run back the way you came.            Directional co-ordination is also difficult sometimes, with it            being nigh on impossible to get your player to run in a diagonal            direction.                    The dreadful player AI further compounds your annoyance. Computer            controlled players will quite often lose the plot and kick the ball            straight into touch. In close scraps for the ball they very often            end up facing completely the wrong way, understandably looking            quite puzzled.                    Worst of all though are the goalkeepers. Many times a ball has gone            astray into the penalty box, with the keeper walking back to his            line, before he actually turns back to pick the ball up! As            you can imagine, scoring goals from this situation is quite easy.            My worst fear is confirmed - it's just too easy to beat. Running in            on goal, I have three guaranteed ways of scoring, and I can't even            bring myself to mention the terrible off-side rule            implementation...         Player                 graphics are actually not too bad, with some great facial                 expressions in there. There are also a fair amount of                 recognisable faces of footballing stars too, which is a nice                 feature. The pitch itself is nicely done, from the plush                 greens of premiership grounds right down to the mudbaths of                 the lower divisions.                    The further out you go though, the less care seems to have been            taken. Stadiums look really bland, with the crowds consisting of a            mixture of badly drawn cardboard cutouts and a pasted bitmap. It's            the backgrounds that ruin the otherwise nice look of the game -            they look completely out of place, and are blocky and badly            focused. It makes the whole game look like it's being played within            a seriously poor bitmap.                    The sound department follows almost the same path as the graphics.            Things start off well, with nice menu and video music, and your            staff telling you the latest information about the club. Once in            the game, things also sound promising with some really well done            crowd sound. There isn't a vast array of crowd singing and            chanting, but it's all well sampled and sounds convincing.                    The killer blow though... Who chose Dominik Diamond to do            all of the match commentary? There is just no enthusiasm in            his voice whatsoever - a commentator is supposed to carry the game            along, and spark your enthusiasm to do better. Half the time he            sounds bored with it all, and at other times like he is actually            falling asleep. Mind you, to have to read off virtually every            single player, ground and football team name must be a gruelling            experience. But, if you were going to all that effort, wouldn't you            make sure the results were worthwhile?                    Not only do you have to put up with this, but the commentary also            lags badly behind. After you score it can be a good five or six            seconds before this is acknowledged. There are far too many times            where lines are used in totally the wrong places too. Very shoddy.            You could argue that you can turn the commentary off, but for me            it's one of the key elements to a good footballing game.         The idea is one that I have had in my head for years, and                 it's a beautiful one. Sadly, Dinamix have failed to deliver                 anything close to realising this simplistic idea.                    A game with a balanced management system behind it simply has to be            tough to beat. Even when you do win regularly, you still need the            computer to have that extra bit of intelligence to up the skill            factor, or perhaps injure one of your key players. None of this is            in ELF. After an initial learning curve, you will be smashing the            computer teams by silly margins every game.                    If you were to play ELF as purely a management game, you actually            wouldn't have too bad a game on your hands. The menu systems could            do with being a little less cluttered up, and the transfer option            is far too easy to get players from, but in the main it's an            accurate sim.                    There are some beautiful features to discover as well, like the            ability to create your club's own merchandise, hiring and firing            your staff as you see fit .. you can even select your own set of            advertising banners which will gain that little extra capital.                    However, the game has been advertised as a merging of both worlds,            whereas in reality an average management game has been bolted on to            a rather poor arcade game.
