It's about as complete and            satisfying an interpretation as the GameBoy Color could hope to            offer. Viewed from overhead, the idea is obviously to pot the balls            in a specific order. The first disappointment here is that unless            you actually know how to play pool in real life, the first few            minutes will be spent guessing which ball is next in the sequence.            There are no numerals on the balls to illustrate the order, and            there are no actual indicators anywhere onscreen.                         Thankfully playing a shot is a lot simpler. You position your cue,            and then you draw a dotted line from the position of your cue            toward the ball you wish to hit. The length of the line is what            determines the speed at which the cue ball moves. Although            simplistic, thanks to the precise physics, this approach is just as            useful as anything high-end PC simulations can offer.                         The physics are a true achievement; they mimic real life so            thoroughly. If you play a ball against a cushion, it rebounds            exactly as you'd expect, and it's clear a lot of tweaking has gone            in to finely tuning this. Similarly, if you add any sort of spin to            the ball, the results are as you would expect.                    There is a decent selection of games on offer, including US or            English 8-ball, 9-ball, straight, three-ball, six-ball, killer or            speed. The practice mode makes up the rest, and although it doesn't            (rather disappointingly) allow you to position the cue ball and            other balls as you'd like, to really help you practice,            there are no penalties imposed upon you for mis-cueing, so            improvement is swift and the atmosphere comfortable.                         Other big plus points in the game's favour are its instant replay            function (with slow, normal and fast motion options) and its even            more impressive autosave feature. If you power off and then turn            the machine on again, you can expect to find the game saved at your            last shot, presumably as some sort of safety feature in case you            run out of batteries. Not even most console titles are this            thoughtful.                         When playing I did occasionally wish that there were even more            variation in the modes available. You can change the colour of the            table and other silly options, but outside the fairly standard pool            formula there's little to retain your interest. I was hardly            expecting a hidden Doom-style subgame, but some sort of trickshot            theatre, or a way of creating your own pool configurations (imagine            setting up five balls in a row and a red at the far end and giving            yourself an objective of finding the right angle to rebound back            and forth down the table to hit it). There's a lot of scope for fun            with such a closed format. On the PC or on a console, sure, you're            in a position where you are expected to dazzle with pretty visuals            and devious AI, but on the GameBoy your audience expects to be            amused and kept occupied, not amazed.                    Pro Pool is instantly accessible and enjoyable for several hours at            a time. If you're on a long car journey or just a little bored            waiting for your favourite show to come on the tele, it's the sort            of game you can fire up for a quick five minutes and be happily            occupied. If only there were a slightly wider berth of customisable            options, it would be even more impressive."}
