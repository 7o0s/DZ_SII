But while Doom was a decidely old school run and gun            experience, Ecks V Sever is attempting to be more of a thinking            man's shooter.                        In a bizarre turn of events, it loosely follows the storyline of a            movie which hasn't even begun filming yet. Set in the present day,            you play either Ecks (an ex-FBI agent traumatised by the death of            his family) or Sever (a Femme Nikita style NSA assassin, trained to            be a killer in an agency-run orphanage). Each character has its own            twelve mission campaign and the two run parallel to each other,            usually showing you different parts of the same levels as Ecks and            Sever carry out similar orders. For example, the game starts with            the agents trying to access files on each other stored on laptops            hidden in a warehouse. Sever then sets a bomb, leaving both            characters dashing for the exit against the clock, before indulging            in a running battle through the streets outside.                        Between missions you are treated to the transcript from an inquiry            into these events, with the game itself effectively a series of            flashbacks. It's a nice idea and the plot is typical Hollywood            action movie hocus pocus, but the actual presentation is            disappointing, consisting of page after page of repetitive            long-winded text, most of it written in short stoccato sentences            which make Max Payne's cutscenes look like a work of literary            genius. The fact that your character describes the outcome of the            mission to the inquiry before you even start playing it also leaves            you feeling rather helpless and kills any real sense of suspense.                    The missions themselves take place in a range of settings, from the            inevitable warehouse full of crates to a hotel and bar. Objectives            are varied, even if they generally do boil down to finding one or            more keys and getting to the exit, and the occasional run-ins with            your opposite number throughout the game will keep you on your            toes.                        The bad news is that your opponent is invincible, brushing off            grenades and bullets all the way up to the final showdown between            the two agents. This means that, for example, if you choose to play            as Sever your only hope is to run like hell when Ecks is chasing            you through the streets in one of the early missions, because the            game isn't scripted to let you fight him off. Unfortunately the            level is (as usual) also packed full of FBI agents, security guards            and SWAT team members, and as the game has a (vaguely) realistic            damage model you're caught between a rock and a hard place. Try to            fight your way out and Ecks will catch up and start peppering you            with his machinegun. Try to run and the other enemies will kill you            long before you reach the exit.                        Finding a balance between running and gunning isn't helped by the            fact that you have no way of knowing what item an enemy will drop            when they die. Even if a security guard is only using a pistol,            when he dies he could inexplicably drop a vital shotgun or assault            rifle, a life-saving bullet-proof vest or health pack. On the other            hand, he might just drop some bullets for your default pistol,            which is utterly useless against most of the enemies you will            encounter. The only way to work out who is carrying what is to play            through the level and memorise which enemies have useful items.                    Even the most absent-minded of players will have plenty of            opportunity to work out which enemies are worth killing on each            level though. Many of the missions are incredibly hard, even in the            early stages of the game, and killing everybody is not always the            easiest way to win.                        Ammunition and health are often in short supply, packs of lethal            SWAT officers and NSA agents are scattered throughout the levels,            and a few blasts from a shotgun will leave you sprawled on the            floor in a pool of your own blood. Taking on multiple enemies at            once is tricky to say the least, as even a guard's feeble pop gun            can cost you 10% of your health if you get shot at close range. And            given that your enemies usually have fairly fast reactions, if you            get badly injured or run out of ammunition for your good weapons            you may as well give up unless you can find some unguarded supplies            nearby.                        To make things doubly frustrating, there is no in-game save option.            In fact, there is no save game system at all. Instead you get a            password at the end of each mission, although the developers have            at least made them easy to remember if you don't have a piece of            paper handy - every password is a real English word, with the Ecks            mission codes starting with ~ex~ and the Sever ones an ~s~. On the            downside, this simplistic system means that you can't carry weapons            and ammunition from one mission to the next, even when they            supposedly take place immediately after each other in the same            location. As a result you start every level with nothing but your            pathetic default pistol, which won't dent anything more powerful            than the basic unarmoured security guards. It also doesn't help            that at least two of the passwords (Excalibur and Survive) don't            actually appear to work.                    This isn't the only bug either - Ecks V Sever gets the unenviable            reputation of being the first GameBoy Advance title I've played so            far which crashes, resulting in a garbled screen followed by much            swearing and cursing as you reach for the power switch. It's not a            very common occurence, but four times in as many days is still far            too frequent.                        Even when they aren't getting garbled, the graphics are something            of a mixed bag. Level design is mostly solid, if a little            unimaginative in places, but it's let down by a lack of lighting            effects and some poor textures. The NSA bunker towards the end is            particularly bland, with washed out grey and white walls which look            flat shaded from a distance. Sprites also lack the clarity of those            seen in Doom, making them hard to identify at a distance and rather            blocky up close. By comparison the weapon in your hand at the            bottom of the screen is nicely detailed, with a selection including            favourites such as the Ingram MAC 11 submachinegun and M16A assault            rifle. There are also some rather nifty infrared goggles, but sadly            these are only used in a couple of special unlit levels.                        The AI is rather unimpressive as well, apparently only reacting            when it has a line of sight to you and ignoring sounds entirely.            Shoot an enemy in the back and it will turn and fight, but if you            shoot an exposed arm or leg peeking out from round a corner the            victim will sometimes ignore you completely. You can also pick off            enemies while their allies stand around watching them getting            riddled with bullets, just as long as they can't see the person            doing the shooting. If you're looking for some more intelligent            opposition and can convince a friend to buy a copy of the game you            can always take advantage of the multiplayer options, with            Counter-Strike style missions - Assassination (one player tries to            kill a VIP guarded by the others) and Bomb Kit (collect parts to            make a bomb and then plant it in the right place) - as well as the            standard deathmatch maps.                    Ecks V Sever could have been a great little game, but instead it's            more frustrating than entertaining. Semi-realistic weapons, short            supplies of weapons and health, hordes of enemies and no proper            save system all add up to make an incredibly hard game, and there's            no choice of difficulty setting. This may be your idea of fun, but            personally I found it to be too much like hard work.                        -        Ecks                    V Sever interviewEcks                    V Sever interviewEcks                    V Sever screenshotsEcks                    V Sever screenshots"}
