An evil race called the                 Grendels took it upon themselves to scupper those plans                 though, and attacked the spaceship.                    The ship was rendered useless, and the Grendels toddled off to the            planet surface to set up home on their new planet. Unfortunately            this left the ship's remaining occupants, the Norns, on their own,            to survive or perish.                    They are not entirely alone though - you're there to keep them            company. You must help them through this torrid time, nurturing the            newly born, educating them, and allowing them to flourish on their            own.                    Watch out for the Grendels though, as some were left behind!        Creatures 3 is a                 'life simulator', giving the player complete control over the                 Norn's future prosperity, or their gruesome demise...                    The game world is split into five different environments            (terrariums), each with their own ecology. These terrariums are            fairly large, and you will need to scroll the screen around to view            other regions.                    You can choose to begin the game with two fully-grown adult Norns,            fully educated and ready to breed, or you can start with two eggs,            which you will need to hatch.                    Control of the Norns is limited to simply right clicking them and            then dragging them where you want to go. You can also pick up and            use other objects though, including weird and wonderful            contraptions which are strewn throughout the game world and which            will aid your breeding efforts.         Whilst you are                 busy raising yourself a little Norn empire, there are other                 creatures inhabiting the terrariums who are hell-bent on                 stopping you though.                    Grendels are an evil race. They are considered a great mistake of            the Shee, created purely by accident. Carrying disease and stealing            Norn eggs are some of their favourite pastimes. Their main source            of satisfaction though is outright violence, hunting the Norn being            an important part of that!                    Ettins on the other hand are a peaceful bunch. Don't let those            seemingly innocent big eyes lull you into a false sense of security            though - they like to steal, and they will often take important            things that are essential to your breeding program.                    So, if you have painstakingly set up some machinery to do a job,            and you come back to find something vital missing, head on over to            the Ettin terrarium - it will nearly always be there!         Creatures 3                 opens up with a nice little video telling the story so far,                 and then you are dumped to the options screen where you can                 load or create a new game.                    But once you are dropped into the game the problems start... The            background graphics representing the terrariums are nice enough,            but the animation of the Norns and other characters is rather poor.            I thought the days of four frame animations were gone, but it            appears not.                    Forgiving this and foraging on, you soon come to realise that this            is only the tip of the iceberg. Far too many times the characters            get on top of each other, making it impossible to click a lift            switch or to select a specific character.                    The scrolling of the terrarium is also very clumsy, and it is often            a real pain to focus on something you specifically want.         Ooh boy! Graphical woes are nothing compared to the                 insane sound that accompanies it all!                    Okay, I know these are cutesy little creatures that you are            nurturing, but we can surely do without the completely infantile            garbage that pours uncontrollably from their furry gobs? I can            understand the need for the young Norns to sound like babies, but            the adults too?!                    And if this isn't bad enough, the music running alongside is enough            to drive you up the wall. It sounds rather like the sort of stuff            aromatherapists use, which is supposed to calm and lift your            spirit.                    About the only spirit I could lift to this was good ole Jack            Daniels, and plenty of it!         The idea behind the game isn't                 exactly original, but the blurb on the back of the box for                 Creatures 3 tickles the curiosity. The box is about the main                 attraction for me though!                    With very average background graphics and laughably poor character            animation, this isn't even a treat for the eyes. Couple this with            the horribly irritating audio, and any chance of a decent game            coming out of all this are pretty much gone.                    I'm disappointed to say the least, after hearing positive previews            and vibrant news articles about the game. The final product simply            fails to deliver though.                    I found vaporising the Norns into outer space to be the sole source            of entertainment here. Whether that's just because I'm sadistic,            I'll leave up to you to decide...                    Avoid!"}
