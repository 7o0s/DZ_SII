Millions ofseemingly normal people became obsessed with their bleepingcritters. Kids failed exams, adults just stopped going to work,unable to draw their attention away - even for a second- from what amounted to a lump of pixels floating around on atiny LCD screen encased in a plastic egg. And like other ridiculousfads including Cabbage Patch Kids, drain pipe jeans and the Britishmotor industry, it seemed entirely of its time, mystifying to allsubsequent generations.But then mobile phone games came along and publishers realisedthere was money to be made in nostalgia. And now Tamagotchi is back (and on DS too).German publisher Living Mobile grasped the phone game licencefrom Bandai and has already bashed out a basic Tamagotchi simulation. Just when you thought they couldn'tget anymore cynical, here's another version - complete withweak and unconvincing soccer theme - blasted out into a WorldCup obsessed universe like an inaccurate Lampard volley.But really, this is just Tamagotchi, pure and unutterably simple. You start the game,a blob appears on your screen. You feed it when its hunger meterdrops, you play with it or shove a snack in its face if itshappiness meter drops, and you 'discipline' it if it startsrefusing to eat or play. Oh yes, and if it poops on the screen, yougive it a bath (or feed it medicine if you leave to much cack lyingabout and it gets diseased).Do this for long enough and, assuming you haven't wept yourselfblind at having wasted a fiver on such pointless tosh, your petgrows into its next phase of life. Then you do it all again, untilit evolves a few more times. Then your pet snuffs it, leaving avirtual cyber corpse on your phone screen.Reset.'Where's the soccer element in that?' you might well ask. Well,that'll be taken care of in the three mini-games. These have alwaysbeen a part of the Tamagotchi 'experience' except now they're vaguely footballthemed.In Run, you press left or right to run in the direction of afalling ball. In Control, you press the action button at the righttime to head the ball. And in Goalie you simple try to guesswhether the penalty will be hit left or right of your pet. That'sit. That's the Soccer part.For some reason - call it misplaced faith in thefundamental goodness of mankind - we were expecting somethingmore. We thought they might do something amusing, enabling you tocare for and nurture a little footballing creature, feeding itpasta and chicken, making it turn up to training, ensuring itdidn't spend too much of its time in West London night clubs withorange-faced soap starlets. That kind of thing.But Tamagotchi Soccer - like the England squad funnilyenough - has taken a baseball bat to the thin skull of hopeand is still pounding away at it. (I suspect Bandai imposed somestrict limits on its property, but that's really no excuse).Tamagotchi once worked because people loved the packaging,the cute little egg design, the way Bandai released lots ofdifferent versions to appeal to our inner nerdy collector. The factthat they evolved in slightly different ways depending on how youtreated them was sort of interesting at the time too (this stillapplies - do you stuff your Tama with snacks or play loads ofgames to keep him trim?), but now we have My Dog, The Sims and Neopets. Tamagotchi is laughable compared to these modernwonders.Look, the nineties are gone, and Tamagotchis aren't funny or entertaining anymore -even with a vague footie theme tacked on. This concept should beput in a shoebox and solemnly buried in the back garden."}
