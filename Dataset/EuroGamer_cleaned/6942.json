The much hyped, long-awaited PS2            exclusive is a triumphant journey through a land of sumptuous            visuals and breathtaking computer generated cut-scenes, and really            shows what the oft-criticized console is capable of doing under the            right direction.                         It had one of the biggest budgets of any videogame ever, but            instead of blowing it on designer clothes and perms, the developers            put it to work where it was needed. Apart from the unrivalled            visuals, Onimusha boasts a wonderful orchestral soundtrack            performed by the New Japan Philharmonic that fits the game like a            glove, and a storyline that plunges you right back into feudal            Japan without a crutch to lean on. In short, it's a killer app.                         Capcom are the masters of CG intros. We already know this from            their work with the Resident Evil series, but even so, $2 million            is quite a lot of money to spend. The reason it cost so much, and            works so well though, is that they didn't collect a circle of            trainee artists and get them to animate it using 3D Studio Max,            they paid an outside consultancy to create a proper introduction,            which lasts five minutes in total and overloads you with excitement            and intrigue. Instead of the usual clanking swords of unrealistic            warriors, the introduction is eerily realistic, with live action            armies slicing and dicing one another. It starts with a battle            between two warlords and their armies. At the conclusion of the            battle, the legendary Nobunaga Oda, who came close to uniting Japan            under his banner in real life, is slain by a rival warlord with an            arrow to the throat.                    The movie also introduces us to the game's hero, Samanosuke Akechi,            an incredibly talented swordsman and warrior who fights selflessly            to free others. Once he's dealt with some foolhardy aggressors, our            hero hotfoots it to the famous Inabayama Castle in the Mino            Prefecture, home of the Yoshitatsu Saito, sensing trouble for            Saito's beautiful daughter Princess Yuki. His concern proves            well-founded, and despite coming close to rescuing her, Samanosuke            is left grasping at air, his quest clear. Our only concern up to            this point was that you can't skip the CG. Then again, why would            you want to?                         The game is effectively about saving the princess, but there's a            lot more to it than that. Princess Yuki is being held by demonic            forces under sinister circumstances, their intention being to use            her to elevate the undead Nobunaga Oda and his evil master            Fortinbras to the control of Japan. Things soon get even racier,            with movie style production values retained throughout. With            Princess Yuki in trouble, Samanosuke races to her aid, but            recognizing his na\u00efvity the mystical Ogre clan draw him into a            deep sleep where they give him a magical gauntlet with power over            the souls of others. With this, they reason, the lad can't go            wrong. The gauntlet can absorb the souls of freshly departed            enemies as they float off into the ether, and using the power of            once mighty warriors Samanosuke can generate strength and magical            attacks to ward off his foes.                         Joining Samanosuke on his quest is the ninja lovely Kaede, whose            moves include silent, gravity defying mid-air throat slices and            other tricky attacks. Samanosuke and Kaede complement one another            beautifully, with agile movement and contrasting fighting styles.                    Visually the game and its characters are sublime, with lavish,            richly detailed backgrounds and texturing. You fight and move in            pre-rendered scenes ala Resident Evil and Dino Crisis, and some of            the stills wouldn't look out of place on the wall of an art            gallery. One of our only complaints with this pre-rendered approach            is that, as with Resident Evil and Dino Crisis, enemies coming            around a corner appear from nowhere, and it can be very difficult            to fight in the confines of the transition areas, where you only            have an awkward overhead view of Samanosuke or Kaede.                        Another issue is that the backgrounds are so lavish that they take            a split-second to load, and if you're fighting a battle and            back-tracking into different areas the game stalls for a second            shifting between stills, which can be irritating as it breaks your            concentration. It can also mess up the controls, especially if your            sword is streaking across an enemy's chest as the scene changes.            Often it's difficult to recover, or the attack misses in the            commotion.                        The control system is pretty forgiving apart from that though. You            use the D-pad to move (which seems more precise in a rather            nonsensical way than the analog stick), and your attacks are split            between Square (for sword thrusts) and Triangle to perform a            special, magical move. When an enemy is killed its soul floats up            and you hit Circle so that Samanosuke can absorb it. During battles            you can also do cute little 180 degree spins using R2 (as borrowed            once again from Resident Evil), and block incoming attacks with L1.            During the scant puzzle/adventure sections of the game, the X            button performs an action or opens a door.                    As the balance of controls suggests, Onimusha Warlords is more            about fighting than adventuring. This may go against Capcom's            Survival Horror heritage, but it makes a nice change, and            Samanosuke and Kaede's fighting styles are suitably different and            varied that you rarely lose interest.                        The weapons and combat system are an obvious crowd pleaser in this            department. Various upgrades are available for your sword, and your            magical repertoire increases are your soul count does. Kaede on the            other hand picks up various tactics, and her use of throwing knives            is tireless. Oh, and if you've been in a particularly tough fight            (and few of them are easy), you can seek some closure from the            encounter by driving Samanosuke's sword into the heart of your            fallen enemies as they lie prostrate. This is unimaginably            satisfying, and if you do buy Onimusha Warlords you will spend at            least the first half of the game doing just that.                         Strangely for such a delicious epic, the game's conclusion is a            lot weaker than the rest of it. For anybody who has ever played            through a real Japanese RPG (Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger will            do), a proper end sequence sews up all the holes and explains away            anything you were uncertain of. Onimusha's just leaves you            guessing, with plenty still outstanding at the close. There's            obviously some scope for a sequel, but why not make it a little            less obvious?                    Despite its movie-like production values and incredible opening,            Onimusha leaves its audience guessing at the end, and given that            it's only 10 hours long (less if you gun through it quickly), it's            almost disappointing. I certainly wanted more, but then I completed            it in just two sittings.                         The problem is, once you know the ins and outs there isn't much            replay value. It's true, hacking people to bits with swords doesn't            grow old, and you can be quite creative with Onimusha, but really            you're looking at 10 hours or so of gaping awe, followed by twenty            minutes or so of consternation, and a gap of several months before            you bother to play through it again. There's some argument that            games should be this sort of length anyway, but marketing alone for            Onimusha hit $10 million in the States.                         An ambitious romp through feudal Japan with very few pit stops,            and definitely the prettiest game on the PlayStation 2, but it ends            sharply. Bear that in mind."}
