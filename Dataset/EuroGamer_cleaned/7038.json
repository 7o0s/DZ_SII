It's yet another Japanese translation that sells well based on the            reputation of its namesake, yet when released into a Western            climate falls into the 'Anime-based video games that really            shouldn't have been commissioned' category. It's not as bad as some            of its contemporaries, but the characters' weakness and            Activision's poor translation have consigned it to the ever-growing            pile of substandard PS2 launch titles.                         The plot is fairly standard RPG fair. You control Orphen, the            title character and his young students Magnus and Cleo who are out            on a boat one day when a nasty sea monster wrecks their ship and            leaves them stranded, washed up on the shores of Chaos Island. From            here you have to locate the various pieces of the Crystal Egg,            achieved by time-shifting back and forth through the island's            history.                         Henceforth there is little to shout about it. Cutscenes            intersperse the action, implemented in a similar way to those in            the Final Fantasy games, and battles take place in real-time, where            timing your attacks is very important. You have four major            offensive attacks, each one bound to one of the four buttons on the            right of the joypad, and as you progress through the game you            unlock defensive magic and other spells. You can't perform two            spells at once, so there's no shielding yourself while you chuck            fireballs; the trick therefore is to work out the best way to order            your attacks. However, this eventually leads to the battles            becoming very repetitive as you learn to adopt a new attack            sequence each time. Outside of the battles, it's a startlingly            linear game.                    Orphen's biggest downfall is the weakness of its characters. Unlike            those found in similar titles, the strong, exciting young heroes            are actually badly lip-synched and poorly translated, and come over            as insufferable, snide little wretches. Orphen himself is the            worst; even the people translating the game and re-dubbing it must            have figured out he hadn't come out right, because it's ridiculous.            The charismatic threesome remind me more of the annoying trio in            Pok\u00e9mon than new-age sorcerers. I dare say they do their            on-screen namesakes no favours.                         The worst thing about the dubbing though, is that it looks, feels            and sounds affected. There are peculiar pauses, clearly used in the            Japanese version to complement a key moment in the script, which            are simply inappropriate. At times it sounds like this is a word            for word translation too, and that doesn't work for obvious            reasons. Whoever directed this should be shot. Lines take on a            whole new meaning thanks to him and it ruins the atmosphere. The            best analogy for it is a five year olds' drama class, where they            say their lines but in not quite the right way, accentuating the            wrong parts and emphasising obscurities.                         The one redeeming feature Orphen can lay claim to is that            occasionally, albeit rarely, a nice visual set piece is executed            and is actually worth watching. The whole game is like one long            scripted sequence, and this does make way for some brilliant 3D            artistry and some stunning effects, with impressive lighting and            explosions rendered by the PS2's Emotion Engine.                    The problem for us gamers who are forced to play Orphen though, is            that in between the stunning set pieces and visual extravagance            lies a maze of tat; badly connected and poorly realised tat.            Exploring dungeons is a mundane job and made all the worse by the            graphical idiocy on display within the dark confines, and            elsewhere, such as onboard the ship at the very start of the game.            The extraneous detail, too is rather perplexing. In most RPGs, if a            room or item serves no purpose, the door will be locked or the item            will offer no interaction. With Orphen, everything is open to you,            and upon entering a room it's pretty clear whether it's important            or not because if it is it will be animated from top to bottom and            superbly lit, whereas if it is not, it will look like the inside of            the caves.                         I suppose it's only fair at this point to consider how Orphen:            Scion of Sorcery would appeal to its actual fans. If any are            reading, you probably know more than me about the series, so I            offer two possibilities. If the game is actually based on an            annoying cartoon with weak characters, bad dubbing and bland            visuals, then you will no doubt know what to expect and lap it up.            If, by some quirk of fate the series it is based on is actually            good, then this will do nothing but annoy you. The game is            so bland in so many areas and so badly pieced together that it will            do you little justice.                    If you have come this far, you will have fathomed that I deeply            detest Orphen and want to construct vast planetary defences to            prevent it invading our peaceful way of life, however despite            myself, I found the musical side of the game to be sublime. The            battle theme (the key part of any Japanese RPG) is right on the            money, as good as that found in Final Fantasy VII, I would say            (although still a fair way of Chrono Trigger and its generation).                         Outside of the \u2026 well lets say it, the game itself, the            bland areas are made more bearable by some nice ambient            accompaniment. The only downside to the musical score on the whole            is the cheesy theme that follows some of the cutscenes. Apart from            that it's quite well done.                    So, I approached Orphen hoping for an epic RPG adventure, and I            left it hoping that I would be able to slag it off without too many            fanboys jumping about my feet trying to catch my attention. It's a            shame, because I bet if you have a decent foreknowledge of the            series it could actually be quite enjoyable, but I'm not going to            make allowances, because very few people who will end up with this            game will have. On its own, it's just not worth buying. If they had            translated the series and run it on Sky One for a while, we might            be looking at Oprhen in a different way, as it is, I feel no pain            in giving it a resounding thumbs down."}
