Back in the old days            (and I mean old - we're talking Romans here), wrestlers were            men of honour. Sure, they rolled around on the ground trying to            snap one another's limbs, but they did it with dignity.                         Fire Pro Wrestling from developer Spike and BAM Entertainment            harks us back to those cherished days of yore when a grip was hard            to get out of, and a choke meant you choked, and also brings us up            to date with the latest fighting styles from all over the world.            The reason for the weird-sounding name is that the game makes its            way from Japan, and brings with it 200 pre-made wrestlers skilled            in the arts of Jujitsu, kick boxing, Luchador and all that. A darn            sight more entertaining than an American pantomime.                         Fire Pro is a GBA exclusive, featuring plenty of fighting styles,            proper technical wrestling and four person multiplayer. By virtue            of its celebrated status as a ~proper wrestling~ game, Fire Pro            also shies away from the button bashing arcade style beat 'em up to            the point where you simply cannot do anything meaningful if you            resort to slapping this and that. This means that you will            have to read the manual to understand what you're meant to be            doing.                    To win at Fire Pro you have to grapple, and grappling is a fine            art. As your two fighters square up and dash at one another, you            perform your grapple combo just as the two meet, and if you get it            right, you get the upper hand. The game boasts perfectly acceptable            visuals, with smooth animation and decent sized fighters, and it            offers visual aids so that you can tell how your fighter is bearing            up. As you battle your opponent the fighting wears you out and the            repetition of different moves starts to take its toll. If you're            caught in a lot of arm locks for example, you lose strength and            reversals are easier for the other guy. This is true of virtually            every physical attribute - you have to wear them down and hurt them            to get anywhere.                         The game wouldn't last very long if it took just a couple of            armlocks to swing a match irreversibly in one direction though, and            fighters can often achieve miraculous comebacks by going for a weak            spot - particularly in multiplayer when the other chap has to fight            to make sure he executes the right reversal or grapple combo on            cue. Fire Pro Wrestling's emphasis on technical precision is a            blessing, but it also acts as something of a curse. I have a really            dated memory of watching a Killer Instinct master pulling off 80            hit combos in the arcade. He just moved the sticks around slowly            and carefully, tapping buttons as he needed to and everything just            happened. On the contrary, I sat there, adrenaline running as the            combos mounted up trying (literally) with all my might to get the            hits.                        That felt like fighting; there was aggression. For the other chap            it was pressing some buttons to move some pixels. Fighting games            need to be energetic and although Fire Pro Wrestling is a special            breed of fighting game, and a very good one to boot, it doesn't            have that electricity found in rival fighters.                    There's no mistaking that if you're a fan of realistic wrestling            this will impress you. And if you're not the only fan in your local            area it will be even better; the multiplayer mode is as exhaustive            as the single player. On your own you can fight in any style you            like under a number of roofs until you feel up to a gruelling            Audience Match or an octagonal steel cage fight. Substitute a            like-minded friend for an AI opponent and you will have hours of            fun. Get four players together and the possibility of double-team            moves and reversals comes into play, at which point Fire Pro            resembles a ballet more than a game!                         The difficulty is, for a multiplayer fight to be fun in Fire Pro            you need two (or indeed four) calm, collected players who enjoy            calculating their fights instead of pumping iron into them. It            isn't for everyone, and it's certainly not for newcomers. One of            the best things about fighting games that encourage button bashing            is that newbies can still give veterans a run for their money and            occasionally cause an upset. In Fire Pro, you're better off doing            nothing than button bashing if you want to last more than a few            seconds.                         So perhaps the game's biggest charm will demonize it in the eyes            of others. It's a tough break, but it does mean that it's harder to            recommend Fire Pro. Fortunately you'll know whether you fancy it or            not. Personally I found it less exciting than my import copy of            Street Fighter, but I definitely have a lot of time for it            regardless. As a wrestling game Fire Pro does a lot of things well,            with a measured style and a degree of originality, packed into a            genre of Smackdowns and Manias, but as a handheld game it makes a            few mistakes."}
