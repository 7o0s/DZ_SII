And Sheep is one of them. Let's                 face it, how many computer games can you think of which                 involve herding sheep through 28 levels of ovine-shredding,                 bale bundling, flossy flattening obstacles of the kind that                 would make your average sheepdog run off with its tail between                 its legs?                    The basic idea behind Sheep is simple enough; all you have to do is            guide at least five of your flock of fluffy mammals from A to B            without them being squashed, frozen, eaten, diced or otherwise            reduced to their constituent parts along the way. Unfortunately            sheep are pretty dim on the wider scale of things, and won't think            twice before casually wandering in front of a combine harvester or            leaping obliviously into a giant blender. The one thing you can            rely on them to do is run away from you, although when they get            seperated from their friends even this can be rather hit and miss.                    Overall though Mind's Eye have done a great job in implementing            ~artificial stupidity~ for the sheep, and getting them to do what            you want them to is a real challenge. Sometimes it can get a little            frustrating as you watch your herd run straight into a trap, but            generally you have enough control over their movements to keep them            going in roughly the right direction.         Shepherding essentially involves running along                 behind your sheep and hoping they all flock away from you,                 which can get a bit mind-numbing after a while. You do get a                 choice of four shepherds, but this has little obvious effect                 on the gameplay. Neither does your choice of which of the four                 breeds of sheep to use in each of the four levels in an                 episode - they all behave exactly the same as far as I can                 tell.                    There is slightly more to it than that, but not much. Sneaking            along on tip toes allows you to creep up on sheep, and if you are            quick enough you can pick one up and carry it off, which can be            very useful if you need to get it past a particularly tricky            obstacle, or want to place a sheep on a button to open a door or            activate machinery. Rather less usefully you can .. ahem .. mount a            sheep at certain points in the game, and then ride around on its            back for a while. Although charging headlong through a crowd            knocking people flying can be mildly amusing, it really doesn't add            anything to the game.                    Some levels also include special areas which will alter your sheep,            varying from a sheep dip which dyes them all sorts of bright            colours to machines which kit them out in platemail armour, duffle            coats or space suits to get past certain hazards. Some of these are            simply for show, while some are actually genuinely useful, but            either way there is something strangely amusing (not to mention            downright surreal) about chasing a herd of tank-driving sheep            through a brick wall.         Luckily the environments in which you find                 yourself are varied enough to keep things fairly interesting                 despite the at-times repetitive gameplay, with a seemingly                 never-ending array of weird and wonderful scenery, obstacles                 and hazards to navigate.                    The game starts in familiar enough territory, placing you in a farm            complete with tractors, electric fences and (rather bizarrely)            shark-infested fields to watch out for, while bonus points can be            earned by herding your sheep through chicken hutches and groups of            line-dancing hicks. From here on in things get progressively            stranger, and every four levels you find yourself in an entirely            new environment. Star Trek style transporter pads and roaming            robots await you aboard a space ship that looks like a cross            between a PC and the Event Horizon, while rolling boulders and            dinosaurs can crush your sheep in the jurassic episode.                    It's not just the scenery and hazards which change either. The            candy factory marks a welcome change of pace about half way through            the game, with two of its four levels focusing on manipulating            machinery to shove your sheep around on conveyor belts without you            ever getting close to them. There are also some truly odd bonus            levels to unlock, including a five-a-side football sub-game and a            recreation of Snakes (a firm favourite with mobile phone owners            across the world), although sadly accessing the bonus levels can be            something of a chore and you're likely to miss most of them on your            first time through the game.         The one thing that all of the settings have in                 common is big, bright and bizarre graphics. It's all very                 cartoonish, and although you will see whole flocks of sheep                 getting burnt, frozen, zapped, electrocuted, eaten, run over                 and otherwise reduced to mincemeat and fluff throughout the                 game, it's all done in a good-natured manner with a minimum of                 gore.                    While the PlayStation version of the game is rather lacklustre when            it comes to graphics, the PC version is sharp, colourful and fast            moving. The levels are full of moving machinery, bouncy castles,            people to knock over, and all manner of bizarre obstacles from jet            fighters to exploding barrels, freezer rooms to vats of boiling oil            and catapults to asteroids. Animations are simple but effective,            and the sheep themselves look suitably cute and gormless as they            canter brainlessly around the levels.                    The action is broken up by short rendered cutscenes between            different areas, showing your flock being trucked around the            countryside, blasted into space on a rocket, and generally            maltreated. There's also a hilarious intro movie to get you in the            right mood, heavily inspired by ~Close Encounters Of The Third            Kind~.         Sheep is certainly one of the most .. unusual                 games of recent years, and while the actual shepherding is                 rather repetitive, there is usually enough going on to keep                 you interested and amused. The constant changes in scenery and                 obstacles also help to lift the tedium of endlessly chasing                 sheep around brighly coloured mazes, and while the game is                 best handled in small doses it is addictive enough to keep you                 coming back for more. If you're looking for something                 completely different, Sheep is well worth a look. Silly but                 fun."}
