{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-pow-ps2", "date": "14 Aug 2002", "game_name": "Prisoner of War", "text": "It's clear from the off that most of the characters and events in            Codemasters' Prisoner of War have drawn inspiration from the            various icons of war film drama. It's a game full of angry German            guards, unpleasant camp commandants and wily prisoners, who range            from the eager and comical to the cold and cynical, and their            loyalties waver almost as much as your trembling fingers when            you're poised to race between two inattentive guards.                         The game's star is Captain Lewis Stone, who finds himself shot            down and separated from his co-pilot during an important            surveillance mission over the German lines, before being remanded            into the custody of a holding camp, awaiting transfer to Stalag            Luft 1. With the premise never in any doubt, I was able to wrap            myself up in the events of the story, but even at this early stage            the game's lack of polish caught my eye. The opening cinematic sets            the tone for dialogue throughout the game - candid lines spoken            well but without the flow of a conversation. For a game that will            be remembered for the strength of its period portrayal, irritating            gaps in speech set the wrong tone.                         Once inside the holding camp though, with some dialogue behind you            and a handful of prisoners to mingle with, it's a different story            entirely. Your mind immediately leaps to the prospect of escape,            and you are given the chance to explore the mechanics of the game            and the lovingly recreated POW camps, carefully designed and            realised by the game's developer. Some of them - Colditz being the            best example - are immense, and the flow of prisoners back and            forth in large numbers really does recreate the feeling of films            like The Great Escape. Naturally you aren't the only POW with a            desire to escape, and in the larger levels you often have to            impress the escape committee to have them sanction and fund your            actions.                    Captain Stone's adventure is viewed from the third person, with L1            switching to a first person perspective and the left analogue stick            controlling movement. The various face buttons serve a number of            different functions. You can duck down, pick up and drop items,            clamber over wire mesh fences, and you can also save your game when            you're standing next to your bunk, or deposit and retrieve items            from your safe box. Smaller objects, such as camp currency            (virtually anything that shines), rocks and keys are collected by            walking over them - you collect a variety of objects on your            travels, and stashing them away is often the only way to keep hold            of them until they are needed.                         Stone's day-to-day routine is detailed in his notebook, which he            keeps in his bunk. If he were to act like a model prisoner, he            would attend meals, exercise sessions and so-called 'free time' as            well as roll call, which is obligatory, pretty much on pain of            death. A clock in the top right of the screen shows the passing of            minutes and hours, and making sure you show up for your next            appointment can ease the guards' suspicion and allow you to sneak            around with greater ease when their backs are turned.                         Stone's handy radar shows the guards from above with cones            representing their fields of vision, and evasion is his primary            concern. Although sneaking around will set them off, simply            obstructing their duties or walking too close to the fence can have            an unhelpful effect, and don't think that just because you can            climb a flagpole they will put up with it\u2026 [Don't laugh, this            is actually the first thing I did on arriving at the holding camp,            thanks to an unfortunate misinterpretation of an on-screen icon.            The guard's weren't amused - Ed]                    Stone's fixation is on escaping, and from the very outset it's a            complicated undertaking. After making the acquaintance of his            fellow prisoners, he has to steal a small amount of currency from            the camp's equivalent of a hospital, before half-inching a key from            the guards' quarters and sneaking into a tool shed to remove a            crowbar. The tool shed is on the other side of the camp, and            provides Stone's best lesson yet in escape etiquette.                         Creeping along behind his sleeping quarters, preferably after            dark, Stone has to pay attention to guard patterns and jump the            fence at the right instant. Thereafter, he has to duck through a            hole in the masonry on the other side of the road, the location of            which he paid good currency for. On the other side he crouches next            to some sandbags and observes the patterns of two guards on the            ground and two in opposing watchtowers, and at precisely the right            moment he makes a break for some logs stacked near the foot of a            watchtower. From then on, it's a simple matter of negotiating the            open ground between the stacked wood and the tool shed, unlocking            the door and slipping inside. Oh, and then working his way back to            his bunk before sun-up and roll call.                         Should Stone come unstuck, perhaps slipping into a guard's field            of vision, that guard's cone will gradually change colour            reflecting his alarm, and Stone's actions will be met with a terse            outburst of his vernacular. If Stone can't conceal himself before            the guard comes running - perhaps in one of the many bushes strewn            around the camp, or amongst some crates - then he runs the risk of            ending up in solitary confinement, or worse, being shot. At this            point, you either reload your last save or keep going, but being            caught or shot shows up as a black mark on your camp report - the            end of level screen - so completists will want to retrace their            steps.                    One issue here is that getting caught after collecting the crowbar            is still enough to retain it. One of your fellow prisoners with a            thick Irish accent can bribe the odd guard into returning            confiscated contraband in exchange for some currency, and for some            reason the crowbar falls under this banner. As it happens, the            overzealous guards will often search you and uncover your various            pocket items as a matter of course, so the retrieval does serve a            function, but with plentiful currency it also removes some of the            challenge, and it's a fixture of levels beyond the holding camp as            well.                         Stone's actions grow bolder and more interesting as the game wears            on, and camps grow in size, population and guard quotient. His            objectives vary from picking locks and stealing more equipment to            sabotaging vehicles or hiding away in them, all the while trying to            evade the clumsy guards by crouching beneath raised huts, nipping            behind objects and throwing rocks to distract them. And as            objectives become more elaborate, the tension becomes more and more            tangible and the experience is extremely engrossing. Although you            can save any time you like, midway through a complicated mission            you can't just hotfoot it back to your bunk and do so - gaining            ground by negotiating guard routines is an intangible reward and            leaves you without the option of easily turning back.                         Sadly, while Prisoner of War succeeds in freeing itself from the            shackles of stealth templates like Metal Gear Solid, it doesn't            share their greater production values and feels very glitchy. The            graphics are PS2 standard, with lots of detail but a fair amount of            angles and jaggies, and a lot of transition animations are also            missing, which spoils the illusion at times. Coupled with the            dialogue imperfections mentioned earlier and the perhaps            unresponsive and occasionally unintuitive control system,            frustration often stems from the game and not your actions. If it's            a pill you think you can swallow, however, then POW will quickly            become one of your favourite games. Unrestrained by the traditional            boundaries of the stealth genre, it executes a neat concept with            some grace, and manages to make a decent-sized game out of it. A            couple of months of extra polish wouldn't have gone amiss, but once            you get used to it, the patient, rewarding experience of the game            shines through, and you'll feel a bit like Steve McQueen. And            that's almost worth the asking price alone."}
