Even Konami is bored of its            artistry and dominance, and now plans to unsettle PES fans with the            release of a definitive International Superstar Soccer game later            on this year. By comparison, Sony's This Is Football franchise,            well, isn't, and EA's FIFA series is apparently under the direction            of ballet teachers, this year's effort notwithstanding. PES is            gritty, it's real and it's instantly discernible as the beautiful            game.                         Whether you agree with my point of view or not is pretty            irrelevant, but if PES doesn't float your boat then there are            certainly a number of choices to consider in your pursuit of a            realistic football game. Footy videogames are a bit of Turing Test            for developers these days, rarely living up to their distinctive            roots and so often leaving us wondering, will they ever be more            enjoyable than the real thing?                         Who knows, but Silicon Dreams are due some luck, having developed            or at least had input into Sega's Worldwide Soccer series, the old            Michael Owen World League Soccer games and now the coveted UEFA            Champions League license videogames across a number of systems. If            you want to save yourself a read, it's still hovering somewhere            between FIFA, TIF and the legions of also-rans, so it's not the            finest footy game out there - in fact it's not even top three - but            it's still a solid effort, and just as FIFA '99 was a game that            showed EA Sports' true promise, UEFA Champions League Seasons            2001/2002 is almost certainly the precursor to something good.                    UEFA the videogame is decked out with all the glitz and glamour of            its television equivalent. You can pick from any of this season's            32 hopefuls and take them on a tour of Europe's finest venues, and            in the process it's difficult not to admire Silicon Dreams'            attention to detail. Flaunting authentic kit designs and sponsor            logos, and an interface largely derived from the original ITV sets            and flashy animations, it's a real experience for, well, Manchester            United fans who tend to go through the ritual of watching Champions            League games regularly. It's also nice to see a game with a flashy            yet familiar interface for once instead of a bloated mess (FIFA), a            Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen style disaster area (TIF) or a bad            Goth-rock nightmare (PES).                         Beyond the basic competition (which, as you should be aware,            consists of a hotly contested group stage followed by a series of            knockout games) players can also choose to create their own team            from scratch, picking from a number of attributes before taking on            various real-life competition. This is a bit monotonous unless you            really want to create your own Worms-esque Fighting Eleven,            but it does give some of the more creatively minded the opportunity            to run free. How about an Ocean's Eleven team? That's topical. I            had to work hard to emulate Julia Roberts' smile, but hey.                         Another incentive to play the game is the impressive array of past            teams. I'm always fond of footy games with 'classic' elevens, but            there are some 46 past champions here, which is beyond anything I            could have expected. How about forcing a Liverpool team of the past            to play off against the Manchester United team of the present?            Entertaining? Yep. Complementing the action is also some reasonable            commentary from the likes of Gabby Logan and Guy Mowbray. Okay, so            it's not John Motson, but at least you can avoid Big Ron\u2026                    Heading out onto the pitch, the first thing to strike you is the            unfortunate appearance of the player models themselves. I'm not a            big fan of any footy game's interpretation of the human form, as it            were, but I'm particularly enamoured by the way PES breathes life            into the models with superb animation and actual, differentiable            characteristics which help the players to accurately mimic their            real life counterparts. Beckham really does act like Beckham, and            so on. The players in UEFA, frankly, do not live up to the            authentic roots of the franchise. They aren't all that strikingly            different to one another - for the most part they singularly fail            to look anything like the characters they are based on - and            ultimately, they stand out merely as products of Silicon Dreams'            development, similar in terms of animation and appearance to the            models seen in Sega Worldwide Soccer, Michael Owen's World League            Soccer and of course last year's UEFA Champions League tie-in.                         This year's UEFA may give you a lot more freedom to express your            footballing intentions, but it also shoots itself in the foot with            some confounded errors, such as a power bar system, which, despite            offering complete freedom over shots and passes, fails to take into            account the deciding factor of 90% of the football you will ever            watch; speed! Players cannot prod the ball with an outstretched leg            to deflect it goalwards, nor play complex one-twos and wall passes,            nor do anything else that requires swiftness of motion and quick            thinking.                         Furthermore, UEFA's default system of dealing with the ball is            ludicrous. You can exercise all the restraint in the world,            watching the ball fly from Beckham's foot into the path of your            leading scorer, only to hit the button at seemingly the right            moment and watch your hero launch into an elaborate bicycle kick            attempt, completely missing the ball. Animations can now be            interrupted to an extent, but it's a surprisingly viscous            interpretation of football at times, and a little frustrating as a            result. Football should be smooth and graceful at this level, not            scrappy.                    If you're simply after an arcade footy title though, UEFA may have            something for you. Silicon Dreams has once again overdone the            aftertouch, meaning that bending the ball is as simple as hanging            onto that D-pad or analogue stick, offering a good way to            capitalise on dead ball situations since the AI-controlled players            have difficulty with all but the simplest attempts on their            defence.                         Speaking of the game's AI, it's a bit ropey in places,            particularly amongst the goalkeepers. If it was just Barthez            sticking to his line with the ball ten yards from it and racing            like a lunatic past the ball as it looped into the box every other            time, you might put it down to authenticity, but thanks to the            close default camera angle (the others are largely unusable) and            the keepers' insistence on loitering between the sticks at all            times, exciting one-on-one situations are completely absent. In PES            a one-on-one can be as exciting as the real thing, and Sony is            promising a lot of changes in this area with its TIF revamp later            this year, so it's a bit disappointing when you discover that UEFA            is hinged almost entirely on through-balls, dead balls and long            shots.                         Nevertheless, it's a momentarily entertaining romp, nowhere near            as refined and clinically detailed as Pro Evolution Soccer, but            still somewhat valid at times. If you want realism on the footy            field, you need to own PES, and it will keep you happy until its            successor arrives. UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002 is, well,            missing that final touch, but I'm sure it has an audience. Tune in            next year to see whether Silicon Dreams can live up to the promise            displayed here."}
