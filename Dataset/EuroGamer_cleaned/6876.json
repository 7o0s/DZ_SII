{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-dune", "date": "8 Jan 2002", "game_name": "Frank Herbert's Dune", "text": "Dune had everything going for it. It's based on one of the most            epic of science fiction novels, released to coincide with the            arrival on DVD of the eponymous TV mini-series and features a            mixture of third person adventuring and Metal Gear Solid style            stealth combat missions. Unfortunately it falls far short of its            potential.                        Things get off to a promising start with an excellent training            mission which teaches you the various moves that Paul ~Muad'dib~            Atreides can pull off. The animations are slick and life-like as            Paul scrambles his way over a pile of boxes and backs up against a            wall, edging along it before peaking round the corner and then            rolling past the opening. Sneaking up behind a guard on tip toes,            you take him by surprise and click your mouse button to            ~neutralise~ him, causing the game to switch to a dramatic camera            angle as Paul grabs him and slices his throat open. This has the            added benefit of providing you with the victim's all-important            water, which can be recycled by your stilsuit and used to boost            your health if you are injured.                        The rest of the combat system is somewhat less slick though,            requiring you to ~lock on~ to an enemy before you can fire your            weapon. This tends to be a rather hit-and-miss affair and            firefights are unnecessarily clumsy. While this is a            stealth-focused game, sometimes you have no choice but to gun down            an enemy and there's no reason why it should be this awkward. It's            also annoying that you can only use your knife if you take your            enemy by surprise; if a guard is alerted to your presence he will            just keep backing away from you, firing his gun as you futilely            wave your knife around in his face. Later in the game you can use            ~the voice~ to temporarily paralyze any nearby guards, but for some            reason this option is only open to you when you are almost dead.            Given that the voice is a precursor to Obi Wan's Jedi mind tricks,            this lacklustre implementation is something of a cop-out.                    The developers have also squandered many of Dune's other assets,            such as its epic back story and host of outlandish characters. The            game is set during Paul's exile in the deserts of Arrakis but all            of the main action takes place off-camera, with no real explanation            of what's going on or who most of the characters are. If you're not            familiar with the book or one of its movie adaptations you're going            to be left utterly bewildered.                        It doesn't help that two years of action is distilled into a scant            half dozen missions, interspersed with sections set in the Fremen            ~sietch~ where you can wander around the caves, chat with the            natives and pick up weapons and equipment you will need for your            next excursion. These sorties can be frustrating as it's sometimes            not entirely obvious what you're supposed to be doing, and you have            to pay close attention to any in-game cutscenes and conversations            to get through some sections. There is also no save system, so if            you get killed you have to start the mission over from scratch. As            there is no way to skip cutscenes this can rapidly get irritating.                        And some of the missions are just plain bloody minded. Your            introduction to Dune comes right after the Harkonnen invasion, with            you and your mother Lady Jessica stranded in the desert next to a            crashed ornithopter. After a short trek across the sand you find            yourself being chased by a massive sand worm, one of the most            impressive sights to grace a computer game in recent years. The            problem is that the camera switches to a low close angle facing            backwards to show the worm rearing up behind you, leaving you            unable to see where you're going. The obvious thing to do is follow            Jessica, but as soon as the worm appears she runs off screen and            disappears. You can't run back to the safety of solid rock either.            Instead you must act like a brainless action movie star and run            directly away from the worm, avoiding the darker patches of sand            which can bog you down. Because of the way the camera is positioned            you can't see what the sand is like more than a few feet in front            of you, leaving you floundering helplessly with no clear idea of            where to go or what to do. It took me more than a dozen attempts to            finish this short section, and if I hadn't been reviewing the game            I probably would have given up at this stage and demanded my money            back.                    Which is a shame, because underneath the awkward combat system and            shoddy presentation (the title screen proudly declares this to be            ~Franck Herbert's Dune~) there is a great game trying to get out.            There are rare moments of genius and sections which can be a lot of            fun, but overall it's a mostly frustrating and disappointing            experience. If Widescreen had been given a few more months they            could perhaps have made something of it, but as it is this Dune is            a waste of a good license."}
