The idea of charging through the Capital City Earthquake zone            running for our lives sounded like a fantastic idea for a game. In            fact the last time we recall playing a game remotely similar in            concept was a creaking, but rather good for its time, post            apocalyptic text adventure called Aftershock back in 1989. This            time around, though, the player gets to run around with structures            collapsing around his ears, uncovering a tale of greed, fraud,            deceit and human corruption. Yep, the survivors you encounter along            the way to safety are not always innocent victims, and eventually            you'll discover the truth behind this apparently 'natural'            disaster.        The game puts you in the shoes of a reporter, Keith Miyamoto,            who one day in June 2005 flies into Capital Island to start his new            job - but during his train journey from the airport an earthquake            devastates the city, derails the train and sends poor old Keith            flying. Our luckless hero finds himself left behind by the rescue            team, and is forced to clamber over wrecked vehicles and a rapidly            crumbling bridge in a desperate bid for survival - which is pretty            much where you come in.                    In each of the game's self contained areas you're forced to wander            around, picking up objects, avoiding flying debris and pre-scripted            collapsing buildings and making it through to the next section.            Most of the time the solutions are relatively simple, but unless            you happen to have a walkthrough handy you'll find yourself going            round and round in circles looking for the one tiny piece you've            missed in order to progress.                    While you're looking for clues, you'll be aware of two meters in            the top left of the screen. The top one denotes health, while the            lower of the two denotes Keith's thirst, and by god has this man            got a raging thirst. He's the thirstiest game character in the            history of thirst. And games for that matter. Literally every few            minutes you'll have to seek out another handily placed tap for you            to gulp from (which also double up as save points, oddly). Once you            pick up a backpack you'll be able to store water in bottles, but            even then, it seems overly pedantic to be forced to check on your            character's thirst every couple of minutes.        Thirsty Keith soon hooks up with a fellow survivor in dramatic            circumstances, the rather clueless Karen (or Jody as the press info            seems to insist). Finally you make it off the bridge onto the            island itself, only to discover all manner of evil shenanigans            going on. At this point the game's total linearity becomes            overwhelmingly apparent. Cars, lorries and buses lie crumpled in            charred, twisted heaps, blocking your path. But despite being able            to crouch, Keith cannot crawl under the vehicles. Thus almost an            hour was wasted trekking around looking for a sign of a way out            until it became apparent that one of the coaches has an emergency            exit which you can jimmy open. Duh. Admittedly sometimes we suck at            games, but this one reminded us of the kind of arbitrary dead ends            that point and click adventures used to present the gamer.                    Still, once you're off and running again, there are some genuinely            impressive scenes to witness, and experiencing a city that's            falling apart around you makes for an immersive and exciting            environment. Graphically, these moments of chaos are handled very            well, and really add a sense of reward for working out what to do            next. Sadly, the rest of the game's visuals rarely hit this height.            For the most part, you're fighting with a bizarre camera system            that does what it damn well pleases most of the time. You can hit            R2 to force the viewpoint behind your character, or triangle for a            free look perspective, but regularly you'll be falling to your            death thanks to the game's abject inability to give you a            sympathetic viewpoint.        Other visual niggles conspire to let SOS down, such as the            often appalling animation. Keith's lurching giraffe run animation,            for a start, is just plain daft, while the frame rate often slows            down to a crawl for no good reason at all (other than maybe just            being a duff PAL conversion). The texturing is old school first gen            PS2 throughout, and it smacks of a game that's using an engine well            past its sell by date.                    Even the sound effects give the impression of a game that's been            hamstrung by a low budget - check out the noise Keith emits when he            hauls himself up a ledge, or the swimming effects. They're truly            high points in gaming history. If you have a twisted sense of            humour at least.                    And on that train of thought, in true low budget Jap conversion            style, the voiceovers are also unintentionally hilarious, with the            kind of stilted, forced emotion that makes western gamers weep with            laughter. Ok, we're not here for the script, but it would be nice            if some effort had been made here, as the concept and the            storyline does have a great deal of potential. Strangely, once the            game ramps up beyond being a question of survival it does suck you            in with its conspiracy laced yarn.                    But for all its grandiose vision, SOS ends up being a survival            horror style adventure game without the shambling zombies,            featuring all the inventory management, health worries, camera            angle issues, control quirks and save game management of any number            of Capcom and Konami efforts of the past eight years. In the right            hands (i.e. a big budget developer) this disaster survival concept            could go on to become a fantastic niche genre in its own right. As            it stands though, it's a neat, refreshing original idea that            doesn't quite do enough to tempt \u00a340 out of your hard pressed            wallet.
