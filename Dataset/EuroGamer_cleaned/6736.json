We were lucky enough to get our hands on the first couple of missions in one of the campaigns, as well as the opportunity to skirmish with the AI to our heart's content. And boy was our heart content...            The back-story is quite simple: Earth has had it. After years of            warring and a series of nuclear explosions near the Antarctic, the            Earth has started to spin off its axis, and according to the            scientists of the Lunar Corporation, within the next few years it            will do so by a staggering 17 percent, enough to bring about            catastrophe. And so instead of fighting for supremacy, the three            sides are fighting for survival, and the chance to escape the once            proud green and blue blob three hops from the sun.                           Lost Souls features three connected episodes centring on each of            the game's factions: the Eurasian Dynasty, the Lunar Corporation            and the United Civilized States. Over the course of thirty missions            players, set on the Earth's four continents instead of the vast,            barren wastelands of the moon as with last year's pseudo-sequel,            players will control three characters. The first is General Fedorov            of the Eurasian Dynasty, left in your control as he supervises and            preps the escape shuttles and protects them from UCS and LC            attacks. The player then moves on to a new recruit of the Lunar            Corporation, protecting a secret project from ED attacks, and then            Marcus Gordin of the UCS, a former defence minister. The plot will            intertwine all three campaigns and promises twists and turns along            with the usual plunder and domination.                    As with The Moon Project, Reality Pump is upping the level of            graphical detail, but unlike that game it should be easy to put            visual tomfoolery to spectacular use. Settings will vary from the            harsh icy wastelands of the Antarctic to the still-pretty greenery            of the remaining continents in the West, with stopovers on the moon            and elsewhere, each resplendent with pools of animated,            semi-transparent water and flooded with dynamic lighting. The full            day and night cycle means managing your units lighting just as much            as it does their other vital functions, and each unit has a            headlight function too, so in the dead of night, when you most fear            an attack, it might be best to have them facing outward and not            simply clustering in the centre of the base.                           Other effects tickling the belly of our graphics card include some            glorious bump mapping, obviously useful on the surface of the moon,            as well as fog, snow, rain and lightning weather effects. Reality            Pump has also built in dynamic shadows to match those lighting            effects, and what's more, shadows actually lengthen as the day            draws on, not just cast by units but also terrain, so you might            want to think twice about building your base at the foot of a            mountain unless you want to keep the lights on most of the time -            at the cost of a great deal of energy, which your power plants            won't thank you for having to pump out. Unit and building detail            hasn't suffered in the wake of all these special touches either,            with designs still standing up to closer inspection.                    Research trees are still extensive, and the complexity will have            you scratching your head in search of the best path. Unit diversity            is also assured. A stealthy batch of armoured vehicles may sneak            through radar screens undetected allowing you to compromise an            enemy's base and plunder it when they aren't expecting it, but you            could almost certainly build greater numbers of the same armoured            vehicles without the added cost of stealth. Is it worth it? Therein            lies the strategy.                           So far it's easy to build up a varied force and the typical mouse            controls and easy keyboard shortcuts mean it takes little effort to            manipulate your forces in battle. What's more, you can get a better            view of things by rotating the camera and raising or lowering the            angle. The mechanics of the game are still very much            build-and-destroy with a few added objectives thrown in for good            measure, but it's nice to be able to do things in comfort and            without cursing the engine every five seconds.                           At this stage, it's difficult to say how the three campaigns will            turn out in their entirety, but for now the setting and mechanics            are very promising. Skirmish mode offers plenty of options for            extended play, and of course you can tweak the various settings            that govern your starting parameters. Lost Souls may not make            sweeping changes to the real-time strategy formula, discarding            accepted methodology and so on, but it does seem to be a            good old-fashioned RTS game, and it may well be worth a look            when its September release date dawns. Just don't forget to turn            the headlights off."}
