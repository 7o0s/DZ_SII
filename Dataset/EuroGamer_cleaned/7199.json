We            already know of their PowerVR technology, which has met with mixed            results, but many of you maybe unaware of their relatively new            series of speaker systems.                    They have attempted to cover, and I think very successfully met the            demands of, each entry point in the market. For the hard core            gaming elite they have the Sirroco Crossfire, and for the more            movie mad users out there they have created the Digitheatre.                    In this review I shall be looking at both products in their own            separate contexts in order to help you make the decision of which            set would be better for you...                    First up we have the new Sirroco Crossfires. The original            Videologic Sirroco speaker system comprised a 3 piece set of two            satellite speakers and one sub woofer, as well as a truly monstrous            amp that drives each of the speakers individually (in fact there            are two amplification circuits for EACH speaker).                    With the arrival of such 3D audio API's as A3D and EAX, it was            clear that a two speaker set up would not be able to do them full            justice. As a solution they came up with the innovative four            speaker system that is the Crossfire.                    They use the same amp, which is not a bad thing as it does provide            a level of power and response only seen in traditionally much            higher end systems, and instead of driving each part of the speaker            individually (one amp circuit for the woofer and one for the            tweeter) they now drive both parts of the speakers from one            amplification circuit.                    This may seem like a cop out, but in doing this they have reduced            any extra cost and are able to provide four speaker sound with only            minimal design changes.                    In order to reflect this the speakers themselves are much smaller            units, yet overall the volume level is similar to the original two            speaker system. The subwoofer used is the same as in the standard            Sirroco system though.                    The speakers themselves, while deceptively smaller, don't have a            significantly lower quality or volume output and still have a truly            phenomenal frequency response range. Being as small as they are            they don't have much of a bass response though, but that is the            reason for the separate subwoofer. This also helps separate the            multitude of frequencies in any given sound better across the            speakers, allowing each one to perform at its best.                    The amp, and specifically the inputs, are where the real 'gaming'            implications exist. The amp itself has 3 separate input channels            which are selectable from a nice big knob on the front. The primary            input has four input channels - front left, front right, rear left            and rear right.                    When coupled with a soundcard that can output separate front/rear            left/right outputs (such as the Vortex2 based Sonic Vortex2 from            Videologic), each speaker outputs only the specific audio            information sent to it, thereby providing true 3D positional audio            effects.                    With more and more games taking advantage of 3D audio technology,            titles will sound increasingly more realistic and authentic when            heard on the Crossfire system.                    As a side note, there is also one other connector on the back of            the amp which has a very special function, but I will come back to            that later...                    The Digitheatre is a product aimed squarely at the DVD-Video            market. The basic premise behind Digitheatre is a system capable of            reproducing the full 5.1 Dolby Digital (also known as AC-3, which            is the compression type) signal that exists on DVD-Video discs.                    It is unsurprising to find then that the system consists of five            speakers, four for front/rear left and right, one centre channel,            and a dedicated sub woofer. Also included is the 'black box' (more            formally known as the DigiDecoder) that takes the AC-3 feed and            converts it into the full 5.1 Dolby Digital sound stream.                    The connectivity of the system is fairly impressive, and at first            the new owner may be thoroughly confused. Not to worry, Videologic            supply a very well written manual that explains the entire system            and how to get the best out of it.                    To go into a little detail, the output from the DVD decoder            (whether it be from a dedicated SP/DIF or an optical output) is            plugged into the DigDecoder. From there the signal is processed and            fed out through five RCA style jacks which connect directly into            the amp that is housed in the sub woofer unit. It is from these            five separate signals that each speaker is driven in order to            recreate the Dolby Digital effect.                    The speakers themselves are of reasonable quality but do not            compare to those found in the Sirroco speaker sets. They are good,            especially for a system of this price, but they cannot fully            compare to those used in the Crossfire system. The upshot is that            an extra speaker can be added without significantly impacting on            the price.                    The amp used in the sub woofer is also of lower quality than the            Crossfire amp, yet will still pump out thumping bass to really make            those explosions feel real. It truly is a relative scale when            comparing the two products as both are really very good in            comparison to the current market offerings, and it seems almost            terrible to have to describe either of them as being ~not quite as            good~.                    The final component is the DigiDecoder. This little black box is            based around the latest Zoran DSP, which co-incidentally can be            found in many higher end AC-3 decoders that are used in cinemas            worldwide, and cost many times more than the cost of both speaker            packages put together.                    The decoder accepts co-axial style SP/DIF, TOSLINK optical and            standard 2 channel RCA inputs, although the SP/DIF and TOSLINK            inputs can not be run at the same time, as the system will only            accept one digital input signal.                    From these inputs the audio can be accepted as either a digital or            analogue input (depending on the connectors used), and appropriate            processing is performed.                    There are a range of output modes including Dolby Pro-Logic (the            analogue precursor to Dolby Digital), 4.1 surround, and even 2.1            surround (where the other channels are virtualised into the other            speakers).                    You can also adjust the volume and delay settings for each speaker,            thereby customising your experience to your own tastes.                    The DigiTheatre is another impressive system, and after spending            many hours watching DVD movies I have found it hard to listen to            the audio tracks on anything less that the DigiTheatre.                    Both speaker sets are truly magnificent and deserve a great deal of            praise.                    There is however one interesting solution that I have kept back to            surprise you... As I have stated, the Crossfire system is extremely            good for listening to music and true 3D positional audio, and the            DigiTheatre is suited for those who want to get the best out of            their DVD's.                    Wouldn't it be cool then to be able to create a hybrid system that            took the best parts from each? I certainly think so .. as do            Videologic.         Do you remember that I mentioned                 there was another input connector on the back of the Crossfire                 amp? What Videologic have cleverly done is to allow a user to                 utilise the four inputs on the Crossfire amp and correspond                 them to the four outputs of the DigiDecoder.                    Now what about the fifth and the sub? Well thanks to the            DigiDecoder the fifth (centre) channel can be virtualised, thereby            creating 4.1 surround. Okay but that still doesn't explain the sub.            The extra input on the Crossfire amp is a direct feed to the sub            woofer, and can therefore provide the .1 required to create 4.1            surround.                    This is certainly clever, and it is this way by design rather than            accident, and to save you buying both sets in order to create this            hybrid they also sell the DigiDecoder as a separate unit.                    It seems that one could now have the best of both worlds, should            your budget stretch to it. If not, then merely analyse what you            listen to most on your computer.                    If you would rather enjoy playing games in true 3D positional audio            and listening to music on your PC then the Crossfire is more the            product for you. If you tend to be more fanatical about your DVD            movies, but still want a rich audio experience from everything            else, then the DigiTheatre will be more suited to you."}
