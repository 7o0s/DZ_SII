Although it was a real-time strategy game, Z replaced the now            traditional harvesting and mining of games like Warcraft and            Command & Conquer with a resource system based on occupying            territory.                    The newly released sequel Z : Steel Soldiers is much the same, with            each map split into several territories and players battling to            reach the flags which control them. The more territories you            control the more rapidly you will gain credits to spend on new            units and buildings, and every battle therefore tends to begin with            a mad dash to touch as many flags as possible, shortly followed by            a chaotic mid-field scrum as the two sides clash and try to hang on            to the territory that they have already grabbed.                    Once things have quietened down a bit you might find time to build            up your base, change your army from a disorganised rabble into a            well-honed fighting machine, and start indulging in some actual            tactics instead of just throwing troops into the grinder. Z is not            going to appeal to the more sedate and thoughtful strategy gamers            out there - if you sit back and expand slowly the enemy will be            swarming into your base with hordes of robots and tanks before you            know what hit you. The only way to win the game is to hit hard and            hit fast, then desperately try to regain control of the situation            once the initial tank rush is over.                    At the heart of Z is a single player campaign featuring a linear            progression of thirty missions, linked by comic book style            cutscenes which look good but are mostly deeply unamusing. Someone            must have surgically removed the Bitmap Brothers' sense of humour            since 1996, because the jokes in the game usually fall fairly flat.                    Mission objectives vary from rescuing prisoners of war and            escorting your commander through enemy territory to ambushing            convoys and capturing enemy buildings. This keeps the story moving            along nicely, with your commander Zod managing to break a            cease-fire between TransGlobal Industries and the MegaCom            Corporation, just when it looked like five centuries of war was            about to end. The good news is that he may have uncovered a            conspiracy in the process. As with most real-time strategy games            though this is all fairly irrelevant once the shooting starts.            Because of the way the resource system works you will have to grab            as much land as you can just to stop the enemy from building up too            much of an advantage, whatever it is that you are supposed            to be doing. The AI is bloodthirsty if a little uncoordinated, and            if you let it get the upper hand it will keep throwing troops at            you until it breaks through.                    Your own units on the other hand are apparently a bunch of            pacifists. Even on the ~aggressive~ behaviour setting they will            often ignore enemies, even when the tank next to them is getting            pelted with rockets. This forces you to keep an eye on all of your            troops to make sure that none of them are being picked off by enemy            artillery or helicopters, which makes things even more chaotic.            There are also some irritating features, like the unstoppable air            raids which infect your buildings with a virus that causes guns to            fire randomly (often blowing each other up in the process) and            cancels factory build queues, forcing you to waste time setting            everything up again once the virus wears off. The game is already            pretty frantic at times, and the last thing you need is to be            forced to babysit your units and mess around giving the same orders            over and over again.                    Unfortunately this isn't helped by the game's interface, which is            primitive at the best of times. Thankfully a few more hot keys have            been added in the latest patch, but even with the new found ability            to remove units from a group (ooh!) and select every unit of            the highlighted kind currently on the screen (ooooh!), it is still            clumsy and requires far more effort than should really be necessary            in a fast-paced strategy game.                    Z seems to be lacking polish, and it was rather worrying when we            opened our boxed copy to discover a little leaflet warning that            there was a problem with starting the game up under Windows 2000,            and suggesting you download a patch from the            official website. Even            more worrying was that at the time of writing the latest patch            wasn't available there - you have to go and                        download it from            FilePlanet instead - and            that even after patching the game still sometimes crashes without            warning.                    In fact, the supposed Windows 2000 problem also effects other            operating systems, and it's hard to see how the beta testers could            have missed it. When you start the game the anti-piracy CD check            system doesn't shut down properly and leaves the game itself in a            background window. Unless you click on the greyed out pane to bring            it back to the front, the game just sits there without ever            loading. Whoops. The new patch more or less fixes this rather            obvious flaw, as well as solving an issue with the pathfinding code            freezing the game up for a second or two when you give your troops            a complex movement order, and curing various other annoying little            bugs and gameplay issues which afflicted the out-of-the-box version            of the game.                    One area where Z has been suitably polished though is the graphics,            which are nicely detailed from the rolling terrain to the chunky            tanks and helicopters and the satisfying explosions they produce            when they get blown up. Artillery shells arc gracefully through the            sky while bullets rip past you and smoke and flames rise from            damaged vehicles and buildings.                    The game's thirty missions are spread across six worlds, including            the seemingly inevitable ice, desert and lava worlds as well as            lush forests dotted with Mayan ruins. The terrain isn't just there            to look pretty though - taking the high ground will give you a            tactical advantage over your enemy, although you have to balance            that against the need to carry on expanding to capture more            territory and so earn more resources.                    Most maps also include one or more bridges which can be repeatedly            blown up and repaired, and these often act as chokepoints between            opposite sides of a river, allowing you to hold off tanks and            infantry by destroying or defending them. Amphibious APCs can be            used to carry robots across rivers or lakes, but there are usually            only certain areas where you can drive in and out of the water.            There is plenty of room for tactics here, but due to the fast pace            of combat and the clumsy interface you will have to be quick and            patient to achieve anything much more sophisticated than a tank            rush, especially during the anarchic opening stages of the game.                    Steel Soldiers does a reasonable job of bringing the novel gameplay            of Z to a modern audience, but it's far from perfect and could            probably have used a few more weeks of fine tuning. Even after            installing the patch it's still a bit awkward to control, and lacks            many of the interface niceties we have come to expect as standard            in our strategy games since 1996. On the bright side the lengthy            single player campaign should keep you busy for quite a while, and            there are also a few maps available for multiplayer and AI skirmish            games, which can be fairly entertaining as well.                    If you like your real-time strategy fast and furious and don't mind            a few rough edges, this could be just what you were looking for."}
