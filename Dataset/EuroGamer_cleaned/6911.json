It's all about            raw, unadulterated speed, and holding your finger on the            accelerator until the screen becomes one vast motion blur. It's a            game that makes Wipeout look like Driving Miss Daisy.                        Astride your precarious looking hoverbike you will reach the kind            of speeds which are normally reserved for astronauts and fighter            pilots, thanks to an ingenious system of winding magnetic tubes            which act as race tracks. Most of the time you will be locked to            the inner surface of the tube with your finger glued to the            acceleration key, able to swing left and right to position your            bike on the wall and .. that's about it really.                        There are no brakes; brakes are for wimps. Instead you have a            cooling system strapped to your supercharged engine which slows you            down a bit whenever you use it. Your engine temperature slowly            rises as you speed along and run into things, with a display box in            the bottom left corner of the screen indicating how hot things are            getting under the hood, eventually flashing warning lights at you            if the bike gets too warm for comfort. If you push too hard and            then hit something your engine may explode entirely, putting you            out of the race, so it pays to keep an eye on the cooling            situation.                    You can also detach yourself from the wall of the tube, although            this slows you down to a crawl. The one real use for detaching is            to grab the power-ups which appear floating in the middle of the            tube at certain points, as these can improve your turbo boost or            cooling systems, or simply provide you with a nice juicy cash bonus            at the end of the race.                        Bonus strips are also scattered liberally along the length and            circumference of the track, coming in blue and yellow varieties.            Riding over blue ones will cool your engine without slowing you            down, while yellow ones provide you with several seconds worth of            turbo power, allowing you to accelerate rapidly to supersonic            speeds, assuming you don't hit something first. Lap times and            maximum speeds are stored in a good old fashioned high score table,            and my personal land speed record currently stands at a            mind-blowing 1625mph, more than twice the speed of sound. No doubt            you can go much faster with practice.                        It's not all plain sailing though. There are obstacles to watch out            for, mostly consisting of nasty looking red spikes that knock you            off the magnetic surface of the tube and giant metal crosses that            straddle the track and can bring your bike to an abrupt halt if you            hit them. Some tracks also include walls which sprout from the            sides of the tube and block off part of the surface, and laser            beams which slow down anything passing through them. All of this            makes races fast and furious. Travelling at over 300mph even            without your turbo, avoiding obstacles is more a matter of instinct            than reactions, and you will need to memorise every twist and turn            of the tracks to beat the game on its hardest setting.                    There are only seven tracks for you to master, and although they            are each several miles long you will be averaging over 400mph by            the end of the game, bringing lap times down to under a minute. On            the bright side there is plenty of variety amongst this scant            selection, and once you have unlocked a track you can race on it in            any of three difficulty modes.                        At first you have access to a handful of tracks in Rookie mode,            which lulls you into a false sense of security by making it almost            impossible for you to come unstuck from the inside of the tube, and            rapidly latching you back on again automatically if you do hit            something hard enough to dislodge your bike. Once you have won the            Rookie championship you can progress to the Pro mode, which unlocks            a couple more tracks and forces you to reattach yourself manually            if you lose contact with the tube. This is perhaps the most            enjoyable of the three modes, with a good balance of speed and            challenge. Finally there is the Ballistics mode, which is downright            insane. The slightest collision will leave you flailing around            desperately trying to fix yourself back on to the magnetic track,            and the other riders seem to travel with their fingers permanently            clutching the turbo boost button.                        Throughout these championships you will earn yourself valuable            dollars which can then be spent in the shop on upgrades for your            bike. New engines, cooling systems, noses and even seats can be            bought, all effecting the performance of your bike. It's not just a            case of buying the best one you can afford either - several stats            govern how your bike handles in a race, ranging from obvious things            like top speed and acceleration to mass and heat output. Getting            the fastest bike money can buy may result in a vehicle that gently            boils its rider over the course of a race and breaks up into little            pieces when you breath on it, and you will need to find the right            balance to match your playing style.                    Although every track is basically a long contorted tube, the walls            are highly detailed and beautifully textured, while occasional            transparent sections give you glimpses of spectacular scenery            flashing past outside. Settings vary from the jungles of Belize to            the icy wastelands of Siberia, along with futuristic cities and            stunning canyons.                        The result is gorgeous, but not quite perfect. Some of the tracks            suffer from scenery pop-up in the far distance, which is common            enough in racing games. In Ballistics though the sheer speed at            which you are travelling means that most of the time you will be            focusing on the horizon, looking as far down the track as possible            to give yourself more time to avoid any obstacles. Sadly this means            that any pop-up is more distracting than it would normally be,            especially when you are looping the loop and the track has a            disconcerting habit of appearing out of thin air above your head.            The game could really have afforded to sacrifice some of the            stunning detail, which you can barely notice when you're travelling            at twice the speed of sound, to increase the draw distance. You            will also need a powerful PC to get the most out of the game, and            if you don't have enough memory you may experience some stuttering            as data is pulled from the hard drive half way through a race.                        While the graphics are generally very good, multiplayer support is            a little disappointing. The network code is rock solid and works            amazingly well given the high speeds involved, even over a 56k            modem, but there is no in-game server browser or lobby system.            Instead you are reduced to hunting for opponents on messageboards            and IRC channels, firing up the game and then typing in the            server's IP address by hand. This might have been acceptable five            years ago, but today it's a bit primitive.                    Ballistics is probably the fastest motor racing game ever made, and            also one of the best looking. It's more about lightning reactions            and blind faith than finesse though, and you will rarely take your            finger off the accelerator. It can be frustrating at times, with            obstacles appearing in front of you faster than you can react, but            when you get ~in the zone~ and find yourself flashing around a            track at twice the speed of sound with the game's pumping            electronic soundtrack ringing in your ears, the sheer adrenaline            rush is unbeatable."}
