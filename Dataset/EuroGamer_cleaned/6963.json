{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-gilbert", "date": "22 May 2001", "game_name": "Gilbert Goodmate and the Mushroom of Phungoria", "text": "Once upon a time there was an evil wizard who lived in a castle            near the little village of Phungoria. The bravest villagers tried            and failed to kill the wizard, until one day it fell on the young,            rather goofy looking Marvin to take his turn.                    Surprised by the wizard on his way to the castle, Marvin was            knocked off his feet and lost his sword. But just when he looked            certain to die, he saw out of the corner of his eye .. a giant            mushroom! Using the outsized fungus, he whacked the wizard upside            the head, striking him down and thus saving the world. Of course,            when he got home it was the fungus rather than Marvin which got all            the glory, and an annual mushroom festival was established to            remember how the world had been saved. Each year someone was picked            from the village to look after the mushroom, which has sat safe on            its plinth in the town square ever since.                    Until today. Because today Abraham Goodmate was hit over the head            with a large blunt instrument while he was cleaning the mushroom,            and the dastardly assailant grabbed the sacred toadstool and made            off with it. As young Gilbert Goodmate, it is up to you to recover            the mushroom and save your grandfather Abraham, who has been thrown            into prison and threatened with execution for allowing the relic to            be stolen.                    This being an adventure game though, finding the mushroom and            uncovering the identity of the thief is easier said than done. Even            getting out of your own house is something of a challenge, as it's            built on top of a tall mountain and the only way down is in a            ramshackle wooden lift. Unfortunately the crank snaps off in your            hand as you wind it up from the valley far below, and you won't be            going anywhere until you can fix it. It's going to be one of those            days...                    Luckily there are a vast number of items at your disposal            throughout the game and, like any adventure game hero, Gilbert is            something of a kleptomaniac at heart. There is no rubber chicken,            but you will be able to pilfer a crystal ball, a mouldy old potato,            some drugged honey, a book of bad love poems and a bottle of Dr            Fraud's Miracle Medicine during your travels, along with many other            equally bizarre items. Thankfully Gilbert has incredibly voluminous            pockets to store all of these objects in, and the sight of him            pulling an entire vaccuum cleaner out of his trousers is truly a            disturbing sight to behold.                    And the other characters you will meet on your travels are just as            strange. There's the hypochondriac who believes he has almost every            disease known to man, the suspicious looking agent from the            Phungorian Bureau of Investigation who is on a drugs stake-out            because the stolen mushroom may be a controlled substance (~we            believe it has certain .. unusual properties~), the paranoid Pete            who believes that the vikings are about to invade and spends his            entire life sat on top of a tower with a cannon, the fortune-teller            Madame Zyx with her freaky music and oil burners, and the cowardly            viking who needs to slay a fearsome beast to prove his manhood.                    A simple point-and-click interface is used throughout the game, and            holding down the left mouse button over any object or character            will give you a funny little mushroom-shaped icon which lets you            select whether you want to use the item with your hands, eyes or            mouth.                    Selecting the eyes examines the object more closely, the hands            allow you to pick up, touch or otherwise manipulate it, and the            mouth lets you eat and talk. Every item and character in the game            can be used with any of these three functions and the results can            be amusing, if not particularly useful. Usually if you try to do            something daft you will just get a message along the lines of ~I            don't want to look stupid~, ~it's not voice activated~ or ~I don't            think that will help~, but sometimes something truly silly will            occur.                    The game has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek, and there are            constant jokes at the expense of other adventure games, as well as            funny throw-away references to everything from Monkey Island and            Myst to soft drinks and the X-Files. Try using your sword on            another character, for example, and Gilbert will complain that he            doesn't have time to learn all of the insults, while the local            eccentric inventor Elton has a big UFO poster on his wall reading            ~Believe? I just want to build one!~                    Generally the humour is spot on, and there's plenty here to keep            you amused as you try to rescue your grandfather, recover the            mushroom and win over the beautiful Princess Michelle while            resisting the temptation to touch, fondle, grope or caress her (all            of which you will be offered the opportunity to do if you try            ~using~ her with the hands icon).                    Some of the dialogue can be a little long-winded at times, even            though it has been cut back slightly since the first version of the            game we received, and although the voice acting is mostly very            good, some of Gilbert's longer lines can sound a little flat and            lifeless at times, especially when he's reading from a letter or            book. But most of the conversations are funny enough to keep you            involved, and if you run out of patience you can always skip            forwards with the ESC key.                    The only real frustration is that sometimes you will have to wade            through a long chain of pointless small-talk before the game will            allow you to ask or do anything useful, and occasionally you must            go through several options before it will even let you out of the            conversation at all. At these points you have to wonder why the            game even gives you the choice of what to say, as you are forced to            use all of the options anyway.                    Apart from these few slight lapses in the dialogue and pacing            though, Gilbert Goodmate is a very funny and highly entertaining            adventure game, and thanks to the cartoonish hand-painted backdrops            it's also a good looking if rather low-tech one. Some of the            puzzles are a little obtuse, but they do at least make sense, and            some of them are obviously send-ups of other adventure games, such            as the daft tile-sliding and logic puzzles that you must solve to            enter a hidden cave.                    Coming hot on the heels of recent releases such as Stupid Invaders            and Escape From Monkey Island, Gilbert Goodmate proves once again            that the adventure game genre is still far from dead."}
