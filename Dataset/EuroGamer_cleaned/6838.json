There's a windmill just            ahead of me, with a broken spiral staircase slumping apologetically            into a pool of gleaming water. As I look around I'm dazzled by the            sun and have to retreat a few steps into the shade to see properly.            I've just beaten a severely irritating room packed with spirits of            the netherworld, but this is far from a thankless task. The serene            beauty of the scene before me, two hours into Ico's adventure, is            one of the most spectacular sights ever witnessed in interactive            entertainment, and this is nothing compared to the rest of the            game.                         ICO was borne of an incredibly simple concept: escape. The huge            castle in which the game is set was supposed to be Ico's prison and            eventual tomb, the last chance for his community to purge itself of            the burden of evil. Apparently children born with horns are no            good, telltale sign of coming famine and desolation, and so Ico            finds himself locked in a peculiar egg-shaped casket at the age of            twelve, shut away in an enormous, impregnable but more importantly            inescapable cliff top Bastille. When he finds himself the            beneficiary of an unusual stroke of luck, however, he - and by            extension the player - is offered the chance to affect an escape.                         Within a few minutes of escaping Ico comes up against a set of            tightly locked doors, signalling the end of his good fortune. But            not for long, as he spots a giant birdcage hanging from the ceiling            of an enormous room, which, he discovers, contains the fetching            princess Yorda, whose bizarre language is apparently incompatible            with his, or indeed our own. Releasing her proves important,            because some bizarre power pulses through her veins, and the            distinctive doors barring the couple's path magically part at her            very presence.                    It might not sound like it, but ICO is much more than a platform            puzzler, and although it sounds like a simplified Project Eden or            even an update of multi-platform classic Dizzy, it's definitely its            own game. Developed by Sony in Japan, it stars two extremely            anime-esque characters on a simple quest, battling to escape an            ancient foe. The castle wants to keep its prisoners, and as we            learn from what fragments of the story there are to put together,            it places a particular importance on keeping Yorda. But this isn't            about to stop Ico, as he runs through subtly detailed corridors,            across bridges and along balconies, hangs from the edge of cliffs            and swings from chains, all the time struggling to keep Yorda in            relative safety and within easy grabbing distance.                         As the game's puzzles grow in complexity and become multi-faceted,            often spreading themselves across several rooms, Ico is able to            gain Yorda's trust by treating her with respect and helping her to            solve problems she seems far too dizzy to complete by herself.            Indeed, as the game wears on she will take leaps of faith and            follow closely, whilst in the early sections the player has to keep            a tight hold of her hand to get her to follow at all\u2026                         Both characters are stunningly detailed and beautifully animated.            Ico's horns poke through a little cap, giving the impression of a            kid wearing a Viking helmet, and Yorda's dazzling, practically            bridal white dress covers up all the important bits while seeming            to float delicately on the light sea breeze. Her hair is brown with            white twinges and hangs unkempt about her face, and along with a            confused facial expression gives her a delightful unassuming            beauty. Ico moves swiftly and responds instantly to control input,            and it's clear in places that the developer has sacrificed the odd            frame of superfluous animation to maintain this speed. Elsewhere he            can leap dramatically in about a hundred different ways and catch            handholds with chilling realism. Who needs motion capture with such            stunning attention to detail? Keeping up her end, Yorda runs            buckled forward slightly when he drags her along, with her little            bare feet stumbling over uneven ground. The running animation is            utterly realistic and truly a sight to behold.                    Along the way spirits of the netherworld, working under the            instruction of a dark sorceress, fight Ico and try to drag Yorda            back through dark portals. These spirits are portrayed as            featureless bodies like silhouettes and shadows against the masonry            and fight bodily for the young princess, with two gleaming white            eyes the only sign of life about them apart from the unsettling            music that betrays their coming. Ico can beat them with his wooden            torch and later a sword, and although fairly relentless they are            there mainly to stop players from leaving Yorda unattended for long            periods of time. Slinging her over a shoulder and making for the            nearest portal, the shadow beasts are a nuisance, but a necessary            evil.                         The reason Ico's fight for freedom is so compelling is the way the            game manages to reward the player over and over again. There is no            HUD, no collectibles (apart from a few weapons) and no clich\u00e9d            objectives list to scan every five seconds. The control system            consists of walking, running, jumping, attacking, climbing and            calling (or dragging) Yorda. Along the way Ico can operate switches            and blow the odd thing up, and to help accentuate important details            the camera can zoom in to give players a closer look, but on the            whole the game is very simple and keeps its eye on the prize. The            only way a game like this can hope to keep people coming            back is through a creative reward structure. And the way ICO goes            about it is ingenious.                         To begin with, Ico is trapped inside, with menacing, eerily            spacious rooms and the odd beam of light penetrating the cloud            cover and bursting through the windows. Before long, however, Ico            is outside, looking out into the mist and facing the full force of            a sun low in the sky, with gusts of wind billowing in the air and            filling your ears with noise. As the player progresses, the sun            rises in the sky and elicits stunning visual effects. The rays are            soft and warm, and after a couple of hours you find jaw dropping,            meticulously detailed areas packed with grass, water and failing            masonry for them to embrace. Before much longer you're faced with            ornate structures built outside the complex, teetering on the edge            of enormous cliffs, and completing the puzzles within harnesses the            light - what else - to help you open the main doors and perhaps            venture one step closer to escape\u2026                    Complementing the peerless visuals with a measure of class is the            aural side of things. I have already made mention of the excellent            sound effects, but the voice acting is another highlight. Now, when            I say ~voice acting~ I'm speaking vaguely, because none of the            characters in ICO really speak English. Or Japanese. Or any other            known language. In fact, although all are subtitled, most of the            subs are incomprehensible squiggles with only a smattering of            vaguely crucial plot information translated. And still, the tone of            the gibberish Ico and Yorda spout to one another at irregular            intervals is surprisingly emotive. You can tell if they are            enthusiastic, excited, reluctant, even sad. Like the rest of the            game, it's art.                         The difficult thing with ICO is that it's over very quickly.            Trying to gauge whether or not a game is worth \u00a340 to the            average consumer is confoundedly tricky when the game in question            is just such an amazing achievement; a step forward not only in            platform and adventure games but videogame entertainment as a            whole, but takes only a handful of hours to complete. My advice to            those of you who haven't already dashed out to buy the game - which            is sold in a special foldout presentation package with four            postcard-type freebies - is to dash out and rent it, finish it in a            couple of days and then decide whether the lure of            second-time-through extras is enough to warrant a purchase. It will            surprise you just how quickly time flies in Ico's world, and every            time you reach a save point - a stone sofa upon which both            characters must flop to be able to record progress - it seems            unbelievable that it really has been going on for that long\u2026            One reason for this is that the game is tremendously varied in its            puzzles, and even the very simple ones offer some sort of carrot on            a stick to keep you going.                         ICO has been changed since its arrival in Japan and the States to            include extra content, and once completed subsequent plays reveal            what Yorda actually says, which is worth a second go all by itself.            A much appreciated 60Hz display mode is also included in the PAL            release. The reason I will keep coming back to ICO though, is the            seamless and vivacious game world and the way everything            consistently comes together in the nick of time. Even the solution            to the most obscenely complex puzzle, consisting of multiple tasks            in a number of areas of the castle, always seems to deposit our            heroes in exactly the right place to continue their quest. There is            never a question of bad design. This is the purest game I've played            in years. Criticisms? Maybe the camera - controlled by the right            analogue stick - could sweep back to Ico a bit quicker, but that's            about it.                    In an industry justly accused of leaning towards style over            content, ICO is a beacon of light and a bastion of superb game            design. Thrusting aside the seesaw of graphics and gameplay which            seems to have emerged in recent years, ICO entertains consistently            and effortlessly and rewards the player with more of the same. And            although it seems strangely ironic to round ICO's time off with a            clich\u00e9, if there is only one PlayStation 2 game you play, make            it this one.                        -        ICO previewICO preview"}
