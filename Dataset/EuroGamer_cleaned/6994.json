Okay, with the possible exception            of ~Legend of the Mystical Ninja~ on the SNES. Lets look at the            reasons it was a success. Firstly, it actually included a sniper            rifle complete with LCD zoom. Second, oh, it included a sniper            rifle. Third, fourth, fifth\u2026 you get the picture. Only people            like you or I who weren't simply gasping at its genius in            the presence of four beer-soaked friends, actually cared about the            game's pace, style and, at the risk of evoking a P45, scope.            (Clear your desk -Ed)             Bringing it home was always going to be tricky. For starters, much            to everybody's disappointment, there's no sniper rifle. Such a            peripheral would, despite impressing the wife and terrifying the            kids, have cost upward of \u00a3100. After playing the PS2 version            of Scope for a while though, I'm actually of the opinion that the            game as it is plays better without the gun. Sure it takes a            little getting used to, but after a while it's no harder to line up            a sprinting terrorist in your sights with the analogue stick than            it is with the big plastic sniper rifle.                         For those of you that haven't played Silent Scope, the idea is            very simply to remove you from the height of the action, and equip            you with the means to pick off enemies from miles away. As such you            are rarely in any danger yourself, but you have to make sure no one            on the ground is either, by centring your view on those rapscallion            terrorists with the itchy trigger fingers and putting a bullet in            them first.                    Graphically the game hasn't changed at all - it is as far as the            eye can see arcade perfect, right down to the splattering blood and            polygonal explosions. Regrettably though, the perfect port from the            arcade extends further than the visuals.                         Arcade games aren't meant to be games one plays on a console at            home. Developers should know, gimmicky concepts will earn you big            in the arcade, but putting them in the home is always difficult for            a trio of reasons. Firstly, you lose any big gimmicks you've been            using, i.e. sniper rifle. The pace of the game isn't necessarily            correct for a closed audience, not to mention the fact that arcade            games are notoriously short, because you need your player to feel            that all those coins he's been pumping into the machine are working            toward something.                         The thing that makes Silent Scope so hard to recommend is that,            yes, it is very short. It's great fun while it lasts, naturally,            but a couple of hours' gameplay is never going to be enough to win            people over. If we had been making Scope, we'd have trimmed out            some of the bad bits, produced a bunch of original levels, slowed            the pace down and included a classic arcade mode for            completists. However, as is sometimes pointed out to us when we go            on these little daydreams, we don't make the games, we just review            them. Bah humbug.                         Back to the good bits for a while though. As I said before, the            arcade version included a tactical sniper rifle, and the main            purpose of that rifle was to use the LCD display to zoom in on your            victims. Part of its attraction was that it felt like you were a            real sniper. You weren't just someone with a Light Gun pointing it            at targets. In order to try and retain this feeling (and make it            possible to see your victims, who are often several hundred metres            away), Konami superimposed the LCD view onto the main view, and            allowed you to control it with the O button. When the O button is            released, you zoom in, and the display moves more slowly so you can            precisely position your shots. When you depress it, you can zoom            around and broadly centre on the target. Using the two in tandem            quickly develops into a fine art, and unlike some other games we            could mention, repeating the action of picking off bad guys over            and over does not lose its charm. And incidentally, I reckon            I have the best aim in the UK by now, so watch out, chumps!                    Control-wise, that's pretty much it. Get to grips with the analogue            stick and a couple of buttons, and before long you can waft around,            zooming in a split second and putting a bullet in a terrorist, or a            truck driver, or the pilot of a jump jet. We kid you not. The level            design is really quite ingenious at times. We could have predicted            that we would be firing from the tops of buildings at street            battles, perhaps even into neighbouring buildings, and at a stretch            picking off the driver of a mad eighteen-wheeler might just have            gotten in there, but picking off terrorists as they invade an            American Football game? With the commentator telling the crowd to            keep calm while you pick them off from a chopper? How about taking            out the pilot of a jump jet? Oh we mentioned that one.                         Okay, how about parachuting under cover of darkness onto an            airstrip, having to shoot out searchlights so that you cannot be            pinpointed and fired at in the air, whilst simultaneously worrying            about anti-aircraft gunfire? You just do not get bored with action            like that. Incursions into Hotels are also impressive.                         At this point one might moan a little that the texturing is a bit            drab, or perhaps that gaining extra lives by managing to find a            naked lady in your sights or something similar is a touch crude,            but you can't fault the gameplay.                    I've not been looking forward to summarising Silent Scope, really,            and you're probably surprised that I have to start so early, but            it's also no doubt obvious where the full weight of my critique is            going to fall since I've pretty much described the entire game in            just over a page. Beyond what I've said there's a fairly decent            Training mode and some reasonable difficulty levels, but it didn't            take me long at all to finish the game, nor to get my aim down to a            finely tuned action - so much so that I can now finish most of the            levels without dropping a point.                         So here it is, Silent Scope's biggest flaw is its length. It's so            short that a reasonably skilled player (and certainly anyone who            has played the arcade version) will be able to overcome it in just            over an hour on their first attempt. There's no real capacity for            replay either, and no hidden extras to uncover. Silent Scope is a            thankless mistress, and not a terribly tough one either. I had all            I wanted out of her in a matter of hours.                         The dilemma one now faces is whether the game's ingenious concept            and pretty much faultless execution outweigh the lack of            replayability and length. I think this is definitely one you could            get the mates over for, but if you're buying it for yourself and            \u00a345 means as much to you as it means to me on a Friday night,            this isn't a good idea.                    I'm sick of praying for sequels to games that didn't quite make the            grade, so in this case I'm just going to say that Silent Scope            isn't good enough. It lacks replayability, scope (hah!) and it            costs \u00a345. If you're happy in the knowledge that you'll be            done with this in a day, then by all means buy it, it's a top            quality arcade game, but if you want something that will hold your            attention, look elsewhere."}
