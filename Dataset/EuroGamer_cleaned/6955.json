In this case,            the story goes that Japan kept fighting even after the Allies            dumped two atomic bombs in its back yard. The planned amphibious            invasion of Japan has had to take place, and since the European            fight was long-since concluded, Russia dedicated some of its mighty            red army to the fight as well.                         When all was said and done, and Japan had surrendered under the            combined weight of two invading superpowers, the country was split            up as Berlin once was, with Russia controlling the communist north            and a democratic state emerging in the south, backed by the United            States and NATO.                         Both of the ~allies~ were developing walking mechanized robots            during the conflict, and later on in the mid-60s at least one Asian            conflict was fought entirely by units of these Armoured Fighting            Walkers (AFWs). The occupation of Japan was enough to turn the Cold            War into a decidedly hot one though, so instead of retiring the            hulking metallic beasts to the coal shed, both sides have trotted            them out once more to decide once and for all who controls Japan.            It's the present day, and you're called upon to help fight the            cause in a far off land using AFW units and foot soldiers to            prevail.                    Instead of dumping you in the middle of a battlefield with some            weaponry and a few skeletons in the closet, as Konami's other            recent mech spectacle ZOE did, Ring of Red gives you strategic            control of the whole AFW army. Starting with the background            outlined above, the storyline develops in a fairly unsurprising            manner but remains suitably intelligent. It isn't quite as            inspiring as the fastidiously detailed Front Mission 3 or Final            Fantasy Tactics, but it has a certain charm.                         The big battles that you direct take place on a traditional grid            controlled by turn-based progression. The combat system, however,            is done head to head in real-time, which is one of the reasons that            you feel so close to the conflict. During an attack, your view            changes to a third person perspective overlooking an AFW unit            (comprised of a mech, one command crew and two groups of foot            soldiers), and as a result really big battles can take hours to            complete, seeming quite slow and laborious at first. The mechs            aren't terribly manoeuvrable, but they can plod back and forth to            get their weapons into range before firing.                    The game kicks off with training missions to acclimatise you to            this sort of combat, but these aren't terribly useful, and actually            had me frowning with boredom at the tedious task of directing a            single walker. Effectively these early encounters are simply a case            of waiting for your gun to load then emptying it.                         It's worth persevering though, because after a few missions you            get a larger unit of mechs and things hot up. As I've already said,            each AFW unit is one mech, one command crew and two foot units, but            I didn't mention that AFW units vary in their skill and            effectiveness under certain situations. This makes combat extremely            exciting, because with different strengths and weaknesses in            targeting certain types of enemy, you have to make a concerted            effort to mix and match your units' skills to achieve success.                         In fact, at the start, support troops seem weak and puny, but            you'll be surprised how useful their attacks can be as you work            your way through. If you spend the first series of tough battle            ignoring your enemies ~puny~ troops, you'll regret it.                    Overall, my only complaints with Ring of Red are the lack of voice            acting to animate the lengthy dialogue sections, the occasionally            poor translation from Japanese to English, and the pedestrian            soundtrack that backs up the action. To be fair, the soundtrack is            catchy enough, but it isn't terribly original and I'd much rather            listen to the themes from something like Red Alert. (That's an idea            actually - where did I put that CD?) Sound effects are of an            excellent quality throughout though, which must be deemed the            important thing. The clunks and grinds are just what one would            expect.                         Another thing that Ring of Red gets right is its graphics. This is            the PlayStation 2 so we expect a certain level of imagination and            finesse, but KCE Studios have taken no nonsense from their            publisher, opting for gun-metal grey and a drab, military look to            everything, which is a far more realistic interpretation of mech            warfare than the brightly coloured hues littering ZOE.                         Mech games are pretty regular these days thanks to anime's            newfound popularity in the West, but Ring of Red is a turn-based            action strategy game about mechs, and has more in common with Front            Mission 3 than the likes of ZOE and Virtua On. People who enjoy            involving battle strategy romps like FM and even Final Fantasy            Tactics will definitely find Ring of Red captivating. Thanks to the            rather laboured pace and the somewhat boring start though, it's an            overnight rental to decide for the rest of us.                        -        Front                    Mission 3 PSX ReviewFront                    Mission 3 PSX Review"}
