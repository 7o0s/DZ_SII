{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-colinmcrae3-x", "date": "24 Oct 2002", "game_name": "Colin McRae Rally 3", "text": "When you've got a benchmark product, everyone tries to knock you            off your pedestal, and Codemasters has certainly come in under            heavy pressure in the past year with the likes of RalliSport            Challenge and World Rally Championship (and soon Activision's Rally            Fusion) all providing more than adequate alternatives. So with            Colin McRae Rally 3 being Codie's first rally title on the next gen            systems it has a big point to prove - namely that it still rules            the genre.        The emphasis this time around is that you get to 'be' the man            himself, with the main crux of the game built around driving the            2002 Ford Focus RS WRC as Colin McRae in a championship season            against 15 other competitors, who each drive their own            authentically modelled car.                    And it's authenticity that CMR prides itself on, with Colin McRae            and (now ex) co-driver Nicky Grist both helping out in the            development process to ensure that crucial elements such as the            pace notes and the handling are as close to reality as possible. Of            course, 99.9% of anyone playing this game will have no idea what a            true Rally experience really feels like, so we'll have to take            their word for it on that one.                    It's certainly easy enough to admire the attention to detail            lavished on the various cars within the game. Accordingly, the            polygon count has risen to around the 14,000 mark, giving the            developers room to really model every aspect of the car - even down            to the interior - and it doesn't take more than a glance to see            that the results are beautiful. The tangible difference between            cars such as the Mitsubishi Lancer EVO 7, the Subaru Impreza WRX            44S, and the Citroen Xsara Kit Car, is certainly lost on most of us            here at Eurogamer, but for the car fetishists among you, you'll be            well catered for with plenty of hidden surprises to unlock too.        With            this in mind, it's a shame, then, that the same attention to detail            doesn't appear to have been lavished on the tracks. From an eye            candy point of view - on the Xbox - you'd certainly expect a whole            lot more than CMR3 delivers. It's not that it's ugly, because it            clearly isn't, but it suffers next to the highly underrated, and            'only on Xbox' (and, cough, PC) title RalliSport Challenge.            Firstly, the problem of scenery pop up hasn't been entirely            eradicated; certain bits of scenery such as the many trees that            populate the trackside just look dated and cardboard cutout-esque.            Jaggies are also rife, and the whole look of it is just plainly            unsatisfying for a next gen product.                    Frankly, side by side, RalliSport kicks CMR3's arse in the looks            department, and in every area you could think of. We suspect it's a            case of the product's PS2 state being a higher priority; an            understandable commercial decision, but nonetheless its            disappointing to see a machine as powerful as the Xbox not being            pushed as hard as it can.                    Before we move on from the visuals, CMR3 does have its saving            graces - firstly the weather effects (rain and snow) are absolutely            fantastic. The only problem is that the only way to see them is to            play from the dashboard viewpoint - which makes keeping the car on            the road an absolute lottery. It's a great effect that no one can            use. And to round off, it's worth pointing out that after a few            hours in the company of CMR3, you'll soon start to forget that it's            not the best looking game out there, but become more enamoured with            its numerous gameplay charms.        Gameplay modes are kept to a sensible, tried and tested            minimum: there's the obligatory single race mode (which in effect            trebles up as a time attack and practice mode). Single race            supports up to four players split screen (only up to two on PS2),            and gives players the choice of any (currently unlocked) tracks            from eight countries (Japan, Spain, USA, Sweden, Finland, Greece,            Australia and the UK).                    Just one track from each country is available initially, with the            exception of Australia, which has all six of its main tracks            unlocked. Still, 13 tracks is more than enough to choose from in            the game's early stages, and it's a nice touch that you can check            out all the different locales before you have to endure the blood            and sweat of the lengthy Championship mode.                    Ominously, when you do get round to starting a season, the            difficulty levels are 'Normal', 'Hard' and 'Very Hard'. It's almost            an admission that there are no easy races in CMR3, so gamers who            like to get straight into their racing games may want to think            about the challenge that lies ahead.                    Your first season as Colin sees you racing a fairly comprehensive            set of races: across six countries, with seven races in each - six            stages across two days, followed by a final one on one race set in            a stadium. Each race has four checkpoints, and you are able to            monitor how far off (or on) the pace you are as you progress            through each race.                    In true CMR style you can make small performance gains by            optimising and adjusting just about any part of the car you could            possibly want to - including brakes, chassis, suspension, gearbox,            tyres, and steering. There really are a bewildering number of            configurations that will affect the way your car performs out there            on the track. You get the option of doing this before every race,            although fortunately for those of us who'd rather not get our hands            greasy, the game's defaults will get you by nicely, too.        The real deciding factor            on the driving experience is the driving conditions. These vary            wildly depending on weather, time of day and, of course, your            locale, but they can even change dramatically on any given track,            with a sudden switch from tarmac to gravel all too easy to notice.                    It's here that familiarity will help get you through each race,            with plenty of evil sections capable of catching unprepared drivers            out. But while initial forays may seem a little daunting when            you're careering all over the track and diving off cliffs, once            you've got the absolutely superb handling nailed, and start driving            properly it all slots into place.                    But if you do come a cropper, there are some superb damage effects            to marvel at. The actual physical damage model isn't tremendously            impressive (Burnout 2 certainly leads the field in this respect),            but with so many areas of the car open to damage, the effects on            the handling of the car can be severe - even to the point where            your gearbox will mess up, you wheels will wobble, or even fall            off. Bad driving is most definitely not rewarded, but it's fun            seeing just how much carnage you can deliver on your car!                    Playing on normal difficulty, the more experienced players will            breeze through the first championship season in a couple of hours.            It's certainly made easier by the fact that your competitors tend            to mess up even more than you do, so you'll find that a steady            stream of second or third places won't affect your charge to glory            all that much. But what this first easy-ish season does do is            unlock a ton of extras that enhance the game's pick up and play            element.        To            begin with this facet of the game is slightly limited in that the            vast majority of the available tracks (and there are at least 56 in            total) remain locked until you've played them in the Championship            mode. Likewise, playing in this mode unlocks a variety of car parts            (making it easier to control your car on certain tracks), and even            better cars.                    And with the excellent, and nippy split screen mode, the more cool            extras you've unlocked, the more fun the game's 'arcade' charms            become. It's just a shame Codies didn't include a mode that allows            you to race against other CPU cars - as there's only so much fun            you can get from racing alone. It would have added a whole new            dimension to the game, and with all the competition out there, we            can scarcely believe they overlooked this.                    To sum up, Colin McRae Rally 3 has everything for the discerning            driving fan. It's handling, damage system, and realistic feel is            untouchable, without ever allowing it to get in the way of being a            fun game. If it weren't for the lacklustre visuals, this would get            an even more enthusiastic response - but if the looks don't bother            you, then CMR3 is pretty much an essential purchase for Rally fans,            and well worth checking out even if you're not.
