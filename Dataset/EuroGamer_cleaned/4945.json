With Halo, TimeSplitters 2 and Medal Of Honor: Frontline all            proving huge critical and commercial hits, the FPS fan has another            big title to consider, with Volition managing to finish work on its            Red Faction sequel just 14 months after the big selling original            hit the shelves.                    Last year's effort was by no means up with the greats of the genre,            being regarded by many as a fairly satisfying, but ultimately            flawed, attempt at emulating the scripted Half-Life style FPS.            Using the much vaunted Geo-Mod technology that allowed players to            blast through walls and predetermined pieces of scenery, it            provided a novelty that, in truth, failed to provide the            revolutionary (pardon the pun) gameplay that THQ had promised us.                    The ultimately annoying thing about Geo-Mod was its inconsistency.            Certain parts of the environment were destructible, while other            identically constructed areas remained impervious to attack,            meaning that players still had to follow a predetermined path. In            essence the ability to destroy parts of the 'geography' wasn't a            whole lot different to Duke Nukem 3D some five years before it,            except this time there was a handy buzzword to describe it.                    And sadly this year's version still follows this tightly            orchestrated approach, although THQ has made less noise about            Geo-Mod, so we'll stop harping on about it as well and acknowledge            that Red Faction still stands as a solid example of the genre, and            having been re-issued at \u00a319.99, is well worth checking out.        The first thing that's abundantly clear about version 2 is the            production values. Every element of the game from the front end            onwards has been given a degree of spit and polish that lets you            know that THQ is expecting big things from its latest hardcore            franchise.                    Set around five years after the end of Red Faction, a band of six            rebels are pressed into service to, basically, kick Chancellor            Sopot's arse. Each of the rebels has a specialist skill; the main            character Alias (i.e. the one you control) being a dab hand with            demolitions, while Quill, Molov, Shrike, Tangler and Repta provide            able assistance in areas such as sniping, heavy weapons, stealth            and so on. But we weren't too hung up on the story - there was far            too much killing and destruction to be undertaken\u2026                    The title page features a typically passionate monologue rant from            (we presume) your initial nemesis Chancellor Sopot, and the level            of presentation give it a unique feel that distances it from the            average gaming fare. The game engine has had a fairly impressive            overhaul, and as a result the overall look and feel is far more            convincing than last year's often sketchy effort. Indoor and            outdoor locales are far more varied and detailed this time around,            with delightful particle effects giving Volition plenty of            opportunities to show off with liberal use of smoke and steam. Over            the course of the game you work your way through eleven distinct            environments including a station, sewer, cathedral, subway,            military installation, and even an underwater section, so at no            stage does the game want in the variety department.        The            character models have likewise been given a noticeable lick of            paint. Far better animated and sporting levels of detail            unthinkable a couple of years back, the game cannot be faulted for            a lack of variety of different foes to kill. In fact variety is            pretty much Red Faction II's watchword as it continually throws up            new and interesting weapons of mass destruction, covering            everything from the basic pistols to machine guns, various types of            rocket launchers, loads of grenade types, different sniper rifles,            and even a well realised rail gun. Add to that a primary/secondary            fire for many of the weapons, and you're never short of new and            interesting ways to dispatch your foes.                    Red Faction II also keeps the interest levels high by occasionally            allowing the player to pilot vehicles, such as the Battle Armour,            which gives you the chance to stomp around as a Mech wreaking havoc            for a brief period. The Gunship, Tank and -later on - the Mini            Submarine all help elevate the game to a more interesting,            compelling first person shooter than your standard blaster. These            sections range from the engaging (Mech) to the downright bastard            hard (Sub), although once you're done with them, the lasting            impression is one of a pleasant diversion.                    Control wise, RFII follows the standard 'TimeSplitters' settings,            and as such are pretty much as good as you'd expect - although            nowhere near as slick in terms of sensitivity as TS2. However,            praise be for Volition for actually bothering to include a keyboard            and mouse option that so few other PS2 FPSs feature - so any real            die hard PC FPS fans will be able to play the game ~as nature            intended~, although to be honest you never feel like having to            resort to this.                    As with its predecessor, RFII includes plenty of multiplayer            options, for up to four players, including the usual suspects such            as Capture The Flag, Deathmatch, Bagman and Team Arena. The frame            rate holds up very nicely even in full on four player mode,            although when push comes to shove, we'd still have to maintain our            preference for a spot of Halo or TS2 for sofa based frag action.        Just as well all the points mentioned so far are uniformly            positive, because the story completely fails to engage at any            stage. Despite being littered with well detailed, well realised            characters, they're so utterly clich\u00e9d and stereotypical in a            thick headed Yank centric cartoon kind of way that you sometimes            feel completely detached from the action, just paying attention            long enough to get the gist of whose ass you have to kick ten bells            out of next. So often you're forced to recheck your objectives to            remind yourself what the point was of the last fairly tedious cut            scene. Apparently Lance Henrikson (bloke from Aliens/Terminator)            plays Molov, but in all honesty you'd never notice, with the plot            and general voice acting so infuriatingly banal you find your mind            wandering while you wait for the next section of gameplay.                    AI can be a little rough around the edges too, with the game            getting by more on weight of enemy numbers than employing any            revolutionary path finding system. The health system has been            pretty much nicked wholesale from Halo, with this at least            providing a degree of strategy to the combat, but health packs are            generally far too numerous for there to be any need to tread too            carefully - although the ante is raised considerably once you reach            the halfway point.                    The title's longevity is pretty questionable too - with just over            six hour's play on Medium difficulty we'd blitzed through nine out            of the game's eleven episodes. Most episodes are broken up into            several short, snappy ~chunks~, which gives the game a chance to            autosave and introduce some more narrative. In this sense it's far            more linear than other shooters have managed, but when everything's            as tightly scripted, it's hard not to adopt this approach.                    In truth, despite giving the gamer a huge arsenal, pleasant            gameplay diversions and dressing it up in shiny new clobber, RFII            doesn't take us anywhere we haven't been before, and plays by the            FPS rulebook for the most part. We enjoyed RFII a lot, but have to            concede that it's not the best example of its fiercely competitive            genre. Fans of the original will love this, but the more casual            observer might want to check it out before they take the plunge.
