As we left it, we remarked only that we hoped the upcoming            PS2 version would live up to its predecessor. Well, here we are,            over a year later and although Spider-Man The Movie is in            development on PlayStation 2, we still don't have a true sequel to            Neversoft's third person adventure. Not even a whimper. As such, we            were quite surprised when Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro arrived on            our doorstep earlier this month, but that didn't last long. Nope,            before the sun went down on our first day with the new Spidey our            surprise had given way to a sense of loathing and frustration.                         In fairness, a cursory glance at the packaging should have been            enough. All the warning signs were there. Gone was the            developmental mark of Neversoft, replaced by the mark of perennial            sequel and fodder experts Vicarious Visions. The screenshots were            also remarkably similar to the original game, and the game was            boasting new advanced web-pulling techniques\u2026                         If you're new to the series, Spider-Man is an excellent but            occasionally troubled third person action game with indoor and            outdoor sections, which see Spidey crawling all over the scenery            and swinging from imaginary skyscrapers. Unfortunately, what            Vicarious Visions have done is to take the quirky but exciting            formula of Spider-Man and aggravate all of its various problems.                    In the first game, sometimes the camera movement disorientated the            player, and web slinging was never an exact art, but things like a            rudimentary auto-aim and the constant variation in level design            kept us hooked and more than made up for the problems. Spider-Man            2: Enter Electro isn't so much a bad game, as a game that's lost            its way. It offers a few new techniques, but these only serve to            complicate proceedings.                         The control system has apparently been overhauled, but the end            result is a much sloppier incarnation of the previous version, with            almost Tomb Raider levels of sluggishness at times. To top it all,            the eccentric cameraman from the previous game is back, and this            time he appears to be taking speed in-between levels. Add to this            collection of problems the utter unoriginality of Enter Electro's            level design and infernally difficult boss characters and you have            a game built to frustrate.                         Spider-Man 2 also boasts a miserable learning curve. It starts out            with a few sections of reasonably easy web-slinging and combat,            with the Spidey kick-punch and throw combos retrieved from            Neversoft's code, but before long you're up against the game's            first brick wall, and his name is Shocker. I've never been pleased            with games that throw an impossibly difficult first boss at you,            because even if you do beat him, you know you've only another half            an hour or so of fun before the next bombshell. The trick with            Shocker is to use your newly acquired web-pulling technique to lob            crates at him. This would be fair enough, but the controls are so            sluggish that actually collecting a crate with your web and            slinging it accurately is hopelessly imprecise. Puzzles based on            web-pulling are the toughest in the game, and Shocker is probably            the worst of the boss characters as a result.                    If I had to finger one thing in my quest to sour the name of            Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, I would pick the control system. There            are plenty of points throughout the game where the control system            lets you down. Some of the mission objectives involve looking for            keys to a bomb, blowing things up and rescuing hostages, along with            other standard superhero fare. Many of these objectives rely on            avoiding contact with guards by clambering over the scenery            precisely, darting around hitting buttons and scouring the area for            various items. Unfortunately, climbing anywhere precisely is            impossible because of the sluggish control system, hitting buttons            is so badly implemented that you have to stand in full view of your            enemies for several seconds hammering the button on your control            pad before the game realises what you want, and scouring for            anything is next to impossible, because whenever you nudge the            D-pad a bit too far the cameraman whirls round and looks in another            direction. It's genuinely dizzying.                         As I'm sure anybody who played the first game will agree, the most            striking thing about it was that every new objective involved some            exciting new activity, like climbing the side of a building whilst            avoiding fire from a nearby chopper, racing across the city while            avoiding rocket fire, carrying out a controlled detonation of a            huge bomb and plenty more. In Spider-Man every second step was            something new, but with Enter Electro there is a complete lack of            originality. Our hero has to complete the same old missions with a            few of the names changed and so forth, and at times the game is            completely predictable, something the original managed to stave off            almost entirely.                    Rounding off this less than pretty picture are last year's visuals            and plenty of unexciting sound effects. When Spider-Man was            released, its visuals were set at about the pinnacle of the            PlayStation's capabilities. Nowadays, we hope for and expect            something more, and Enter Electro simply cannot offer it. There are            places where Vicarious Visions have attempted to spice things up,            but the result is just a choppy framerate. Even the cutscenes just            seem worse. Mouths still don't move when the characters            talk, and while that was forgivable in the original, it just adds            to the general sense of failure.                         Overall Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro has gone full circle. With the            original Spider-Man, its success in almost every area easily            outweighed its letdowns, but with the sequel the problems leave            whatever entertainment used to reside here in anonymity. If you            were a fan, you might want to rent this out for a night or two, but            only to confirm your fears. As we said at the end of last year's            review, we can't wait for the PlayStation 2 version, and at this            point that's what we really need. And Activision? Do us a favour -            give it back to Neversoft.                        -        Spider-Man reviewSpider-Man review"}
