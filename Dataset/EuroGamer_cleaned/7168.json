The USA and Russia have forever tiptoed their                 way around each other, knowing that the slightest unrest on                 either side could cause a world war catastrophe.                    In Battlezone 2 these two heavyweights have already been at war in            space. But a greater common threat exists now, with the impending            attack of a strong alien race known as the Scions. The decision is            made to unite and form the ISDF (International Space Defence            Force).                    Lucky old you has been chosen by the world powers to lead the            systematic planet by planet elimination of this alien threat. The            very fabric of life itself is hanging in the balance, and it's up            to you to do something about it! As the game goes on though, you            will soon find that not everything is as it appears...                    After the rather nice introductory video, you are presented with            the option to create your pilot. From here you are taken to the            main menu, which allows you to go straight into an arcade style            game, play the single player adventure fully, or take the battle            online.                    Choosing the 'instant' option will take you into arcade mode. This            lets you jump straight into a game against the computer, with the            fight ending when either side's Recycler is destroyed. You can            either choose to build everything yourself, or have the computer do            it for you automatically. The former is far more stress inducing!                    The 'single' option will take you into the full mission based game.            Here you will be briefed both by audio feeds from your commander,            and additional text information. Hit 'launch' when you're ready to            rock...         The first couple                 of missions serve as a tutorial to learn the basics of the                 game, the fundamental lesson being that your Recycler is                 paramount to any mission success. Once deployed, the Recycler                 is responsible for building other essential machinery such as                 Scavengers and Constructors.                    To build anything you need scrap or bio-metal resource pools, and            to mine these pools you need a Scavenger. Build and deploy one, and            you can now start to create your little empire. You will soon learn            that the Scavenger is your second most precious item to defend.                    Now you can create a Constructor. Looking like a cargo walker from            Aliens, this little beauty lets you create a whole variety of            buildings. Of course, buildings need power, so the first task is to            create a Power Lung. Once created, you can then build Service Bays,            Relay Bunkers, Gun Towers and more.                    Want a more advanced craft than the default Scout? Easy, just            create a Factory and you will soon be waltzing around in an Assault            Tank. Obviously the more advanced the building or craft, the more            resources you're going to need. This is where you will need to            locate more resource pools and deploy a Scavenger and some Turrets            to defend it. Meanwhile the enemy is also constructing, and your            base can come under attack at any moment.         Each craft in Battlezone                 2 is equipped with a different set of weaponry, which means                 you have to learn what ship is going to be of more useful at                 any given time.                    For example, you might be low on energy, and you have to secure a            resource pool surrounded by enemy turrets. Simple .. build and            deploy two or three Mortar bikes, tell them to target their            turrets, and bombs away!                    You begin with a simple ISDF ~Thunderbolt~ Scout, equipped with            Dual Guns and Rockets, and certainly for the first few missions the            Scout does an adequate job. The further you get into the game            though, the more help you wil need, and it can be extremely            satisfying to leave the base followed by a war party of four Sabre            Tanks, two Missile Scouts, and maybe an Assault Tank for additional            backup!                    Perhaps the neatest craft though is the ISDF APC. This ship will            fly from place to place, dropping off ground troops who will            infiltrate any base and die for the cause. It is quite awesome            watching these fellas do their work.                    And when hell breaks loose, it does it with great gusto! The            battles are fantastic fun - you get a great feeling of being in            charge, and most of the time everyone does as they are instructed.            Remember though, you must be careful to safeguard your key            buildings from attack, and more importantly .. keep your ass alive!                         Graphically, Battlezone 2 is a stunner. And, unlike the first                 game, this time it has a whole lot of atmosphere too. Some of                 the scenery is really quite breathtaking, and is nicely                 varied. One moment you can be flying around pink hued                 mountains, the next dodging and weaving through rich                 vegetation.                    One of the missions involves getting to another location on foot,            under the cover of night. This has to be one of the scariest            experiences I've had in a game in a long while. The dim glow of            twilight is superbly represented, with tree branches only dimly            visible, and water shimmering darkly. The eeriness of this mission            just can't be described. Wonderful stuff.                    Everything is lovingly rendered, and you can actually see the            buildings taking shape as they are constructed. Buildings are often            animated, and you can watch the Gun Turrets' twin cannons            revolving, looking very foreboding. The ships look brilliant too,            and are all unique in design. I defy you not to be impressed by the            Walkers and their alien counterparts, the Maulers.                    The sound department hasn't been neglected either. Distant gunfire            and the thunking of mortar fire is very well done, and weapon            noises range from the simple shrills of laser fire to the            ear-piercing scream of guided missile locking system. In a heavy            battle it can get a tad noisy!         I wasn't at all impressed                 with the original remake of Battlezone, released back in 1998.                 I felt at the time that it was nothing more than an                 extravagant demo for 3D graphics technology with no soul.                    But I must say I am pleasantly surprised by Battlezone 2, which            oozes atmosphere and looks superb. Mission variety and difficulty            is nicely balanced, providing hours of solid playtime, and the            interface is also very easy to manipulate and manage.                    There are times when your Constructor or Scavenger can get stuck            due to another vehicle being in the way, which can get very            annoying if you're hurriedly trying to build your base, with an            enemy attack imminent. It is, however, a tiny black spot on an            otherwise flawless experience.                    Multiplayer action is also very good. Servers are few and far            between at this time, but the games I did play were reasonably lag            free, and hugely entertaining. Even though the computer plays a            mean game, it's always better to face-off against a human            opponent...
