Otherwise you'd knowhe's playing Robert Langdon, the clean living scholarly star of the The Da Vinci Code.As you'd expect with such a huge film release these days, asimultaneous game launch across consoles and even mobile phones ispart of the deal, and publisher Blaze Interactive has promised four The Da Vinci Code mobile games in 2006.The first of these, released to coincide with the film, is a clever little puzzler called The Da Vinci Code: Light Puzzle. We've played enough puzzlegames in our time, each of which is usually a variation on a theme(Tetris clones still dominate). But this game offerssomething a little different.The basic gameplay involves directing the beamsof light that pour through the windows of the Rosslyn Chapel (thesetting for the book/film's grand reveal) into their respectivecoloured crystals. To do this, you must position mirrors around theroom to reflect the light where you want it to go.The first few levels are easy enough, but things get prettytricky pretty quickly, as more obstacles appear that you need todirect the light around. To make things even more complicated, newtypes of mirror as well as splitters and prisms are thrown in asyou advance through the levels.The object remains the same throughout, however: get the lightto illuminate the appropriately coloured crystals.While this is a pretty original concept for a game, it'sslightly disappointing that each level must be completed within aset number of moves, as the sun rises and sets in the background,with each 90 degree rotation of a mirror counting as a move. Theproblem is that one wrong button press when you're rotating amirror means expending two more turns to get it where you wantedit, which inevitably leads to you having to start the level againwhen you fail. A time limit might have been less frustrating, whilestill providing a stiff enough challenge.That said, the The Da Vinci Code: Light Puzzle is good fun, and it'scertainly different enough to make it worthwhile playing a fewtimes, even if it doesn't reflect (arf arf) the storyline of thebook and movie. It may not be a game that you play for longperiods, as it does get a little repetitive, but it's ideal for aquick level or two every day on the bus to work or school.The presentation of the game, as you might expect with the movielicence, is impressive, with plenty of nice in-game music, andwell-designed menu and loading screens. The in-game visuals are alittle basic, and the isometric view doesn't lend itself to thegameplay particularly well (a top-down view could have workedbetter), but everything important is clearly discernable.Best of all though has to be the in-game dialogue between RobertLangdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). The script isso poorly written it becomes positively amusing - a bit like the film, but at least this has agame to make up for it."}
