The            world has been waiting a long time for Hudson to take the 'bombing            blocks on a grid level' premise and turn it into a decent single            player game, and thankfully that time has finally come. Oddly, the            way it's been pulled off is so obvious that it beggars belief, but            first of all: the plot.                    Bomberman and Max are once again (the original BM was on Game Boy            Color) trying to stop the nefarious Mujoe from causing mayhem, but            before they can do anything, the evildoing uber-boss shrinks them            down to the size of an ant in one of those peculiar scrolling            text/still image story sequences the Japanese seem to love so much.            Now their challenge is much bigger, and starts off in the garden,            progressing across five worlds and roughly 80 levels.        Bomberman Max 2 comes in two flavours, giving you the            chance to play the game as either of the two heroes; Bomberman            (Blue) and Max (Red), and the idea of two versions is to restrict            certain levels, power-ups and so on to each cart - the Pok\u00e9mon            principle, if you like. So far so good.                    The levels work in a fairly obvious way, as we said. All you have            is a familiar grid layout with an arrangement of immovable chunks            and a number of 'soft blocks', which can be destroyed by laying a            bomb next to them. The idea is to complete a particular objective            on each level - be it destroying all the soft blocks, killing all            the enemies, etc - whilst avoiding various obstacles, like the            hot-footed and hot-tempered sunflowers, army ants and even            blob-spitting shrubbery.                    As you work your way around the board, freshly blown up soft blocks            yield various power-ups, which do pretty much anything; allowing            you to take a hit from an enemy; giving you the chance to walk over            a planted bomb (useful if you've boxed yourself in); speeding your            character up; increasing the explosive radius of your bombs; and of            course allowing you to plant more of them at once. A handy status            bar along the top keeps you abreast of any time constraints, and            reminds you of how many blocks your explosions span and how many            bombs you can plant simultaneously at any given time.                    The latter elements are, as always, best used in combination. Once            your bombs span several spaces, you can set up chain reactions to            take out many soft blocks and/or enemies at once, as bombs will            explode if enveloped by other explosions. This is also useful in            dealing with persistent enemies, as many of them cannot skip over            your bombs. Managing to box in a particularly nippy enemy with a            bit of quick finger work and then retreating to watch the fireworks            is incredibly satisfying.        However,            the level design can be a little confusing. Often there are a            number of portal-type gates which open up when you complete the            objectives, and as the game is fairly non-linear, you often have no            idea which portal goes where - unless you've already been to one of            the levels. Nevertheless, it can be frustrating if you think you're            getting closer to a boss battle, only to find yourself transported            to a level five numbers prior or something like that.                    Equally annoying is the reliance on one-hit kills. Although you can            get the odd shield power-up, it's still very frustrating to find            yourself dead after sharing a pixel or two with a roving worm, and            having to start the entire level over again. Admittedly, most            levels are only meant to last a few minutes, but they can be very            tricky and it's really annoying when you overcome all the tough            bits only to stumble on something elementary. Particularly if the            enemy appears from beneath a bit of foreground scenery before you            can do anything\u2026                    Then again, some effort has been made to keep you happy in this            regard, with Cheraboms (Bomberman's version of Chocobos, really)            popping up occasionally to offer a ride, and on some levels, an            AI-controlled Bomberman or Max (depending on the version) will pop            up to offer a bit of co-operative assistance. The AI for these            characters (and indeed the enemies) isn't brilliant, but at least            you don't get bombed by your silent partner\u2026 very often.        On the            whole, the single player game is pretty playable. It's tough, no            doubt about it, but then again Bomberman is a game about quick            reactions and thoughtful gameplay, so that's hardly surprising.            What is surprising, though, is that Hudson has messed up the            multiplayer!                    Honestly. It finally manages to produce a single player Bomberman            adventure worth its salt (well, more salt than any of the other            'okayish' attempts), and then it throws in a rather lame 'Mario            Bros. meets Bomberman' attempt at single-cart multiplayer. Instead            of the traditional top-down game, we're limited to a 2D,            side-scrolling platform game with the odd soft block and the            same Bomberman ingredients.                    You get to choose from some funky characters (including monkeys),            but that can hardly make up for the dullness. Hudson almost gets            off the hook for making it single-cartridge, but not quite, because            there isn't even a proper multiplayer mode for those of us with            both Blue and Red cartridges! The interactivity between versions is            limited to swapping items unavailable in the respective single            player games, and battling Cheraboms. Whoops, eh?                    Bomberman Max 2 is one of those games which stands inches away from            greatness. Given it a single-cart multiplayer game of traditional            Bomberman, we'd be adding a couple more to the score. Heck, even a            multi-cart version would be nice, but on its own the single player            version really is only just about enough to carry the package. If            you've played Bomberman to death and fancy a bit of a change, this            might be just the thing, but if all you want is a decent            multiplayer game for your GBA then look up Bomberman Tournament,            released 18 months ago and give this a miss.
