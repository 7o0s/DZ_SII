{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tradeempires", "date": "20 Dec 2001", "game_name": "Trade Empires", "text": "If Trade Empires is to be believed, the development of civilization            is defined not by wars and diplomacy but by trade. Instead of            conquering new territory by invading neighbouring countries, you            spread your influence by setting up markets and supplying them with            the goods they require, hopefully at a hefty mark-up. It might not            sound tremendously exciting, but the result is a surprisingly deep            and addictive experience.                        Over the course of sixteen scenarios the game covers four thousand            years of history and four continents, taking in the birth of Egypt,            Sumeria and China, the rise of Greece, Phoenicia and Rome, the            colonisation of America and the industrial revolution in Europe            amongst other topics. In each mission you will start out with a            small amount of cash and be set a target score to achieve by a            certain year. Sometimes winning is simply a case of earning lots of            money, while in other scenarios you will get bonus points for            building up the population of cities or importing specific goods.                        At first sight the whole thing can look rather bewildering, and            while the interface is neatly laid out and fairly logical, it does            require a lot of mouse clicking to actually get anywhere. Luckily            then there is a helpful tutorial mission to ease you into the game            and introduce you to the basic concepts, from setting up your first            markets to trading different goods between them. And this is            essentially all that you will be doing for the rest of the game.                    This isn't as repetitive as it may sound though, because while the            opening mission has only a few raw materials to trade in a            relatively confined area, by the time you get to some of the later            scenarios you may have upwards of twenty or thirty different types            of goods to trade.                        Some of these are required by towns if they are to continue            growing, while others are luxury or military goods which can bring            big profits but are only needed by special buildings such as            palaces, fortresses and temples which are dotted around the map.            Some raw goods will only be available in one region and may need            transporting a long distance before you can sell them, and some            must go through more than one factory before they can be turned            into anything useful. For example, to build a musket you first need            iron ore and wood. The wood is taken to the appropriate facility            and turned into charcoal, which can then be burnt in a blast            furnace to convert the ore into pig iron. Finally this is taken to            a gunsmith, where it is combined with more wood to produce the            finished gun.                        At every step of the way you have the opportunity to make a profit            by buying the raw materials cheaply and selling them on at a higher            price. Even when you are operating a monopoly though, you can't fix            your prices; the whole game's economy depends on basic laws of            supply and demand. If a trader has to wait for the goods he needs            because of insufficient supplies, the price will gradually rise. If            he has to wait to sell goods because there isn't enough demand for            them, the price will fall. Needless to say, juggling this for a            dozen or more types of goods being bought and sold at several            markets spread across anything up to five or six seperate countries            can be rather tricky.                    Things get even more complex when rival merchants enter the game,            and sadly this is one of the areas where Trade Empires doesn't            quite gel. Sometimes your competitors will all chase after the same            goods, and you can end up with several merchants from various            families all piling into the same town looking to buy and sell the            same goods. Needless to say this completely destroys the market and            can play havoc with your own trade routes.                        This problem is made worse by the AI's stubborn refusal to drop            goods or move on to another town if a market becomes glutted.            Instead rival traders will sit there until they have sold            everything they wanted to, by which time the local value of the            goods has nosedived. By contrast, once they have wrecked a market's            economy and any hope you might have had of making money from it,            the computer will constantly switch routes, making it hard to keep            up with them and find new markets where you can make a decent            profit. In the early stages of the game the AI almost always seems            to be one step ahead of you and is constantly getting in your way,            although later on as new markets and goods open up things tend to            get more spread out and markets can be exploited more sensibly.                        The way in which raw materials are handled can be a little clumsy            at times as well. You can buy any of the various factories and            workshops which are scattered throughout the game world and switch            them on and off at will, or just leave them to run themselves, but            this doesn't extend to sources of raw materials such as timber            camps, mines and farms, which are always run by the AI. These tend            to build up a big glut of goods when they are first activated, and            then switch themselves off as the price starts to drop. Often they            will only start working again once the backlog of goods has been            completely cleared, and then abruptly stop soon after any new            demand has been met. If you are visiting a market infrequently and            trying to buy a large quantity of goods at one go, this can be a            serious nuisance.                    All of this can be particularly annoying as there is precious            little room for micro-management in the game. Merchants must be            assigned to a trade route, with the goods that they will be            carrying when they leave each market along the route decided by the            player in advance.                        As you can load, save and edit the routes, this makes it easy to            set up and adjust orders for several merchants at once. But if they            reach a town and there is no demand for their goods, the local            factories have shut down, or they are at the back of a long queue            of merchants all waiting to trade the same commodities, your only            options are to switch to another one of your pre-defined routes,            order the merchant to drop some of the goods they are currently            holding or just leave them to wait for the situation to sort itself            out. Short of creating a whole new trade route specifically to get            your merchant out of this pickle, there is no way to manually            bypass their orders. If you edit an existing route the merchant            will ignore the changes until they have finished their current run,            and there is no way to order them to skip a stop or to leave a            market without buying everything on their shopping list.                        But while these niggles can prove frustrating at times, overall the            game is strangely addictive. Rival merchant families can be            switched off in the options menu if you find competing with them            too much like hard work, and although there is no mission editor or            open-ended Civilization-style ~sandbox~ mode to give the game true            longevity, the wide range of scenarios on offer should keep you            busy for several weeks. Most of the scenarios introduce a steady            stream of new technologies as the years pass, and the new goods and            buildings which come with them will keep you on your toes and stop            the game from getting overly repetitive.                        Trade Empires isn't without its flaws, and there are improvements            that could be made if it spawns a sequel. But in the meantime, if            you're looking for an unusual, intelligent and challenging strategy            game with more depth than the Marianas Trench, this could be just            what you need."}
