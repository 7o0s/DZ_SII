People take holidays, enjoy the great                 outdoors, maybe even play some sports, one of the most popular                 of which seems to be golf. I totally fail to see why - whoever                 it was that said golf ~ruined a good walk~ was spot on...                    If you are unfortunate enough to be a beginner, your first game on            the course is little more than a nightmare. As you fumble ineptly            with your clubs, pretending to know your 3-wood from your putter,            the seasoned players look on with glee, laughing moronically as you            sink your seventh ball of the day into the water hazard.                    As well as this, the cackling golf-nuts will be dressed in clothes            featuring colours that simply don't occur in nature, and hats that            must have looked ridiculous even to the poor sap that designed            them. No, you can stick golf as far as I'm concerned.                    But what if you could enjoy the swinging without suffering            humiliation at the hands of these sporting jesters? What if you            didn't have to trudge around a course for several hours just to            play a few minutes of actual sport? What if you didn't have to pay            \u00a310 for a beer at the clubhouse bar?                    Enter Sierra's ~PGA Championship Golf 1999~, recently re-released            on their budget label, Sierra Originals. This was one of the top            selling sports games of its day across the Atlantic, but has it            stood the test of time, or has it become as embarrasing as the            garments favoured by golf players? Let's tee off and find out...         One of the                 most hotly debated subjects in the PC golfing world is the                 control method. Some games favour the three click mechanism,                 where you operate the swing through a series of mouse clicks                 to determine the strength and accuracy of your shot, while                 others choose the True-Swing system, using your mouse as a                 virtual club, allowing more realistic control of the shot's                 direction and power.                    Sierra has sought to please everyone by including options for both.            The tri-click is certainly easier for the beginner, and can allow            you to play decent rounds as soon as you start. But True-Swing is            more realistic, has a proper golf-like feel to it, and as you            improve you can play some superb shots and gradually become a            seasoned pro. The choice is yours.                    Of course, sports games are built on choices, and Sierra's PGA            series is no different. The wealth of camera options available are            unbelievable, and the range, pitch and height of each camera is            easily changed. There are dozens of different modes of play, and            you can create and customise your own golfer, complete with plaid            trousers.                    Eight real-life courses are painstakingly recreated in game,            including the world-famous Coeur D'Alene and Pete Dye courses. You            can even create your own with the Course Architect, a rather            daunting tool which takes a long time to completely figure out. But            if, like me, you can't be bothered crafting your own St. Andrew's,            there are already plenty of extra courses available online.                    There is even online play available through WON.net. It can be a            little hard to find a suitable game, especially during off-peak            hours, but it's fun to play alongside others and see their own            styles of golf. You can even set up cameras to track the movements            of your opponents, monitoring their shot scores and pitfalls. A LAN            mode is also available, as well as a ~hot seat~ mode to allow            multiplayer on the one PC.         Each of the                 courses is recognisable as its real life equivalent, and you                 can point out all of the bunkers and lakes in-game, with your                 choice of course coming complete with a short video                 advertising its main features.                    The graphics are a strange hybrid that doesn't really look ~right~,            a mixture of the occasional 3D structure and trees and other            features in ~glorious~ 2D isn't the prettiest of sights. The game            was first released in 1998, and this does show in the graphical            quality.                    A number of cosmetic features help bring it up to date though,            including the ability to animate your golfer in reaction to his            shots. For example, he can fall to the ground and bang his fists if            you misplay a drive. It's not exactly sophisticated, but it is            particularly fun to see it happen in a multiplayer game.                    The commentary is commendable as well. I'm more used to the            slap-dash speech of soccer games like ISS and FIFA, where            announcements take can place minutes after the incidents they refer            to, and are more often than not just plain wrong. In PGA the            commentary is always accurate, sometimes even informative, and            keeps you up to date with the changing winds and the difficulty of            holes. For once the speech isn't just something tacked on at the            last minute for the benefit of the advertising material, it's a            valuable addition.                    It's also really satisfying to hear a commentator say ~He'll have a            hard time getting this one onto the green~, just before you            chip your ball out of a troublesome bunker and it settles next to            the pin. Lovely.         Of course, all of these options and fancy extras are                 nothing if there is no gameplay to back it up, and I'm pleased                 to report that there is. The ball physics are sound, and the                 wind, gradient and course conditions really do make a                 difference. Play one hole in dry, calm conditions and then                 adjust the green to wet and the wind speed to fast, and you                 will really have to rethink your strategies.                    This isn't to say the game is perfect though, and the lack of a            decent tournament mode is my first gripe - it would have been nice            to chart my player's progress over the years, earning money and            playing invitationals. Still, online gaming allows these to be            organised over the internet, so if you are so inclined and have the            time to spare, by all means go for it.                    As well as this, you can sometimes find yourself cursing at the            awkwardness of some of the controls. Swinging, selecting play            modes, setting up options and the like are all fine, but            semi-complex tasks such as removing your ball from the water and            placing it on the ground aren't easy to execute, with little help            from the instructions.                    Still, there is enough good in the game to negate these slight            problems. The control systems are fully customisable, and selecting            your club, stance and shot style are all done with a few clicks of            the mouse. No confusing menus or reams of text - the GUI handles it            all. After a few hours of play I was confidently selecting things            like punch shots and lazy stances without my eyes widening with            confusion, although many of these aren't adequately explained in            the manual for beginners.         As golf games go this is                 certainly one of the more successful efforts, and I prefer                 Sierra's effort to the long-running Links LS series, which                 seems to be favoured by purists. I'm not a huge golf fan in                 real life, but I found the game enjoyable nonetheless.                    If you can tolerate the simple graphics and lack of single player            depth, this could be for you. The budget price is definitely a            bonus, and the online play and support provided by WON.net and            Sierra is excellent. Just remember that the tartan shorts are            optional!                        -                            PGA Championship Golf 2000 review                    PGA Championship Golf 2000 review"}
