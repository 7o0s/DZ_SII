It is nighttime and a large storm            hangs menacingly overhead, yet through the crashes of thunder and            the pattering of rain on the sodden ground, a lonely piano can be            heard picking notes out of the air. Upon further investigation, we            notice we're moving towards an orphanage. Following the rain, our            view proceeds down, into a drain, and from there into a bathroom.            There is a child here. A boy. Still the piano plays. As the boy            stares into the mirror, the door bursts open; ~Cyp! What are you up            to?..~.                         And so begins Evil Twin. Cyprien is the young protagonist in this            tale of a warped journey through his own imagination, where the            lines between it and reality have blurred. The dilemma he finds            himself in is brought on by his own misery and distorted view of            the world. This night is his birthday and yet the anniversary of            his parents' death, and his depression and anger brings a new twist            to the world he inhabits. Himself, his friends, and his\u2026            ahem\u2026 teddy bear, Lenny, are dragged into a twisted world            called Undabed, which is overrun by an evil force called Big Boss.                         It then becomes unclear whether Cyprien is actually inhabiting            this odd world or if it's some figment of his twisted psyche.            Nevertheless, on your arrival in the world as Cyp, you're greeted            by an elephant. On a swing. Called Wilbur. Wilbur tells you it's            your task to free the world from the wave of tyranny brought on by            Big Boss by locating the pieces of the Great Zipette, the key to            Big Boss' tower. Originally this task was taken on by Lenny, who it            transpires is the leader of an elite resistance. After he went            missing it was decided that it should be you to take his place.                    It's after the intriguing and enchanting opening sequences that the            game starts to show you it's true colours, and the fact that it's a            run-of-the-mill platformer hits home extremely and disappointingly            early. The emphasis is clearly on the storyline and setting, and            less on creating an engaging gaming dynamic. For thrills, the game            relies on the mastering of pixel-perfect leaping from the very            start, and this doesn't relent for the duration.                         Playing the game with a keyboard is an absolute no-no because of            this, and only really becomes bearable with the use of a decent            analogue joypad. For this reason, Evil Twin really doesn't feel at            home on the PC from the off, and I for one would be eager to see            just how much more enjoyable the PS2 version is.                         The playing style is obviously influenced by many of the games'            contemporaries, such as Rayman, Mario 64 and MDK, yet fails to be            as engaging as any of them as the constant leaping quickly becomes            monotonous. The short missions you occasionally partake in in order            to advance your progress rarely do much to offer some respite.                    As a 3D platformer, Evil Twin has inherited the dreaded lazy camera            syndrome often associated with the genre. That you should have to            keep reaching for the keyboard every few minutes to re-align the            view is unforgivable. It's also because of the camera's seeming            inability to keep track of the direction Cyp is travelling in that            many precarious jumps lead to his unanticipated death.                         The character of Cyprien himself is very well designed, with a few            really rather nifty tricks up his sleeve. After you initially            discover his slingshot for dispatching enemies, it comes to light            that you can switch to a handy first-person view for accurate            aiming at distant targets. Throughout the game you have the ability            to upgrade the slingshot with different powerups, including a laser            sight and a bouncing-projectile mode among others.                         More intriguing than this, though, is Cyp's ability to transform            into SuperCyp once you've collected enough of the relevant icons.            This transformation into Cyprien's superhero alter-ego graces you            with the ability to fly across short distances, unleash devastating            fireball and lightning attacks and generally kick arse in a far            more stylish fashion than vanilla Cyp.                    During your travels across the games 76 levels, you come across            some truly eccentric characters, and the air of oddness that they            create is quite reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's naturally comparable            Alice tales. In fact it could be questioned whether or not In Utero            were intending for Evil Twin to be a natural genre-partner to            American McGee's Alice. Of course, it comes close only in            storytelling terms.                         For the senses, Evil Twin is an absolute delight. The eight            heavily stylised worlds take obvious cues from the likes of Tim            Burton's ~A Nightmare Before Christmas~, and the luscious texturing            and detailed level design rarely fail to impress. As far as audio            is concerned, Evil Twin's soundtrack is stunning. Both the more            ambient incidental compositions, and the more purposeful music for            cut-scenes and the like are atmospheric gems. This writer even took            the liberty of incorporating a few mp3's which make up the            soundtrack into his WinAmp playlist.                    That all this effort couldn't have been put into something simply            more engaging sends the mind boggling. In Utero only needed to take            a look at the aforementioned genre rivals to see how to create a            stylish yet entertaining game, but Evil Twin simply remains the            former. Playing this game, we were reminded of a similar fate for            the mediocre Heart of Darkness of a few years ago, and it's a shame            that Ubi Soft didn't learn from the mistake that team made. To            create something so beautiful, elegant and stylish, yet make it so            ultimately unfulfilling is quite unforgivable."}
