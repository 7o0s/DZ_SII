Atleast one of us remembers as far back as his second orthird birthday when he was given a petrol station set for hisMatchbox collection. Quite a seminal moment, by all accounts.So it's a little curious that Pixar and Disney haven't reallyexploited this latent market until now. After all, it's been 11years since Toy Story. And even though Cars will fill that gap, it's not being released until the28th of July in the UK (the aforementioned team member's birthday,incidentally - spooky!).That's some wait. And, given that this, the mobile phone tie-in,picks up the story from the climactic race in the movie, if youdon't want to know how it ends (thanks, Disney Mobile, for spoilingit for us!), you shouldn't play the game until after you've seenthe film.And that's unfair, because Cars (the game) is one of the most genuinely enjoyabledriving games we've had the pleasure to get behind the wheel of. Infact, it's surprisingly so.You play as Lightning McQueen, a hot-shot racing carwho's competing in the Piston Cup and star of the movie. Wewouldn't have been surprised if the game had just been a top-downracer like so many others where you've got to win races on your wayto the cup - even if it did contradict the central tenet ofthe film, that there's more to life than winning.Instead, Cars provides what is a relatively free-roaming experiencewhere you've got the run of Radiator Springs, the rural town whereMcQueen is stranded in the film. You can drive around at will,visiting characters and locations from the movie, and interactingwith anyone you come across.Doc, Mater, Flo, Sheriff and the rest of the town's inhabitantsare included, drawn in a cartoon style that, while not reminiscentof the movie's CGI brilliance, is bright and detailed. Each willtalk to you and ask you to help them out, and this provides thegame with its mission structure.Some missions involve racing other cars, such as the interstatebandits, while others require you to drive around town collectingitems before the timer runs out. The missions provide a neat way ofvarying the difficulty levels and an element of characterdevelopment creeps in as you improve your driving abilities for thelater stages of the game.There's no compulsion to do any of this, though, and you canspend as long as you like simply exploring. While the setting isn'thuge, there's enough room and variation to make it feel bigger thanit is, and you'll spend many a happy minute just driving aroundrandomly.It's this sense of freedom and adventure that sets Cars apart from the pack. It's quite unlike any otherdriving game you're going to find on mobile phone.The open-ended(ish) nature of Cars and the fact that you can tackle the missions at yourown pace also means that there's plenty of mileage in the game- perhaps enough even to last you until the end of July whenyou can see the film at the cinema. The bottom line is, Cars is a brilliant and consistently fun game that makes themost of its movie connections while also offering something new."}
