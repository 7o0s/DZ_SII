X is just the latest in a whole string of games, but with the            exception of the literally unplayable ~Elite : First Encounter~ it            is without doubt the worst Elite clone I've ever had the misfortune            to install.                    First impressions were not good, as the game wouldn't run on my            RivaTNT graphics card, apparently due to a driver problem. There            were severe clipping problems, massive texture corruption, and            sections of the starry background would come unstuck and float            around as you moved.                    Eventually I managed to solve this by using the ~Optimized for            Direct X 6~ version running in compatibility mode. Which is a            shame, because if I hadn't worked this out I wouldn't have had to            torture myself for the next two weeks by playing the damn game...         The first five minutes were actually            quite good though. You play a test pilot flying an X-perimental            craft (oh dear), and the game's intro runs you through a series of            tests which set the scene and give you a chance to get to grips            with the ship's controls and systems.                    Of course, as with any scientific experiment in a computer game, it            soon goes pear-shaped. The jump drive malfunctions as you activate            it, and you find yourself in a distant star system with no way of            getting home.                    A passing alien destroyer kindly repairs your ship and gives you a            1Mw shield and 100 credits, on the understanding that you will            repay them at a later date. Don't worry though - they'll never ask            you for the money.                    Unfortunately it's all downhill from here...         You see,            that flimsy shield and 100 cr is all that you start with. You have            to pay a fortune for such luxuries as guns, a time acceleration            feature, and a decent scanner. You even have to pay 10 cr every            time you want to save your game.                    And X turns Elite's trading system on its head. Instead of trading            goods between systems, each system has several facilities (a            trading station, power plants, mines, factories, farms etc) and you            must trade between them.                    Each facility only sells one product, and usually only buys three            or four types of resource at most. This makes trading difficult            until you work out what each type of facility imports and exports,            and whether there's any profit margin in it.                    Of course, the manual won't help you because the game dumps you in            at the deep end. After all, your character doesn't have a clue            what's going on, so why should you?                    You get absolutely no help, and are likely to end up wasting your            first few hours just shuttling backwards and forwards between space            stations trying to make a bit of money.         It doesn't help that            your high tech spacecraft moves slower than most World War Two            fighter planes and handles like the Exxon Valdez.                    Just covering the few kilometres between adjacent space stations            can take a couple of minutes, and getting to the jump gate to            travel to the next system takes forever.                    Make sure you have a magazine to read while you're waiting, or go            and get a drink. You'll have plenty of time.                    After a couple of hours you should be able to afford the            Singularity Time Distortion Engine. This speeds up time by a factor            of ten, allowing you to get from A to B without needing to leave            the computer running overnight.                    Other early purchases should include some cargo bay extensions,            better shields, and a pair of guns. At this point the game is            almost playable.                    Unfortunately by this point you've probably already uninstalled the            game, unless you're a sadist, a reviewer, or have the patience of a            saint.         Even after            you have upgraded your ship, it still handles like a pig. Rudder            optimisation helps a little, but it costs a fortune and you can            only buy it at pirate bases.                    The obvious solution is to buy a new ship .. but you can't. You are            stuck with the same second rate heap of junk throughout the game,            and although you can tinker with its engine and controls and add            new hardware, guns and shields to it, it is still a heap of junk            underneath it all.                    Because of this combat is very hit and miss. Mostly miss. The poor            controls make dogfighting chaotic, and combined with the slow            moving projectiles it makes it very hard to actually hit anything.                    Shields are far too powerful at the start of the game, and you will            only be able to take out the weakest enemy craft at first. Given            that your ship is fairly slow and your afterburners take all the            energy from your shields, you can't even run away from bigger            ships.                    Later on though the weapons become too powerful. Plasma throwers            are expensive, but they rip through enemy shields effortlessly. You            can comfortably take on four or five ships at once, and your            biggest risk is colliding with one of them.         Navigation is also next to            impossible thanks to the substandard scanners. You'll need to buy            two or three expensive upgrades before you can find your away            around a system easily.                    You can't tell what anything is until you are within scanning range            of it, which is generally just a few kilometres. Even worse, your            radar readout zooms in and out uncontrollably depending on how            close you are to the nearest ship.                    Once you've been playing the game for a while you can usually            identify a facility visually before your scanner can tell what it            is. Which is rather silly.                    This is especially true once you get the awesome zoom goggles,            which look like a simple headset but are actually more powerful            than the Hubble Space Telescope.                    The biggest problem though is finding jump gates, as they are            always located at the extreme edges of a system and are often pitch            dark, making it almost impossible to see them against the blackness            of space.                    As you can see from the screenshot above... Yes, there is a jump            gate right under the crosshairs. Can you see it?         It gets worse though. As the game goes on it            becomes increasingly obvious that X's economic system is horribly            broken, which for an Elite clone is obviously a serious problem.                    Goods often cost more where they are produced than where they are            consumed, and the laws of supply and demand fail to apply with            prices staying constant for hours and then suddenly fluctuating            wildly for no obvious reason.                    After I had been playing the game for about a week the entire            universe's economy had virtually collapsed, and it was almost            impossible to make any profit by trading in some areas.                    Nick Leeson eat your heart out.         Luckily you don't have to rely                 on the aliens for trade - once you have made a whole shitload                 of money you can start buying your own factories, power                 plants, and farms. I quickly built up a small business empire,                 and the profits started to flood in.                    This was about as much fun as I've had with X, but as a business            simulation it is pretty primitive. There's no way to monitor or            control your business short of going round all your facilities one            by one and docking with them, which makes management very            frustrating.                    Luckily you can buy other ships and get them to do the boring work            of shuttling backwards and forwards between stations, buying            whatever resources your facilities need to keep them running.                    They don't always do quite what you expect though, for example            travelling to another star system to get beef when there's a            cheaper cattle ranch right next to them.                    Generally it works, but it isn't particularly sophisticated and            leaves no room for micromanagement.         In fact X manages to fail on almost            every level.                    It fails as a space game because the backgrounds have highly            visible seams, which leaves you in no doubt that you're really just            flying around inside a big box with stars painted on it.                    It fails as a combat game because the controls are terrible, the            shields and weapons are unbalanced, and the AI is appalling.                    And it fails as a trading game because the economy is unstable and            erratic, and somehow ignores both common sense and            economics. Which is quite an achievement...                    Even the ~find a way home~ plot drags on endlessly, not because            it's hard but because every time you uncover a clue you have to            travel to the far corner of the universe to find the next.                    Overall this game is dull, tedious, repetitive, boring, and highly            frustrating. Avoid at all costs.
