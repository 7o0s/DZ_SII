The game's premise is an interesting one - a            hardcore shoot 'em up with the added depth of a full scale war            going on in real-time around you, the outcome of which your actions            can affect in a very direct way - and when we posted            first impressions of the game            back in January, we were certainly impressed with what we'd seen of            the game so far.                    Now that the much-delayed launch of the title is nearly upon us            (the game was finished and meant to appear in stores last year, but            was slipped in order to avoid the Christmas bloodbath), we've had a            much more in-depth look at the game - with the question to answer            being whether it can live up to its early promise, or if this is an            innovative concept that falls over in the execution?        At first glance, the game is a simple one - you play Hawk, a            young pilot who is drafted in during a military crisis to fly a            unique prototype fighting machine after all of the test pilots are            killed by an enemy operative. This machine (the Battle Engine            itself) is a combined land and air assault unit, which switches            from a ground-based walker mode into a flying jet at the touch of a            button. Each mode has a deadly arsenal of weapons at its disposal,            with the weapons in walker mode being more powerful but the flight            weapons arguably more versatile. You can only stay in flight mode            for a certain amount of time - while flying, your energy meter            gradually drops, and when it runs out you come crashing to the            ground, where it recharges again quite quickly.                    Safely tucked into your fearsome mech, you're dropped into a number            of major engagements between your troops (the Forseti) and the bad            guys (the Muspell). Each mission takes place on an island, and            although the mission objectives vary, the general objective is the            same - win the battle and take over the island. You're not fighting            alone, of course, and will usually have tanks, troopers and even            artillery fighting alongside you, as well as a wingman - introduced            after the first few levels - who'll help you mop up the enemy            forces.                    The controls are pretty easy to get to grips with, and there's a            competent (but sadly non-optional) training level at the start of            the game which gives you a chance to familiarise yourself with            them. Most people will probably find that they're buzzing around            like pros by the time they've done the first couple of levels, and            the game is certainly a lot of fun right from the outset - with            huge play areas, powerful weapons and literally hundreds of targets            for your guns.        Although you can play the first few levels quite happily as a            pure shoot 'em up, just running around the battlefield destroying            everything in sight, the chances are that you'll start to notice a            few things in the process which later become essential. Firstly,            your allied troops are pretty intelligent - if you make a gap in            the enemy defences, they'll take advantage of it and rout the enemy            in that area, while if they're being hammered in a certain part of            the battlefield, a few well-placed shots from you into the enemy            ranks will give them the upper hand again. Although you can't            explicitly order your troops to do anything, this does give you a            great deal of control over the battle, and it sometimes starts to            feel like you're backing your troops up as much as they're backing            you up - which is an interesting and enjoyable first for an action            game.                    The progress of the battle as a whole is indicated by a ~battle            line~ in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, which allows            you to see where your troops are making progress and where the            enemy is breaking through. Unfortunately this indicator isn't            always particularly useful - on some levels where you're making a            beachhead on hostile territory, the battle line doesn't accurately            represent the state of play in the game at all, with huge swathes            of map marked as enemy territory because there are a couple of            stray infantrymen with machineguns wandering around aimlessly            posing no threat to anyone in them. However, in general the            indicator works well, and can be a very handy indicator of where            you should devote your attentions at any particular point while            playing.                    This is where the real ambition of the game can be found; it's            effectively a massive strategy game being fought out between two            computer AI players, and you're the only wild card in the whole            thing, so your actions will determine the outcome of the battle.            For the most part, this approach works wonderfully, and it gives a            whole level of depth to the game which many similar shoot 'em up            titles have lacked. It also makes failing any given mission less            frustrating than you might expect, because you haven't necessarily            failed because the mission is simply too difficult - you've failed            because you didn't notice a winning strategy, and it's fun to play            through again and try new approaches to winning the battle.        In fact, the only places where the game seems to fall off the            rails a bit are in levels which are obviously designed to provide            variety, by giving mission objectives which differ from the normal            ~lead an assault force and capture this island~ type. Although some            of these missions are certainly fun - an early mission involving            escorting a convoy at sea springs to mind, as does a later one in            which you must destroy radar installations on an enemy island using            a cloaking device - others can be the source of toe-curling            frustration, with objectives which seem to have been tacked on to            otherwise perfectly reasonable missions in order to ramp up the            difficulty and avoid repetition.                    A good example is a later mission in which you must destroy            anti-aircraft emplacements on an island - but the invasion of the            island has already started, so the skies are filled with your            planes, and of course you cannot allow too many of them to be            destroyed or you fail the mission. This arbitrary objective is            deeply annoying, mostly because while you're off on this wild goose            chase, at the other end of the island your landing force is            establishing a beachhead - and their job sounds like much more fun.            Meanwhile, your idiot flyboys are being cut to ribbons, and whether            you can take down the air defences in time to save them seems            almost totally random, because your allies quite happily fly all            over the map in pursuit of enemies - sometimes avoiding being shot            down for ages, sometimes being blown out of the sky within seconds            of the mission starting. Besides - what kind of stupid military            commander sends in the air support before the AA batteries have            been taken out?                    In fact, as we progressed through the game, we often found            ourselves wishing not for more variety, but for less - more            missions which are focused on establishing beachheads and leading            your troops on an invasion of the island would have been welcome,            with fewer arbitrary objectives or unfair conditions for failing            missions. This is our biggest criticism of the game by far - while            some missions are simply fantastic, others are let down by being            either too complicated for their own good or insanely difficult for            the wrong reasons. It should be noted, however, that the positive            features of the gameplay outweigh the negative ones massively, and            the very fact that we were frustrated by these deviations from the            core gameplay mechanic should point at just how much fun the game            is when it's being more straightforward.        The            graphics in Aquila are well up to the task of rendering the large            battlefields and massive armies very well, with a consistently high            framerate and very nice explosion and weapon effects. The models in            the game aren't shockingly detailed, but they're extremely well            designed and often very imaginative - we especially liked the            enemy's spider-type mech units, and some of the bosses (yes, there            are bosses!) are very nicely designed. The lack of detail on the            models is for a good reason anyway - the game throws around            literally hundreds of them at once, and the epic scale of the            battles is something we've genuinely never seen before in a game.            The PS2 graphics are particularly noteworthy - although the game is            no graphical slouch on the Xbox by any means, it's up to a very            similar level of quality on the PS2, and is certainly pushing the            machine very very hard indeed. It's rare to see a multi-platform            game that shows off the hardware of both platforms so effectively,            and Lost Toys are to be commended highly for that.                    Although the Xbox version does look slightly better in places than            its PS2 counterpart, anyone considering buying the game on the PS2            should probably actually bump the final score up a notch, because            the game is stunningly impressive looking on the PS2, whereas Xbox            owners spoiled by the likes of Halo are less likely to find the            graphics jawdropping.                    The only big flaw in terms of presentation and graphics is the cut            scenes, which are very poor indeed. Although the vehicles are            rendered quite nicely, the human characters are simply downright            ugly; however, the cut scenes are short and functional, and serve            only to provide the thinnest veneer of plot over the action. The            voice acting, both in the cut scenes and in the game itself, is            remarkably good by videogame standards - it certainly has its fair            share of unintentionally funny voice acting bloopers, but then            again, the plot was hardly meant to be taken very seriously anyway.                    On the topic of audio, it's worth mentioning the soundtrack for the            game, which was put together by Tomb Raider composer Nathan McCree            and is a very fine piece of work indeed, with stirring orchestral            themes that wouldn't be out of place in a big-budget action movie.            The rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty much as you'd            expect from an action title - lots of explosions and gunfire            noises, creating a wartime soundscape that's perfectly functional            if a bit unremarkable. Still - the music more than makes up for any            deficiency in this area, so it's a definite thumbs up in the audio            department.        The game does feature a limited range of split-screen            multi-player modes, including a fairly pointless deathmatch mode            and a much more interesting co-operative mode. There's also an            interesting bonus in the form of several racetrack levels which can            be unlocked by achieving certain ranks in the game - these are a            surprising amount of fun, albeit something of a short lived            distraction. Overall, however, you won't be buying Battle Engine            Aquila for multi-player options - it's a single-player game at            heart, and the multi-player functions do feel like a bit of a token            effort.                    After a lot of time spent playing Battle Engine, the fact is that            the game is still a lot of fun, and we're looking forward to            getting back into it and trying to improve our rankings on some of            the levels we failed to get high grades on (each level gives you a            ranking when you complete it, and if you manage to complete the            optional secondary objectives as well, you unlock a more difficult            ~Evo~ version of the next level). The pure shoot 'em up component            of the game is a lot of fun regardless of the tactical depths, and            we've enjoyed finding some of the neat tricks that can be performed            with the Battle Engine - such as transforming into walker mode            while above an enemy aircraft, landing on top of it, destroying            while your energy gauge refills and then hopping off when it            explodes to move on to the next target.                    That's perhaps the beauty of Battle Engine in a nutshell; it's a            game where you keep on finding cool new things to do, ranging from            unexpected uses for your weapons to interesting strategies for            winning a level. There's a smug satisfaction to be found in            creeping behind enemy lines and wiping out their production            facilities that you simply won't get from just taking out endless            lines of tanks; and there's a definite joy to landing on the deck            of an enemy battleship and pounding grenades straight into its            superstructure before taking off and flying away from the sinking            stricken ship. This is simply a fun game, and regardless of our            complaints about difficulty curve or annoying objectives in the            later levels, little can detract from that fact.                    Battle Engine is one of the first games this year that has really            leapt out as a hugely enjoyable console title. It's certainly not            without its flaws, but any fan of console action games is            definitely going to enjoy this game a lot, and there's certainly            enough gameplay in there to warrant the price of entry - especially            since the freeform nature of many missions means that they can be            replayed over and over again in search of higher rankings without            becoming dull. Fans of action games will love it immediately; those            looking for something a bit deeper will need to persevere for a            while, but the final reward is definitely worth it."}
