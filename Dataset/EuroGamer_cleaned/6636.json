I think we mumbled something along the            lines of having a PC GoldenEye on our hands, and we meant it. Have            Innerloop taken what we enjoyed so much about the first game and            crafted a masterpiece? Is it merely more of the same? Why do I            always have to put questions at the end of my introductions?        More of the same            wouldn't have been a good move, in my opinion. What primarily held            Project IGI back from being a downright classic was the lack of a            multi-player mode and some pretty ugly AI behaviour from time to            time. Had Innerloop delivered a mission pack of a game two years            down the line, the disappointment would have been great. Thankfully            they appear to have taken steps to address the issues many had with            the original; the engine has been beefed up; the AI routines have            been re-worked; they've introduced a far more forgiving save            system; and, of course, there's a proper multi-player feature.                    What appealed most about the original IGI was the sheer strength of            the single-player game, and so that's where my attention was            immediately drawn with the sequel. Innerloop seem more willing this            time round to simply throw the player into the thick of things,            only bothering themselves with the bare minimum of (cut)            scene-setting before expecting you to get to work.                    The story starts with IGI agent David Jones parachuting into Russia            to retrieve evidence that a new type of stolen EMP weapon is in            production. What picks up as an apparently rudimentary            mission-by-mission plot soon begins to take a few interesting            twists, but never gets deep enough to really touch the gameplay            itself, as the narrative rarely interferes with your 'go here; find            this' objectives. Consequently the story and the game actually feel            quite detached from one another.        The game plays much as you would expect,            and stays quite faithful to the original's formula. Two year's of            maturity in the stealth-action genre have forced Innerloop to take            more careful consideration of how the stealth elements work in            IGI2, and we're now graced more twitchy enemies with eyes like            hawks. To help gauge how likely you are to be discovered in the            field, there's a sort of Splinter Cell-style risk assessment meter            next to your health bar, detailing how likely you are to be            discovered. Unfortunately due to the constraints of the engine, you            can't make use of light and shadow anywhere near as well as Sam            Fisher might and so your stealth antics rely more on your ability            to hide around corners and hold the crawl key a lot.                    Aiding you in your approach are a few extremely nifty gadgets. The            light-enhancing binoculars and thermal goggles both help to quickly            assess how much danger you might be in, particularly with the            latter's ability to see through immediately visible surfaces.            Possibly even more nifty than these two is the brilliant GPS            real-time map computer, which shows you an overhead view of your            location, and enables you to zoom and scroll around spotting            highlighted objectives and enemies as they go about their patrol            routes. These tools give you an excellent opportunity to simply            take stock of your options and plan a decent approach route.                    Properly approaching the situation is absolutely essential in IGI2.            The emphasis on being careful is extremely strong, and rushing a            base with a machine gun blazing is an absolutely terrible idea. It            might work for a while, but eventually the alarms will blaze and            before you know it you're pinned down in a hut and rapidly running            low on ammo. Your life can be made a lot easier by sneaking over            the crest of a hill, popping a few security cameras with your            sniper rifle and cautiously avoiding guard patrols. Frustratingly,            you're forced to play like this for most of the game and it can be            a little disheartening having to restrain your AK-47-toting            enthusiasm should you want to finish the mission in one piece.        Graphically, the game looks            very similar to the original. Improvements on the draw distance and            general terrain detail are welcome additions though, and the new            water effects are quite lovely. Conversely some models, in            particular vehicles and indoor details, lack the care afforded            outdoors and you get a strange contrast between lush graphical            brilliance and flimsy low poly movie set interiors. There's also            the odd visual glitch, such as the shadows of player models            projecting through walls and mountains, and according to Jones'            shadow he has a head the shape of a breadbin.                    The sound design, on the other hand, is rather more consistent,            with a decent moody soundtrack and some fantastic spot effects. The            guns sound just right, snow and gravel crunch underfoot in just the            right way, and bullets even ricochet off metal with just the right            amount of, er, ping. The only real slip-ups in the sound department            come in the shape of god-awful enemy voice acting.                    While I'm at it, another gripe I have is with the game's so-called            advanced AI. While particularly good at hunting you down, running            for cover and seeking comrades for assistance, enemies are still            easy to bait into a room to be popped off one by one, corpses            piling high in the doorway. Couple this tactic with the fact that            enemies no longer respawn a la Project: IGI and you have a pretty            simplistic method for clearing many areas, providing you can find a            nice spot where you're covered from all sides.        Despite the loopholes and slip-ups here and there though, IGI2            is on a whole quite a stern challenge. With three large campaigns            each split across a number of levels, and each taking a goodly            length of time to get through, the chances are you could be at it            for days on end. This is due in part to the fact that many levels            are as hard as nails, and some can be more irritating than fun.                    Thankfully there is some relief offered in a completely redesigned            save system, which is accessed via your map computer. Depending on            your chosen difficulty setting, you have a set number of saves per            level, and three slots will typically do you quite well without            making the game a quick-save cakewalk while simultaneously avoiding            the kind of hairline demolishing frustration that cropped up with            the first title far too often.                    I haven't forgotten the multi-player mode by the way, but it            appears that Codemasters have, because for all our trying we simply            couldn't locate any servers to play our review code on. Based on            both our and others experience with the recent multiplayer tests            though, it seems a worthwhile and well-planned addition. The game            takes the form of a CS-style objective-oriented affair across six            thoughtfully designed maps. We're assured that Innerloop plan to            fully support this portion of the game post-release with            instalments of new maps and weapons via patch updates. Free ones to            boot. Fancy that, eh?                    I was sort of surprised by the direction IGI2 had taken at first.            It was clear from the outset that Innerloop had been listening to            the criticisms levelled at the first game, and set out to address            the problems directly. The effect is that IGI2 has lost some of the            na\u00efve charm that made Project IGI so appealing in a bid to            contend with real players like Splinter Cell and Raven Shield, and            appearing slightly weak and flimsy in its attempts to do so. Once            you give it a chance though, it's a fairly competent shooter with            quite a bit of life in it - just not quite the leap forward we had            hoped for."}
