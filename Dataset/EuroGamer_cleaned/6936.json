We imagine this is because generally speaking the idea            isn't that enthralling. Syscom would contest that though, and shove            console helicopter romp City Crisis under your nose to prove the            point.                         The thing is, despite my lust for original game concepts (I bought            Startopia, I can prove it) after a week with City Crisis I'd turn            my nose up if given the opportunity again. It just doesn't feel            like a finished game.                         For starters, it looks really pants. Admittedly, I came to it off            the back of Gran Turismo 3, surely the bastion of PlayStation 2            visuals, but I doubt City Crisis is even using half of the system's            power to flaunt itself. Two minutes in and I'm overwhelmed by the            damn interlace flickering, something I thought we did away with            about ten steps further on from the console's launch titles. The            texturing is of a very low resolution, reminding me of the urban            settings from last year's Spider-Man on the PlayStation, a system            with only a fraction of the PS2's power, and repeating every five            metres in any given direction. Another characteristic inherited            from Spider-Man is the hanging drapes effect. Textures don't look            like textures, they appear to be bits of cloth stapled to the walls            rippling in the wind. They wobble all over the place - it's not            pretty.                    Another issue are the actual polygonal structures. A water tower            appears to be hexagonal rather than circular when viewed from            above, and even the slightest variation from the classic big cubic            box of the main buildings is accentuated by a complete lack of any            visible curves. Given the consistent framerate surely they could            have spent a bit of time here lavishing some detail. Since when do            roads bend at 45-180 degrees on a sixpence?                         Even the helicopter model itself is flaky. The blades seem to spin            reasonably but they don't look all that realistic; more like a            transparent disc attached to the top of the chopper that whirrs out            of your speakers. You can actually see through the helicopter's            open compartment, but that's about as far as the detail goes.            Decked out in gunmetal blue and grey, it looks pretty functional,            and the skis form a sort of double arch under the helicopter, which            when viewed up close looks like one half of a barrel glued on to            the undercarriage. There's some sort of light or speaker or            something on the side, which I'm sure fits in with normal            helicopter design, but it looks really out of place.                         On the whole the game looks like it should have come out on the            PSOne. There's no place for it amongst the likes of Onimusha, Gran            Turismo 3 and their ilk, and the aliasing is really bad. This could            be enough to put off a lot of you at the first hurdle. Continuing            the trend of PSOne-ishness is the lacklustre audio accompaniment;            unremarkable helicopter sounds that cover the spinning of the            rotors, crashing and other basic effects, no soundtrack to speak            of, and little to engender a low whistle of admiration.                    The actual game, as you've probably guessed, is about rescuing            people from fires and other hazardous urban emergency situations            using a helicopter. There are three modes of play; Training, Time            Attack and Mission, and beyond that nothing. The Training mode gets            you to grips with the helicopter, courtesy of some pretty basic            manoeuvres in the air. This is well worth completing before you try            anything else.                         Mission mode is the focal point of the game (obviously, since the            rest of it is so mediocre), and players can pick from a selection            of available missions that are classed as rescue, chase or final            rescue. In Rescue mode, players fly around in their preferred            helicopter either putting out separate fires or saving lives before            the time runs out. Chase missions involve lending your skills as a            chopper pilot to the local constabulary, who are pursuing suspects.            Your job is to find the suspects and shine a searchlight on them            for as long as possible so that the rozzers can nab 'em.                         Final rescue, the final mission of the game funnily enough,            features a mixture of everything you do during the course of the            game.                    In spite of the insipid visuals and dreary audio, this game of            throwaway heroism could actually be quite fun, but unfortunately            like so many other so-called concept games, it's let down again by            a questionable control system. Over-complicated is the key; you use            your left analog stick to control movement, while the right analog            stick handles turning and altitude. Hang on, turning and            altitude? Yes, although this sort of control works fairly well as a            rule using a D-pad or the right-hand buttons, you're required to            use the analog stick in City Crisis, and it's ever so easy to turn            left when you're actually just trying to bob a little bit higher in            the air.                         The camera angle doesn't help one bit either. The height of the            buildings is almost indeterminable from the position you view the            game (above and behind). If there was an option to switch to an            in-cockpit view perhaps things would be simpler, but there isn't            and it hurts.                         Take 2 are pushing City Crisis with a firm paw, hoping that the            original concept will be lapped up by PlayStation 2 owners crying            out for something new to do. Unfortunately the game is more            reminiscent of something pulled out of the PSOne's back catalogue            from a year ago. Shoddy visuals and unimaginative audio are bad            enough in light of recent PS2 releases, but coupled with a lean            single player game, a lack of any sort of multiplayer and            irritating controls the game simply isn't worthy of your time or            money."}
