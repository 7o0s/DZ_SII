Quite how they            achieved this feat we're not entirely sure, as this is quite            possibly the worst first person shooter we have seen since .. well,            I can't remember ever seeing anything quite this bad to be honest.                    The idea was simple enough - take a team of Russian developers            working for slave wages and get them to pump out a game which            shamelessly rips off Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament. Give them            a substandard graphics engine which seems to have come through a            time warp from 1997, and kick the result out the door without            bothering to beta test the abomination. Then leave it to fester for            several months before releasing a poorly translated version of it            in the UK, complete with such tasteful built-in taunts as ~die you            faggots~.                    Controls are imprecise and unreliable compared to any of the games            that Trial is designed to replicate, and coupled with poor physics            and unimaginative weapons this makes for an utterly unrewarding            experience. Results are almost random as the starting weapon causes            virtually no damage, making it all too easy to die over and over            again without ever reaching a gun. In one match I went from 12 : 4            ahead to a dead heat in under a minute, somehow managing to suicide            in the process by falling off the edge of a ramp which was all of            about six inches high. And for some reason I had started that            particular match with -2 frags before even spawning - don't ask...                    The back of the box claims that the game features ~fabulous level            design~, but then it also says it has an ~original backround story~            [sic]. The truth is sadly rather different, with a lack of            architectural detail, second rate textures, poor item placement,            excessive use of crates and lava pools, and the usual selection of            clich\u00e9d techno castles, military bases and floating platforms            in space making up all too many of the nineteen levels.                    But if the rest of the game is uninspired, the artificial            intelligence is truly in a class of its own, making the bots in            Quake 3 Arena look like MENSA            candidates by comparison. They wander around aimlessly, ignore            targets and pick-ups alike, can't climb ladders or use lifts            properly, and frequently get stuck on scenery. You will often see            them falling off platforms, getting confused walking up a flight of            stairs, or even hanging gracelessly in mid-air while magically            super-glued to the side of a crate. It's almost worth playing for            sheer comedy value. But not quite.                    It's little surprise then that the bots also show absolutely no            aptitude whatsoever for the various teamplay modes which have been            cloned from Unreal Tournament's DNA as part of some hideous            experiment in removing all trace of soul or originality from a            game. The now familiar Capture The Flag, Team Deathmatch, Assault            and Domination modes are all here, but without any of the gameplay            finesse or graphical prowess found in Epic's meisterwerk.                    Of course, Hired Team Trial was intended to be a multiplayer game            first and foremost. Can the online mode save it from ignominy?            Sadly not, as nobody is playing it. Well, actually that's not            entirely true; I once saw as many as six people playing the game.            In Russia. The server must have been running over a 9600 baud modem            though, because even with my cable connection I was seeing a 999            ping in the built-in browser and couldn't even connect to the            server, much less play on it at a competitive level.                    The bottom line is that this is a hideous piece of derivative pap            which will be filling bargain bins across the land come next            Tuesday. I feel ripped off having been forced to play this rubbish            - I hate to think what I would have felt like if I had actually had            to pay \u00a324.99 for it. Avoid at all costs."}
