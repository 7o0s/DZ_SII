After a little research it came to light that Logitech were            launching their own brand of optical mice, and since I've long            preferred the shapely curves of their rodents, I flung half a ton            at them for a mouse and priority shipping and got myself setup.                         The first thing that strikes you about the MouseMan Wheel is that            its left-hand side is quite pronounced. There's no slant to the            unit as with older models, so the shape is rather peculiar from            some angles. To be fair that's the only aesthetic point that I'd            count against it. Aside from that it's a beautiful bit of            machinery.                         After turning on my PC and booting up I ignored Windows' cries of            ~There is no PS/2 mouse connected to this PC~ (et cetera) and            plugged the Logitech into one of my USB slots. Immediately Windows            picked up on this and the mouse installed under some erroneous USB            entrant. Popping in the supplied drivers CD produced an Autorun            menu that allowed me to install the Drivers, Logitech MouseWare            Control Center (with other useful utilities like Adobe Acrobat also            included on the CD).                    Emerging from the installation triumphant (well, in a manner of            speaking) I was offered to configure the mouse. This was a simple            Wizard process, which discovered the mouse that I was using and            allowed me to set it up for use. During later testing (of the PS/2            port for instance), reinstalling the software was not necessary as            it simply detected a different rodent and dealt with it.                         One of the MouseMan Wheel's biggest advancements over previous            models is of course the lack of a ball. A red laser on the            underside of the mouse measures desktop input some 1500 or so times            per second and average out the input to give you a truly sensitive            and devastatingly accurate representation of your movement.                         The mouse's biggest gimmick is also a laser. Well, a radiant blue            light which illuminates the Logitech symbol on the area of the            mouse where you rest your palm. Obviously when in use it's not            seen, but if you leave it on your desk family members will no doubt            be impressed and it will leave crowds at LAN parties in awe. To be            honest it's just a nice aesthetic touch, and it's not hindering or            improving performance, merely giving the mouse a bit of visual            class.                         Features-wise aside from the optical element, the mouse has the            usual left and right buttons, a scroll wheel that can be press down            itself as a third button and an extra thumb button low down            (probably just below where you would grip it, for easy access). All            are rebindable via the MouseWare suite. The middle button can be            set to Autoscroll or something else (as can the thumb button), but            another option is Logitech's own menu which includes browser            options and other quick-launchables. It's quite a handy feature,            but probably not for the power user.                    Having moved over from an IntelliMouse Optical I was expecting            nothing less, and was impressed and disappointed in equal measures.            I was impressed by the MouseWare's ability to tweak things like            acceleration, but disappointed by the way that in game I was unable            to rebind things like the scroll wheel and the thumb button. I'm            told this is sortable but I haven't been able to ascertain how at            the time of writing.                         Another disappointment came when playing Counter-Strike with the            new rodent. Pulling out the AWP for a bit of sniping on cs_militia            I crouched atop a wall and prepared to pick off an influx of            newbies, but much to my disappointment, when fully zoomed in the            accuracy was a little off. The smooth transition between movements            I'd have previously were disappointingly accurate and at times I            felt my shots were missing because my jerk-kills weren't in tune            properly. A bit of fiddling (setting ~m_yaw~ to 0.015 instead of            the default 0.022 helped a little) minimized the problem, but it's            still a concern, and for Quakers in particular who rely on            jerk-kill rail shots it's of paramount importance to be utterly            accurate.                         Of course, compared to any ball-based rodent the Logitech optical            mouse is tantamount to holding the gun yourself. The sensitivity it            unparalleled by any ball-based mouse, and only Microsoft's optical            mice can hold a candle to its supremacy.                         My main concern with the Logitech compared to the IntelliMice is            its performance on the new Ratpads. The smoother surface of the new            models is fine for IntelliMice, but the Logitech slides and glides            and doesn't pick up on it very well! It's fine on most surfaces,            but apparently not this. Interestingly, the older Ratpads are fine,            with their slightly rougher texture.                    It's difficult to say whether you should buy this as opposed to the            Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer or Optical. Having used all three I            can say that I honestly think the white Microsoft mouse was the            most accurate, but the thumb buttons on those are flimsy and that            the pads underneath attract grime much more than the Logitech.            That's one other important myth to dispel. Just because these mice            have no balls doesn't mean you don't spend time scraping grime off            their pads.. because you do. That said, the Logitech has required            no cleaning of any kind as of yet, which is promising.                         Although I prefer the sensitivity of the IntelliMice, I can't get            over how much more comfortable the Logitech mouse is. As a very            hardcore computer user (hey, it's my job) I have to be careful            about all sorts of ailments, such as RSI, Carpel Tunnel Syndrome            and other problems relating to bad posture and uncomfortable            positioning, etc. With the Logitech, I feel incredibly comfortable,            and my wrist doesn't ache at all after a few solid hours of clan            practice, whereas with the smaller Optical IntelliMouse it feels a            tad sore. If you're a hardcore gamer you'll know what I'm talking            about. It's a bit cheesy to say that the Logitech could help            protect your health, but to me physical experience is enough.                         The bottom line is that if you play first person shooters            regularly you need a quality mouse, and the latest group of optical            mice are at the apex of the curve. Whether you buy this or the            Microsoft options is up to you, but I've never been more at ease            with a rodent than I have with this one, and it looks fantastic            too."}
