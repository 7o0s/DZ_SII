However, instead of            crammed into a cabinet, this finely crafted piece of racing mayhem            has been buffed and polished from its original PS2 incarnation and            slid neatly into the GameCube's launch line-up. But is Burnout            worth picking up for your favourite new toy? Almost certainly.                         Diving into the game is simple enough, and plumping for the            Championship mode should be your first move. The championship            comprises of four Grand Prix and two Marathon races, all of which            are unlocked sequentially. A Grand Prix involves fulfilling a            required finishing position after three laps on one of the games 14            tracks, while the Marathon races are the same, except they're more            like an endurance test as the tracks are made up from several of            the game's courses linked seamlessly, end on end.                         The first thing that strikes you as you head into Burnout is the            enormous sense of speed, more so than any other racer I've played            recently. As you tear down the wrong side of the freeway into            oncoming traffic the proceedings get more than a little hairy, and            tension builds as you anticipate the inevitable. That's when you            experience one of Burnout's main selling points - the crashes.            Whacking headlong into an articulated truck and tumbling down the            road, dragging other cars with you and causing an enormous            multi-vehicle pileup is one of the most grin-worthy and downright            visceral moments I've ever experienced in a racing game.                    Slinging your car about with wreckless abandon is all very well and            good until you realise that you're not going to get anywhere in the            game. The crashes are a feature, yes, but you'd do well to avoid            them as your wallet takes a heavy hit in insurance payouts for            every crumpled bonnet and smashed windscreen, and eventually this            can mean game over. Also, unless you manage to create a crash big            enough to catch out your trailing competitors, it could see you            slipping to the back of the pack easily. However, once you slip up,            all is not lost. The AI competitors screw up their racing line just            as much as any human driver, and scrambling back to first position            within a lap is an entirely realistic proposition providing you            pull out some fancy moves.                         Criterion chucks polygons about with wreckless abandon, but            although speedy it really isn't even close to pushing the Cube as            much as we'd like. Reports of flickering and other graphical            glitches in the PS2 version don't seem applicable here, and the            whole aesthetic is very solid if a little dated. Some higher-poly            models and scenery wouldn't have gone amiss, and the general            feeling is one of ~it'll do~, despite some pretty particle effects            like dust and breaking glass, all of which conspires to remind the            player of Burnout's origin as an advert for Criterion's RenderWare            development tool. On the plus side, the musical accompaniment is            very strong, with tunes varying seamlessly as each race progresses            from rather odd RPG-ish compositions blending into rawk and into            techno. The car engine noises tend to whine, but other spot effects            are above average.                         Aside from progressing though the championship and unlocking new            tracks for use in the single race and time trial modes, extra modes            may be unlocked as you progress, and appear in a ~Special~ menu.            Face Off pits you up against an AI opponent in a previously            unavailable vehicle, and should you win, that car will be available            for use in all the other game modes. The other mode, Survival, sees            you attempting to complete a course without crashing once, and            despite not going up against any other racers, it's still more            difficult than you would imagine. Throw these in with a superb            split-screen mode and you've got a racer that effortlessly lasts            beyond usual expectations.                    There's really no reason to not recommend Burnout to you. It's an            incredibly fast paced, nerve wrecking twitchfest of a racer, and            commands your attention for every moment that you grip the            controller. The visuals and the game's simple premise might seem            off-putting at first, but there's a lot to do, and a rich bed of            content to dig up beneath the surface of the main game. If you buy            it, you should find plenty to do with it. Superb stuff."}
