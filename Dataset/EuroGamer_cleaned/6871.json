With no handheld adversaries to speak of            though, the game's actual release date has always been something of            a misnomer. So unlike the Dukes and Daiks of this world, Advance            Wars will be a timeless classic for many years to come.                         Advance Wars is the product of one of Nintendo's cluster of first            party developers, Intelligent Systems. Although it sounds bizarre            for a GBA title, it's a turn-based strategy game with an original            storyline, more than one hundred battle maps and inestimable replay            value. To give you some idea of its addictive qualities, I bought            the American version of the game a few months ago. The last time I            fired it up was this morning. Before that it was last night, and so            on.                         The game also boasts a splendid multiplayer mode and one of the            most involved tutorial systems I've ever encountered. Literally            clutching you by the paw as you nervously embark on a campaign,            your tightly-uniformed anime instructor babe Nell guides you            through a long list of tutorial missions. Through the Field            Training section of the game you will learn about simple gameplay            mechanics like moving troops and gaining terrain intelligence.            Beyond that there's Base Capture, Unit Repair, APCs and Tank Ops,            and then you have to learn about air and sea-based units, such as            Copters, before completing the training regime with a couple of            tutorials on Climate Status and the Fog of War.                    Once you have learnt the ins and outs of the game's twenty or so            individual units you will be ready to take on the game's main            campaign. Battles involve units on the land, in the sea and            attacking from the air, but each individual unit has its own            peculiar quirks. For example, a well-rounded force needs Artillery            Cannons, but because they lack the ability to attack units in their            direct vicinity, a group of fleet-footed troopers can make            mincemeat out of them if they aren't properly defended.                         As you may have guessed, it is the game's attention to detail that            makes it such a success. Anybody can plonk you on a battlefield            with only a few units to your name and an enemy force inbound, but            Advance Wars is special because it demands a strategic approach.            Controlling the Commanding Officer of all these 'ere troops, you            have to use their various strengths to exploit the weaknesses of            the enemy's platoon. There is no other way to ensure victory. Of            course, another factor is the regular addition of new officers,            with nine to uncover. Throw in over one hundred missions, each with            its own objectives, along with the fifteen-mission tutorial mode            and you start to understand why Advance Wars is such an            entertainment haven. I still haven't 'finished' the game, more than            two months after starting it. As if this wasn't enough, you can            store up to three custom-built maps created using the game's level            editor.                         As a GameBoy Advance game, the visual odds and sods might make no            nevermind to some, since you can barely see anything to begin with,            but the game's GUI and graphics in general play a superb supporting            role to the incendiary gameplay. The main screen is set out in grid            formation, with various types of terrain littered about the place.            Great tracts of land can be separated by the open sea, forests or            mountain ranges to impede your progress, and there are often towns            and other civilian areas dotted around. These can be captured to            increase your army's influence and income, allowing you to            revitalize your troops before sending them off again. Strengthening            the attack is a delicate balancing act. Sending units back and            forward between the front and the field hospital style outposts on            your side of the map is an important aspect of the game.                    Each unit is represented by a tiny, squidgy sprite occupying one            space on the grid. Everything is extremely cutesy and anime-esque,            right down to your opposing number, the commanding officer of the            enemy forces, who looks like an anime pirate. Using the D-pad you            can select units and other items as you might with a mouse pointer            in a PC strategy game, before selecting various options from a            drop-down menu (everything from moving the unit to firing upon the            enemy and ending your turn).                         In case of engagement proceedings switch to a different screen,            where the terrain and units are portrayed with greater detail in a            sort of horizontal split screen. When your troops fire, depending            on your distance from the enemy, the relative trajectory and a            number of other factors, weapons fire will rain down on your            enemies and they will respond in kind. The outcome of each of these            miniature encounters is easy enough to predict.                         Let's take an example. Each unit has a certain number of hit            points (it's mercifully small in most cases to avoid FF-style            mathematician's block), and in this case you have five infantry            units firing one grid space away from five enemy troopers. Your men            are advancing over mountainous terrain though, and find themselves            severely elevated compared to their enemies. Thanks to this            advantage, your five shots weaken all five enemy units. A similar            attack in the next turn would wipe them out. Unfortunately for            them, your position on the mountain also means that you make a            harder target, so only three of your own troops are slightly            injured, and the enemy has to retreat.                    After a few of the main single player missions, the process of            moving troops and scanning enemy forces for weakness becomes second            nature. The AI can be pretty fearsome, and far from simply throwing            wave after wave of disposable troops at your frontline it plays the            game like a chess board, sizing up each move and often dispensing            as many crippling blows as you can muster.                         Advance Wars is a black hole, swallowing time like there's no            tomorrow (hah!) and apparently without fault. Honestly, I can't            find anything to criticize. Not even the music is getting to me.            Even after countless hours glued to the GBA's tiny screen with the            volume cranked right up, I still find the quirky little theme tunes            extremely enjoyable. And I haven't even touched on the game's            reward structure. Far from limiting you to a path through 100 or so            stages in sequence, the game sends you all over the place, and the            rewards include levels only found in the rare Japanese GameBoy            version of the game; GameBoy Wars.                         I touched briefly on the linkup mode at the start of the review,            but it's fitting that it seals the package. Advance Wars'            multiplayer mode supports up to four players via the link cable,            and if you thought AI commanding officers took a few tricks to            defeat, the tactics of rival GBA owners will shock and astound you.            Negotiating the various challenges Advance Wars offers is like            trying to find the best cycle route through London on a Saturday            afternoon - different people have come up with different ways of            doing it.                    If you buy this game only for the single player mode you won't be            disappointed. If your interest in the game stretches to multiplayer            jiggery pokery - and that does mean finding a rival GBA owner with            the cart - then you're in for an even bigger surprise. Advance Wars            is a game for every situation and mood, with superb presentation,            gameplay and unfathomable replay value. I have no complaints.                        -        Advance                    Wars screenshotsAdvance                    Wars screenshotsAdvance                    Wars previewAdvance                    Wars preview"}
