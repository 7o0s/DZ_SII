I can safely say that the FIFA series of football games            does not fall into that scenario, and I will impulse buy every            single time. Am I mad?                    You'd think I would have learnt after the tragedy that ~Euro 2000~            turned out to be, that even the seemingly infallible FIFA games            could come across a hiccup now and again. Not on your life matey,            which is why I am now a proud owner of both the PC and PlayStation            versions! This review is an amalgamation of my views on both games,            which basically play pretty much the same as each other, with only            a couple of differences.                    So what has compelled me to once again shell out the best part of            seventy of your wholesome English pounds on what most people are            saying is just the same game as FIFA 2000 with slightly better            graphics? Well, I liken FIFA to a pair of comfortable slippers.            After a hard day's work you come home, have dinner, kick your shoes            off, and put them on for hours of fun filled escapism. What makes            the game even better still is to have another player to cram onto            the sofa with and duke it out against, and it has become a            tradition for me to have an annual Christmas tournament with my            brother.         So what            is different in FIFA 2001 then? The general trend from one revision            to the next has been for the graphics to be noticeably beefed up,            and this version does not disappoint, incorporating yet more            pointless side animations and player facial contortions. Not much            new then? Absolutely not, how dare you even think such a thing!                    Taking the PSX version for example, you would be forgiven for not            being able to discern the difference between FIFA 2000 and 2001 if            they were played side by side. A default camera angle change and            slightly re-designed menu system will probably give it away, but            game wise there is very little to segregate the two. The graphics            are definitely improved upon, but it is not that huge an            improvement. No doubt the limits of the now ancient hardware the            game is running on have been reached.                    On the PC however, the graphics have been drastically overhauled,            providing some of the most intricate player detail in a footy game            to date. It does not stop there either, as numerous side-line            animations bring the whole stadium to life, with substitutes            warming up, stewards craning their necks looking for            trouble-makers, and camera men swivelling the lens to keep up with            the action. The result is utterly breathtaking, totally immersing            you in this computerised football world, a mini-heaven for any            footballing nut I can assure you. What makes the whole experience            even better is that little things like the team badges and sponsors            are all present on the player shirts. A Subbuteo filled childhood            dream come true, as your team emerges from the dressing room and            puts you in control.                    Once again a nice set of tunes have been chosen, including the            superb ~Body Rock~ by Moby and ~Power To The Beats~ by the Utah            Saints. The sound has also gone under the surgeon's knife, with            commentary now far more appropriate and varied than before. Other            nice touches like the manager shouting from the dugout at his            players, and the players shouting to one another on the pitch,            serve to make the whole experience that bit more realistic.         I feel pretty sure that the FIFA forums must get filled with            requests to sort out the various control problems that plague one            revision to the next, but it appears that fundamental annoyances            still exist that are blatant, or at least they are to me. For            starters, the ridiculous habit of a keeper to just stand still            while an incoming ball heads towards goal. Although this does not            happen too often, the game appears to take great pleasure in            choosing the most match-losing of moments to spring it on you!                    Once again there are far too many computer chosen moves when you            are simply trying to pass the ball or lob it over a line of the            opposing team. All too often the computer will choose to            automatically overhead kick, volley or head the ball onwards, and            most of the time to completely the wrong team. It is this aspect of            the FIFA series that has irritated me from the start, and is still            haunting me to this day. Why they cannot just make each pass or            move completely and utterly your own amazes me. It makes for some            very disjointed matches, where a move you have been brilliantly            executing breaks down simply because the computer chooses to head            the ball on for you where a simple pass would have been so much            better.         Something that EA Sports have tried and failed to implement in            the past is proper TCP/IP driven internet play. It was promised for            FIFA 2000, but we ended up with the usual IPX backed LAN play or            modem to modem options. These were decidedly difficult to get            working, and even when you do the results are really quite abysmal.                    But this time round FIFA sports internet play via the incredibly            friendly EA Sports web-based game search engine. I created an            account for myself and the site then proceeded to update my            installation with the latest patch. All the while I am grinning            like a Cheshire Cat in anticipation. Ten minutes later I get told            that the service cannot connect me, and a sense of deja vu            overwhelms me.                    It has been nearly two weeks now, and I have yet to get a single            online game going, and I think the only realistic way is to find            someone else with the game and set up a match that way. So at this            time, yes, there are internet options available to you, but no, I            can't tell you whether it fills the gap in this type of game.         Both the PC and PSX versions of the game play very well,            though you will probably make changing the default camera your            first task. Unfortunately just another set of graphical tweaks            can't quite make this game a classic, and with the usual annoying            gameplay aspects rearing their ugly heads again, it almost makes            the game a forgettable cash-in.                    However, there is enough in both versions to prevent them from            becoming dust gatherers, and with the PC's internet potential yet            to be realised it could well be the making of a classic. I would            suggest that if you have FIFA 2000, then you really do not need            FIFA 2001 on either platform, unless like me you simply cannot help            yourself! If you do not have a recent football title in your            collection though, then this is currently the best arcade-style            footy game on the market.
