Anyone would think the            buying public would be getting sick of the damn things. Over the            last few months we've seen the progression of the Marvel vs. Capcom            and Street Fighter lines, and even an updated version of Star            Gladiator for crying out loud. A cursory glance at Capcom's back            catalogue shows titles such as Rival Schools, Pocket Fighter and            many more. One wonders how they can get away with it.                         The simple answer, as I'm sure you know by now, is that Capcom are            great at what they do. With Street Fighter, they brought the genre            to the forefront of arcade gaming. Over the years they've refined,            redefined and added to the fighting game repertoire in a way Rare            and Nintendo rejuvenated the platform game with Super Mario 64, and            EA the sports game. For me, the fruit of all this effort is Power            Stone 2. Original, quirky and devilishly fun, Power Stone 2 takes            the traditional fighter, turns it on its head, and is a great game            for it. If you play this, your judgement of fighters could be            changed too.                         Of course, if you've never played the game, you'll be wondering            what the hell I'm babbling about. I'd better start explaining. The            story behind the game is as follows. It's the 19th century, and a            group of adventurers are searching for the mystical, elusive Power            Stones; gems of great magical power that can make any wish come            true. One day, dark clouds form in the sky, and a huge hovering            fortress emerges from the mists, its shadow darkening the whole            world. The nefarious Dr. Erode resides within, and his collection            of captured power stones. Nobody knows what he plans to use them            for, but each one of the adventurers feels they must embark on a            journey to his castle to retrieve the power stones, each for their            own personal motive.                    The adventurers are a varied and charismatic bunch, featuring            well-loved stereotypes and a few original ideas. Ranging from the            obligatory big, beefy type to the tiny, geeky robotics freak, with            a few madcap ideas such as the evil clown Jack and the mad chef            Gourmand, the range of personas on show each have their own clearly            identifiable traits and moves. A surprisingly large amount of            characters appear throughout the game, complementing the variety in            gameplay.                         At its core, the gameplay is manic fighting action for between 2            and 4 contenders. However, none of your hell-for-leather smacking            each other with high punches, blocking low kicks and insane combos            here. What we have is an ingenious system using only one Attack            button, a Jump button, a drop item button, and a multifarious            do-all button called Action. This action button allows items to be            picked up, crates to be lifted, players to be grabbed and a whole            lot more. The numerous boxes and crates that litter each stage are            packed full of items, health boosters and the occasional power            stone. The items available range from umbrellas and crowbars to            huge bazookas and magic wands. The Action button even allows to you            manipulate the landscape and architecture of each stage.                         ~Architecture? Landscape?~ I hear you cry. I'm not talking about            the identical square fighting rings of the Tekken series or the 2D            backdrops favoured by SNK. I mean truly interactive, interesting            environments for the insane posse of scrappers to leap around in.            Initially I was put off by the relatively few number of levels            available but after playing just one, I had changed my mind. From            the ice-breaking watercraft, to an elaborate airship, to a mystical            Mayan-esque temple, to a futuristic space station, each level has            its own features and quirks. In the Japanese castle level, for            example, the initial fighting area, strewn with boxes and shields            for your pleasure, quickly catches fire, leaving it to our four            heroes to bound up platforms to the safety of the roof. It really            lends more to Mario than to Mortal Kombat. In the Airship level,            the flying contraption, due to the wear and tear of a few            hyperactive polygons smacking each other around, quickly exploded,            leaving our heroes to skydive (still kicking the living snot out of            each other) to the castle below, where among the delights waiting            are a man-made waterfall, and a fully operational tank.                    There're even turrets and pillars to shoot and hit each other with            on some levels. Gone are the days of punch-block-punch, because            here we have punch-smash-shoot-hide-behind-pillar-jump-run. The            design is genius. Not only genius, but beautiful: the 3D is of a            quality that is excellent, even for the Dreamcast. Each and every            element is crafted in bold, bright and shockingly fine detail.            Whatever they're feeding the graphic artists at Capcom: more of it,            please!                         Of course, mindless violence can quickly get boring, so            thoughtfully Capcom have supplied us with many playing modes for            our aggressive pleasure. From the obligatory fight your way through            Arcade mode (with stages interspersed by 'boss' levels, where you            destroy a huge enemy alongside your opponent), we have a Versus            mode, a free-for-all Original (where up to 4 human or CPU opponents            lay the smack down), and the epic Adventure mode.                         For the solitary player, Adventure mode is great. The            aforementioned items are, this time round, stored in the            magnificently named ~Item Book~. This hefty tome has hundreds of            pages, but only a few dozen (!) items are actually available in            game. How are the remainder of the pages filled? This is where the            shopkeeper Mel comes in. Not only does this merchant of destruction            buy and sell your assorted junk, she also has the Item Combiner: a            machine dedicated to taking 2 of the items or essence cards (base            substances, e.g. Fire, for making flamethrowers) to produce a whole            new one. For example, the manual lists a Hand Grenade and a Rabbit            Arm make a pair of Punching Gloves, and the ones you can devise            yourself or learn about in-game are even zanier. During my last            session, I successfully crossbred an Umbrella with an Axe, a bar of            Gold with a Bazooka, and many more. This mode, in addition to the            crazy fighting, gives longevity and challenge.                    However, it's not the undoubted joys of the 1-player game that will            keep you coming back. The multiplayer mode is undoubtedly the            finest feature in the game. On the Dreamcast, at least, there's            nothing to compare with smacking your mates across the face with            crowbars while avoiding the strafed fire of a machine gun. Better            still, finding 3 power stones then morphing into your character's            Transformation (ranging from a giant phoenix to a smirking lizard)            and blasting the hell out of everything.                         All of this is backed by a soundtrack of the highest order; a huge            array of tracks and styles fit right in, changing as you fight your            way through a level. The only possible downside to this game is            that once you complete the Adventure mode, unless you have instant            access to 3 other people at all times, it can get a little            repetitive. But if you're fortunate enough to be amazingly popular,            or live with people who adore games, this will seldom be out of            your Dreamcast.                    Superb, anarchic fun from Capcom. Puts some of their earlier            offerings to shame. (Don't buy Marvel vs. Capcom 2!) If you've been            looking for the perfect multiplayer game on the Dreamcast, or just            a beat-'em-up with a hint of originality, you must get this. Be            warned: I'm told it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy it. But            the reaction I've seen from almost everyone who plays it basically            says: if you like fun games, you'll love Power Stone 2."}
