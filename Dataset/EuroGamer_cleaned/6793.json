Some have even argued (pre-emptively)            that EA's F1 2002 is the current king of the road, and that            Crammond's crown has been displaced.                         Well I've been waiting a long time for this one, and while my            opinion of F1 has changed dramatically since the last game (the            sport currently rests somewhere between horse-racing and guttural            belching competitions on my list of things I'd like to watch),            Crammond's conviction hasn't wavered in the slightest, and despite            a strong challenger in the shape of F1 2002, and despite only            featuring the 2001 season date, and despite an almost constant            stream of cynicism from the media, Grand Prix 4 proves that it            takes more than a few expensive licensing deals and a slick            interface to make a good F1 game.                         The first thing that catches the player's attention about GP4 is            the new menu system, and it serves as a microcosm for the rest of            the game. The menus in GP4 have been completely updated - answering            a major criticism of GP3 - such that the player is never more than            a few clicks from the track, and yet they still retain the basic            structure of old, such that veterans like myself can pick it up            quickly and easily.                    More exciting though is the totally new in-game graphics engine,            pushing more polygons than ever before. More polygons means more            subtlety and variation in what's on display, and Crammond's team            hasn't been afraid to reach for top-tier performance options like            full transform and lighting, full scene anti-aliasing, and the full            array of environment-mapped real-time shadows, environment-sourced            reflections and a raft of different effects depending on the            weather. Heat haze is even more obvious and effective than before,            and if you've ever driven down a dusty road on a hot summer's day            you will be in awe of Crammond's replication of the effect. F1 2002            had a great water-streaking effect and some other trinkets, but GP4            has an authentic environment.                         Improvements to the accuracy of the game are bounteous to say the            least. The 17 tracks of the GP circuit have been modelled based on            photographs, video footage and Global Positioning Satellite data,            and now boast varying track width and curb design - which makes            overtaking more difficult - as well as the full complement of            background buildings and scenery, from popular landmarks like the            swimming pool section at Monaco to the less conspicuous            out-buildings of Silverstone and Melbourne. Even the            papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 crowds have been replaced with spiffier            models. Completing the picture, the pit crews and track marshals            are all motion-captured and polygonal, and while I'm not a big fan            of motion capture, they all look incredibly smooth and the mocap            doesn't interfere with the convincing effect.                         Presentation overall is very clear and the screen is rarely what            you would call cluttered. Instead the developer has filled the game            with handsome touches, like your having to watch TV views of the            other drivers' qualifying laps on a pit monitor with their hulking            racers speeding past in the background. It's all very atmospheric.                    On the track it's a similar story. Each team now boasts its own car            shape, which is a definite improvement - players won't have to wait            for amateur design updates this time out. You can drive from            numerous camera angles, including the new T-bar camera (although I            defy you to complete a whole race with it), and the interior of the            car is lined with gadgets and keeps you up to date on the status of            your car. Your radioman helps with that too of course, which            reminds me...                         I didn't even consider the game's sound effects for several days            because - to be honest - playing GP4 felt like watching F1 on            television, or, if I boosted the volume, like watching F1 balanced            on the nosecone of a Ferrari. Some will complain about the lack of            race commentary - and it's something for Crammond to consider with            GP5 - but then this only occurred to me because I saw Murray Walker            being interviewed on the grid at Silverstone about an hour ago,            which says something in itself.                         Of course, with amazing game engines come amazing system            requirements, and GP4 is a real hum-dinger. If you have a fast PC            (and GP4 really needs a 1GHz processor and a GeForce 3 to break            30fps), then you're okay, but you might actually find it cheaper to            buy an Xbox and that version of the game than to perform the            upgrades necessary to really enjoy this on a PC - the Xbox version            of GP4 is due out this summer, presumably when it stops raining.            However, I can't mark GP4 down too much for its over-zealous use of            graphical widgets, because I don't feel that the developer has been            lazy or wasteful in its application of said widgets, and GP4 can be            toned down to fit slower systems.                    GP's control system remains largely untouched, and remains largely            untouchable. Miraculously, on a keyboard the game is both playable            and enjoyable, and based on our time with a gamepad Xbox owners            have nothing to fear. Give it a steering wheel and pedals though            and you might as well be in the car - you can map controls for            everything an F1 driver might need.                         As ever the headlining gameplay mode is the full championship            season, which takes you through every hair-splittingly detailed            moment of every race as your preferred driver, and its considerable            bedfellows on the game's front end include the returning Quick Race            mode and a non-championship race weekend option. My favourite            though has proved to be 'Quicklaps'. Quicklaps is an            arcade-oriented mode that sets you off with a rolling start and            does away with the outlap completely, and it's useful primarily for            testing out your technical adjustments, or for the pundit's            favourite: hot-seating fastest laps with your drunken mates! Or if            you happen to be a rich driving fanatic, you can race up to seven            of them on your LAN or simply race split-screen.                         And so once again Geoff Crammond's Grand Prix can be catered to            just about any player. If you want an arcade racer, then you can            learn the ropes quickly and easily with Quicklaps and Quick Race,            and then you can fight your way through a season glossing over            telemetry and other such nonsense and with a full complement or a            selection of driving aids deployed; from automatic braking into            corners and help with the gas to automatic steering correction and            even a full-on indestructible cars option. If you fancy getting            your hands a bit grubbier though, then you can tinker with            virtually every aspect of the car with three distinct layers of            nitty gritty to tuck into, you can choose to make full use of your            various practice and qualifying options, work out a good strategy            to suit the weather and track design, and you can switch off all            your driving aids and see if you really could keep up with            Schumacher. As if all this weren't enough, once again you can pick            from various AI difficulty levels, and they will hound you to the            very last if you'll let them, but they know the risks too.                    Grand Prix 4's graphical improvements were always going to grab the            headlines, and deservedly so, but they aren't merely gloss to hide            a tired game. Apart from the 2001 data and the hefty system            requirements, I haven't a thing to say against GP4. The competition            will have to step up the challenge considerably to topple GP4 -            it's an almost perfect replica of Formula One."}
