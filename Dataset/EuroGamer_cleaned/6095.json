So I suppose I'll spend a few minutes            explaining the ins and outs of this year's finest videogame.            However I want it recognized that I do so under protest! (Noted            -Ed)                             Grand Theft Auto III. What a game. Easily the best on the            PlayStation 2, and probably any other system for that matter. If            there's one thing that annoys me about it, it's that DMA and            Rockstar have elected not to do a PC version, so I have to try and            persuade all my friends to blow \u00a3250 on a PS2 and a copy of            the game in order to waste hours nattering about it in the pub.            Frankly though, it is a killer application and it            will sell the PlayStation 2 this Christmas. And it deserves            to.                             You start off as a rookie criminal, busted by the cops after your            girlfriend double-crossed you in a bank raid, quietly building up            your contacts and level of respect in Liberty City, first with the            Italian mafia, then with the Japanese yakuza and other criminal            organizations. And there are plenty of 'em. As your reputation            improves you get offered more jobs, via payphone, pager and            face-to-face meetings. Sometimes your current boss meets you in the            company of a mysterious stranger, who turns out to be some big-shot            from downtown ready to offer you more work. Reliability is your key            asset as far as they are concerned, and it helps improve your            status and get you more work.                             Now, fans of the original games are probably wondering how anybody            could achieve ~reliability~ in a game like Grand Theft Auto. In            previous installments you would often screw up one mission, make a            mistake, run into the side of a car, get shot, or something like            that, and then sorry chum, that mission is no longer available to            you. In some extreme cases this could render your progress up to            that point irrelevant, since there was no mid-game saving and if            you needed to accrue loads more points you needed to get the            missions which paid the best rates. This made reliability something            of a fluke. Not so in GTA3. Although I'm not 100% sure I like it,            you no longer have to get each mission right first time. You get an            infinite number of chances to complete it, and you often have five            or so missions available at various employers and payphones, so if            you get stuck on any particular one you can leave it for later.                    So you're a Mafioso super villain thanks to your reliability (and            respectability - don't mess with Luigi's girls, for instance), and            you get a lot of jobs. But you don't have to take them. If you            don't fancy working you can just go for a drive, splatter some            pedestrians, buy some guns and kill some cops. GTA3 wins the fight            over the Daily Mirror crowd by giving you the choice. I was            fascinated when my little brother came over to visit this weekend,            because he just sat there driving peacefully around town in a taxi            doing nothing in particular.                             Speaking of taxis, you can switch professions for a while if you            like. Pick up a public service vehicle like a taxi or a fire truck            and you can tear around town collecting fares and putting out            blazes before the clock ticks down. Your very own Crazy Taxi,            except that you can simultaneously be on the run from the law and            perform drive-by shootings on some punk who flicks you off. And            even when you're not in a hijacked vehicle you can still have            plenty of fun. Pick up some grenades and you can stand on the            pavement trying to time your throws to coincide with the lights            changing for maximum damage. And yes, you can still steal all the            cars on the street, line them up neatly and then blow them up, but            beware of other carjackers out to spoil your fun.                             Police attention is more laboured than ever. You can get away with            jacking a car right in front of the police station, but don't try            it with a cop sat in the queue behind you. You can squish as many            peds as you like, but try to do so discreetly. They also tumble            over your car from time to time, which is amusing. Battering            traffic is a good way to incite some police action too, or you            could get an Uzi, drive slowly along a packed street and use the            L2/R2 triggers to line up a drive-by shooting, choosing a cinematic            viewpoint of your choice with the Select key beforehand. And for a            little harmless fun you can always steal a car and spiral it off            one of the game's many huge stunt ramps, which are located in odd            places around the map.                    Liberty City is more menacing than ever before, with three distinct            areas; the industrial, commercial and suburban sectors. You can't            access them all at first, thanks to the bridges being out, but as            the game progresses and you pick up more street cred and rack up            more time, the city planning committee finally gets its act            together. Each area is several miles square and you can lose            yourself for hours, although helpfully the game comes with a nice            fold-out map of the city. The maze of streets is ornately detailed,            and roads actually bend now instead of all forming right angled            corners.                            There are plenty of locations to memorize, like spray shops, bomb            shops, police and fire stations, hospitals, drop-off points and            such. The radar in the bottom left corner of the screen shows you            which way is north and marks the various bosses you are currently            working for, along with your home garage, where you can save your            game between missions and put cars in the garage. During missions            these aids all vanish except for the compass point, and are            replaced with objective beacons. These are often pink or brown dots            at different extremities for you to work towards, or little icons            for shops and the like.                             The graphics are generally pleasant to look at and have their own            charm, even if they aren't up to the standards of a Gran Turismo 3            or ICO. The thousands of pedestrians and cars in the game look good            and move beautifully - men walk like men, bag ladies hobble like            bag ladies, hookers prowl hips-thrust-forward like hookers, hobos            slump like .. well, you get the idea. The textures are pretty drab,            but that's because it's a city, and cities look like that. In fact            the game offers one of the most delightfully accurate portrayals of            a sprawling American metropolis that I've seen on any machine;            there's no film noir undertone or anything like that, it just looks            realistic. There are some real eye-opening moments, like rain            pouring down from the clouds and the huge moon glinting at you from            the sky, thanks to a time of day function that rotates conditions            and light levels depending on how long you play. The cutscenes            deserve their own paragraph as well, but then so does so much else.            They use in-game graphics, which is a sort of weakness, but it's a            compromise you have to deal with. The lip-synching is perfect and            the voice acting is superb, with some decent uncredited actors in            there, including the chap who played Cypher in The Matrix.                    Vehicles are the mainstay of the game, naturally. There are            something like ninety in total, and they range from the huge rig            wreckers to the ubiquitous stationwagon to the Mafia sentinel and            Yakuza and Diablo sports cars. Everything is accounted for, and you            can pinch just about anything on wheels (and perhaps more). You can            also trash everything, as the cars have innumerable damage skins            and crumple a lot more realistically than before. Nick a taxi as            you swerve onto a main road and you'll know it. Hit something            straight on and the bonnet flies up. Or maybe the doors give a            little, failing to close. Ultimately, you can do far too many            things for me to mention them all here. You want to watch it though            - little tongues of flame mean the car is done for. In GTA and            GTA2, it wasn't quite terminal until the thing was a ball of flame            and sounded like a wind-up toy, but in GTA3 you get the hell out as            soon as things start to turn red. You also need to get the hell out            if you roll over. The Hollywood car physics remain, but DMA have            introduced Hollywood's attitude to physics in general - a car on            its roof is a car which is about to blow up, and this can rock you            off your feet if you're not too careful, losing you valuable health            points.                            Finally, I ought to mention the sound. Not just the soundtrack,            which is fabulous, but the little things. The sounds of the city            are, as always, perfect. Pedestrians shout abuse as you mount the            pavement, cops yell orders about dropping and surrendering (yeah            right) and the spoken lines of the other characters in the game are            all excellent. Your character never utters a word though, giving            his opinion through various bodily gestures - as artistic a            decision as DMA have ever settled upon. The soundtrack is monstrous            too. Over three hours long, it features pop, classic, RnB, drum and            bass, what sounds like speed garage, ska and even talk radio. That            last one is the real killer though - you can pump the volume up and            listen to ads about 24 hour pet shipments and a guy who thinks he's            a 'yoghurt-trained ninja'.                       There are problems with Grand Theft Auto III. Given the enormous            scale and the tremendous number of things the game attempts, that's            inevitable. There are some minor collision detection issues, such            as the trees on the lawn near the first police station you visit            which you can drive straight through, and car doors which don't            seem to pose much of a problem for our hero. Also the damage skins            on the cars, although mostly perfect, are a bit suspect at times.            The biggest problem though is the distance clipping. There is some            acceptable slow-down, but you often notice quite a lot of clipping,            and texture-drawing seems to have trouble catching up with you if            you are driving particularly fast. Driving under a bridge in the            first section of the game, the front lost all semblance of texture            for a while and just flickered beneath me, which was a bit            disheartening.        But you have to appreciate that these things are small fry compared            to the main dish. GTA3 is a luscious, sprawling epic of a game and            one of the most complete experiences I have ever encountered. If            this is what I've waited a year to see on my PlayStation 2, then I            would have waited ten. Magnificent."}
