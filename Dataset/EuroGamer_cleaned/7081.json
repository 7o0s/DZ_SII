Very often a game            from yesteryear will be re-released on budget, with manuals printed            in miniscule print on a CD booklet, and no indication as to whether            there are additional patches or configuration changes that need to            be made for it to even function on a modern Windows PC.                    Enter Sold Out Software,            whose latest range of budget software is aiming to change your way            of thinking, with their \u00a34.99 and \u00a39.99 ~Extreme~ range            of top quality games. What you get with each CD is a simple inlay            slip and the CD itself, but that is it. ~What of the manual~, I            hear you cry! Well, cunningly enough this has been included on the            CD itself in Adobe Acrobat format, as part of Sold Out's new            .now technology. It will even install the Acrobat reader            should you not have it already.                    The idea behind .now is to assist you with the game            installation process in every way that is possible. Each CD            auto-starts with a Macromedia Flash 4 based menu system, which            includes a remastered installation routine, online manual, and any            patches or updates which are currently available for that product.                    In this round-up I will be taking a look at ~Tomb Raider~ and            ~Worms United~, available in the \u00a34.99 range, along with            ~Special Ops~, ~Grand Theft Auto~ and ~Jimmy White's 2~ in the            \u00a39.99 range.         The game            that caused such an uproar that they even tried to ban it when it            was originally released! Yes folks, it's Grand Theft Auto time            again, but now available for the princely sum of ten of your            English pounds. So what was all the fuss about then? Surely            breaking into cars, mowing down pedestrians, running amok with            guns, blowing up buildings, and generally taking no notice of the            police force persuing you, is not such a terrible thing?            Essentially GTA is all a bit of harmless fun, but it is deemed by            some to be promoting and glorifying such ill behaviour in real            life.                    You begin life standing on a street in Liberty City, America, with            nothing but the clothes you are wearing. Parked rather temptingly            in front of you is a flashy car, which you promptly get into. A            voice comes in over the radio directing you to some phone boxes,            where you are to receive your mission orders. Missions can be a            simple pick up and drop off of a fellow criminal, or can involve            the planting of an explosives-rigged tanker to blow up a building.            Let's face it, you are not going to be flower arranging in this            game!                    The idea is to attain enough points to complete the current city            you are in, and you are told the target you have to reach at the            beginning of the level. For the best scores you are better off            taking jobs handed to you by the Mob; while giving you nice rewards            though, these missions are more likely to land you in trouble with            the local constabulary. If you ~die~ you are taken to the nearest            hospital, losing all your weapons but keeping your current score.            Get arrested however, and you will return to the streets weaponless            and half of your score deducted .. but at least your Wanted level            is reset to zero!                    Although quite pixelated, the graphics are easy to identify, and            the top down scrolling cruises along at lightning speed. A wide            variety of vehicles are at your disposal, or should that be mercy,            and you can be driving a top of the range sports car one minute and            a garbage truck the next. Where GTA really flourishes is in the            music department, with superbly selected rap tracks booming out of            the speakers in some cars, and more mainstream tunes in others. All            of this is played to you like a radio station, and is utterly            convincing in its execution.                    I loved the game when it was first released, and I still love it            now - there is simply nothing that tops it for mindlessly violent            and addictive fun. Sure the ethics are questionable, and maybe it            should not be played by a younger audience, but ultimately it's no            more violent than watching the every day news bulletins on the            television. The add-on pack ~GTA London 1969~ is also available            from Sold Out for \u00a39.99, so for a score you can have the lot            mate.             Listen up            soldier! Your duties are many, including upholding the prestige and            honour of the elite group of soldiers known as the Rangers. You are            expected to move faster and travel further than any other soldier,            keeping yourself mentally alert, physically strong and shouldering            more than your fair share of responsibility. You are always to be            neatly presented, respect your superiors, and care for your            equipment. You are better than the enemy, and you will defeat them            on any battlefield, and never leave a fallen comrade behind. That            will be all Ranger.                    Spec Ops is a third person strategic warfare game, set in various            locations around the world. Think of a ~Hidden & Dangerous~            style of play and you won't be too far off the mark. You are the            leader of an elite unit of US Rangers, tasked with a variety of            missions including your normal search and destroy type, counter            strikes, and hostage rescues to name but three. The game uses the            much touted (at the time) Viper 3D engine, and whilst it gives you            reasonable looking graphics, it does produce a really annoying            liquid effect at the base of the screen.                    The movement of the characters is reasonably trouble free, but can            be infuriating when you are near a solid object and your character            cannot decide whether to walk past or detect it. The result is that            your character jerks around the object, making it a difficult task            to pick up any health or ammo that may be lying nearby. The combat            system is not exactly brilliant either, with the soldier            auto-detecting enemies for you, but often not the one you really            could do with being killed.                    The night vision mode is a little overpowering, very often            disguising the enemies more than if you did not have it on, and it            can also be difficult to isolate where an enemy is firing from,            night vision or not. It is a pretty tough nut to crack, and even on            a lower skill level you will be staring at the 'mission failed'            screen more often than not.                    I found Spec Ops to be a pretty laborious game to play, with the            niggly little problems shining through more than they should. The            enemy AI leaves something to be desired, and in a stealth game            where this is so important, it defeats the object somewhat as a            target meanders into your line of fire without a care in the world.            With the sheer number of missions on offer and their great variety            it may provide a tenner's worth of fun to deep fans of the genre,            but the casual gamer should definitely avoid it.             Let's face facts,            snooker is perhaps one of the most niche marketed of all the game            types - you really have to like the green baized snoreathon to            actually get along with a computer version of it! I love playing            the real game itself, but I find more excitement from a packet of            flower seeds than I do watching it on television. I have enjoyed            computer based snooker offerings in the past, ~Jimmy White's            Whirlwind Snooker~ being a fine example, but their long term appeal            is rather limited.                    Enter ~Jimmy White's 2 : Cueball~, which is no ordinary game of            snooker, taking a refreshing change of direction and providing you            with an entire suite of indoor games. You begin inside an elegant            hallway which has two doors, one leading off to the snooker room,            and the other to the pool hall. Yes, there is pool too, an instant            plus in the game's favour, but it doesn't stop there. You also have            a dartboard, a Drop Zone arcade machine, a draughts board, a fruit            machine, and even a jukebox to tinker around with.                    Of course, the main attractions are the snooker and pool            tournaments, and mighty fine they look and play too. The snooker            table is situated in a grand lounge with a roaring open fire, and            your computer opponent is invisible except for two white gloves -            kind of like Rayman, but with less limbs! You decide who you wish            to play against, one of the computer opponents or another human            player if you so desire, and then the first frame begins. Shots are            achieved with relative ease using either the traditional dotted            line as a guide, or your own judgement if you are feeling            particularly cocky.                    The early computer opponents are not exactly the most adept of cue            wielders, but as you get further into the game the opposition gets            tougher. The net result is that you can often have some extremely            good frames of snooker or pool, and it is very rare for a shot you            have lined up to do something you did not expect it to. There are            times where real physics would mean certain shots made to look easy            would not be possible though, particularly with shots in the center            of the table.                    Graphics are as you would expect really, nothing too fancy; after            all there is not much you can do to make a set of snooker or pool            balls look anything more than solid and spherical! However, even            though there are more gaming options available to you, you will            soon tire of it all, and quite possibly seek out a pub or snooker            hall to play the real thing. Good entertainment for half an hour,            but not much more than that.             ~Worms United~ takes the original            game and bolts on its add-on pack ~Worms : Reinforcements~ in one            tidy package. Worms can be likened to ~Lemmings~, but replacing the            cute green fellows with little pink worms armed with weapons of            mass destruction.                    The idea is simple enough - take your team of military trained            worms onto the battlefield and be the last to survive. The range of            violent measures you can take against your foe is impressive, from            simply lobbing grenades to ordering a full blown airstrike, all            viewed from from side-on. There are four worms to a team, and you            will need all your cunning and skill to keep them alive. You can            play against the preset computer teams, or crowd around your PC            with your friends and take it in turns to make your move, risking            much spillage of beer and violent misconduct.                    Each worm begins with one hundred units of health, and when a            worm's health reaches zero it will self destruct, taking any other            worms in the vicinity with them. It is therefore prudent to make            sure the worm which you are about to wipe out is not too close to            one of your own team members. You can teleport your worm to 'safer'            locations on the map if you feel they are vulnerable, but this            costs you your turn, and the computer opponents are adept at            seeking out even the most well hidden of hermaphrodites.                    Alhough graphically crude and with horribly grainy sound, being a            DOS based game, there is something about Worms that keeps you            hooked and wanting more. Maybe it is the sadistic side of our            natures that compels us to snigger with an evil furrowing of the            brow as you finally take that troublesome worm's life. At            \u00a34.99 it represents outstanding value, and with the seeding            method of randomly creating landscapes there are literally            thousands of levels for you to wade through.             Lara Croft needs little introduction, being one of the most            widely known computer born characters ever created. ~Tomb Raider~            is how it all began, and the original is regarded by many as her            finest adventure. I was certainly one of the first to rush down to            my local Special Reserve and grab myself a copy. Originally            released in late 1996, does the original still stand the test of            time? The answer is a resounding yes.                    Wealthy Lara Croft seeks more excitement in her life, as rattling            around a mansion house is clearly not enough to satisfy her whims!            When she meets up with a tycoon who offers her the chance to            retrieve an ancient artefact, she jumps at the chance of            exploration and adventure. Successfully retrieving it, she            discovers that it is actually just one of four pieces of something            called the Scion. Ever the greedy one, Lara sets about retrieving            all of the pieces, but she is not alone in the hunt for the Scion,            and soon discovers that the tycoon has more than a casual interest            in the it.                    The tycoon's henchmen are just some of the enemies you will face in            the game. You also have to contend with the local wildlife, which            includes lions and gorrillas. You will even come up against the            more pant-filling Raptors and Tyranosaurus Rex, the latter of which            scared the bejesus out of me when I first played the game. As you            no doubt know by now, you control Lara from a third person            perspective, jumping, climbing and shooting your way through a            variety of locations, which in the first game includes Peru and            Atlantis.                    Graphics and sound are excellent throughout, but you will need to            do some digging to find the right 3dfx or OpenGL patch to show Tomb            Raider in it's true glory. Unfortunately these are not available on            the Sold Out CD, but are not too difficult to locate on the web.            Even in software mode though, the game still plays and looks good,            and for a fiver you can't moan."}
