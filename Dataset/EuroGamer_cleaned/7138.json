The sun beating down on your back, a light breeze                 rustling the trees... A cool calm surrounds you as you eye up                 your first shot of the day. Dressed in a ghastly beach shirt                 and chequered trousers, you certainly look the part.                    ~I'll take the Driver for this one~, you instruct your caddy, and            he hands you the hard hitter. A final analysis, and you settle down            for the swing. Passers by stop to watch you play your stroke.            Thwack! The ball soars through the air gracefully, catching a top            branch of a tree, and landing in thick undergrowth. Time for a            beer.                    Handy then that my fridge is but a few yards away from my PC. What?            You didn't think that I actually go out and play the darned game            did you?         PGA 2000 has all the                 features of PGA 1999, but with a plethora of new improvements                 and content. The game comes with eight courses, with an                 additional five created using the game's ~Course Architect~, a                 simple to use editing facility which allows you to create your                 very own nightmare golfing scenarios.                    You can now easily customise your own events, seasons, and even an            entire career. Earn money in your fictitious world, while the game            tracks every single player's statistics. Work your way from lowly            amateur where 50 over par isn't uncommon, to the heady heights of            actually getting under par. There are other side games to be played            too, such as Sandies and Greenies, but sadly no night-golf option.                    The graphics have all been updated, giving far more realistic            looking turf, trees and players. The game also boasts dynamic            galleries, meaning that the crowds are attracted to the better            players more than the poor ones. With a real-time rotating ball            complete with logo, and more camera views than you can shake a            stick at, PGA 2000 works out to be quite a nifty package.                         From the main menu you have a whole string of options open to                 you. To get straight into the action you can choose the 'Quick                 Start' option, which allows you to play a relaxing round of                 golf without any opponents.                    The 'Play Golf' option will allow you to select between 'Local',            'Remote' or 'Season' games. 'Local' allows you to set up a            multiplayer session using one computer, taking it in turns to take            your shot. 'Remote' allows you to hook up with other players via            the Heat.Net service or modem-to-modem.                    But 'Season' is obviously where you want to be heading for the            serious competition. Unless you are a complete wizard you will want            to select or define an amateur player to play against similar            opposition. Once you feel more confident you can start tackling the            big boys. You can either follow the default season provided for            you, or you can create your own. The flexibility is great, and it            makes a nice change not to be forced to play through a pre-set            batch of courses.                    The 'Options' menu allows you to alter the level of detail of the            golfer and course. By default the game will try to play in            1024x768, but if your system is having a hard time with this, the            options menu is your answer. You can also choose whether the            weather conditions will change, and even alter the ball size should            you find yourself peering at the screen wondering where it is!                    Finally you have 'Stats' and 'Preview'. 'Stats' allows you to view            the comprehensive statistics of every single player in the            database. You don't actually get any of the real player names, even            though the PGA endorses the game. Odd indeed, but I believe there            is a data-file you can download with all today's celebrities.            'Preview' simply opens up the on CD tutorial, a handy starting            point if the comprehensive manual is too daunting for you.         So now that you've set up your dream tournament, it's                 time to show the world what you're made of.                    Usually you will play in a group of four players from the entire            leaderboard, although you can change this if you want the game to            progress quicker. The players you're putting with are picked in            relation to your position on the leaderboard - if you're in the top            four, then logically the top four is who you will be playing            alongside.                    Having watched the computer controlled players do their thing, it's            now your turn. This is where I fell completely in love with the            game. The ~TrueSwing 3~ technology has been refined quite superbly,            and is totally realistic as a result. To play your stroke, simply            pull the mouse back to draw the club back, and forwards to release            the shot.                    The advantage of this over traditional arced swingometers, is that            you can actually control what you do with the ball. All the trick            shots that you can perform in real life can be done with this            system. Subtle shots are possible with gentle nudges of the mouse,            whereas driving from the tee involves a hard push to achieve.                    Like the real game, club position and fluent swing movement are            critical. If you rush the swing forward you will quite easily            mis-hit the ball. Particular care must be taken when performing            out-of-the-rough shots. You really need a smooth style to carry            these shots off.         An area which lets a                 lot of golf games down is poor representation of gradients and                 distance. I can happily report that PGA 2000 deals with both                 perfectly. Even the smallest of inclines is clearly visible,                 making it easy to pinpoint where not to hit your ball.                 You can also opt to play with a grid, accurately showing you                 the peaks and troughs, but you shouldn't need it until you                 reach the green.                    Location graphics are nicely varied from the desert sands of Cabo            del Diablo to the lush flowering fairways of the Whisperwood            course. Both of these were designed with the excellent ~Course            Architect~, showing you just how powerful a tool it is. Real            courses are of course in the game, including the Royal Birkdale in            northwest England, Black Diamond Ranch in California, and the Pete            Dye Golf Club in West Virginia.                    The golfers' animations are splendid too, with poise and posture            nicely rendered. There are also amusing touches like dramatically            falling to the knees due to a close shot, or the amusing tapping of            the watch when you're taking too long over a putt. The only            downside to the graphics are the cardboard cut-out crowd.                    Sound is utilised well in the game. The usual swoosh of a swinging            club and dull sound of ball hitting grass are well sampled. Crowd            cheering, clapping and gasping also occurs at moments when you do            something of note. Superb spot effects like birds chirping, ducks            quaking, and even planes flying overhead, all add to the realism of            the environment.                    The two American commentators add to the game immensely as well.            They provide helpful tips, such as how the wind will affect the            next shot, or how far it is to the flag. They also let you know            when you have hit a poor shot, while acknowledging your moments of            excellence. There are the odd occasions when commentary gets            muddled up, but on the whole it flows along nicely.         Quite frankly this                 is the best golfing simulation on the market. Graphically the                 game is superb, and landscape variety is good too. With 13                 courses to get your teeth into, you're not going to get bored                 in a hurry. And of course you can also design your own, or                 download other people's custom courses.                    The main attraction has to be the ~TrueSwing 3~ system though. You            have to actually use this to believe just how good it is - it            reacts accurately to your mouse movements, and behaves just as you            would expect.                    Sierra proclaims the game is ~Written by Golfers for Golfers~. I'd            certainly recommend it to enthusiasts and non-golfers alike. Mighty            fine stuff."}
