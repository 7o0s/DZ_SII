Thanks to the AMD            Athlon Thunderbird processors (or Athlons with            ~Performance-enhancing L2 cache memory~ as AMD would have it) comes            yet another doubling of the CPU speed threshold within a year.                         Why have AMD made this move to a new core though? The answer can            be seen when broadly comparing the specs of its own line of Athlons            from the past year. Throughout the series, spanning 500 to 1000MHz,            the L2 cache divider was set so that the cache speed never rose            above 350MHz, its peak, seen only in the 700MHz variant with its            1/2 divider. With the later Athlons, the performance deficit            between them and Intel's equivalent Pentium III chips (whose cache            ran at full speed) was quite sizeable, and something needed to be            done.                         With the advent of the Thunderbird core, AMD have tipped the            balance back in their favour, introducing a chip capable of keeping            up with even the hardiest PIII. The secret to the Thunderbird's            success lies in its full-speed on-die L2 cache. Having the L2 cache            on the die allows it to operate at the same frequency as the rest            of the die, meaning that it runs at a ratio of 1 : 1 with the            processor, ergo full-speed. The latency is greatly reduced, as the            CPU is physically closer to it. The performance differential            between the older K7 core Athlons and these newer Thunderbirds            under certain conditions is staggering.                         The Thunderbird is being released at 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000            and (most recently) 1100MHz frequencies, with more to come. The            availability of the chips is paramount and although there were            rumours of a shortage earlier this week, there's been no talk of it            since, whilst Intel are left scrimping and scraping to get their            1GHz Pentium III off the ground. Currently it's in very short            supply and at inexplicably steep prices, while the Thunderbird 1GHz            (reviewed here) is priced reasonably and available readily.                    The 256Kb of L2 cache does wonders for the performance of the            processor, but it's not the only change. The new Thunderbirds have            now adopted what's known as the Socket A packaging. Instead of            being produced as cartridges, which slot into connectors (with            boards named appropriately Slot A), the new chips adopt a much            smaller package, similar to Intel's ~flip-chip~. Because the cache            is on-die there's no need for the hefty cartridge style, and as            such the chip is much smaller, and clamped firmly by its 462 pins            directly onto the motherboard, which uses a new chipset, the KX133.            This is because the only chipset other than this, which officially            supports the Thunderbird, is the AMD 750, or Irongate. I can            confirm this for myself, as my own K7V board has trouble with the            Slot A Thunderbird I managed to track down through OEMs. The newer            K7V-T seems to be the way forward if you would rather stick to the            Slot packaging, but for the most part moving over to a Socket board            is more future-proofed from the buyer's perspective.                         Physically the actual die of the chip is much smaller, with a            0.18micron fabrication process, although the presence of the cache            on-die increases the size some 20% over the most recent            non-Thunderbird 0.18micron Athlons. The transistor count is greater            too, with some 37 million transistors, compared to 22 million in            the original Athlon.                         Obviously such a large amount of transistor switching creates a            lot of heat, and this must be channelled away. One of the areas            that some people have reportedly encountered trouble with is            third-party heatsink and fan combinations that don't clamp down            correctly onto the Thunderbird. As such it's very important to make            a proper thermal contact between the core and the heatsink, as the            core will burn up after seven seconds without adequate cooling. One            of the reasons it appears hard to clamp the heatsink on correctly            is the four pads (one in each corner) of the Socket A chips. As            proven by the new Taisol and Chrome Orb coolers though, it's            perfectly possible to cool the chip without worry. A little bit of            messing around with thermal grease will help, but for the most part            the process is painless.                    The actual benefit of adding full-speed on-die L2 cache is specific            to certain applications, but its other main purpose is to allow the            Athlon to reach much higher clock speeds. At high clock speeds the            2/5 cache divider of the older Athlons meant it could be running at            only 300-340MHz, and the Athlon won't be getting much help from            that at its highest frequencies. The lower latency is also very            important for those applications that make use of the L2 cache.                         Obviously there's a bit of a puzzle as the older K7 core Athlons            used 512Kb off-die (usually just referred to as external) L2 cache            - surely the higher numbers are more important than the            positioning? As it happens having 256Kb closer to the core reaps            larger benefits. Certain situations (such as database crunching            servers) may call more readily for the external 512Kb, but on the            whole the Thunderbird is preferable for the above reasons.                         If you've read AMD's press release about the Thunderbird you may            be puzzled by their insistence that the chip has 384Kb of cache. In            reality this is split up into the L2 cache and 128Kb of L1 cache.            The main reason that this is news is that unlike Intel whose            CopperMine processors use an inclusive caching system (where all of            the data within the L1 cache is duplicated in the L2 cache), AMD            have opted for an exclusive caching system for the Thunderbird,            where the L1 data isn't duplicated, so when AMD say they have a            total of 384Kb of on-die cache, that's the truth of it.                    Possibly the biggest news about the Thunderbird prior to its launch            was the news that it would operate with the use of copper            interconnects rather than Aluminium (or Aluminum to our American            friends). However it's been mooted since then that the Thunderbird            will be fabricated using both types, since it's not specifically            important for the Thunderbird to be produced with a copper process.            The burden has therefore been split equally between AMD's plants in            Austin, Texas and Dresden, Germany. The latter will be responsible            for the copper process.                         The question of difference in performance is still only loosely            documented, but since a processor from either plant would operate            at the same core voltage, their temperatures will be very close to            one another. For AMD, the move to copper interconnects will help to            let them work more efficiently at higher clock speeds, but lets            save that for another article.                         The bottom line from AMD's perspective on the subject is that it's            a future-proofed move toward higher clock processes. It will help            them in the long run. In the meantime, all other CPUs (based on the            Aluminium process) will be manufactured in Austin, Texas, and that            includes the new Durons.                    The Socket A Athlon 1000MHz AMD provided us for review gave us a            few problems at first, although these were tracked down to the            motherboard, and a replacement was quickly despatched to us.            Ironically neither board was terribly user friendly. The first, a            Gigabyte 7ZM (a Micro-ATX solution) was dead on arrival, although            it looked fairly sturdy, whilst the MSI 6340 gave us problems with            PCI devices, ignoring them. To this day we haven't tracked down the            problem.                         Nevertheless, the Thunderbird itself was a stunner. Installation            of Windows 98 was the fastest I've encountered, and the boot-up            process took a mere 20 seconds. Yes, that's 20 seconds. Although            this is with a bare bones system (MSI 6340, Athlon 1000MHz, 128Mb            Crucial RAM running at CAS2, 3d Prophet II GTS graphics card) the            speed is astounding.                         Installing all our favourite apps produced some simply stunning            results. The 3d Mark 2000 program used the world over to benchmark            systems produced a score of some 7500, possibly the highest score            I've ever encountered. While 3d Mark is considered a very synthetic            benchmark (in other words it's only good for comparing like for            like), the score drummed up enthusiasm.                         Quake III is our benchmark of choice at EuroGamer however, and as            such it was the main focus..                    : the low-end                    : the other extreme                    As you can see we tried to encompass both ends of the performance            settings ladder with these tests. The lower resolution tests are            quite interesting, as the Thunderbird sticks its head out            marginally in front. Although perhaps it would do so further with a            better motherboard chipset. At the higher resolutions the GeForce 2            GTS is the limiting factor. Although the Athlon is ahead on paper            by a slither, it's really going to be some time (not until the            GeForce 2 Ultra and Voodoo5 6000 hit store shelves in fact) until            these processors can be used to their full potential at this            high-resolution setting.                    At this stage the performance against other leading processors is            about right - on the level, if you like. The L2 cache being on-die            is a significant factor in keeping the performance at such a            competitive level, and AMD have definitely achieved success in            holding off Intel for the moment. Many may turn around and talk            about Intel's new Williamette (or P4 as it's officially known) and            its performance against the Thunderbird, but the truth of the            matter is the Thunderbird is here to compete against the            CopperMine, and it's won that war.                         An interesting point about the Williamette argument though, is            that considering the extremely hefty pricetag that will be attached            to it, and the limitations due to graphics cards in gaming that we            are already seeing, it may be hard for anyone to justify the            upgrade, no matter how much the performance increase. After all,            the price will be very steep and for gamers at least, there may            seem little point. Intel may have trouble marketing the            Williamette, as it will inevitably be pitted against Thunderbirds            (which will be in the upper echelons of the 1300s by then I should            imagine). AMD have recently announced their 64-bit processor, and            in the current climate Intel may find themselves at the mercy of            the general public for mistiming their CPU launch. Stealthy            marketing tactics will be abound, but for the moment at least,            thanks to its high level of performance at a competitive price, the            Thunderbird CPU is the processor of choice for real gamers. Coupled            with the new ABit KT7-RAID or ASUS A7V, you can't really go wrong."}
