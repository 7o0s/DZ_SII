With Jane            Jensen once again behind the engrossing story line, ~Gabriel Knight            3: Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned~ promises to be a great            adventure...                    With the disappearance of the son of a prince, Gabriel is called in            to help and soon finds himself on a train through France hot on the            trail of the kidnappers. As usual things go wrong, and Gabriel soon            finds himself on the wrong end of a heavy object, only to awake in            a hotel in a small French village called Rennes-le-Chateau.         Once awake you have free rein                 over the whole village and the ability to talk to virtually                 everyone that you see. You can very quickly determine that                 something isn't quite right with this pleasant looking town,                 and with tourists looking for everything from the buried                 treasure of the Knights Templar to the Holy Grail, there is a                 lot more going on in Rennes-le-Chateau than meets the eye.                    Some old characters return as well, namely Grace Nakamura, and            Gabe's old cop chum Moseley. It's always good to have recurring            characters, as it does help make the game feel that little bit more            friendly for players familiar with the previous games in the            series.         As is common to all adventure                 games from Sierra, there is a points system to give the player                 some idea that he/she is ~doing the right thing~. With a                 massive total of 965 points to earn, GK3 is no walk over.                    The game is also split into 3 days, each one consisting of 2 hour            periods, and in order to progress you must complete all the            required tasks. This can certainly become a little annoying, as            missing just the smallest item will send you running round the            village looking for what to do like the proverbial village idiot.         Being a Gabriel Knight game, there                 is a fair bit of talking between the various characters. And                 inevitably there are a few well known names that make up some                 of the cast.                    Tim Curry reprises his extremely annoying southern drawl as Gabriel            - think nasal Forrest Gump meets Cameron Po, Nick Cage's character            in Con Air. Other stars that lend their vocal talents to the game            are Rene Auberjonois and John de Lancie (known to any trekkers as            Odo[DS9] and Q[TNG] respectively).                    Another point of note regarding vocal talent is the lip synching.            It may not be entirely accurate, but when Gabriel and the other            talk their lips seem to move incredibly realistically, which is a            nice touch. As is the random blinking of each character.         Usually in an adventure game you                 are stuck with very static scenes and very little control over                 the camera. In GK3, not only are all the rooms fully 3d                 accelerated, you also have total control over the camera. In                 fact, moving Gabriel around doesn't effect your view at all                 (until you change scenes).                    By providing the user with control over a free camera, you can go            virtually anywhere you like, and look around things without having            to wait for Gabriel to get there.                    Generally the scenes themselves are well drawn, but are            geometrically quite simple. Fortunately though the designers have            covered up a lack of complexity with some detailed texturing, which            further adds to the ambience of the quaint little town that you are            stuck in.         The engine doesn't actually require any 3D                 acceleration to run, which is nice, as far too many games will                 only run with some serious graphics power - I should start a                 ~bring back software rendering~ campaign... But given a                 suitably powerful piece of 3D hardware, GK3 will take full                 advantage of it and allow you to run in any resolution and bit                 depth that your hardware can support. It is certainly a treat                 to play at 1024x768 in 32bit colour.                    There are some serious limitations to the game though. Due to the            room/scene based nature of the game, when moving from one scene to            another there is a significant loading delay, which is unacceptable            in my opinion (yes, I found Half-Life to be just as annoying). This            seriously impacts on the games fluidity, and it certainly made me            feel more than a little tired at having to wait five to ten seconds            just to go from the lobby to the dining room...         GK3 is a superb game with a                 truly deep story. Couple this with a rather good looking                 graphics engine, some great dialogue, detailed environments,                 and an all round attention to detail, and you have a great                 game. Unfortunately though, thanks to the nature of the                 adventure system and the pauses while loading scenes, the game                 can become tedious at times.                    Rest assured though, Gabriel Knight fans will love this game, and            for anyone wanting to get their teeth into some serious adventure            gaming I can thoroughly recommend GK3.
