Are they just out to            make my job more difficult? With every new release it's some            bizarre new behemoth of a concept that requires press briefings,            extensive playtest sessions and ultimately more time to review than            it takes to translate Tolstoy into Cantonese using a pocket            calculator. Why has the gaming industry denied its roots so? Every            other new release that ends up on my desk is some sort of            'incredible breakthrough' in how we'll see and interpret gaming for            the next fifteen years. If I had my way there'd be far more Dynasty            Warriors to this world and far less pantomime shoot 'em ups.                         In a sense then, it's quite pleasant to discover that although            Final Fight-clone Dynasty Warriors II isn't quite the game            we had hoped it would have been, its shortcomings are more to do            with longevity and bad design than with the genre itself showing            its age. In fact, if we're lucky, overzealous developers KOEI will            flash back to the drawing board and bedazzle us with the coming of            DWIII. However, in the meantime, lets put down our collective glass            of Christmas sherry and trade our mince pies for broadswords. It's            time for battle.                         Dynasty Warriors II is like playing Golden Axe with crossed eyes.            You are fighting in a truly 3D setting, with a third person 'over            the shoulder' approach and more assailants to overcome than could            be drummed up on a scouring mission through Greater London. Whereas            titles like Final Fight and Golden Axe obliged you to trade blows            with only a token force, DWII is literally swarming with enemies.            You start out by selecting a burly fellow from one of the            historically compiled Warlords available, and almost immediately            you are swamped by attackers. Thankfully the learning curve is less            of a curve and more of a straight.                    The backdrop to the carnage upon which you are forcing yourself is            feudal Japan, a rather violent place if truth be told. This            particular period is full of brave, honourable warriors fighting            for a multitude of causes, and yours is to unite the troubled            region of China and avoid it becoming the subject of a gross civil            war. The plot is a rather cunning simplification of the goings-on            in the ~Romance of the Three Kingdoms~ RPG series also developed by            KOEI, but ultimately you're there for the fighting, not for the            view.                         As you start your noble mission you are immediately set upon by            some nasty chaps, hell-bent on doing you a mischief. Each of the            enemies in DWII has a specific attack pattern based on their            weaponry, so it's often pretty easy to deal with them. Thanks to            the shear quantity of oppressors, your task doesn't lose its charm            for quite some time, not at least until the repetition kicks in.                         Your own attack consists of a few token slashes as well as a            chargeable combination move, which is operated by holding down the            secondary attack button for a few seconds and then letting rip. As            you gradually downsize your opponents, the energy bars that waft            conspicuously above their heads decrease until they are completely            drained, at which point, in long-established fashion, your opponent            flops down and fades away from view. The control system,            incidentally, is as responsive and faultless as can be, with            functions allocated logically and unlike some third person titles,            no lapse between press and action.                    Rather like your average side-scrolling beat 'em up, the world of            DWII is covered with fruitful scenery. Crates, jugs, and other            elements of the d\u00e9cor can be smashed to pieces revealing bonus            items inside. This is something worth doing too, because            occasionally it reveals a mid-battle save point, something of a            Godsend.                         These items are not the only things to reveal surprise bonuses -            many of your opposition are worth bumping off just for the reward            factor. The higher ranked enemies in particular, often yield some            exciting new item in their wake. The rank of the chap you are            fighting is often displayed in the top right of the screen,            allowing you to work out if he's really worth it. If you spot a            Captain or a General, it's usually worth seeing to them just for            the extra armour or weapons you will get out of it. They make            dealing with the rest of the on-screen protagonists much easier.                         You may feel duty-bound at this point to inquire, nay, demand what            the problem is with such a simple, yet entertaining concept, and to            be frank, there isn't one. Dynasty Warriors II is fast, furious and            enjoyable. It's one of those games that pulls you in with its            mindless simplicity and fails to let go. But unfortunately, at some            point along the way, and it's difficult to say when it happens, you            lose interest. The engaging nature of the early levels gives way to            tedium, and eventually frustration as you yearn for something            else to happen.                    Granted, there's a fair bit to do and see before the boredom sets            in. You get to ride a horse and such (the graphics for which are a            spectacular indication of what the PS2 is capable of in the            future), chat to other Warlords to find out how the battle for            China is progressing and such, but all things considered there is            so little to do once you've played the game for a couple of            hours that it just begs the question of whether or not it's worth            bothering with, especially at the price of current PS2 games.                         One of DWII's strongest traits though is its graphical engine. As            mentioned above, the horse-riding scenes are breathtaking, and            general combat smacks more of Tekken Tag Tournament and of Soul            Calibur than something like Final Fight. Watching yourself battle            several foes at once is definitely quite captivating, but thanks            mainly to your scant array of attacking manoeuvres, this too            becomes fairly boring after a while.                         Another gripe is that aurally DWII is more like elevator music for            beat 'em ups than anything else. It's got crashing war themes and            the like, but they are nothing special - nothing like Final Fantasy            VII's battle theme, nothing that gets the blood boiling.                    At the end of the day, although Dynasty Warriors II is a competent            and entertaining game which does well to take advantage of the            PlayStation 2's graphical hardware, any game that becomes tedious            through repetition deserves more than a raised eyebrow. Although            there's some fun to be had here, for what we dole out for            PlayStation 2 games it should last beyond a first day's worth of            play, and that's why we have to be so harsh on it."}
