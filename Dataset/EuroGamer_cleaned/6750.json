However,            if I were to delve back into the fancies of my youth, I might be            able to claw a couple of popular titles to mind. Pinball games            which I actually bothered to play - a measure of quality            unsurpassed in the field of pinball-reviewage, I assure you. Those            two games would be Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies. Somebody            out there, and I don't know exactly who, is well aware of my            enduring obsession with these two icons of popular pinball pursuit,            and I believe that somebody works for Ubi Soft, because Pinball            Challenge Deluxe encompasses both and offers much in the way of            entertainment as a result.                         Originally released on the Amiga, I met both games on the Super            Nintendo, and they wowed me with their cleverly designed tables and            realistic table physic. Pinball Challenge Deluxe goes one better,            overwhelming the player with the sheer wealth of things to do. With            a combined tally of eight tables, you won't be totting up            impressive scores on all of them for quite a while, especially as            they all tread the fine line between playability and dastardliness            with some class. Of course graphically it's nothing too special by            the GBA's increasingly impressive standards, but the cartoony            tables are cleanly presented and the balls easy to see, and in a            game about hitting a ball with flippers and trying to get it to            roll in the right direction, just how much detail do you need?                         For those of you, like me, intrigued at the quality of the            conversion, the game accurately recreates more than 300 pieces of            music, 50 sound effects, 450 lights and 200 ~game modes~. And a lot            of the tables retain their multi-flipper approach, rather like            eternal GBC favourite Kirby's Pinball. Oh look, I've got you casual            'ballers interested now. Tsk.                    The game won't be to everyone's liking. It is, after all, a pretty            simple game, and for all my posturing it's not as deep and            meaningful as some of the better GBA games out there. Plus, at as            much as \u00a330 it's quite a hefty purchase, but flippant            nostalgics like myself, and those of you who like pinball and fancy            the idea of playing some of the best tables ever conceived on your            handheld will almost certainly want to give it a go. Tune in next            month for an embarrassingly knowledgeable appraisal of each table,            pixel by pixel! [Yeah, I'm gonna can that idea actually -Ed]"}
