Using the ~Thunderbird~ core, it pummelled Pentiums in            just about every test we could throw at it.                         Now of course, Intel have answered AMD with the release of the            Pentium 4, which we feel is a very promising architectural change.            That said, it hasn't taken off, and benchmarks show it suffering at            the hands of AMD. The reason that current programs don't show any            real improvement is that they are coded to avoid using (previously            slow) main system memory, and the Pentium 4's design relies upon            the superior memory bandwidth and the speed of its main memory.            It's a slightly peculiar hypothesis, but it would explain why            programs don't take advantage of the memory bandwidth that the P4            has been built to use.                         Which, all things considered puts AMD in a very strong position,            at least for the time being. With a new revision of the Athlon core            codenamed ~Palomino~ and a concurrent revision of the Duron core            codenamed ~Morgan~ close to release, the company has a lot to be            cheerful about. The list of improvements seems to be mostly to do            with temperature and power management - fundamentally it's still            the Athlon ~K7~ core, edging its way higher and higher. Palomino            should debut at 1533MHz.                         However as our readers will know, at speeds like that any machine            is going to be severely graphics card limited, unable to keep the            polygons pumping hard enough to strain the CPU any further. And            lets face it, we're not CADs, we're not movie directors, we're            gamers, and we want high framerates and pretty visuals.            Having played with numerous Athlons and various graphics cards, our            research indicates that very little if anything is gained above            around 1.1GHz, even with the latest GeForce 3 and high performance            system memory. Which is why, gentle reader, we're casting a            critical eye over the most powerful strain of the K7 core yet            produced for the home consumer; the 1.33GHz Athlon.                    It could be argued that gamers are no longer buying expensive            computers to improve their framerates. Generally speaking, they            want to experience a higher level of visual quality.                         With this in mind, we feel that a PC's ability to handle 32-bit            colour with all settings maxed out is more important than how many            frames per second above 150 it can go with no textures and primary            colours. If you take a look at the following tables, you can            clearly see a trend - at 1.1GHz and above, there is little or no            change in framerate. All tests were conducted in Quake III, with a            GeForce 3 (using beta drivers), currently the most powerful            graphics card on the market. As indicated above, all settings were            maxed out, although full-screen anti-aliasing was disabled.            Quake III (OpenGL)            With anti-aliasing enabled, performance flatlined above 1GHz            - our PC was limited by the ability of the GeForce 3 to shovel            data.                         So immediately the question has to be, how can we justify the            purchase of a 1.33GHz Athlon?                    Is AMD's 1.33GHz Athlon as powerful as they said it would be? In a            word, yes. The problem is that at the moment, there is nothing that            can really keep up with it, and programmers aren't developing            software that can take advantage of, for example, the DDR            motherboards that have been filtering onto the market. Even with            DDR memory prices now rock bottom, the market is in disarray over            how to handle things.                         Whether or not you should buy a 1.33GHz Athlon is dictated by two            factors, the first of which is price. On the one hand, you won't            necessarily have anything in your PC able to harness the chip's            abilities, but on the other, it costs a mere \u00a3215, and opting            for a slower processor to save \u00a350 would seem wasteful.                         The other factor is variety. In all likelihood, if you're reading            this, you don't just use your PC for gaming. Perhaps you watch            DVDs, surf the Internet, juggle email applications and word            processing packages. It all mounts up, and counts against you. The            faster your processor, the faster things will get done. And            thanks to the 1.33GHz processor's higher memory bus speed, you can            harness some of the power your games can't touch right away.                         The Pentium III has long operated at its staple 100 and 133MHz            front side bus speeds, passing data back and forth once for every            memory bus clock cycle. With the Athlon, AMD introduced the ability            to transfer twice as much data per clock, and claimed 200 and            266MHz front side buses. It also bears noting that the Pentium 4's            ~quad-pumped~ memory architecture pushes four times as much data            per clock thna the Pentium III.                         The move to a 133MHz DDR (or 266MHz) front side bus (FSB)            noticeably improves performance. Using a 1.2GHz 100 DDR FSB chip,            compared to a 1.2GHz 133 DDR FSB chip, and Ziff Davis' ~Content            Creation Winstone 2001~ benchmark package, we discovered that            performance improved by some 10%                         Another interesting test was the boot speed of the PC. Using the            above two processors, loading the PC from cold to the Windows 2000            desktop three times for each chip, we observed an improvement of            approximately 7 seconds.                    Ultimately, any gamer who owns a computer over 900MHz will not be            terribly impressed by the upgrade to 1.33GHz. If you're in the            market for a new machine and find yourself still kicking around            anything below that, you will not only notice it, but it will            change the way that you play games and use your computer, at least            for the next year or so while the world catches up.                         The most difficult thing about reviewing a processor is trying to            work out whether the next big thing (which is never more than a few            months away) is going to be worth waiting for. It drives us            reviewers mad! As the owner of a 1GHz machine myself, I'm inclined            to wait and see how that gets on.                        -        AMD                    Athlon ~Thunderbird~ ReviewAMD                    Athlon ~Thunderbird~ ReviewAMD                    Duron ReviewAMD                    Duron ReviewApril's                    Marching MotherboardsApril's                    Marching MotherboardsPerformance                    Memory ShowdownPerformance                    Memory Showdown"}
