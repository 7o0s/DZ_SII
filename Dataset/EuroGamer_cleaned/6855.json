It was engaging enough to drag the player through a            ridiculous number of levels - gradually unlocked as the player            improved - before making his collection of vehicles inexplicably            indestructible and ruining any remaining levels he still had to            complete by removing the challenge. Still, it was about as close as            the car combat formula has ever really come to succeeding.                        Twisted Metal, Sony's answer to SCi's - if you'll excuse the pun -            killer franchise died a death before it really had a chance to            blossom, slaughtered by a dissonance of feeble revamps which merely            served to underline the PSone's inadequacies and Sony's own            intention: to wring some cash out of Joe Public. Which is why            Twisted Metal : Black comes as such a shock to the system. Stunning            presentation, awe-inspiring vistas and manic gameplay aren't the            half of it. There is a limitless amount of gameplay in this            behemoth of a video game, and it fills the void left by the            devolving Carmageddon series admirably.                        Twisted Metal : Black is made up of several gameplay modes, most            notably the single-player story mode which invites you to pick a            character - Street Fighter II style - and battle to the end of            their storyline. You wouldn't necessarily think that a compelling            narrative would be on the cards with characters like Sweet Tooth,            Outlaw and Mr. Grimm and a running theme of wanton destruction, but            for a large part of the time I played TMB I found myself            empathizing with the characters. I have a little brother who enjoys            destroying things, so I can relate to Sweet Tooth's plight. No,            really.                    Joking aside though, the simple truth is that the line-up of            characters is so outlandish and varied that you find yourself            wanting to take on new challenges. This is partly thanks to the            game's skills system. Character can be controlled in a number of            preset ways, some relying on the analogue sticks and others            sticking to digital, some mapping weapons to the shoulder buttons            and others to the diamond. For each character though, players can            access a special weapon. For instance, the Junkyard Dog driven by            Bill Ray can hurtle fire and brimstone from its rear-mounted tow            mechanism like a catapult.                         Players can also execute a number of special moves, with complex            d-pad manoeuvres unleashing devastating attacks and stunts.            Dropping stuff in the path of a pursuing car is also an option.            Ultimately though, players will learn that skill moves are the most            valuable. Performing a skill move consists of little more than            timing your shot to perfection for maximum effect, but doing so            allows players to reap countless rewards. Not content with simply            allowing players to blow stuff up and using Street Fighter-esque            control mechanics though, Incognito Studios has also strewn            weaponry all over the battlefield. The average rocket pack can be            picked up, and once the player has selected it a little compartment            on the side of his vehicle opens up and a jet fighter-style firing            bracket pops out. A sublime effect, and it varies from character to            character and weapon to weapon.                         It's not just the little touches that compel when it comes to TMB            though; it's the big, blatantly obvious gameplay modes. Players can            select Challenge mode, which is effectively the game's Single Race            option, whilst diehards can opt for Endurance, which comprises an            endless series of opponents coming at you, with only your single            car taking any of them on. If you can find a friend worthy of the            carnage though, you're in for a real treat. We're big multiplayer            fans around here, so we tend to say that a lot, but it's doubly            true of TMB. Apart from the standard split-screen deathmatch mode            for between two and four players, there's a Last Man Standing            option (try to guess how that works) and the cutting edge of the            exercise, two-player split-screen co-operative story mode, with one            set of lives for both players. You may sacrifice a few frames per            second, but on a big screen TV the effect and sheer artistry of the            event takes over.                    Blowing stuff up might get boring after a while if you found            yourself racing around a primary-coloured Mario-esque paradise,            which is why Incognito have kept their heads and introduced us            instead to a manic, dystopian near-future society where the running            theme is darkness. It resembles some of the sets from Blade Runner            at times.                         Using the PlayStation 2 to its fullest, each of the characters'            vehicles is subtly detailed right down to the tiniest moving part,            but this comes at the expense of reasonable damage skins, for which            Incog seem to have opted for the WarCraft II school of thought with            its small-flame-big-flame scheme. Making up for that though is a            motley collection of barren cityscapes in which to 'go at it'. Once            again not settling for the clich\u00e9 though, Incog have worked            their backsides off and produced a stunning variety of levels which            make Carmageddon's offerings look feeble by comparison. Take for            example the Prison Passage level. Players begin in a jail cell of            all places, and before long it emerges that the cell is on a moving            ship, and before you can lay waste to your entourage of metallic            maestros the ship docks and you're given a whole new playground to            decimate.                        Special mention should also be given to the Suburbs level, which is            so incomprehensibly huge I don't think I found everything despite            wasting close to an hour just scouting around. One of the major            aspects of this level is the player's ability to take out a huge            Ferris Wheel, which rolls menacingly into the ocean where it            disappears. And that's another important aspect of TMB; unrivalled            interactivity. You can break everything. From people and vehicles            to buildings and Ferris Wheels, there are a huge number of things            to be broken apart in TMB, and when you send an enemy careering            into something to explosive effect I defy you not to gasp 'cool'!            So apart from anything (and by anything I mean the prevalence of            multi-tiered secret passages and areas, Evil Knievel-choking jumps            and the billion other things that make up a level of TMB) there's            always something to destroy. Pucka.                    Apart from the level design, I think my favourite aspect of TMB is            a tiny thing; the particle effects. Used to illustrate            rocket-propelled grenades roaring through the air and ash            splintering away from a cascading gaseous fireball, they are truly            a spectacle to behold. Besides that, you cannot help but be amazed            at Incognito's ability to gloss over a logistical nightmare. You            try texturing a PS2 game with landscapes as vast as this and create            the same flea-bitten, smouldering effect they have\u2026                         The one thing that might cast doubt on TMB though is the lack of a            60Hz option. This is a wholly bizarre decision on Sony's part, as            our friends across the pond have been shouting from the rooftops            about their oily-smooth framerate for several months now, and given            the delays thrown at TMB (no thanks to September 11th), it's not as            if they didn't have time. Still, finding fault with TMB is            difficult because it's such an awesome, multi-faceted experience of            unparalleled calibre. Even the presentation is mesmerizing. The            character select screen, for instance, has the camera hurtling            around the level to show you the next character, and all of them            appear midway through doing something exquisitely violent. Junkyard            Dog's freeze-frame was taken halfway out of an exploding building,            for instance. Then touched up to look even nicer.                         Although not often a problem faced by racing games these days, it            must have been very tricky scoring the accompaniment to Twisted            Metal : Black, but given the tone of this review so far I'm sure it            will come as little surprise to discover that it rocks. Moody isn't            the word. Refusing to play partisan to the pop-metal revolution of            driving games, we're presented with a collection of epic,            soul-destroying tunes as detailed as the game itself, with legions            of stringed instruments and choristers all over the place. It's            probably an acquired taste as far as casual listening goes, but            it's perfect for the game. And completing the package we have the            sound effects. Crashes, cracks, breaks and brakes. It's all there.            And if you hear that tell-tale horn blowing, you know you've found            yourself in the path of Dollface - the trucker behind the wheel of            Darkside, one of the game's most menacing vehicles.                    Twisted Metal : Black is epic, and comes thoroughly recommended.            I've barely touched on the basics here, but there are countless            hours of entertainment on offer. Don't expect to finish this in a            week, or even a month. If I haven't convinced you by now you            probably hate driving games. Well do me a favour, at least seek out            the demo and find out if I'm right. I don't think you'll regret it.            And the rest of you have probably already skived off work to go            find a copy. It's amazing how quickly people can develop            work-impeding headaches and stomach bugs headaches these            days\u2026"}
