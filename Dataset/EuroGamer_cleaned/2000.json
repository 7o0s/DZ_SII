It's got inventory puzzles, silly humour, exotic locales and a mystery shaping the plot. The one new thing it brings to the table is a\u00a0cast\u00a0modeled\u00a0after\u00a0African sculpture.\u00a0It's refreshing to see - and\u00a0Lord knows we could use more black characters who aren't criminals, athletes or bulky soldiers.Unfortunately, The Journey Down's African theme is poorly integrated; it comes off feeling like an ethnic restaurant where the menu mostly consists of English cuisine. The\u00a0character models are abstract, emotive and visually inspired, but it's impossible to ignore that this is a game made by a bunch of white dudes.\u00a0Though\u00a0their intentions seem pure, there are a few choices\u00a0that don't sit well.\u00a0The two protagonists, Bwana and Kito, are based\u00a0on\u00a0statues from the Chokwe and Makonde tribes of Africa - yet they have\u00a0Jamaican\u00a0accents. Things get dicier when\u00a0African masks are merged with Asian\u00a0characters.\u00a0It\u00a0feels like these aesthetics were\u00a0pasted on to a story that doesn't use them in any meaningful way. The character art suggests a window into an often underrepresented culture, but the reality is that this game could have starred anyone, and the African designs are merely for show.This is\u00a0a\u00a0shame, as\u00a0The Journey Down\u00a0does\u00a0an otherwise\u00a0pretty good job of emulating the best point-and-click adventures from the '90s.\u00a0It gets off to a promising start,\u00a0with a pair of\u00a0down-on-their-luck\u00a0gas station\u00a0attendants\u00a0lamenting their financial woes. When a woman shows up\u00a0offering\u00a0them a healthy sum if they can charter her a flight,\u00a0it's up to our heroes to fix their derelict seaplane by doing what adventure game protagonists do\u00a0best: combining items.\u00a0The Journey Down's puzzles are largely inventory-based, but they usually make sense. There's no point where you need to combine a knife with a block of tofu to make a mask, or use a monkey as a wrench.\u00a0Nor are the puzzles so obvious that you can breeze through them without thinking. Occasionally it falls victim to pixel-hunting, and I could have done with a few more non-inventory puzzles to liven things up, but by and large this is a refined rendition of its archaic influences.This quality carries over into the writing. While rarely hilarious, The Journey Down is often good for a chuckle. Bwana and Kito's constant optimism in spite of their dire straits has plucky charm, and while this introductory episode is filled with lots of exposition, it\u00a0develops an intriguing world with promises of spooky-sounding locales with slick names like ~The Underland~ and ~The Edge~.The striking setting is brought to life through wonderfully evocative\u00a0hand-painted backgrounds. We may not visit the metropolis of St. Armando yet, but it shines brilliantly in the background, establishing a visual\u00a0contrast between the bright bustle of city life with our duo hustling at the harbour. The attic of their shop\u00a0is appropriately moody, as it's laid dormant over the many years their father has been missing, and a ritzy yacht provides a spot of glitz.\u00a0I can't say I'm as fond of the voice-acting. Bwana and Kito are mostly well done, but other characters are can be cringe-inducing stereotypes on a par with the cartoonish\u00a0Letitia from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This wouldn't be so bad if you could turn the voices off, but you can't. The free version doesn't have voice-acting, which I think I prefer.While The Journey Down contains all the elements of a great adventure, the storytelling isn't quite concentrated enough for the\u00a0episode's\u00a0scant length\u00a0of about four hours. After an energetic intro, it quickly devolves into that most familiar of adventure game tropes; solve three tasks before you can set sail.\u00a0\u00a0In form and function,\u00a0this\u00a0recalls the opening chapter of The Secret of Monkey Island, but lacks that game's\u00a0spark. Where Guybrush's tongue-tied first meeting with Elaine instantly summed up who these characters were, Bwana's\u00a0initial encounter with his love interest is rife with noir potential but mostly limits itself to exposition followed by her sitting in a chair saying, ~Let me know when you're ready.~ The villains are equally\u00a0underdeveloped, and all I know about them is\u00a0that they're\u00a0looking for a book and their head honcho sits behind a desk on\u00a0what appears to be a set from Blade Runner.\u00a0You might not go into The Journey Down expecting an anthropology lesson, but it would be nice if it sparked the same sort of enthusiasm for the culture it's\u00a0aping that Grim Fandango did with its\u00a0Mexican heritage. Despite this, it's a solid adventure game with\u00a0high production values and sharp design. There's a courageous allure to an indie team trying to stand toe-to-toe with LucasArts' masterpieces, and that they've come this close with their first entry in the genre is no minor accomplishment. Here's hoping the next chapter gives has a little more African flavour."}
