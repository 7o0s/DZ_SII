What's the use of a racing            game with a plot, when presumably all the player wants to do is            drive the fugging cars? When TOCA Race Driver appeared on            PlayStation 2 last year, we were of mixed opinion as to whether or            not the plot idea worked. Some eight months later, PC TOCA fans            finally have the chance to get their hands on it. Does it live up            to their and our expectations?        The plot isn't exactly the deepest or most emotive tale we've            encountered, and borrows from racing movies gone by here and there,            following the career path of young Ryan McKane, who is attempting            to follow in the footsteps of his older brother and late father,            the racetrack death of whom Ryan witnessed as a lad.                    Ryan, however, is a bitter fellow. Not in the sense that he's out            for vengeance as such, we just think he's a bit of a prat. I mean,            our mate Ryo in Shenmue witnessed his own father's death and is out            for revenge, and although he's not a lad of many words at least            he's got time to play some OutRun and look after kittens. C'mon            Ryan, don't be such a stick-in-the-mud.                    There's even a love interest for our man, albeit one that walks            like a penguin, and a far more likeable arch nemesis with a nice            goatee and a gruff British accent (because the bad guys are always            British, right?). All the while, the press is patronising Ryan's            talents as a driver, and so his need to prove himself as his own            man starts to become his number one priority.                    The various cut scenes that advance the story are interspersed            between races, and cleverly differ according to your performance in            the current championship. The actors are very well animated and            voiced for the most part, apart from the aforementioned lovely            lady's waddling problem, and are presented in their own little            real-time 3D engine. The actor models themselves look a little            rough at times, and we'd even go so far as to say mildly            psychotic-looking, but they're passable.        On one hand, the plot idea could serve as a minor irritation to            some, and on the other it lends the series - and to a lesser extent            the genre - a refreshing new direction. It certainly makes the game            unique if nothing else. The fact that your virtual representation            in the game is a petulant idiot with the attitude problems of a            schoolboy really doesn't help matters much though, and coupled with            the floundering and rather disappointing visual presentation on            PS2, TOCA Race Driver felt slightly under whelming.                    The main coup of the PC version over the PS2, however, is that it            that the on-track visuals have been given a massive overhaul. This            is no example of cheap porting - the higher resolution that PC            hardware affords is only the basis of a wealth of improvements in            the engine: car models remain detailed regardless of distance;            textures are sharp and beautifully rendered; convincing lighting            and reflective effects bathe the cars and environment, even the            tarmac, in realism; the employment of motion blur dramatically            helps to enforce a sense of speed; and most importantly of all,            there's a huge boost in framerate as the engine slings the action            round at an occasionally frightening pace.                    It feels as if the game really has come into its own here, the            racing becoming all the more compelling thanks to mere improvements            in the engine. Sadly, though, areas where the original tripped up            stand out all the more. While the cars handle well for the most            part, the physics can be inexplicably quirky at times and sometimes            just downright unrealistic, particularly when things get a little            hairy and cars lift off the ground, which is ridiculously rare. A            car that takes off seems to glide through the air, land, and skim            across the surface of the track without rolling or pirouetting or            doing anything you'd expect it to. With the game capable of            some enormous speeds, it's disappointing that decent crash physics            are absent. Burnout this ain't.        Your overall aim is, of course, to prove Ryan's worth by            becoming the World Champion. You achieve this by advancing through            a couple of competition tiers before advancing to the final Lola            world circuit challenge. The game starts off simply enough on a            dash round Brands Hatch to earn your stripes, and then a jaunt in            TOCA itself. Once that's out of the way, you have a choice of other            competitions to take part in as part of your tier, where your            successes determine how quickly you will rack up tier points.                    Invitations to come and drive for the various teams in various            competitions arrive for you by e-mail on your office computer. Each            team offers various cash bonuses in return for impressive            performance, and once you've found a deal that takes your fancy,            you can immediately set off on the tour of your choice. At the end            of the tour, the points you've earned are added to your cumulative            total for that tier. Once you've earned enough points, you move up            a tier. Additionally, opportunities to drive in single race            exhibition events will occasionally land in your inbox, and offer            the chance to gain points quickly and easily without getting            involved in an entire competition.                    The whole approach and progression lends an appealingly comfortable            and almost arcade-like feel to the game. The simulation side only            really rears its head in the form of the car tuning screens            available, but not essential, before each race. Your mechanic can            offer a little advice on where the car might need some tweaking for            the particular circuit you're about to drive on, and thankfully the            game doesn't get bogged down with stats and charts - tweaking            things to get the feel of the car just right can become a small            sideline distraction in itself.                    There are faults, of course. Mainly, the physics really could have            done with some more attention, the damage modelling could have been            put together slightly more convincingly, and the lack of rear and            side-view mirror reflections is quite baffling - instead you can            either keep flicking to a rear view camera, or pay attention to the            little red warning arrow that lets you know where the guy behind            is. Also, the cardboard cutout crowd really looks ridiculous            alongside the otherwise tremendous graphics. But issues like these            are mostly insignificant, only coming to light after heavy play,            and thankfully not immediately irritating.                    It's surprising just how fresh TOCA Race Driver feels, and we're            quite taken aback at just how compelling the game can be. The races            are usually exciting enough to keep you pushing through the            championships and tiers, and the story is rather silly but all the            more amusing for it. At least it distracts from the mind numbing            habit of bounding from race to menu to race, like so many games of            its ilk.                    A brave effort from Codemasters, then, and one that pays off for            the most part. With a little more work on what's been achieved            here, a sequel could stand out all the more."}
