Sure enough, a Terran ship strays into            the middle of a civil war and gets run over by a big honking alien            battleship in pursuit of a rebel leader, at which point all hell            breaks loose. You are sent to find out what happened to the missing            ship, but before you know it your simple rescue mission has turned            into a five way war between humanity and rival factions from two            alien races.                        Unlike most real-time strategy games Conquest takes place in space            rather than on the ground, although in contrast to Homeworld and            FarGate it sticks resolutely to two dimensions and a traditional            overhead view of the action. This is a little disappointing at            first, but it does make the game easier to get to grips with and            means that you can focus on actual strategy instead of struggling            with rotating camera views.                        The other problem with space is that it is, by definition, big and            empty. Conquest solves this by restricting the game to relatively            small circular maps linked by wormholes which act as chokepoints.            Initially you only have two or three solar systems to worry about,            but the further into the game you get the more maps you will have            to fight over. By the end of the campaign battles may rage across a            dozen systems, interlinked by a maze of wormholes.                    Space is somewhat more interesting in Conquest than real life, with            nebulae, asteroid fields, planets and impassable anti-matter            ribbons scattered across the maps. These are intended to replace            the hills and rivers found in ground-based strategy games, but            don't do the job very well.                        Asteroid fields slow down ships as they navigate the area, while            nebulae come in a variety of colours, each with its own effects.            These range from slowing down or speeding up movement to            interfering with shields or increasing the damage taken from            weapons fire, but in most cases the effects are too slight to have            any noticeable effect on the game. Stationing ships in a red nebula            which gradually eats away at their hulls is obviously not a good            idea, but it takes so long for the gas to cause any serious amount            of damage that simply passing through a patch doesn't really hurt            you.                        The AI doesn't seem to understand the effects of the nebulae            either, quite happily wandering into a blue shield-depleting gas            cloud in the middle of a battle or trying to cross a system by            travelling through a vast green nebula that slows them down. This            is particularly clear in the pathfinding of your own units, which            always take the shortest route instead of the quickest or safest,            ignoring any nebulae or asteroid fields completely.                    The ineffectiveness of the ~terrain~ blows the game wide open.            Apart from the rare anti-matter barriers the only real bottlenecks            which you can defend are the wormholes, and so battles tend to            focus around these. Once the enemy gets into one of your systems            it's hard to do anything about it apart from chasing them futilely            around the map while desperately trying to plug the hole and stop            any more units from getting in.                        If the enemy does break through into your territory, they will            probably make a bee-line for the nearest planet. Planets are the            only place you can build base structures, and depending on their            class they can also provide some or all of the game's three            resources once the appropriate buildings are in place. Everything            from unit production facilities and resource gathering refineries            to a wide range of specialized research labs can be built around            the planets, although there is limited space on each. This forces            you to keep expanding, seeking out strange new worlds to pillage            and turn into ad hoc military camps.                        Planets also act as forward supply bases, because in Conquest your            ships actually consume ammunition. It usually takes a few minutes            for them to run out, but once they do they are helpless until they            come within range of a supply base or ship. These support ships            must dock with a base to restock eventually, and supply and repair            bases only work if there are friendly jump gates linking the map            they are in to your home system. This means that you can greatly            weaken the enemy by knocking out his supply lines, which makes            defending wormholes even more important. A few ships can take out a            supply base or jump gate if they can get past your fleet, and            there's not much you can do to stop them.                    It doesn't help that you have a limited fleet at your disposal.            Throughout the campaign you can only have a maximum of one hundred            command points worth of ships under your control, and every combat            ship uses up at least two of these. Throw in a few support vessels,            miners and construction ships and you can have perhaps thirty or            forty warships. While this makes for more tactical battles and            averts the tank rushing seen in most real-time strategy games, it            does mean that your forces are spread fairly thin. You simply can't            spare enough ships to defend your bases and jump gates if you are            trying to hold down a couple of wormholes and invade an enemy            sector.                        The multiplayer and quick battle modes do allow you to increase the            command point cap to two hundred, but even this is fairly low if            you are fighting up to seven AI or human opponents across sixteen            systems. Luckily you can split up into teams if you want to have a            more epic battle, and the addition of hero characters allows you to            delegate control of fleets to the computer, leaving a group of            ships to mop up stragglers with a ~seek and destroy~ command while            you focus on another part of the conflict. Bizarrely in the main            campaign this isn't possible though, and heroes simply exist to get            themselves killed, leading to a game over screen and much            frustration.                        The AI needs all the help it can get though. It does a solid job in            the single player campaign thanks to having a stronger starting            position than you in most of the fifteen missions, but when faced            with a level playing field it tends to be a bit of a push-over.            It's telling that changing the difficulty level in quick battle            mode simply changes the number of enemy leaders that are ganged up            against you.                        After four years in development then, Conquest is a bit of a mixed            bag. The supply system adds a new dimension to the game, but            because the nebulae and asteroid fields aren't effective enough to            be worth avoiding the game becomes a series of do-or-die battles            over jump gates. While this is entertaining enough for a while, you            can't help but think that it could have been much more involving.                        -        The                    Death Of The Celebrity StudioThe                    Death Of The Celebrity StudioFarGate                    reviewFarGate                    reviewHomeworld                    Cataclysm reviewHomeworld                    Cataclysm review"}
