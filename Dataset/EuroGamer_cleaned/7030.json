But although his tough unflinching            approach has often led to criticism, his most controversial film is            undoubtedly ~The Last Temptation Of Christ~, an adaptation of the            book of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis.                    Attacked by many fundamentalist Christians because of its at times            graphic content and the portrayal of Jesus as man rather than            messiah, it is in fact a deeply spiritual and incredibly moving            look at the life of Christ, which is thought provoking and highly            entertaining even for non-believers such as myself, a devout            atheist for the last fifteen years.                    Willem Dafoe plays Jesus, a confused young man plagued by            uncertainty and self-doubt; he is a man who suffers from fainting            spells, blinding headaches and bizarre visions, who hears voices.            The voice is of course God's, although Jesus is unsure even of that            at the beginning. ~If it's the devil, the devil can be cast out~,            his mother tells him. ~But what if it's God?~, replies Jesus. ~You            can't cast out God can you?~                    At times the pain and the voices become too much, and all he wants            is for God to pick somebody else. ~God loves me, I know he loves            me. I want him to stop. I fight him, I make crosses so that he will            hate me.~                    It is only after being purified in the desert that he begins to            accept the role that God has chosen for him, and here he is joined            by his friend Judas, played bizarrely enough by Harvey Keitel. Sent            to kill Jesus by the Zealots for collaborating with the Romans,            Judas instead decides to take a chance and join him, becoming the            first and most faithful of his disciples.                    From here on the film moves quickly, taking in some of the most            famous acts recorded in the New Testament along the way. Jesus            gives his sermon on the mount, meets John the Baptist, faces            temptation in the desert, raises Lazarus from the dead, casts out            demons from the insane, and cures the blind. But the focus is less            on the miracles and more on the man behind them, Jesus himself and            his continuing uncertainty and fears.                    God only reveals his plan to Jesus a little at a time, and speaks            through him in parables. At first he tells the people to love one            another, but eventually he finds himself at the head of a mob about            to burn down the great temple in Jerusalem, facing the Roman            garrison there. His words are misinterpreted or simply ignored; in            one memorable scene he tells the people that the meek will inherit            the Earth while the rich become hungry, only for the crowd to run            off taking his words as a call for revolution, screaming ~kill the            rich~. Being the messiah is not easy, although it is better than            what fate has in store for Judas, who finds himself being asked to            betray his closest friend. As Jesus says, ~God gave me the easier            job, to be crucified...~                    As with most of Scorsese's movies, the direction is impeccable and            the whole thing simply oozes style, from the long shots of Jesus            and his growing band of followers marching across the desert hills            to the slow motion sequence of the possessed streaming out of holes            in the parched ground as Jesus comes to cast out their demons. The            only time things seem to get bogged down a little is during the            last temptation itself, but overall the pacing is near perfect.                    The film is accompanied throughout by Peter Gabriel's inspirational            score, mixing haunting drones and the incredible voice of Islamic            devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with pounding ethnic beats            and traditional instruments of the Middle East and North Africa.            The music matches the mood of the film perfectly, and in scenes            such as the march on the temple and the journey to the cross it            helps to lift the whole thing to a higher level. Silence is used            equally effectively in places, such as the wailing crowds on the            banks of the River Jordan fading out as Jesus faces John The            Baptist for the first time, or in the crucifixion scene as the            ~angel~ comes to Jesus on the cross.                    Meanwhile the impressive cast of actors all put in solid            performances, from Dafoe's insecure and tortured Jesus and Keitel's            passionate Judas through to Barbara Hershey as the whore Mary            Magdalene and Victor Argo as an inconstant Peter, with David Bowie            appearing in a surprising cameo as the Roman governor Pontius            Pilate.                    The disc itself lives up to the standards of the Criterion            Collection, with a new high quality Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack,            and a solid if slightly grainy widescreen transfer presented at the            original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.                    The menus give you access to a whole range of extra features,            including an excellent audio commentary track featuring Willem            Dafoe and Martin Scorsese, as well as co-writers Paul Schrader and            Jay Cocks. It's well worth watching the film through a second time            with the commentary to get more of an incite into the making of the            movie and what Scorsese and company were trying to achieve. Also            provided is an interesting feature on the movie's soundtrack,            including a short interview with Peter Gabriel and a gallery of            photographs of some of the instruments and musicians involved in            the production.                    Apart from that there are large collections of design sketches and            stills, illustrating everything from costume design to the research            that Scorsese did to make sure that the settings and characters            were as authentic to the period as possible. Finally there is a            home video shot by Scorsese during the making of the movie, which            starts off slowly but includes some amusing behind-the-scenes            sequences of the actors goofing about, as well as shots of the film            crew at work.                    All in all a great disc of a great movie, packed with fascinating            extra features. Sadly it comes with a price tag to match, but it's            worth every dime - The Last Temptation might not be the most            conventional adaptation of the life of Christ, but it's certainly            by far the best.
