He's gotta catch 'em all, apparently. We were never particularly caught up in the Pok\u00e9mon ~phenomenon~ before now. In fact, it would be fair to say that it passed us by almost entirely over the last six years, but with the franchise's GBA debut we figured it was about time we got our Pok\u00e9m-on. Ahaha.The nondescript little chap is in fact you - whatever name you decide on, anyway - and you have just moved into a new town full of new faces. Thanks to forging a slightly dubious friendship with the local professor's Pok\u00e9mon-mad daughter, and with the encouragement of your mother, you quickly develop a newfound interest in man's pursuit to fill his Pok\u00e9dex. Egged on by the professor when you pay him a visit, he hands you your first Pok\u00e9mon and you set off on a journey of fame and fortune. Well, you know, what else are you going to do?From here it's all familiar territory, even to us. You wander along roads and explore small towns, speaking to random people who have little in the way of conversation other than to give you short hints on the subtleties of Pok\u00e9mon training, and getting into random battles with wild Pok\u00e9mon when you wander through the patches of long grass that they inhabit.A Pok\u00e9mon battle is typical of simple turn-based RPG combat, with the player and the CPU (or indeed other players via link cable) taking it in turns to pick their particular attack or defence move, usually with a little hint of paper-scissors-stone strategy as you fathom your adversary's weaknesses. A Pok\u00e9mon with grass attacks, for example, will sap a rock creature's defences quite easily, and fire-based creatures naturally a walkover for those with water attacks. Once you've significantly weakened a wild Pok\u00e9mon in battle - which is decidedly easy right from the off and will only get easier as your primary critter soon becomes unstoppable - you can whip out your balls [fourth paragraph, I win fifty quid -Tom] [damn -Ed] and attempt to bag it for your own personal use, eventually training up a powerful, unstoppable army of the critters.You can only carry around six Pok\u00e9mon storage balls in your backpack, each containing one Pok\u00e9mon, but officially there are hundreds of the little scamps including 100 new cast members. Cunningly, Nintendo has spread a handful of the new creatures across both Ruby and Sapphire versions, so to truly catch 'em all you're going to need to either trade with a pal or buy two copies of the game, which are otherwise practically identical. We suppose it depends if you're actually masochistic enough to put yourself through that. Anyway, you're able to store additional Pok\u00e9mon in a PC-based storage system, accessible at the various Pok\u00e9mon Centres spread around the world in each town. It's also at these centres that you're able to recharge your Pok\u00e9mon after a particularly strenuous scrap.The berries that you'll come across during the early stages of your journey form the main diversion. You can use the berries to give your Pok\u00e9mon small energy boosts or other quick bonuses during a fight, but they can also be fed into a blender to form Pok\u00e9bloks via a little rhythm-action game, which you play with the CPU or via link play. Pok\u00e9bloks are candy that improves elements of your Pok\u00e9mon's personality. What's the use of this? Pok\u00e9mon Crufts, basically - you can enter your chosen Pok\u00e9mon into a show to exhibit their moves and personality.Elsewhere there are bicycle races and a collection of bizarre little mini-games. Oh, there's the side story of course, which interferes with your quest occasionally and has to do with the irritating Team Aqua/Magma (the moniker depends on your version of the game) attempting to fiddle about with Hoenn's ecology.Your overall goal though is to defeat the eight Gym Leaders of Hoenn, then face off against the Elite four Pok\u00e9mon trainers, and finally the Pok\u00e9mon Champion himself. You'll spend the game getting into as many fights as possible in order to level up your pocket monsters and facing them off against the best of the best, and it's during the admittedly quite compelling journey up to the higher echelons that you come to one startling realisation - this is almost exactly the same as every other Pok\u00e9mon game. The graphics are updated to a functional level at best, and the gameplay mechanic is barely developed with the occasional two-on-two battle the only real addition to the fights. Some may argue this as beneficial because, after all, if it ain't broke... But really, the differences are slight and form a sugar coating - sprinkled across the same old core game.Hardcore Pok\u00e9fetishists are actually probably used to more of the same these days, and they'll gobble this up regardless. However, we can't help but imagine widespread disappointment at the lack of gameplay development and the game's inability to push the GBA even slightly. Apart from the occasional tense battle with a Gym Leader and the more sophisticated opponents later on in the game, the constant fighting and collecting mechanic gets very tired, very fast.Pok\u00e9mon Ruby/Sapphire isn't without its charm, and for those in it for a cheerful little adventure with little in the way of challenge can't go far wrong. Just don't blame us when you start wondering what all the fuss is about."}
