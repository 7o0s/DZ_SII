Games that are more gloss than substance and only            serve to show off the graphical capabilities of the console. Like            Fantavision, although admittedly that does offer some traces of            entertainment. Thankfully Silpheed is not only good looking, but            also enjoyable, and with a degree of replayability that can be            harnessed to extend the life of the game further than one would            expect of a 2D shooter. More than a trip down memory lane or a            gimmick shooter, it's an example of how innovation has grown within            the confines of the genre.                         Once you get past the fact that Silpheed sounds like some sort of            sexually transmitted disease, it's actually a surprisingly good 2D            shoot 'em up. It's been put together quite quickly, but that            doesn't seem to hurt it any; if anything it does a better job than            Gigawing, last year's flash in the pan Dreamcast shoot 'em up            success.                         The basic concept, as if you hadn't figured it out, is to progress            up the screen shooting the bad guys. They tend to originate at the            top, whereas you start life on the bottom. Unlike Space Invaders            though, Silpheed does it with a bit of sparkle. You're always            heading up, but up isn't always up, if you see what I mean. The            last game I recall that did this properly was Silvergun. The level            design is pretty exciting in this respect, although a little            nauseating at times, particularly on a big-screen TV.                    The bosses and general enemies are a bit humdrum and unexciting for            their part, although there are a couple that are worth persevering            to see. You'll need some mad skills to get to them though, let            alone past them, even though a number of them seem to behave like            seven-year-old cricket batsmen protecting the stumps from a mile            out.                         Difficulty on the whole is just the wrong side of easy. There is            no ~Easy~ option, just Normal and Hard, although that's more            psychological than anything. Personally I'd have called them Normal            and Fiendish, though. The number of Continues is pretty much            unlimited, although it's back to the beginning of the level with            you in the event that you come a cropper.                         The end sequence of the game is fairly unadventurous, and you do            complete it relatively quickly thanks to the continues, but there's            a lot more to the game than simply repeating the same sections            until you know them off by heart. You actually learn the patterns            of certain enemies and how to react as they enter your field of            vision. Your general skill level increases with each level, and            this helps you achieve a higher score. The scoring system gives you            more credit for kills the closer you are to the victim, multiplying            your score by a certain factor depending on proximity. You run the            risk of getting killed more quickly, but there is an element of            one-more-go-ism there, certainly enough to enhance the replay value            of the game.                    Many people think ~2D~ and imagine Mario, or Sonic, or another game            where the sprites are basically painted onto a brightly coloured            background and the camera scrolls along in Mode 7 or similar.            Silpheed's backgrounds aren't just bright, they're lively, and the            camera doesn't just pan along, it sweeps by the action, catching            the heaving lava flow and rolling layered fog as your little ship            cruises by.                         The explosions are rendered beautifully, although the carnage does            slow down the PlayStation 2 on a couple of occasions.                         The gameplay is punctuated by cinematics, lifted directly from the            Japanese version, which far from amusing, demonstrate Game Arts'            superb ability to speak English! Correct grammatical pronunciation            may not be quite as common as South American drawl in action            titles, but it's surprisingly effective when yelled across the            tactical voice network and in general story-telling. The cinematics            weren't done in-house according to the manual, but no mention is            given to the authors.                         Complementing the cinematics and the gameplay is quite an            excellent orchestral soundtrack. Gigawing's sequel threatens us            with an entirely original score and orchestral overtones, but it            looks like Silpheed beat it to the punch.                         Visually, aurally, and in terms of gameplay, Silpheed is an            exemplary 2D shoot 'em up, and it does its best to disguise that            fact, too. There are still things that could have done with work -            the slowdown is particularly annoying when it occurs - but            generally speaking it's an excellent, by the numbers shooter, and            superb entertainment, without a gimmick in sight."}
