I            never did, I just played them, but Infogrames evidently don't            subscribe to the school of forgettable storylines - instead they've            practically written a book about Slave Zero!                         Megacity lives atop a ruined Beijing, 500 years into the future,            and is made up of ~decks~, the lower ones being the residential            areas, the middle ones being military in focus and there are plenty            of other areas, including laboratories and sewers, all of which            you'll see during the game.                         The game is based around a mission structure, of which there are            15, set all over the city. You're guided by a ~controller~, who            explains to you what's to be done and such.                         Controlling your mech in the PC version would be very simple            indeed, using the time-honoured (and now well-established)            combination of mouse and keyboard. On the Dreamcast that sort of            combo is of course feasible with the right peripherals, but the            mouse doesn't yet exist and Slave Zero doesn't support the keyboard            anyway. The controller must therefore be used to handle the game,            and it must be said that it's a smidgeon less than intuitive,            especially for perpetual first person gamers.                         Thankfully a little perseverance soon gets you going and the game            is easy enough after a while.         Despite Slave Zero's abundant                 flaws (of which more later) the presentation is very special -                 Infogrames have clearly spent a lot of time putting the game                 together and sorting out the presentation. It all looks very                 nice indeed, with the occasional quality cutscenes keeping you                 entertained. General mission instructions are provided by the                 ~controller~, over an authentically crackly radio, which                 splutters to life from time to time, barking orders for the                 mission.                         The cutscenes actually fit in very well with the in-game action.            One such example of this is when you encounter a boss character. At            first the intercom squawks at you about a ~massive hostile~ heading            your way. A bit further on you leap into another street and a            cutscene smoothly kicks in and shows the boss landing in front of            you. Then you fight him - the atmosphere is very tense and            genuinely exciting, because you're never sure quite what visual            device will be employed next, nor what challenge is just around the            corner.         It's very impressive how                 Infogrames have managed to pull off the sense of scale within                 Slave Zero, too. You do feel as though you're a towering                 mechanoid, far more so than in other games. In Shogo-MAD on                 the PC, for example, the scale was a bit, well, dodgy. But in                 Slave Zero, there are cars that race around about your feet                 (and can be picked up and launched at enemies as a cunning                 offensive manoeuvre!), and buildings that really do resemble                 buildings, which sprawl in a murky suburban fashion as you                 wonder through the streets.                         The city feels real enough, but the in-game visuals are distinctly            average from time to time. For example, the textures look rather            more like N64 Quake than a high-end Dreamcast title. I was            disappointed that Infogrames didn't push the system to its maximum            capabilities, considering the amount of time they had to develop            the game. A big disappointment.                         Nonetheless, Slave Zero's graphics do suit the mood of the game.            The Western Judge Dredd and Blade Runner have quite clearly            inspired it, rather than the Cyberpunk Manga tales of Japan that            Shogo thrived upon. There are traces of Japanese anime to be found,            but it's no Ghost in the Shell.                    Slave Zero's biggest major downside is that it is bug-ridden, a            totally unforgivable malady on a console. On the PC they can            probably patch some of the issues, but with a console title, the            same is not true. For instance, you see a lot of slowdown as you            play, even more so that on low-end PCs running the game.                         As with Tomb Raider and the like, playing from the third person            perspective (which is an option available to you), can get irksome            if you're stuck in a tight corner. The key is then of course to            move to the first person view, but not everyone will be willing to            do this. Sometimes the game does this for no apparent reason            though, which is kind of frustrating. It should at least let you            make your mind up for yourself!         Difficulty is the thing that most                 bugs Slave Zero - the game is terribly hard to play, even on                 the lowest skill settings. It's the wrong side of challenging,                 to be frank, and I got very bored of its difficulty, very                 quickly.                         The game is made up of a lot of interesting factors, and for the            most part it impresses, with some neat presentation and an            enjoyable plot. It makes for an interesting and not altogether            unplayable game. I would certainly pay good money for it if I            didn't own a PC. But the thing is, if you own a PC, you can buy the            PC version, download a patch, and be rid of all the irks and bugs            that console owners have to put up with. And it's unacceptable for            us to have to put up with any bugs at all, so the game is            always going to be a problem child in that respect.                         Should you buy Slave Zero? If you're a console owner whose PC            simply can't handle modern day shooters, then yes, definitely give            it a go, but if you're a PC owner, you're spoilt for choice with            the likes of Quake3: Arena, Unreal Tournament and indeed Slave            Zero, which is a fiver cheaper on the PC than on the Dreamcast.                    If you're a PC owner, then you probably shouldn't bother with Slave            Zero on the Dremacast. If you're a Dreamcast owner who has been            waiting and waiting for first person shooters to come to the            system, give it a try, but don't be too upset if it doesn't get all            your dogs barking.                         To be honest, you might be best to wait for another first person            shooter to get converted to the Dreamcast. That said, the game is            enjoyable to a point, and I wouldn't say that it's a bad game on            the whole, just a good game with negative points.                         Still, on a system like the Dreamcast, you shouldn't have to put            up with mediocrity.                        - Out Now"}
