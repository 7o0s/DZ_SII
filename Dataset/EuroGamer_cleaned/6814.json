The problem is, despite the more advanced LithTech engine in            use here, the game still feels and looks like nothing more than a            Half-Life mod.                        It probably seemed a good idea at the time, using Nakatomi Plaza            and the events of Die Hard as the basis of a gritty            lone-gunman-against-the-terrorists first person shooter. The game's            plot follows that of the film quite closely, as you take on the            role of NYPD officer John McClane, alone with a band of terrorists            in the 40 storey Nakatomi Plaza after going to visit his estranged            wife at her office's Christmas party.                        The game attempts to recreate most of the notable scenes from the            movie, while adding a few more of their own utilising a little            artistic license. Unfortunately these boil down to variations on            the bog-standard first-person shooter staples of yore. Take the            sewer level for instance, one of the first indications that the            development team begin to flounder for ideas once they get beyond            the recreation of action scenes from the film. The level design            here is particularly mediocre, and I was running about the same            areas over and over again without a clue of what to do. This is in            fact where the majority of Nakatomi Plaza's problems stem from -            the utter lack of direction. There is an objectives screen of sorts            which you can bring up during the level, but you're never notified            when this is updated.                    Your progress is mostly dictated by running headlong through            strictly linear level design, as opposed to clever stealth            assaults. The scenery is almost completely lacking in            interactivity, and the only offensive tool you ever really need is            your MP5 machine gun.                        The terrorist threat is never very real either, and you don't come            up against any particularly formidable foes. Enemies usually            respond to your presence by shouting a bit and then running behind            the nearest solid object until you come and get them. They don't            cover each other, they don't attempt to form an assault on your            position, and they don't try to flush you out with grenades. This            is truly action gaming out of the Ark.                        The occasional mid-level bosses (or at least I think they're            supposed to be bosses) are as braindead as the rest of the            shambling cast, and so you can usually resort to hiding behind a            crate and popping up every so often to fire off shots until they're            dead. Then there's the constant threat from SWAT officers, who            think you're one of the terrorists, despite the fact that McClane            has an NYPD badge and ID he can show to them.                    I wasn't joking when I said the only tool you need is your MP5, by            the way. It's not like you have much choice though, as there are            only about five different weapons in the entire game and you rarely            get to use those. Come across the Steyr Aug, for example, and then            try and find some ammo for it. That's right, you can't, and the            same goes for the others.                         And we haven't even touched on the use of the moderately powerful            LithTech engine yet. Unfortunately, this is pretty bad news as            well; the palette usually makes use of a dull mix of greys smudged            across horrific low-resolution textures, which themselves are            wrapped around some of the boxiest scenery we've seen since the            first Quake. The character models don't fare much better either,            looking and moving like wooden puppets with facial animations that            are verging on comical. Just when you think things can't get any            worse, you witness the team's attempt at special effects - never            before has a fire effect in an action game made me physically            laugh.                         Sound is perhaps the game's strongest area, but even this isn't            without its faults. The guns sound suitably realistic and the            acting of the Bruce Willis (McClane) and Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber)            impersonators sometimes rises above average. However, the rest of            the German accents exhibited by the terrorists are a joke, and            probably offensive to any German players. The (ahem) atmosphere is            permeated by unobtrusive backing tracks which, while not            extraordinary, fit in with the action quite well.                    Despite ending up with a poor take on the bog standard shooter            formula, the team have at least tried a few deviations from the            theme. For example, McClane's HUD has meters not just for physical            health, but also morale and stamina.                        Stamina works much like the function in the Half-Life mod Day of            Defeat, where too much exertion from running and jumping causes            your player to slow and become tired. This helps to force you into            thinking a little more strategically about your approach, but the            terrorists are such a limited threat that it isn't much of a worry.            Morale supposedly affects how hostages and terrorists react to your            presence, but I never really managed to discern any marked            difference.                         Die Hard : Nakatomi Plaza could have been a great game, had            it been given the attention it deserves by the right people.            Unfortunately this just stinks of a cash-in without any            consideration of how to make a decent game out of the license. The            whole affair is cheap and the production values are so woefully            substandard it's a wonder it was ever released at all. There is a            small amount of pleasure to be had amongst this disaster, but not            enough to recommend you spend any money on it."}
