Even though they'remerely little glass balls with a pastel swirl running through themiddle, marbles have been a cheap way to keep kids out of troublefor generations.They'll undoubtedly outlive the DS and PSP. They'll onlyfall out of favour when man leaves the earth and moves intoweightless space - until then, they're in a league of their own.3D Marble Madness has something of this timeless quality,playing like an old-fashioned board game. The aim is to roll amarble down an obstacle course without it falling off the edge,avoiding hazards and maneuvering across precipices. You'll alsofind pipes that go to random locations and marble-eating blobs verynasty blighters indeed.The control is straightforward. You use the direction keys toset you off in the direction you wish to go and the marble startsrolling. The longer you hold down the button, the faster it goes.It's a simple method, but it offers enough flexibility to movearound the course with relative ease.Having said that, slowing down can prove tricky. It feels a bitlike running uncontrollably down a hill, then looking ridiculous asyou haplessly attempt to stop yourself without tumbling in a tangleof arms, legs and turf.Marble Madness' visuals stay true to the sourcematerial's roots, with fairly simple backgrounds, colours andanimations. The board is presented as a flattened representation ofa three-dimensional gaming area, which makes the perspective alittle hard to judge at times. As for the marble, its size andposition in relation to obstacles can also be a littleconfusing.There's no denying though that as the levels progress, thedesign and originality of the courses is increasingly impressive.With elaborate arrangements and multiple routes to take, MarbleMadness has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, which it onlyreveals as you roll deeper and deeper in.Another plus point is the opportunity to link up with a friendvia Bluetooth, so you can race around a course to the finish line.This turns the humble schoolyard sport into a completely differentexperience, and makes for a fun multiplayer game.3D Marble Madness isn't perfect, mainly due to theawkward nature of the game on such a small device. But it does havemuch to offer the average pocket gamer. It might be frustrating attimes it may even, dare we say it, cause you to lose your marbles.But if so, it's only doing its job as addictive mobileentertainment."}
