Although the name            was remarkable enough to commit to memory though, the game itself            wasn't, and I'd long since forgotten the adventures of Emerald            Flint and the Biont threat. Within minutes of firing up Aquanox            though, if you'll excuse the pun, it all came flooding back. The            premise is that Flint's post-apocalyptic Earth has long-since            driven humankind to the depths of the world's oceans, and that the            Bionts - a mysterious race of hive-like cyborgs - are now poised to            overthrow what little resistance remains beneath the surface.                         This time around the Bionts are gone, making way for a new enemy.            An orbiting satellite has caused seismic disturbances and something            has awoken in the murky depths. The story unfolds at a leisurely            pace from hereon in, told in the gaps between missions and            occasionally during them. The characters Flint meets on his            adventure also help to twist events. It's easy enough to become            immersed, especially if you take on the task of wading through the            surprisingly large manual, which is packed chock-full of background            information on the world, its inhabitants and its technology.                         This magnificent fantasy adventure is carried by the game's            visuals, which are nothing short of extraordinary. Finally offering            something to give my GeForce 3 a challenge, the game uses            environmental bump mapping and gorgeous particle effects to breathe            life into Flint's world. Texturing is at a constant high standard,            although a curious in-game V-sync option should certainly be            disabled by default. The overwhelming level of detail is maintained            throughout with some beautiful ship, character and architectural            designs realized in a way that Archimedean's designers probably            thought would never happen\u2026                    On the flipside though, Aquanox suffers from a number of issues            which condemn the game to a barely respectable score. This game            could have been awesome, but instead it merely serves to remind us            that the PC software industry still rushes games to market in            whatever state they can muster. Let's begin with Aquanox' system            requirements. I'm not complaining about the frankly monstrous            pre-requisite of a GeForce 3 to truly enjoy the game, nor the 800Mb            footprint. Equally, I'm not especially bothered about the minimum            128Mb RAM requirement; the average PC spec has risen lately.                         But that fact also conspires to smite Aquanox, as the game doesn't            support Windows XP. I happen to use Windows XP. After a few days of            constant crashes and being dumped back to the desktop, the            progressively more frustrating realisation that this game needs an            older operating system led to my installing Windows 2000. This            copes with Aquanox better than XP did, managing to avoid randomly            dropping my session to the desktop within seconds of load-up, but I            still recorded two similar crashes.                        I suppose that's average these days and I should count my            blessings. With the exception of these problems, the game was            actually extremely stable. But it's still rather annoying - my XP            setup easily handles every game I throw at it, other than Aquanox.                    Other issues include an unfortunate soundtrack of German techno.            Get it away from me! I have trouble with techno at the best of            times and after a four-hour trip across the German countryside            listening to soul-destroying techno music on the radio one summer            during my childhood, I'm one of the least likely people in the            world to enjoy this game's soundtrack. That said, tarnished though            the game is by its unfortunate music, its array of sound effects is            much worse - there's virtually nothing here that fits the            underwater setting. I could barely find anything that struck me as            a water effect, and the 3D surround sound support almost seems like            adding insult to injury.                         Gameplay also falls short of expectations. Aquanox is an            individual and team-based game of underwater combat, with an first            person shooter style control system that threatens to drive you            insane with its ridiculous yawing all over the place and twitchy            responsiveness. Your ship can move forwards much faster than it can            in any other direction, and the same is true of enemy vessels. This            makes dog-fighting extremely difficult to master because you always            seem to end up zooming up and down trying to locate the enemy, only            to see him stream past your right ear necessitating another roll.            Since rolling is so important to combat, the predefined turn limit            on vertical loops seems rather unfair and impractical\u2026                         Actually, Aquanox' combat system behaves like a bad console first            person control system. If you do land that fatal blow, the chances            are you were lucky. That said, if you do manage to hit something,            the explosions look good.                    Aquanox is a very nice story delivered by a beautiful, sumptuously            detailed underwater world. The depths of Aquanox's oceans are            matched only by the astonishing attention to detail in the design            and art departments. Unfortunately, a combination of lacklustre            audio and unwieldy combat - two extremely important and yet            fundamentally flawed aspects of the game's design - serve to            condemn Aquanox to an early, watery grave.                         There's plenty of action here, with some 34 missions total and a            nice collection of ships to try out, and there are also some neat            features, but with barely half the game completed I was already            sick of the sight of it. Multiplayer cannot hope to save the game            either. In spite of its GameSpy support and plenty of options for            deathmatchers, it merely accentuates my gameplay-related            frustration. Stripping the game's storyline from proceedings was a            bad idea. Some sort of co-operative mode might not have gone amiss            - at least you could gang up and not just spin around all over the            shop trying to target your enemies - but alas, no.                         Aquanox shows a lot of potential, but thoroughly misses the target            in a number of areas, and its lack of Windows XP support is            unforgivable these days. GeForce 3 owners can download the demo for            a peep show - it's a nice way of showing off expensive graphics            hardware to your mates. Just don't let them try it out for            themselves, or they might go back to poking fun at its lack of            support again. Support from quality software, not just pretty tech            demos.                        -        Aquanox                    screenshotsAquanox                    screenshotsAquanox                    previewAquanox                    previewNVIDIA                    show off magic at The GatheringNVIDIA                    show off magic at The GatheringGeForce                    3 Titanium reviewGeForce                    3 Titanium review"}
