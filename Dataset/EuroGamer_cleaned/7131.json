Big, huge, humanoid mecha, stomping            about the place, making the ground shake, blowing things up, and            generally making a nuisance of themselves.                    Face it - they're ludicrous. Simple physics and military science            tell us that such creations would be utterly useless on any            conceivable field of battle... But yet we love them. Many military            buffs have a soft spot for mecha, and fans of warfare are thrilled            to bits by the sight of these towering beasts.                    When it comes to sheer spectacle, mechs have the best of all worlds            - on the one hand, their gigantic form and dazzling array of            futuristic weaponry is enough to send shivers down the spines of            most gun-bunnies, while their humanoid form, often armed with            deadly swords and protective shields rather than projectile            weapons, brings to mind the glories of battles past, between            samurai or medieval knights, rather than the boring, cold precision            of modern warfare.                    PC games about mecha are numerous, ranging from the            simulation-style play of Mechwarrior, through the arcade-influenced            Heavy Gear, to the sleek fast behemoths of Shogo. But the use of            mecha in real time strategy games has so far been limited. Total            Annihilation threw in a few legged units, and MechCommander, as the            name suggests, placed you in control of squads of the units from            the Mechwarrior series, but concentrating more on squad-based            action than traditional RTS values.                    Thus, Metal Fatigue is the first really traditional RTS game to use            anime-style mechs as a centrepiece; and what a centrepiece!            Dwarfing units such as tanks and artillery, and utterly dominating            any battlefield engagement, the ~Combots~ in this game will not            disappoint any fan of giant robots.         The rather sketchy plot of Metal Fatigue has three            major ~corponations~ banding together to research the technology of            a seemingly dead alien race called the Hedoth, who have left behind            them many many bits and pieces of their advanced military robots.                    Naturally, once the true power of the technology becomes apparent,            the corponations (RimTech, Mil-Agro and Neuropa) all decide that            actually they would rather like to have it for themselves, and            hostilities erupt between them. Three brothers caught in the middle            of this end up battling for the various different sides, and in the            three single player campaigns, you play as one of these brothers.                    All of this is explained in the intro movie, and the plot in the            campaigns is carried forward by means of a world-weary sounding            voiceover. The heavy-handed attempt to make the plot of Metal            Fatigue into a moral story is apparent from the outset, and I found            myself wondering if the developers could have saved on the            voice-acting budget by simply injecting a voice sample of the            school councillor from South Park saying ~Greed is bad, mmm'kay?~            at regular intervals.                    Luckily, the plot doesn't intrude into the actual gameplay very            much, with mission objectives often fairly unrelated to the            storyline. While it is not unusual to get a concise ~Destroy the            Enemy~ objective, you will occasionally get more interesting            missions though, calling on you to build defensive perimeters            around vital installations, or to capture enemy technology.                    It's common to have to keep certain units alive over the course of            a mission as well, which can be annoying - the frustration of            having a well defended base and then losing the mission because one            of your units wandered out into a field and got shot is not to be            underestimated. Fortunately the designers have avoided the            temptation of throwing the annoying ~lone commando~ style missions            so beloved of the C&C series at you every two minutes.         One of the most interesting parts of Metal Fatigue is            the ability to custom-build your Combots to fit specific tasks. The            various parts of the bots are built individually, and then            assembled according to your specification.                    It's also possible to salvage bot parts on the battlefield, carry            them back to your base, and either (in the case of an enemy part)            research it so that your Parts Factory can build more like it, or            fit it on to one of your own Combots as an upgrade. Collecting bot            parts after, and even during, battles is a wise strategy, allowing            you to build new Combots without the long delay caused by having to            manufacture new parts.                    As you add new bits and pieces to your bots their on-screen            appearance and abilities change dramatically, providing a level of            user customisation which adds quite a bit of depth to the game.                    Research of new bot parts is often carried over between missions,            as are the skills of your Combot pilots, which can be upgraded            after each mission using the points you have gathered for            fulfilling objectives and bonuses. This adds a certain RPG element            to the game, and means that you will go to great lengths to            safeguard your best pilots, and make sure that they are always            equipped with the best weaponry and shielding possible.                    Luckily, when a Combot is destroyed its pilot is ejected rather            than dying with it, and it is possible for them to run back to the            safety of the base; assuming, of course, that the enemy doesn't            spot them and decide to leave a 10 metre wide heel imprint on            them...         Aside from the mecha themselves, Metal Fatigue is            quite a standard RTS game, although the 3D engine which it uses is            rather nice, like a crisper version of the graphics used in Warzone            2100, and will have no difficulty in running on low-end systems.            Beyond that, there is little to set this game apart from the            mechanics of many older strategy titles.                    Except, perhaps, for the unusual three-level battleground. While            most battles will as usual take place on the surface of the planet,            there are two other levels to the maps - the orbital layer, and the            underground layer. Units can be moved about as normal on these,            although movement between asteroids in the orbital layer will            require hover or flight capable units, and you will need to            excavate underground using a drilling unit in order to move about.                    Interaction between the three levels is carried out using giant            elevators or Star Trek style transporters, and can be crucial to            the outcome of a mission. Building solar panels in orbit, for            example, frees you from having to collect resources on the ground,            while moving attack forces underground can be used as a great            flanking movement.         Metal Fatigue is certainly a good-looking game, but I            did experience some trouble with graphics settings, causing text to            blur at some resolutions, and its OpenGL support is dubious - users            are advised to stick to the Direct3D drivers. The game also sounds            reasonable, with appropriate (if rather forgettable) music and            decent sound effects.                    Ultimately there is very little that this game does wrong as an            RTS, and the inclusion of the mecha units and the layered map bring            it well above average. This isn't a game that sets out to change            the world or to redefine the genre, but rather to rehash an            existing genre in a solid and playable way. An objective which it            achieves with room to spare."}
