Their assignment was simply to find a certain Dr. Edward            Kirk and return him to the home country unharmed.                    Three years prior to all of this, leading scientist Dr. Kirk was            feared to have perished during one of his mysterious experiments.            At the time he had been working on what was nicknamed ~Third            Energy~, a technological breakthrough of pure energy. A military            agent returns from Ibis Island much later to report back that he            has seen Dr. Kirk alive and well, and curiously continuing on with            his research at a military facility. This causes much confusion and            so Regina, with task force in tow, are assembled to unravel the            mystery. Little do they know the dangers they will face, and the            Jurassic nightmare they will endure.                    Dino Crisis is an action adventure very much in the mould of            Resident Evil; in fact it is not too far from the truth to say that            it is Resident Evil with dinosaurs instead of zombies! The game was            originally released on the PlayStation just over a year ago,            receiving much praise and acclaim. So why release it on the PC, and            why so long after the PSX release?         It is certainly a big gamble from CAPCOM, with the PC arcade            adventure market already chock-a-block full of excellent titles            such as ~Martian Gothic : Unification~ and the recently released            ~In Cold Blood~. But then, you will be thinking that they have used            that time to completely overhaul the PSX version to take full            advantage of the PC's graphical capabilities. I am afraid you are            sadly mistaken...                    The game starts outside the research complex where Dr. Kirk was            last sighted, with the place liberally scattered with the dead and            dismembered bodies of the employees. There are three central            characters that make up your team, with Regina being the agent you            control, and Gail and Rick your associates. Both men are highly            trained in their fields, with Gail being an experienced military            veteran, and Rick an expert in computers, medicine and heavy            equipment.                    Regina is armed with a Glock 34 handgun and PA3 Shotgun, which is            also capable of firing anaesthetic darts to pacify your Mesozoic            friends. You will be familiar with how the game operates, simply            moving from one pre-rendered location to the next, picking up a            variety of objects en route, not knowing whether they are important            or not. Progress is only hindered by the odd interception by            vicious Raptors, who are easily dispatched by three or four            bullets, and ..                    Now hang on a sec, the base has been trashed by these ferocious            creatures, with people being ripped apart, arms half chewed and            blood spattered against the walls. You are now telling me that a            scantily clad (or clad, you do get the choice) girl comes in armed            with a handgun which sounds more like a party-popper, and can lay            them to waste as easy as clicking her fingers? Get outta here!         I like games to            vex me, to give me moments where I could scream the house down in            frustration at a certain puzzle that is proving too difficult to            conquer, and of course to resist the temptation to search for a            walkthrough! Dino Crisis does none of the aforementioned, with the            game playing through from start to finish with the ease of alphabet            bricks. The puzzles are ridiculously simple, with practically all            of them being spelt out to you in various notebooks and folders            which you will find strewn around.                    One thing that is impressive though is the game's creepy            atmosphere, and the odd occasion where it makes you jump out of            your skin as a Raptor comes crashing through a window. This is            further aided by an excellent choice of soundtrack, which cuts in            with appropriately dramatic or creepy music to suit the situation.                    You also get the Operation Wipeout arcade mode for the more gun            happy folk out there, where you wander the complex gunning down            Raptors within a set time limit. As with the main game though, it            is often very difficult to see where the dinosaurs are coming from            with the fixed camera view, and most of the time you are better off            waiting for them to attack you first!         I have saved my biggest gripe            with the game until last, and it is simply that the graphics in            Dino Crisis are just not good enough by today's forever improving            standards. It is painfully obvious that this is a console port, and            on that particular platform the game probably does look wonderful.            But you know the writing is on the wall when you get to select what            Regina wears at the beginning and the interface looks like            something from the old sixteen colour EGA days.                    On a PC with high-resolution graphics, where numerous other            lighting and manipulation methods are possible, it should look a            whole lot better than the often horribly pixelated scenes which you            get in this game. The characters themselves are at least fairly            solid looking, but seem to suffer from weird warping, resulting in            some truly odd facial expressions. It is not to say that all of the            locations are badly done, just that there is too much mediocrity            throughout the game for it to be ignored.                    The FMV scenes are all nicely done though, but mixing them with            comparatively poor in game cut-scenes renders them a little wasted.            Just giving you the option to play in anything other than 640x480            would have made things a little less painful for the eyes. A real            shame, as they could have built so nicely upon the PSX version and            made something truly sumptuous to behold.         I am massively            disappointed with Dino Crisis, and left wondering how it was ever a            success in the first place. With a predictable storyline,            childishly designed puzzles and some simply awful graphics, there            is very little to haul this game from the clutches of Pantsville!                    Fortunately the creepy atmosphere still manages to break through            the mist of poor quality surrounding this game, and at least keeps            you playing the thing. I am not opposed to console conversions, far            from it, I would just like to see more care and attention used,            even it if involves rewriting the game code from scratch. Avoid            this unless you really haven't anything better to do."}
