A small lump of grey plastic with a ball in the bottom                 and one or two buttons on the top, it lived on your desk and                 moved a pointer around your screen. Soon people discovered                 that the grime from your desk surface accumulated on the ball                 though, and so was born the mouse mat.                    And for around twenty years nothing much else happened. Most mouse            mats were boring plastic affairs, sometimes emblazoned with an            advert for the company that you got the mat from. But just as the            humble mouse has recently mutated into a gaming device with a wide            range of different shapes, sizes, buttons and wheels, so the mat            you put underneath it has started to evolve again. Strangely            deformed mouse mats with unusual surfaces began to appear on the            market a few years ago, and a whole new industry was born. Make a            better mouse mat, and the world will beat a path to your door.                    But while companies like Everglide concentrated on hard            grainy-surfaced mats specifically designed to give gamers the            maximum possible accuracy from their rodent, a small British            company called Mat-Trix was making bizarre customised mats for the            likes of Coca Cola, The Beastie Boys and Smirnoff. Earlier this            year they opened            Liquidelica, a web            store which for the first time sells these unusual mouse mats to a            mass audience. We decided to take a closer look, and when a few            days later a box of samples appeared on my doorstep, all work            suddenly ceased.         What Mat-Trix                 have done is essentially to put a lava lamp inside your mouse                 mat. A low tech combination of vegetable oils, glycerin and                 food colouring dyes is used, and because the various oils                 don't mix they produce random pyschedelic patterns.                    Instead of heat though, the liquidelic mouse mats depend on            pressure to cause movement in the oil. A flexible transparent            plastic top layer keeps the thin layer of liquid inside the mat,            and the weight of your hand pressing down on the mouse causes the            surface to bend slightly and the liquids inside to move around. The            effect is at first highly distracting, and you will find that your            productivity falls sharply as you stare at the mat's slowly            shifting patterns, and move your mouse around the mat just to see            what happens, paying no attention to the mayhem your cursor is            causing on screen.                    Once the initial novelty factor wears off you may be able to get            back to whatever you were doing, but the mats are certainly very            eye-catching, and make a refreshing change from both your            run-of-the-mill plastic mats and the usually jet black mousing            surfaces from the likes of Everglide and Ratpadz. The top surface            is also very smooth, and the mouse glides almost effortlessly            across the mat, although for some reason the rectangular ones            seemed to offer more friction than the circular ones.         The                 range of Mat-Trix surfaces on offer varies from the sublime to                 the rather ridiculous, with a whole host of different shapes                 and colours available for the mouse mat connoiseur, and all at                 a surprisingly low price.                    Let's get the Foot (\u00a37.25) out of the way first. As the name            suggests, this is a mouse mat shaped like a human foot. It looks            great, and the blood red and sunburst yellow oils inside made it            one of the most visually appealing of the mats, but sadly it's            almost useless because there just wasn't enough surface there to            move your mouse over. I use a Razer Boomslang 2000 mouse with a            very high sensitivity setting, and yet I could still barely reach            all four corners of my desktop without the mouse falling off the            edge of the mat. Maybe a Big Foot (eugh) mat would be more            effective, but this man-sized mat just isn't large enough to be            practical for most users.                    Next up is the Heart (\u00a35.25), which features a metallic pink            substance mixed into a silvery liquid inside the heart-shaped mat.            While it might be a nice present for your significant other, they            are likely to be too embarrassed to use it in public, and again the            mat is really too small to be useful for many users. The liquids            also don't mix as well as the ones used in the other mats, and the            overall effect was (for me at least) less appealing.         Luckily the rest of the range                 was somewhat more practical, made up of regular circular and                 rectangular mats. The circle (with a 20cm diameter) is perfect                 for those of us who use high mouse sensitivity settings, while                 rectangular designs (20cm x 24cm) are well-suited for people                 who prefer to move their mice around more vigorously.                    Most of these samples were straight ~aquamats~, which cost \u00a36            and feature two non-mixing coloured liquids, with a choice of eight            different combinations to pick from. My circular mat came in ~dark            blue and cyan~, and was probably my favourite of the aquamats, with            a nice contrast that produced some impressive patterns without            hurting the eye. The two rectangles were (I think) ~blue and red~            and ~turquoise and red~. These also looked good, although the            liquid was somewhat thinner than in the other mats, which meant            that you could often see the white plastic beneath it showing            through across much of the mat.                    The real star of the show though was the rectangular ~aquavelvet~            mat (\u00a38), which features a ghostly mixture of metallic red,            black and orange-ish brown dyes. The effect is simply stunning, and            makes it without doubt the most desireable mouse mat I have ever            laid eyes on. The liquids don't move around quite as much as in the            regular aquamats, but they do shimmer in the light, and look            incredibly funky. Man.         While the Heart and Foot                 mats are more novelty items than practical mats, the more                 regularly shaped ones are actually very useful. They might not                 offer the precision of a dedicated gaming surface, but they                 are at least as accurate as any regular mouse mat, and                 infinitely more interesting to look at. Quality is generally                 high, although the rectangular aquamats could maybe have used                 a thicker layer of liquid. There were also some air bubbles                 inside all of the mats, but if anything these only add to the                 effect, squidging around the sides of your mouse as you move                 it, and slowly shrinking and expanding as the temperature                 changes.                    If you don't take yourself or your gaming too seriously, and            want something out of the ordinary at a budget price, these mats            are exactly what you are looking for. They look great, are every            bit as effective as a normal mat, and are guaranteed to make you            the star of any LAN party. Of course, there is one last point to            note - if you have an optical mouse you should not buy one            of these mats, as the constantly swirling patterns will confuse the            hell out of your poor rodent!
