Featuring plenty of things for us to get excited about - an amply            imbued heroine, spectacular sea battles and swash-buckling            activities of every description - it struck us as a bit peculiar            that we had heard so little about the game during its            development\u2026                         With our cynical senses tingling then, we fired the game up to            give it a jolly rogering [steady on - Ed] and discovered that it            consists largely of two separate games lashed together with some            spare rigging. Unfortunately, while one of these games is rather            good, the other one .. er .. isn't.                         Bearing an uncanny resemblance to the ridiculously bad Geena Davis            movie Cutthroat Island, the game kicks off with the luscious            Katarina discovering her father in his death throes and uncovering            his piratey past, before setting sail on the Wind Dancer and            putting pay to some scurvy sucker-punching scum. From thenceforth            it's up to Geena - sorry, Katarina - to move between land and sea,            performing death defying feats of sword-fighting bravery in a Tomb            Raider like third person environment while also tending to her flea            bitten ship, fending off those stupid enough to venture close by,            and conquering various forts and their surrounding islands.                    Graphically Pirates is a bit hit and miss. Katarina's animations            once ashore are absolutely diabolical for a PlayStation 2 game            (although this seems to be a fixture of Westwood games these days),            with one standing pose, a handful of running animations and very            little in between. This is accentuated by one of the game's            silliest features, the metal detecting Dual Shock 2, which vibrates            whenever buried treasure is nearby. When the pad starts to shake            you have to move around until you find the strongest source of            vibration, and as you do so it pays to move a few inches this way            and that. Apparently furnishing Kat with an appropriate animation            never occurred to Westwood though, because she just judders and            jerks around like an 80's disco dancer.                         Kat's swordplay, on the other hand, is surprisingly good-looking.            Thrusting and parrying in a three-stage assault, she can deal with            pirates, outsized crustaceans and even bulbous gorillas from time            to time, and the pirate boss battles are amazing to watch, let            alone take part in. Rank and file pirates amble along nicely,            although they do look like they're fighting to control their            bladders when they run, and the game's various animal aggressors            also look pretty smart. When it comes to terrain and texturing            though, Pirates comes up short. The problem is that while the            textures are fairly detailed and the terrain is nice and hilly, the            one has been applied to the other with all the grace of a charging            rhino.                        The third person sections of the game simply do not work as an            ensemble, with textures clashing at the seams and a depressingly            spartan feel to the whole thing. You can see virtually everything            of interest at a single glance, and unlike a level of Serious Sam,            the smoothness and frenzied attack of a hundred enemies is absent.            I get the feeling that the game would have been a lot more            interesting if you had a couple of helpers joining you on your            scavenger hunts, filling the screen with bloodshed and the sound of            clashing cutlasses\u2026                    Once you move out to sea the game takes on a whole new persona.            Your ship is finely detailed, right down to the individual masts,            cannons and various other bits and bobs littering the deck, while            waves lap against the sides of the hull and the gleaming ocean            extends to the distant horizon.                         Your ship is equipped with two cannons to start with and you can            either fire these or opt for your power attack, if it's charged up.            Another aspect of your ship's arsenal, which is unavailable to your            land-lubber prey, is the ability to harness a quick gust of wind,            sending you racing forward like a motor boat. This 'turbo' feature            is kept in check by an icon on the HUD, which drains and then            steadily replenishes until you can use it again. The trick to            winning sea battles is to circle the enemy (who will be trying to            do the same to you), fire a few shots, wait to be fired at, then            surge forward before any damage is done and fire again. Getting the            hang of it is tricky, but thankfully you can plunder cloth and            timber debris from the wrecks you leave behind, allowing you to fix            up your ship via an inventory system without having to stop off at            port.                         And this is a good thing, because the people at the port don't            like pirates. One of the ongoing objectives of these seafaring            sections is to take over each island's defences, which usually            consist of a handful of tower-mounted cannons and a main fort area.            Racing around firing at all of them (and any ships on your tail) is            terrific fun, and once they surrender you can head into port and            fix up your ship. If you've picked up enough doubloons from sinking            ships and gathering treasure chests in the third person sections            you can even upgrade your ship with more cannons and other            weaponry, or trade up to a better model. As the game progresses,            everything from a tiny little scooner to a thirty-six cannon Man O'            War becomes available.                    Actually docking at the various peers and jetties strewn around the            islands which you visit isn't all that exciting though; it's simply            a matter of sailing up to them and hitting a button, at which point            the game switches to the island mode and hands you control of            Katarina. While the sea battles are utterly engaging, if a little            dizzying, the third person sections suffer from an unresponsive            mess of a control system and rapidly become tedious due to            Westwood's penchant for unadventurous mission objectives such as            'search for keys', 'search for maps' and even at one point 'search            for flowers' [aw, bless - Ed].                         Floral excursions aside, the focus of the game is revenge, and            various elements of this story are depicted through pre-rendered            cutscenes which pop up from time to time. These feature some truly            heinous voice acting and poor scripting in general. Katarina's            accent in particular seems to be badly affected, and as you're            forced to hear it constantly thanks to her random bellowing at odd            moments, I'd like to suggest the person responsible for casting is            made to walk the plank. In fact, Pirates works better on the whole            if you ignore the story, and the single player game loses its charm            quite quickly due to the overabundance of substandard third person            'action' sequences. If you can find someone else willing to buckle            swash with you though, there is nothing quite like Pirates'            multiplayer mode. Pick from any ship in the game and take your            friends on in the waters of your choosing, from the barren oceans            of a tropical paradise to the ice-packed lagoons of the northern            hemisphere. As far as post-pub multiplayer entertainment goes,            there's a new king in my house\u2026                         Sadly, this enjoyable extension of the game's best feature isn't            really enough to rescue players from the dreariness to be found            elsewhere. And while diversions such as the mid-level smuggler            peddling power-ups and the save game parrot provide comic relief,            overall you get the impression that Westwood might have done better            focusing on the exciting elements of the game instead of trying to            out-Lara Core Design, when they patently lack the ability to do so.            Give it a rental and see where your threshold for tortuous Tomb            Raider take-offs lies, or play it with your friends and never even            bother."}
