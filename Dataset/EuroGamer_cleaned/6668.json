It certainly appears            to have all the credentials of an accomplished adventure game, it's            got some RPG staples in its armoury and real-time combat to boot.            An intriguing, exciting and entertaining sequel to ~one of the            PS2's biggest selling role-playing adventures~ then? Weeeell...        This is            Summoner 2 in three words: Hack, run, slash.                    This is Summoner 2 in more words: While the game certainly has            aspirations to action-RPG greatness, it falls far, far short of the            mark by instead boiling down to a trudging mess of relentless            combat, character statistics and more quests and side-quests than            you could shake some kind of magic stick at. It actually            starts off quite well, as you're dropped straight into the thick of            things fighting off invading pirates on the deck of your ship in            the middle of a typhoon. Dropping you snippets of information here            and there to help you along the way, the game eases you into your            role as Maia, the Queen of Halassar, quite elegantly. You have no            idea as to the history of your character or the world you inhabit,            though, aside from a completely baffling FMV just after starting a            new game.                    It is after that short bout of introductory battling, however, that            the dialogue starts up and kicks the grossly bloated, complicated            and bewildering plot into gear. We're immediately expected to know            all about the Prince of Neru, who's nicked off with your Book of            Prophets into the Wyrmlord's Palace in... well, you get the idea.            So the adventuring proper starts on a small island littered with            ruins inscribed with completely meaningless... inscriptions.            Joining you on the island is your assassin sidekick, who you can            also take control of whenever you feel like it and take advantage            of her particular skills if you can be bothered. You will at times            have a team of up to four characters assisting you in your quests,            each with their own abilities and each customisable with the            application of skills points that are earned when levelling up.        So you go on your way, looking            for this Neru fella, finding stuff in chests and the like, and            battling off hordes of random floating ghost things, big            spear-throwing plant things and pirates every couple of minutes,            and it starts to get really, really tedious. While there appears to            be some kind of story behind all the ruins and inscriptions - which            does become quite interesting - the constant interruption of the            random respawning enemies hampers your ability to properly            investigate, and so your interest eventually just turns to getting            your quest over and done with. And so it goes for the rest of the            game.                    While pushing the mostly impenetrable plot along with dribs and            drabs of dialogue and cut-scenes, the game rarely deviates from the            stop-start approach of running about, finding things and then            fighting off some enemies. I wouldn't mind so much if the combat            were at all exciting, but it's just pretty basic button-bashing            mediocrity. Some interest is created in being able to use one of            your several ~summons~ - Maia at certain points throughout the            adventure comes across giant runes which grant her the ability to            summon a beast of tremendous power for a limited time, forcing you            to use your summoning ability strategically and appropriately in            times of need.                    The game pads out its lack of engrossing combat with an enormous            collection of quests to complete, which would take even a hardened            player a good few days solid playing to finish up completely. As a            queen, you also have a kingdom to run, and occasionally returning            to your palace you're able to listen to advisors and petitioners            asking for your funding, permission and input into keeping your            people happy. You can even take the time out for some sparring in            your palace grounds, just in case you weren't tired of randomly            bashing the square button already. This creates a sort of diversion            from the action, and would be pleasant if there were more to do and            see without the threat of whatever random beast feels like squaring            up to you next, as per the regular quests. As it is, though, there            are a lot of corridors, and a lot of stairs and a lot of talk about            prophecies that need fulfilling. If I hadn't spent half an hour            trying to find the way out of the place the first time I was there,            I would have done so sooner.        Summoner 2 is also visually below par. The graphics            occasionally rise into above-average levels of detail, but the            low-poly character models, stilted animation, blurry textures and,            for the most part, blocky location design knock the game back a few            years aesthetically. The acting is actually surprisingly good a lot            of the time, but the mostly humourless dialogue lends an            unavoidable flatness to the speech - you're more likely to nod off            to sleep than sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next            shocking plot twist to be divulged.                    Summoner 2 is average. There isn't another word that more pointedly            describes the experience; the graphics are average, the plot is            average, the adventuring is average, and the combat is            decidedly average. It lets itself down with the rubbish            fighting bits, and by taking itself far too seriously, particularly            with a plot that is so sprawling and hard to decipher that you lose            interest before it even gets a chance to get going. If the combat            engine had been more considered and dynamic as a compliment to the            adventure elements instead of being a tacked-on attempt to appeal            to more action-oriented gamers, it could have improved the            underlying game immensely. Only then would it be worth more than a            passing glance on a rainy Sunday when there's absolutely nothing            else to do.
