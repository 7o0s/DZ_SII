The various PC versions can be had for peanuts and run on            anything upwards of an original 3dfx Voodoo graphics card, which            means that, while the PlayStation 2 version is also excellent, it's            probably not worth \u00a340 to Half-Life die-hards. In fact, I can            only really recommend it to people who have no PC or want to play            Half-Life on a big-screen TV. Let's be frank. When this first            landed on my doorstep, I had to motivate myself to play it again.            I've been through Half-Life and it was a hell of a ride, but that            was more than two years ago. I want something new!                        In retrospect, I'm glad I dragged myself out of bed one morning and            settled down with it though. It's a wonderful game which invented            FPS clich\u00e9s all over the place and featured some really            exceptional level design and presentation, however old it is now.            Visually the game has always looked good, although the lower            resolution and absence of anti-aliasing on the PlayStation 2 does            it no favours, and there's no sign of a 60Hz option either. The PC            version looks better and lacks the intermittent jerking that            accompanies excessive on-screen detail, multiple nasties or big set            pieces. By the time you get to the marine insertion forces later            on, you find yourself playing at about 25 frames per second more or            less constantly.                        There are some nice new touches that help ease the pain though,            such as the health and energy stations, which now have movable            handles, and each and every weapon has been spruced up to match            those seen in recent PC patches. A lot of the spangly effects, such            as the shiny guards' helmets, have been borrowed from the PC            version, and the texturing is nicer than I had expected. As a PS2            conversion it's pretty solid, and load times are no more            substantial than they were on the PC - about 20 seconds at the            start of each enormous chapter, and 3-5 seconds for the small            breaks during them.                    Although there is some cheesy menu music at the start, the game has            otherwise retained the unnerving soundtrack of the original PC            version, which is as modest as ever. The sound effects are also            identical, and the voices of the Barneys and scientists have been            reproduced without blemish.                         The interface has been adapted nicely to the PS2 as well. The main            menu offers you a choice of Half-Life, Decay, Head-to-Head and            Options. Through the latter you can adjust the brightness, volume            and control system, although the default settings are fine. You can            choose to play the original Half-Life single player campaign in            Easy, Normal and Hard modes, each of which does exactly what it            says.                         As far as console first person shooters go, the game features            several clever additions. The first of these is a bona fide Quick            Save / Load system. Like some of the recent PlayStation            role-playing games, Half-Life lets you save your progress to the            system memory temporarily, allowing you to pick up and drop off            important save points during the game without losing half a minute            navigating load screens. If you want to turn off your PS2, you just            have to make sure you save the game properly to the memory card.                    Another change to the formula is the targeting system. Originally            Half-Life demanded that you find whatever you wanted to activate            and then press your Use key. Now the Use key (which also doubles up            as a walk key in general gameplay) operates whatever the game            targets for you. As you approach a door, for instance, two little            square brackets appear around the button. In the presence of            several buttons you may have to move your view around to seek the            right one, but in practice it's a good system, borrowed            successfully from games like System Shock 2 on the PC.                         The control system is actually very good, which surprised me. I            found it quite easy to use, with the sensitivity at just the right            level. By comparison, Red Faction had me diving in and out of menus            adjusting the sensitivity, and I never really got it just right.            With Half-Life, the left analogue controls movement (that's            forward, backwards and side to side), while the right analogue            controls direction, sensibly inverted by default. L1 and L2 handle            jumping and crouching, while R1 and R2 handle normal and            alternative fire. The D-pad switches weapons, and the four buttons            on the right control walking, using objects, your flashlight and            targeting. Targeting can be toggled; spot a bad guy, toggle it and            your view will centre on him until you disengage the toggle.                         As far as the actual adventure goes, it's a feature-complete            conversion of the original as best I can remember. There may even            be a few additions here and there. As I have said, Half-Life is            based on an excellent plot with some lovely set-pieces, and even            though I had already finished it on the PC, I really enjoyed it on            the PS2. Was it worth \u00a340 to play through it again though?            Sadly not.                    The real problem for Half-Life on the PS2 is that nothing in the            rest of the package really justifies the \u00a340 either. Decay,            the PS2 version's coup de grace, is something of a dead duck. It's            a split-screen co-operative mode for two players with about ten            levels. It's the same sort of quality expansion as Blue Shift,            which we enjoyed thoroughly (albeit briefly) a few months ago, but            beyond the initial excitement of being able to play co-operative            Half-Life, the graphics have been compromised for split-screen play            and it's altogether rather samey.                         Beyond Decay there is a Head-to-Head deathmatch mode, which does            the business, but it's not as much fun as playing it on a PC.            Actually, that's not much fun either, as vanilla Half-Life            deathmatch was always rather boring compared to its own mods such            as Counter-Strike, and was surpassed almost instantly. With no            online options and no i.Link option that I could find, there won't            be much life in it, especially when Red Faction multiplayer is more            entertaining and has an original single player game into the            bargain.                         I don't really know how to feel about Half-Life on PS2. I'm            grateful to Gearbox for giving me the opportunity (and excuse) to            play through it again, but I'm doubtful as to the package's overall            worth. It's one of those games that offers a tremendous amount, but            makes a poor substitute for \u00a340 in your pocket. Half-Life is a            spectacular, rollercoaster ride of an adventure, and it's a piece            of gaming history everybody should sink their teeth into at least            once. If you haven't taken a bite though, there are cheaper,            better-looking PC packages than this. A good game it most certainly            is, but do you really want to spend \u00a340 on it?                        -        Half-Life                    : Opposing Force PC reviewHalf-Life                    : Opposing Force PC reviewHalf-Life                    : Blue Shift PC reviewHalf-Life                    : Blue Shift PC reviewHalf-Life                    PS2 screenshotsHalf-Life                    PS2 screenshots"}
