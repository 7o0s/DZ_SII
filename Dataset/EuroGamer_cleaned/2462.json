I'm sure a            lot of gamers crying out for a new online fixation will buy Return            To Castle Wolfenstein purely on the strength of the multiplayer            test demo.                         The RTCW single player game is a solid albeit extremely linear            experience, with plenty of atmosphere thanks to the significant            attention to detail and excellent visuals. The game is based on the            Quake III engine, but from the opening levels, where developers            Gray Matter have crafted a fortress to rival the one in Where            Eagles Dare, to the final gory conclusion, the journey is decked            out in a whole new wardrobe. The game boasts some of the most            impressive models and texturing we've seen to date, the guard and            weapon animations flow gracefully and, with a couple of exceptions,            every little item in or around the room can be poked or manipulated            in some way. Fortunately there's more to it than pretty pictures            though.                         Your quest concerns the story of a mysterious evil buried near            Castle Wolfenstein. The Nazis intend to unleash a warrior of            demonic powers and his unlikely hellspawn, and it's your job as a            secret Allied operative to deal with the problem. After your            partner is sliced and diced in the torture chamber, you have to            break out, rendezvous with local resistance and try and force your            way back into the reckoning. The story is told through various            paper clues hidden in the game, the guards' conversations and            in-game cutscenes that appear between levels. The game's opening            scene is fairly exciting, but for the most part from there on in            it's some fat Churchill-alike and his Allied commanders propping up            a desk in a cushy office, which needless to say is a mite boring            when you get the same rambling prose on the next page's mission            brief.                    The levels are fairly well designed, although some are worse than            others, and the texturing and audio accompaniment really helps to            build up this vision of an epic adventure. Going from the castle to            a nearby village and the catacombs, the game's mood errs on the            side of the disturbed, with Nazi insignia and propaganda all over            the place, and harsh, cultish undertones lurking in the shadows.            The sound is distinctly eerie, rather than spooky, and the sound            effects are pretty standard. One non-standard addition (or            subtraction, depending on which way you look at it) are the German            voice-overs from our friends the guards. There will be no more            hysterical waffling in German as you sprint through an open doorway            and pepper the room with lead. Instead, the guards - and everybody            else in the game - speak English. The dialogue is drab and            conventional guard-speak, uttered in the few moments before they            round the corner for you to open fire\u2026 A bit of a let-down.                         Overall the single player game is strong, but it's more Red            Faction than Half-Life. There are some huge, Doom-like nasties to            be despatched and diversions like heavy assault weapon bunkers,            which can be commandeered to cut through swathes of Germans and            scenery alike. The game also features some stunning weaponry (from            the familiar automatic rifles and sniper's Mauser to the old-skool            rocket launcher and a flamethrower) and the effects are daring and            of the same high visual standard as the rest of the game. There are            enough set pieces to keep you entertained, the AI of your enemies            is effective, and ducking in and out of cover as sniper bullets            rain down around you gives an authentic feeling of being in the            midst of a war. The thing is, having completed Return to Castle            Wolfenstein I can't help but feel that something was missing.                         For example, when I first played Half-Life, the very notion that a            game could carry the player on a magic carpet ride through a            lightshow of a first person shooter while thrilling him or her so            completely that they would be hooked and gush about the game for            the next three years was utterly hysterical, but Valve            proved that it was possible. They took a new approach, and it            worked. RTCW isn't the watershed for the genre that Half-Life was.            Of course it's good, but ultimately it's not going to be remembered            as a defining moment in first person shooter history as the            original Wolfenstein 3D was, because everything it does somebody            else did first. It's as if Gray Matter were afraid to try anything            new. As far as the single player game is concerned then, it's a            nice footwarmer, but it plays second fiddle to multiplayer...                    The multiplayer game is what really defines Return to Castle            Wolfenstein. As revealed a while ago, Gray Matter actually spent            their time developing the single player game, while a group called            Nerve worked on multiplayer. When the 'test' was released, it was            obvious why. RTCW multiplayer is like digital crack. Amazing            really, given the scope of the multiplayer game when compared to            that simplistic demo. Its only real fault is the lack of bot            players - you will need to play on the Internet or a big LAN to get            a good game, so make sure you have a decent connection.                         Multiplayer features two sides - Allies and Axis - and four basic            character classes for each. In the interests of balance, not all of            the weapons from the single player game were brought over to the            multiplayer aspect, but your basic soldier can use any of the            weapons in the game with a larger capacity for ammo than the            others. Most of the players on any given server will choose to be a            soldier, since they can use the messiest weapons like            flamethrowers. Next up is the engineer class, which can plant and            defuse dynamite and repair any turreted guns on the level. If            you're defending something (such as the fort in the Omaha beach            style level) you will definitely want an engineer to help touch up            your defences when you're close to being breached.                         The third class is an absolute necessity though; the medic. If you            don't have a medic, you will just keep on dying and losing health            until you are dead. Medics can regenerate constantly, give 10            health to each player on joining the game, and they can also            resuscitate borderline troopers and hand out health packs. Develop            your abilities as a medic and people will make way for you on a            packed server. Beyond the medic there's the lieutenant, who can            hand out ammo packs like there's no tomorrow. He also has            binoculars and the authority to call for air strikes on enemy            positions, so each team wants one good lieutenant.                    There are a couple of nuisances with the multiplayer mode though.            After you die you have to wait a few seconds to respawn. This is            handy for picking another character class, or would be if the            interface wasn't so cumbersome. You can bind macros for selecting            different character classes, but you would have to find those on            the Internet and add them to your config files outside the game.            The other thing that bothers me is that a lot of the levels in            multiplayer are just reworked versions of the single player ones.            This is fine, but I had hoped for some original efforts.                        Fortunately these are only mildly annoying aspects of the game, and            they have a plus side too. For instance, the game's interface is            perhaps a bit complicated with its big game window and buttons and            whatsits all over the place, but the HUD is surprisingly reserved.            Health, ammo, your teammate's names and health percentages all            appear on the screen, and the last two are particularly important            for medics and engineers. Medics and lieutenants can also locate            people in need of help via the various voice commands players can            use to call for health and ammo. Hit one of these and your name            will be shown to nearby medics or lieutenants, and you will appear            with a red blob over your head in their view.                         Furthermore, the maps may be based on levels seen in the single            player game, but they have all been subtly (and occasionally not so            subtly) altered so that they make excellent levels for strategic            warfare. Eight maps ship with the game, and the overall standard is            very good.                    Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a worthy addition to the stable of            id Software affiliated shoot 'em ups. The single player game is            average to good and takes quite a while to finish, but the game            really earns its salt by shipping with a first class multiplayer            element. Given that the first person shooter genre is full of            developers happy to ship a game with half of its functionality            broken out of the box, RTCW makes a refreshing change, and if The            Great Escape doesn't really appeal to you, perhaps slaughtering            Nazis on the battlefields of Europe will go nicely with that glass            of brandy.                        -        Return                    to Castle Wolfenstein screenshotsReturn                    to Castle Wolfenstein screenshots"}
