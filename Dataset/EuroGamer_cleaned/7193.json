The man behind the music, James Grote, has            previously produced pieces for id Software and 3D Realms, creating            soundtracks to accompany demonstrations of Quake 2 and Duke Nukem            Forever at the E3 computer games trade show in recent years.                    His first CD sounded excellent, but was a little disappointing in            that it featured only eight tracks, totalling rather less than half            an hour of music. It's something of a relief then that the sequel            weighs in with a dozen tracks and a more healthy 41 minutes of            music, and all for just $10.                    The CD also now includes all the tracks in handy 128kbps MP3 format            as well as standard CD audio, which saves you the time of ripping            the files yourself if, like me, you're an MP3 fanatic.                    Of course, as any man will tell you, size isn't everything. What            counts is how it sounds. So without any further ado, let's take a            look at what you get for your money...                    The album opens with ~Razor Edge~, which begins with some slightly            spooky sounding noises, soon joined by stabbing distorted guitars            and a slightly cheesy electronic drum. Things start to look up when            the real drum beat kicks in though, with a driving guitar riff and            rolling drums pushing the track along.                    About a minute in a synth line comes in and there's a little            breakdown with some eerie guitar sounds floating around in the            background before the main beat kicks back in again. Towards the            end of the song the deep guitar riff drops out, and a higher            pitched lead line comes in to replace it, sounding almost like an            old (I'm talking early 1980s) U2 song at times, with the bass still            rumbling along underneath it all.                    The second track, ~Alienation~, starts with a fast paced drumbeat            behind a dark choral melody which dominates the first minute of the            track, and this theme continues throughout the song, alternating            between being played on a guitar and using the choir sound. The            track ends with the drums dying (rather suddenly) and a string            sound coming in to accompany the choir. A nice dark and moody            instrumental.                    ~Chron 2~ follows with the same almost gothic feel, with heavily            distorted rhythm guitar riffs and a catchy lead guitar line cutting            in and out throughout the song. A couple of minutes through the            song everything cuts out and an almost Nine Inch Nails sounding            distorted noise rhythm comes in to give the song a slower            mid-section, with the undistorted lead line floating around over            the top of it.                    ~Deviation~ is back to more metal, with deep stabbing distorted            guitar riffs and a fairly plain pounding drum beat with the            occasional roll to liven things up. Towards the end there's a            couple of short sections with some spooky industrial sound effects            and a rather mournful sounding choral bit, which actually works a            lot better. Not the best track on the album, but enjoyable enough.                    ~Unhinged~ is anything but unhinged, starting off with a promising            sounding electronic bit before descending into more low heavy metal            style guitar riffs and pounding drums, with some rather thin            sounding choral sounds over the top in places. In the middle            everything cuts out and there's a rather nice little bass riff            before the guitars come back in to accompany it, only for            everything to suddenly cut out and an entirely different guitar            riff to start up, punctuated by some occasional dodgy whammy bar            fiddling.                    Track six is ~UltraMedia~, changing over to a more electronica            sound for the intro, with a slightly thin but dancey drumbeat and            another nice choir sound. This is soon joined by a really nice            guitar riff and a more metal-ish drumbeat, before cutting out again            to go back to the intro drumbeat with a lilting lead guitar line            over the top.                    There's a lot more of this than there was in the first album, and            it looks like James has got a bit more confident in his guitar            playing. The result is mostly catchy and uplifting, with the two            sections alternating through most of the song, although the            freestyle fretboard mangling bit in the middle doesn't quite work            for me. A nice way to end the first half of the album though...                    Kicking off the second side is ~Rezin~, another heavy metal            instrumental with a nice bass line hidden away under the distorted            guitar riffs to give your woofers some exercise. It's hardly a            remarkable track, but it makes a nice background to your fragging,            which is after all the whole point of the CD.                    ~Electric Skies~ on the other hand is a complete change, with a            beautiful rolling piano loop starting things off and some synth            sounds over the top before the drums kick in. It's a refreshing            change of pace, especially the mid-section with its sinister            sounding strings and slow heavy bass line.                    This soon cuts out though, and the piano loop comes back to be            joined by a soaring guitar line that soon descends into more            freestyle fretboarding, though this time it works a lot better than            in ~UltraMedia~. The string and bass section comes back for the            ending, though sadly it soon fades out rather suddenly. One of the            best tracks on the album.                    Next up is ~Psychward~, returning to the metal mayhem side of            things with burly disorted guitar sounds and some suitably heavy            handed drums, occasionally toning down to introduce a distorted            bass and high synth whine to the proceedings. Towards the end            there's more of the fancy fretwork rising above it all, and the end            has an almost operatic metal sound before it all dies down.                    ~Illuminati~ starts up with one of the most haunting synth lines            I've heard in a long time, with an echoing grated drum sound in the            background before the main drum beat and a bouncy electronic bass            sound start up. It gets a bit confused in places, but generally it            works very well.                    A long droning choral sound comes in towards the end, and the            result is depressing but hauntingly beautiful. Sadly it's all over            too soon, and at just over two minutes this is the shortest track            on the album. Which is a shame, because it's also one of the best.                    After this brief interlude, ~Chron~ is a return to the land of            distorted guitars and unsubtle drumbeats. A dark and sinister piece            with some nice subdued metal riff work throughout and eerie noises            occasionally sticking their head over the parapet of distortion.                    At just over four minutes its the longest track on the album, but            not overly long, especially as a more melodic guitar line comes in            over the top of the rhythm at the end, though once again it all            fades out rather suddenly just as things start to get            interesting...                    And so on to ~Closure~, which is .. what's a polite way to say            this? Horrible. It starts with a bombastic, over the top piano            ~melody~, and then the most cheesy, whiny, grating synth brass            sound you can possibly imagine comes in over the top to cap it all.            Eugh.                    Towards the middle things pick up though, with the piano calming            down for a bit, and a beautiful dreamy guitar line that's amongst            the best lead guitar work on the album floating over the top of it            all. It's just a shame about the rest of the track...                    Apart from the final track, which is truly hideous, the rest of the            album is at worst good and at best excellent. It's a fitting            follow-up to the original, and shows a more mature and experimental            approach.                    James' guitar work has improved noticeably, especially when it            comes to the fretboard thrashing lead lines, and once again the            music wouldn't sound out of place on an original game soundtrack.            Given how poor some computer game music is, it's a miracle that            nobody has hired this guy yet.                    It not only makes nice background music for anyone who likes more            than the sounds of their opponents' screams to accompany their            deathmatching, it also stands on its own merits. As with the            original, I've been listening to it while I've been working as much            as I have been while playing games.                    Here's looking forward to ~Songs for Deathmatch 3~...                        ~Songs For Deathmatch 2~ can be bought                        here for $10 plus shipping, and you can also listen to some            samples of the tracks before buying the album."}
