Pure            evil is always the product of hangovers, early mornings and that            poorly made first cup of coffee. But if super villains are the            product of Monday mornings, then Bastion - the chief bad guy in            X-Men: Next Dimension - was invented when the boss insisted            everyone work over Christmas, cut the bonuses and banned mistletoe            on the grounds of health and safety.                    You see, Bastion is no ordinary super villain. According to Next            Dimension, he's so evil he can't even find hired help, and had to            build an army of robots to wage his war - unsurprisingly against            the mutants and their protectors, the X-Men.                    But sadly, Bastion, like much of Next Dimension, is about as            original and inspired a choice as a canteen-made prawn sandwich.        Just about anybody who's glanced at a            beat 'em up menu screen since 1991 will recognise Next Dimension,            with its story, arcade, versus, practice and survival modes. And it            doesn't get much more exciting when you venture deeper - relatively            recent additions to the genre are easy enough to synthesize from            the diverse world of Stan Lee's comic creations. Take super moves            for example. Have a completely wild guess as to how they            implemented those? Hopefully it won't spoil the surprise, but            'super' moves harness 'super' powers.                    It's a theme which continues throughout most of the game.            Interactive scenery finds a home, and the X-Men twist is that only            mutants with telekinetic powers (or a suitable reach) can hurl            ringside objects at their opponents.                    Meanwhile, some take-offs are easier to spot than Wolverine's            sideburns. Arenas are tiered, DOA style, so a particularly well            aimed blow will send your enemy falling to the ground far below,            tracer effects are used to exaggerate the heavy strikes and the            familiar quarter circle forward plus punch will often send a            fireball sizzling across the screen.                    And as you'll quickly realise if you spend any time with the roster            of characters, many of them are based on their contemporaries in            other titles. Toad, for example, is a rather unflattering Kilik            wannabe, with an arsenal of limb stretching moves and a rather            mischievous tongue.        Next            Dimension does make a few relatively feeble attempts at innovation            though, but unfortunately with virtually no success. The super move            charge bar, for example, is split into three sections, and you can            charge them individually with each successive blow to gain access            to specific moves. However, while the idea is to use L1 to switch            between them so you know which one is charging, in practice bouts            are far too hectic to effectively make that split second decision.                    Then there's the ability for certain characters to fly. If your            character can stand taller than most, then pressing L2 after            jumping will keep you in the air for a short spell of time. But            apart from raising some peculiar questions about the game's            collision detection (which occasionally caught us in projectile            attacks which zoomed miles over our head) and confusing the hell            out of anybody we introduce to the game, the practical benefits are            negligible.                    Compounding matters is a frustrating control scheme which demands            the use of both D-pad and analogue stick. Thanks to a quirk of the            controls, the D-pad can only be used to jump, while the analogue            stick can only be used to sidestep (the ~3D~ element). There's no            way to remap the buttons, so you're left either jumping or dodging,            or flicking your thumb confusedly back and forth between controls.                    This flaw, along with the speed of the game, means that many of the            more interesting moves at your disposal are far too risky to            attempt, leaving you with a pretty narrow range at any given time.            Whether you'll have the enthusiasm to persevere and become a truly            skilled X-Man is doubtful - we certainly didn't.                    There are some things to be said for the Next Dimension though.            Visually it looks rather nice (if only on the PS2), with detailed            character models - clearly representative of each character - and            some fairly large (and often imposing) arenas. What's more, each            character's repertoire of moves is pretty extensive and draws upon            familiar attacks. But when all you can say for a game is that the            license is a good one, it shouldn't really sound like praise.                    Perhaps the most damning thing of all about Next Dimension though            is that throughout our time with the game, we never once felt the            impact of a blow or watched a character reel in pain - there's            virtually no weight to any attack and hit contact is unconvincing.            For a game based on a collection of the world's most powerful            superheroes, that's as good a reason as any to avoid it.
