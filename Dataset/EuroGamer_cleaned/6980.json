You can trace it right back to when the first home            consoles were kicking about. From Marioland on the GameBoy to Mario            64, a Sonic game has never been far behind. Mario Party is Sonic            Shuffle's inspiration, and unfortunately for the sprightly blue            hedgehog, this one hasn't worked out quite so well.                         With Mario Party, Nintendo created an eclectic board game, but in            the form of a cartridge rather than a lot of counters and dice,            which meant less faffing around drunk and knocking over the            carefully arranged piles of counters, and more button bashing and            general rowdiness. Sonic Shuffle has the looks - it uses the            enchanting cell-shading technique put to use by Jet Set Radio - but            thanks to the atrocious load times and overly complex instructions            it will appeal to very few, and certainly fails to hit the target            so clearly defined by Nintendo. Oh, and it's boring.                         The audio and visuals are deceptively good, but did a good job            initially of hiding the hideous gaps in the gameplay. The            characters are all well defined thanks to the cell-shading            technique, and the actual game board is nicely textured and            brightly coloured. Everything looks very much like a cartoon, with            smooth 60 frames per second animations, and it's all accompanied by            cheerful little musical numbers. Each of the characters has            sufficient voice acting to back them up, and overall the game is            just\u2026 pleasant to be around.                    As I said though, the audio and visuals are deceptively            good. You first realise just how annoying Sonic Shuffle really            is when you land on a ~special tile~ and it starts to load a            mini-game. It takes a bloody age. Every departure from the main            game board precipitates a long pause while data is fetched from the            GD-Rom. Getting back to the board is equally tiresome.                         Within the game, each character has a hand of cards with a number            on them. You choose a card and it determines how many tiles you            move across the board. If your cards are all a bit rubbish, you can            take a chance on another player's card, although it's impossible to            know what value will be on it. After all the cards are dispensed            with, another round is handed out randomly.                         Trouble is, the game isn't anywhere near as exciting as Mario.            There are some special tiles for the sub-games and such, but most            of the tiles on the board are blue or red, which add or subtract            three of your character's rings respectively. Rings? Yes, er, they            function very much like coins do in Mario. The big issue here of            course is that with the board being so low on special tiles, it's            incredibly rare for you to get to play a mini-game against another            player, which was of course what made Mario Party so spectacular.            Presumably limiting the amount of mini-games was Sega's attempt to            mask the hideous load times.                    The actual aim of the game is to collect the ~Precioustones~, which            are powerful gemstones scattered around the board. But who cares,            eh? Party games should be about manic mini-games that you can shout            and scream about with your friends. The first problem is that the            mini-games in Shuffle are usually too complex, meaning you actually            have to read the damned instructions. Like ~Chef's Love Shack~,            another party title for the Dreamcast, the game is marred by the            amount of time it takes to load everything, and the difficulty of            the games themselves. With Love Shack, you rarely got anywhere, but            at least it wasn't that hard to get the hang of things. With            Shuffle, you spend most of the time trying to work out what's going            on, because after waiting so long for things to load, the last            thing you can be bothered with is reading instructions.                         When all's said and done, Sega should have sat down and looked at            Mario Party, and tried to work out what made it so popular. Board            games aren't really party games, are they? It's the mini-games and            variety of tasks on hand that build up the party atmosphere, and            that's where Sonic Shuffle falls down. It's just not worth            persevering with, and Mario Party (and its sequel) stomp all over            it.                         If you're looking for a good console come board game, buy an N64,            at the moment, the only alternative likely to get your friends            moving on Dreamcast is Samba De Amigo."}
