Fear not though, for            the imaginatively titled Second Encounter is bigger, better, harder            than ever and utterly, utterly insane.                        Once again you take on the role of ~Serious~ Sam Stone, a marine            with a bad attitude sent into the distant past to save the world            from hostile aliens. Or something. The storyline isn't really            important, serving merely to give Sam an excuse to rampage his way            through the ancient world slaughtering outlandish monsters, and if            you haven't played the first game you won't have missed anything            that you can't pick up from the short intro cutscene.                        But what the game lacks in plot it more than makes up for with            character. Sam is more vocal than ever and is always ready with a            sarcastic one-liner or an in-joke, from whining about how much he            hates crates to complaining about the quality of his script. The            whole game is decidely tongue-in-cheek with a refreshingly            self-deprecating sense of humour, constantly poking fun at itself            and its rivals.                    Fans of the original game should feel right at home with the second            chapter of Serious Sam, as essentially it's more of the same with            added bells and whistles. Not that this is in any way a bad thing,            given how entertaining the last installment was.                        Most of the weapons and monsters from the original game have found            their way into the follow-up, from the minigun and rocket launcher            to screaming kamikaze bombers and stampeding bull-like animals that            can hurl you high into the air with their tusks. Joining the old            favourites are a few choice additions. There's a highly effective            sniper rifle with a zoom lens that lets you zero in on targets from            hundreds of meters away, and a devastating flamethrower (my            personal favourite) which fires a stream of napalm that ignites            anything it hits, causing further damage for several seconds after            the initial impact. Perfect for dealing with hordes of close-packed            monsters. There's even a big chugging chainsaw especially for those            ~close encounters~, prompting Sam to start singing Monty Python's            lumberjack song.                        The game also sports a wider range of power-ups. None of them are            going to win any prizes for originality, but they can prove            incredibly useful in the middle of a chaotic battle. ~Serious            Speed~ makes you run faster than a speeding bull (if not a bullet),            ~Serious Damage~ temporarily increases the effectiveness of your            weapons and ~Invulnerability~ is fairly self-explanatory.                    While the game's inhabitants are mostly familiar, one welcome            change which Croteam have made is to use a much wider variety of            settings. Gone are the bleak sun-drenched deserts and towering            pyramids of Egypt, replaced by a trio of mini-episodes set in Mayan            America, ancient Babylon and medieval Poland.                        The game ~only~ includes a dozen maps in total scattered across            these three settings, but they are quite possibly the biggest, most            monster-packed maps ever to grace a first person shooter. Most of            them take the best part of an hour to complete as you wade through            wave after wave of bizarre looking creatures conjured up by the            appropriately named evil mastermind Mental. Some of the pitched            battles involve literally hundreds of monsters, and a couple            perhaps go on a little too long, leaving you wondering            whether the flood of monsters spawning around you will ever stop.                        Overall though Serious Sam is arcade-style action at its best, a            mixture of adrenaline-pumping action and nerve-wrecking ambushes            with only a few basic puzzle and platform sections to break up the            wall-to-wall mayhem. Apart from a little pointless bounce pad            navigating these generally aren't too intrusive, and ~puzzles~            generally involve blowing things up, moving blocks around or            finding the appropriate object to open the next door. Nothing too            taxing then.                    Where Second Encounter really shines is the incredible attention to            detail applied throughout. There's always something to keep you            busy, and every level is filled to bursting point with secrets to            discover, varying from your basic power-up hidden in a dark corner            to some truly surreal set-pieces.                        Pick up a health pill and you never quite know what will happen            next. Often these virtually useless power-ups (they only restore 1%            of your health) are used to trigger special events, such as the            appearance of a giant kamikaze bomber or a horde of tiny exploding            frogs. In one level I made the mistake of firing a shot down a            mouse-hole to see if anything was back there, only to trigger the            arrival of a stampeding herd of midget bulls. The world of Sam            Stone is a seriously strange one...                        Sometimes the strangeness gets a bit out of hand, and at times you            can feel like you're in a giant invisible pinball machine. There            are gravity-defying rooms that can leave your head spinning from            vertigo as you struggle to destroy endless hordes of exploding            monsters while everyone bounces around so fast you barely have time            to aim your weapon before your target is half way across the hall.            The feeling of satisfaction when you finally complete these odd            encounters is usually enough to overcome any initial frustration            though.                    Croteam are deviously inventive and have a thoroughly warped sense            of humour, all of which has been put to good use in Second            Encounter. With a good ten to twelve hours of gameplay and an RRP            of just \u00a319.99 it offers great value for money, and while it            still isn't a particularly deep or intelligent game, for a bit of            brainless high octane action it can't be beaten.
