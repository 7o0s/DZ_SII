Unless you're really out of touch, you'll have certainly have noted            that they all involve object collection and platforming, and all            have been born to the world since October 2002. Now say hello to            latecomer Vexx and try to look the snub-nosed intruder in the eye            without spitting contempt in his stupid generic face.                    If it was customary to be cruel and rude to newcomers, then Vexx            would and should be given the kind of welcome reserved for American            backpackers in the The Slaughtered Lamb. It's perhaps ironic that            this 'kid with attitude' is thirsty for revenge, because that's            exactly what we want to wreak upon Acclaim Austin for producing            possibly the laziest, most uninspired platformer we've had the            misfortune to witness in the next-gen era.                    It's hard to know where to start in pinpointing which is the            biggest disappointment in this turgid excuse for a game. While we            sharpen our metaphorical knives, let us at least run through the            basics, should you be even remotely interested. Hang on, you can            probably guess already. If we can unearth a single original or            well-implemented idea, we'll be sure to let you know about it.        Apart from the splendid Sony-backed efforts of late, stories in            platform games are generally shocking sub-infant school nonsense.            But not only is Vexx's tale of revenge against the Shadowraiths an            irrelevant, terrifyingly dull way to start the game (plus the            majority of the voiceovers are drowned out), there's virtually no            attempt made to explain what you're doing thereafter.                    When you're first thrust into the game via a short tutorial (short            because there's sod all to learn), young Vexx can dish out            punishment to those who dare cross his path via a pair of            mean-looking claws that have arbitrarily been fused onto the ends            of his arms. A basic slash attack can be performed by tapping            square three times, L1 and square deals an uppercut, X plus L1            performs a jump and slam 'Ground Blast', while X plus square            performs a Flare Kick. Jump is assigned to X, while a longer jump            can be pulled off by tapping L1 just before hitting X. And apart            from the ability to climb and swim, that's about all you need to            know throughout the game, with no power-ups or extra abilities            added later on. Hmmm. Why did no-one point out that gamers like new            toys as an incentive to progress?                    Enemies are astonishingly uninspired drones that draw/spawn before            your very eyes thanks to a curious framerate saving mechanic, and            can be dispatched with the minimum of fuss. There is a pointless            combo system that allows you to juggle the enemy in the air, but            why bother when stabbing the square button does just as good a job?            It's this kind of slackness that fails to draw the player into Vexx            from the off.        Just as disappointing is the alarmingly lacklustre graphics            engine. Although the main character is reasonably well detailed and            animated, the rest of the package feels like some throwback to the            ugly pop-up ridden, low textured early PS2 era. You guide Vexx            through a game world so uninspired you wonder whether Acclaim even            looked at the extremely stiff competition in the early stages of            development. Wandering up to any wall, rock or item of scenery,            it's clear that the engine should have been drowned at birth, being            unable to inject any credibility into your generic surroundings. To            add insult to injury, the levels are floating platforms (inspired,            eh?), meaning one slip and it's a life down the drain. And with            just five lives at your disposal, the Game Over screen will be            flashing up before you know it.                    Game Over screens in platform games are annoying enough as it is            (especially when you're forced to wait for a lengthy reload to            resume), but the game refuses to auto save until you find one of            the level's hearts, and thus meaning you lose every single shard            you've tirelessly picked up on that stage.                    And it's hearts that you're after. It's Vexx's equivalent of Mario            Sunshine's Shines or Jak & Daxter's Orbs, and yet another            crushingly generic feature that requires the player to hunt for            them before other levels in the hub will open up. The ability to            change the levels from day to night sounds like a vaguely            interesting idea, but merely opens portals, or makes enemies            harder. Not exactly a thrilling prospect to change the face of            gaming as we know it.                    En route, you'll encounter an odd collection of mini-bosses (why            the fug is there a Sumo wrestler sitting atop a big rock on the            first level, and why does he feel the need to guard a heart?), and            the occasional mini-game breaks up the tedium, but it's no Ratchet            & Clank. Every level thereafter is much the same in its            randomness, and you're expected to suss out what's going on with no            direction from the game whatsoever.                    If none of the previously mentioned games had been released, Vexx            would still struggle to impress us. The whole package feels utterly            unfinished, and its troubled development history screams out at            you. But it's only when you size up Vexx against the sizeable,            quality opposition (especially on the PS2) that it become            alarmingly apparent how far down the pecking order this comes. In            all honesty, even average fodder like PacMan World 2 and Ty The            Tasmanian Tiger piss over Vexx from a great height.                    If you've skipped to the final paragraph looking for a quick            assessment, then here it is: Vexx is a charmless, shoddy,            unfinished, unplayable mess and does nothing that a dozen other            games haven't done infinitely better. If you're going to try and            compete in an overpopulated genre, at least make it stand out.
