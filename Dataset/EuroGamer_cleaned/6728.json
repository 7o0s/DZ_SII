Certainly, they are often involving, challenging and            interesting - but in terms of stirring the soul, they're not really            much cop. There's not a lot of drama or emotion in play when a tank            blows up a couple of lighter vehicles in Red Alert, or when your            Zerg lay waste to an enemy outpost in StarCraft - which is why            finding a strategy game which has the blood of your warrior            ancestors pumping through your veins and the bloodthirsty cries of            battle ringing in your ears is really something rather special.                    And that's exactly what Medieval: Total War is; something rather            special. The developers of Shogun: Total War are back with a game            which isn't so much an upgrade or a sequel as a complete overhaul            of the original, reinventing much of the battle system and almost            all of the strategic system to deliver a slicker, more thoughtful            and yet even more dramatic game. If you thought charging hundreds            of samurai across the fields of Japan into bloody battle was an            incredible experience, then the delights offered by Medieval will            make your mouth water; and if you've never played Shogun, you truly            have a treat in store for you.                           Taking it from the top, for the benefit of those who have never            played the first Total War title, Medieval is a game, set in Europe            during the end of the Dark Ages and the Renaissance, which gives            you control of a faction and then sets you loose to achieve            domination through a combination of tactical manoeuvring and            hard-fought battles on a grand scale. Two almost entirely different            games exist here rolled into one; firstly, there is the tactical            map, which gives you control of your provinces on an economic,            military and political level. Secondly - and herein lies the true            hook of the game - there is the battle map, which pits your armies            against those of your rivals and gives you direct command.                    One of the key differences between Medieval and Shogun is that the            tactical map has now been beefed up significantly, with the level            of control offered to you - and the resulting level of complexity -            being far ahead of anything seen in the previous game. You have            direct control of the production queues of each province in terms            of buildings and troops, as well as being able to award titles            relating to the province to your generals, affect the religion and            loyalty of the populace in a variety of ways and even secure            yourself against spies and assassins - while using the same tools            against your own enemies. You must also keep an eye on the royal            family of your realm; the game spans several hundred years, and            you'll go through a lot of monarchs in that time - so you need to            be sure to keep their heirs safe, because a country without a king            will often be reduced into civil war.                           If all of this sounds familiar, that's probably because you've            played one of Sid Meier's Civilization games in the past. Creative            Assembly have certainly taken a lot of inspiration from Civ in            creating their tactical play component, and while the technology            tree in Medieval certainly isn't as complex or extensive as the one            in Civilization, this is more then compensated for by the intricate            systems controlling monarchy, succession, generals of armies and            governors of provinces. Indeed, in many ways Medieval is a more            satisfying tactical game than Civilization III was; the level of            forward planning required in conducting a successful military or            espionage campaign is much higher, and the sense of overall            achievement when you conquer a rival or even just capture a            province is far beyond anything Civ has to offer.                    Of course, the incredibly good tactical game is only half of the            story where Medieval is concerned, because when your armies march            off to war in this game, you get the chance to control their            battles directly. The computer can, of course, resolve disputes on            purely numerical basis - but a little tactical flair can overcome            even quite overwhelming odds, so it's almost always worth your            while to take control yourself. Besides, if you choose to ignore            the battles, you're missing a really big part of the overall            package - and one of the best war simulations ever created. Set on            a variety of giant, rolling landscapes, you can take control of            literally thousands of troops, organised into a number of            divisions, and must take advantage of the landscape and the            composition of your forces in either defending your territory or            invading an enemy province.                           The sensation of scale and drama in these conflicts is incredible;            imagine the opening scene of Gladiator replayed on a grand scale,            with fantastic music that rises and falls according to the events            on the battlefield and hundreds of units clashing noisily on the            hillsides and valleys of the province. The simulation of battle is            also superb, with height offering a real tactical advantage, and            the strengths and weaknesses of each unit accurately modelled -            right down to archers having poor aim in bad weather, and            camel-mounted Arab troops panicking the horses of cavalry! There's            little in gaming terms that can match the drama and satisfaction of            an uphill enemy charge being cut down by lines made up of hundreds            of strategically positioned archers on the hilltop, before your            cavalry race downhill to pick off the retreating stragglers.                    Control of the battlefield is not perfect - the camera can            occasionally be fiddly, and it can sometimes be difficult to see            exactly what all of your units are doing at any given time.            However, in ways, this confusion adds to the atmosphere of the            game; while the gamer in you hankers for the accurate, pixel            perfect controls espoused by modern RTS titles, it has to be            remembered that war in medieval times simply didn't work that way -            not to mention that factors such as the tiredness and morale of            your troops will have a major effect on how accurately your orders            are carried out, and with what speed.                           All in all, Medieval presents a stunningly rounded package,            combining the most dramatic and stirring renditions of the            battlefield ever created with a deep and cerebral tactical game            which rivals any god-game on the market in terms of complexity and            entertainment. Creative Assembly have crafted a masterpiece; a game            which may not have massive mainstream appeal for casual gamers, but            which anyone who enjoys strategy or historic war will rightly            recognise as a milestone in gaming."}
