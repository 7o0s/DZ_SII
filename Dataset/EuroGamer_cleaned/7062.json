In fact, for as long as I can remember I have            had some sort of video gaming entertainment to hand, from my            earliest recollections of the ColecoVision owned by my parents to            my very own first computer, the Acorn Electron.                    When you grow up with technology you don't really notice the subtle            advances, but when I played Speedball 2 for the first time on my            Amiga I was a very happy little geek. I had in my possession one of            the finest sports games available on any platform at the time, and            I could while away hours and hours fine tuning my mean bunch of            rogue sportsmen into lean killing machines, as well as pummelling            my mates into submission well into the wee small hours. I don't            hear from many of my old friends these days...                    Then I heard that the Bitmap Brothers were planning an update for            Speedball that would both win over new fans and surprise and endear            their older audience, and so I was quietly anticipating the title a            great deal .. until it finally landed in my PSX. And what a huge            goddamn mess they've made of it.                    Things started promisingly enough as the short intro cinematic            kicked in, and I was treated to a wonderful CGI sequence depicting            the eponymous speedball's manufacture and subsequent launch into a            game of thugs generally bashing each other around in order to get            their hands on it.                    I was hoping that the standard had been set by the quality of the            intro, but as soon as I arrived at the main menu I realised            something really quite striking - it looked almost exactly the same            as it did around six years ago on my old Amiga. ~Fair enough~, I            thought. ~They want to bring back the feel of the original - that's            fine by me.~                    To see what the actual game was like I chose to play a knock-out            tournament from the single player menu. From the same front screen,            you can also choose a two-player game, an exhibition match, or            customise your team by altering both the name and the aesthetics of            your team and individual players, including hair and skin colour.            Which is a nice touch.                    I nipped through the team stats menu though, wanting to jump into            some action straight away. Part of the appeal of the original was            that you could pick it up and play a quick match for 10 minutes            whenever you wanted. The first thing that immediately struck me            about the sequel though was how damned ugly everything            looked. The players were ridiculously disproportionate, with            enormous shoulder pads completely dominating the rest of their            bodies, and of course the low-res PlayStation graphics hardly did            the arena and player textures any favours, giving the entire visual            experience a rather cheap and rough look.                    The game itself is simple enough. Two teams start at the centre of            the field in a formation, and the ball is launched into the sky            before landing for the players to scrap over. You direct the            players with the d-pad whilst tapping X to toss the ball to another            player or shoot for a goal. You can also attempt to activate the            various bonuses and goal multipliers in order to bump up the score,            which adds a pleasant variation on the theme. Various power-ups            also appear throughout the match in order to temporarily bump up            the players' speed or aggression, or to have adverse effects on the            opposing team, such as halting their movement for 15 seconds.                    Actually playing the game hardly held any recompense for the            frankly gaudy visuals though, as the PlayStation controller simply            didn't lend itself to the games frantic pace, being more suited to            games of comparably relaxed accuracy like FIFA rather than            Speedball's frantic button bashing as you attempt to weave the ball            around the opposing team's players. Of course, credit must go to            the Bitmap Brothers for managing to re-create a hugely exciting and            frantic game (occasionally a game became so energetic I broke out            into a sweat), but the enjoyment is utterly marred by the fact that            playing Speedball 2100 physically hurts.                    I'm not exaggerating. After a couple of games in knock-out mode my            wrists and thumbs were screaming for mercy, and I was forced to            stop playing. I was simply astounded at how they had managed to            achieve this, and to prove that it wasn't just me being pathetic            (as is often the case), I challenged a burly mate to a game of the            two-player mode, but lo and behold, after a few matches we were            both pounded into submission by the inanimate grey box.                    Speedball 2100 is replete with game modes, options and menus, but            none of these actually offer anything much different from the            standard game, other than progressing through it in a slightly            different fashion.                    You can choose to play friendlies or knock-outs, or play a full            championship as a player manager. You can even act simply as a            manager, sorting out the player stats like aggression and speed,            and dealing with player transfers to and from other teams, all of            which is paid for by players collecting money from the pitch whilst            they play.                    The whole affair is frankly tired and unsatisfyingly similar to the            original Speedball 2 though, which was far better for its            originality and functional graphics, as opposed to the ridiculous            fluff littering the game here. For example, the stadia in which you            play are almost exactly the same as before, except gratuitously            swathed in coloured lighting. And at the end of the day, the poor            use of the PlayStation's abilities only proves that Speedball did            not warrant or need this update.                    I remember Speedball 2 so fondly for its superbly detailed            graphics, the wonderful pounding sonic effects, and of course the            addictive, stomach churningly violent (for the time) action of the            game itself. By comparison, as a full-price package Speedball 2100            simply cannot compete as a title worthy of purchase.                    It's a shame that the Bitmap Brothers have managed to display such            an utter lack of imagination, and why they had to ruin one of the            finest landmarks in gaming history to do it is beyond me..."}
