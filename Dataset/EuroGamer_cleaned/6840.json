This time he's popped his head up on the Xbox,            and this new version of the game has been upgraded here and there            to give Tony Hawk fans a little more incentive to check it out than            the Cube version released in the States last year. Tony's third            game makes several departures from its predecessor and also            features a collection of new tracks and of course an array of real            skaters to choose from including the eponymous Hawkster himself,            each equipped with an arsenal of signature moves.                         The graphics have received their seasonal update, but the touch of            sparkle promised Xbox owners is absent. Grass was meant to become            more than a mere texture, swaying slightly in the wind as you            skated past it, but apparently (despite stealing a few seconds of            film on a recent Xbox mag coverdisk) it was cut to keep the frame            rate up. Regardless, as with the PS2 and Cube versions, each of the            skaters is superbly drawn, modelled and animated, and the tracks            are full of neat visual effects and intricately detailed. Virtually            every edge can be used to grind with plenty of jumps and half pipes            and of course all the usual level goals - collecting S-K-A-T-E, the            secret tape and racking up high scores. Themed goals feature            prominently too, with skaters racing to take out a handful of            pickpockets in the Airport, and squashing pumpkins in Suburbia.                         Tricks are as easy to perform as ever, and the control system maps            surprisingly well to the Xbox controller, although I reckon            Controller S with its spaced out diamond will be a better bet. The            tutorial (including Tony's cringeworthy voiceover) clears up all            the important stuff for beginners, and instructions for performing            the big tricks can be accessed in-game and assigned to different            button combinations. With each level the high score goals become            harder to attain, but thanks to the skill points scattered            throughout each level you can upgrade your skater's abilities            before it becomes a problem, from ollying and grinding to grabs and            catching air, and these attributes make a big difference to the            outcome of each two minute run.                    Some of the game's levels invite you to show off for three            one-minute rounds and have your performance scored according to the            panel of skater judges. These levels form stumbling blocks in the            single player game, with a minimum bronze medal required to unlock            the next level and tough competition. No amount of goals on the            previous levels can be employed to help bypass these obstacles, and            the challenge sets you up nicely for the trickier levels            thereafter. New to the Xbox version of the game is an Oilrig level,            which posed a challenge even for my Tony Hawk addicted friends, who            - being mostly of the student variety - cannot afford to shell out            required cash to buy their own Xbox. That said, THPS3 doesn't            really constitute a killer app for Xbox, but then these people            often defy logic\u2026                         Perhaps the most important thing the Xbox can offer Tony Hawk fans            is the ability to customize the game's soundtrack. Rip a few of            your favourite songs to the Xbox hard disk before you play and you            can kick some of the less inspired tunes on Hawk's soundtrack to            the curb, replacing them with your own blockbusting beats. If not,            you'll find plenty of skatey tunes in rap, punk and a handful of            other genres. Artists like Alien Ant Farm and the Red Hot Chili            Peppers make their mark, but it's a bit hit and miss.                         In terms of the quality of the port, THPS3 is unmatched, even on            the already port-ridden European Xbox launch line-up. If you've            bought an Xbox and are looking for something familiar to get your            teeth stuck into, you could do a lot worse. The PlayStation 2            version is no cheaper, and the Cube version (obviously not yet            released in Europe) is a level lighter and a mite uglier to boot.            Even the vaunted GameCube load times are about the same as those            witnessed on the Xbox, and with level data caching to the hard disk            you'll find the process of repeating those crucial first few            seconds of each level a less arduous and disjointed task. Although            much smoother than its counterparts on other consoles, THPS3 Xbox            outing does slow occasionally, dropping below the staple 60 fps at            the start of levels more often than not. Load times are generally            good though, and the interface is reassuringly slick. A fully            featured skater and skate park editor seal the package.                    Execution is one of the strongest aspects of Neversoft's games, and            THPS3 is no exception. Indeed, this is definitely the slickest and            more desirable Hawk to date. Long-standing fans of the series may            demand more, but for skating virgins there is no finer game, and            ultimately, there isn't much about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 to            deride. So we won't bother.                        -        Tony                    Hawk's Pro Skater 3 PS2 reviewTony                    Hawk's Pro Skater 3 PS2 review"}
