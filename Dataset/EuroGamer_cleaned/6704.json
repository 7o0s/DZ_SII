Remember Soul            Calibur, Shenmue, Grandia II, Skies of Arcadia, Metropolis Street            Racer, Virtua Tennis and Phantasy Star Online? Remember laughing at            everyone who spent \u00a3300 on a PS2 at launch and then sat            staring glumly at it for six months while you romped through a crop            of the best games ever to grace a home console?        Of course you do. Sega may have done some wonderful things as a            third-party developer and publisher, but it'd take a lot of super            monkeys in balls to make us forget about the Indian summer of Sega            hardware, where the last rays of sunshine were all the brighter and            warmer for the knowledge that winter was coming soon.                    Ok, yes, a little over-dramatic and over-emotional, I confess. But            all the same, there was a certain thrill to dusting off my trusty            Dreamcast and popping in a brand new game for the first time in            months, a definite sense of comfortable recognition in the liquid            tones of the boot logo, and almost a touch of recrimination in the            screen which popped up demanding that I set the date correctly - as            if to say, ~oi, how long without playing any games on me do you            call this then!~                    I'm sure my Dreamcast will forgive me though, because the slice of            digital delight I fed into it was the latest masterpiece from a            little Japanese developer called Treasure; and even if it's the            last new game my Dreamcast ever sees, this certainly counts as            going out with a bang. Treasure, for those of you who don't            recognise the company, are the crowd behind some of the most            fantastic shoot'em'up games of all time, ranging from the utterly            wacky (previous Dreamcast outing Bangai-o) to the near-perfection -            Saturn-era jaw-dropper Radiant Silvergun [and the team currently            working on Wario World for Nintendo -Ed].        Ikaruga almost never            appeared for the Dreamcast; finished long after the machine was            officially buried by Sega, Treasure seemed prepared to dump the DC            version entirely and move on to making the forthcoming GameCube            port. Appeals from distributors and importers promised a certain            level of sales, however, so Treasure ran off a limited run of            several thousand copies of the game on the Dreamcast, many of which            ended up with US-based import companies and hence into the hands of            rabid Treasure fans everywhere. It's just as well that they did,            too, because Ikaruga may be late to the Dreamcast party, but it's            still one of the best reasons yet to have a Dreamcast as part of            your console collection.                    At heart, this is a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up, in which you            play a single ship pitted against hordes of enemies who fill the            screen with bullets, beams and explosions. The unique twist on the            formula is the introduction of two opposed elements - white and            black - which you can switch your ship between at a touch of a            button. While you are white, you absorb all white bullets and do            double damage to black enemies, and vice versa. Absorbing bullets            boosts your special attack bar, and shooting enemies of your own            colour causes them to explode in a shower of bullets of the same            colour, which you can collect to build up special attack power more            quickly.        This is a very simple game            mechanic which is exploited to the fullest by Treasure's level            designers. Combining streams of black and white enemies and bullets            onscreen forces you to dart around the play area like an angry            wasp, switching colours frantically to nip through sprays of            bullets unharmed. Several segments take on a puzzle-like quality,            as destroying everything on screen can actually make life more            difficult for yourself in certain situations. Of course, in true            Treasure style, there's also a chaining system - destroying three            enemies in a row of a specific colour earns you a chain, and            building up your chain requires you to destroy enemies only in            groups of three. Initially, you'll battle to stay alive and ignore            the chaining system, but it adds an extra layer of complexity to            the game as your skill increases.                    Two-player Ikaruga is also a stunning piece of work, with the            colours system making life much more interesting in the multiplayer            game. At the most basic level, players have to be careful not to            destroy wrongly-coloured enemies near their partner, since the            resulting shower of bullets will probably kill them (and forcibly            thrown Dreamcast controllers can be very difficult to dislodge from            human skulls), but as you advance in ability combined tactics such            as using one player to sweep up bullets and the other to shoot boss            enemies become possible.        Graphically, Ikaruga is stunningly beautiful - each level is            amazingly detailed and expansive, enemies are imaginatively            designed and the occasional use of dramatic camera swoops and rolls            is excellent. The game doesn't have as much impact on the Dreamcast            as, for example, Radiant Silvergun had on the Saturn, simply            because we already know that the Dreamcast is capable of graphical            wizardry that can often still eclipse the PS2 and its ilk, but this            doesn't detract from the wonderful presentation and superb artistry            on offer here. For the best experience possible, the ability to use            a monitor that can be turned on its side to see the entire play            area as the designers intended is a welcome addition. As ever with            a Treasure title, the music is also excellent, with a fantastic            classical score which complements the action perfectly.                    The game is inevitably compared to Treasure's previous masterpiece,            Radiant Silvergun, but the comparisons are unfair. Ikaruga is a            much smaller game in scope, with a single cunning gameplay mechanic            used to provide hours and hours of enjoyment; Radiant Silvergun, on            the other hand, was the be-all and end-all of vertical shoot 'em            ups, with a complex system for levelling up, tons of different            weapons and an emphasis on pure action and adrenaline. Each game is            equally enjoyable, when taken on its own merits, and rather than            making comparisons between Ikaruga and Radiant Silvergun, we're            just happy to see yet another magnificent Treasure title on a home            console.                    Of course, Ikaruga won't have any mainstream appeal while it            remains on a dead (for all intents and purposes, sniff) console as            an expensive import-only title. The release of the            Infogrames-published GameCube version is imminent, however, and we            can only hope that someone decides to distribute it in Europe. If            you don't own a Dreamcast (shame on you) or aren't keen on paying a            small fortune to import Ikaruga from the USA, consider this entire            article a preview of the GameCube version; and if your Dreamcast is            hidden away in the attic at the moment gathering dust, now would be            a perfect time for an emotional reunion with it.
