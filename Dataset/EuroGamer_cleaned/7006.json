Currently            the head of Sega's AM2 division, Suzuki has been an innovator in            the field of 3D gaming for years - producing games such as Space            Harrier and Virtua Fighter, which may seem dated now but were            groundbreaking in their time. Since the original announcement of            Shenmue, every release of images has astounded and thrilled even            the most cynical journalists and the most battle-weary console fans            with their beautifully realistic depiction of characters and            locations - giving meaning, arguably for the first time, to the            whole concept of a ~next generation~ console.                         Shenmue promised something that no game had ever before even dared            to hint at - a fully interactive world, which lives and breathes            around you as you play, and in which you can interact with anything            and anyone. Believers have enthused about the enormous potential of            this for months; sceptics have explained over and over why this is            an impossible task. With Shenmue finally on the shop shelves, the            question of whether the game lives up to its own hype can be            answered at last - as well as the burning question of whether it            can justifiably be considered to be the start of a whole new genre,            as Yu Suzuki has claimed so many times.                    The first thing that will strike anyone about Shenmue,            unsurprisingly enough, is the graphical splendour of the game. A            short intro features a young girl standing on top of a cliff            delivering a monologue, while the camera swings and pans around            her, following the flight of a beautifully detailed bird of prey            before zooming in dramatically to a close-up of her flawless face.            This scene alone outshines the quality of anything seen to date            from a console game, coming startlingly close to the standard of            FMV seen in the likes of Final Fantasy VIII, and this standard of            graphics is perpetuated throughout the entire game. If you gasped            when you first came across Hyrule Field in Zelda 64, Shenmue will            have you doing a convincing impression of a fish out of water for            most of the time spent playing it; from countryside roads to            bustling towns, villages and dockyards, the game constantly            astounds the player with both its depth of vision and of detail at            once.                         Perhaps more impressive than the environments are the characters            themselves. Central characters such as Ryo himself are modelled            with painstaking care, right down to having moving eyeballs,            eyelids and lips - meaning that scripted scenes can use a whole            range of facial expressions and movements. Many of the scripted            scenes, fight sequences in particular, are very impressively            animated, and extensive use is made of motion blur and slow-motion            to create martial arts effects which wouldn't look out of place in            a good kung-fu film. However, the animation of the characters            outside of the scripted scenes can be disappointing - Ryo himself            seems to shuffle about like someone with a gammy leg much of the            time, and other characters can seem very stiff in their movements,            which does let down the otherwise unprecedented graphical look and            feel of the game world.                    It's all very well to create an astounding-looking game world, but            allowing the player to interact with it in a meaningful way is a            much more difficult thing to achieve. The basic plot of Shenmue is            quite simple - a sinister intruder murders Ryos father in the            opening moments of the game, and it is up to Ryo to avenge his            death. First of all, of course, you need to find out who it was            that killed him, which leads you off on a chase around the nearby            villages and towns that would make Agatha Christie proud. This            element of the game is somewhat disappointing, in fact; Ryo spends            hours walking around asking people if they've seen a black car,            following up dead-end leads and only very gradually finding out any            new information about his fathers killer. This can become very            tedious indeed if you're actually playing through the game as a            straightforward RPG-style affair; Ryo wakes up in the morning,            walks into town, and asks the same questions over and over again,            night falls and he goes home - lather, rinse, repeat.                         Most of all, this ruins the impression of freedom in the game. You            don't have a choice as to the line of inquiry you follow; Ryo asks            about the car, and from there the path of questioning and progress            which you will follow in the plot is totally set in stone. This is            understandable - after all, the amount of dialogue which would need            to be recorded in order for multiple plot paths to be available is            ridiculously large - but disappointing nonetheless. After all, with            all the effort that has gone into making Shenmue into a genuine,            living, breathing virtual world, forcing the player to take a            specific path through it seems a bit of a letdown.                    There is one saving grace to the rigid plot of the game, however,            and that is the freedom which the game gives you to explore the            world outside the boundaries of the storyline. While your ultimate            mission in the game is to find out who killed your father, and            avenge his death, Ryo doesn't have to be single-minded in achieving            this goal. Along the way there is plenty of opportunity to have fun            in the game world - looking after a stray kitten, collecting toys            from vending machines and racking up high-scores on arcade-perfect            Hang On and Space Harrier machines are only a few of the things            which Ryo can sidetracked doing. Every person you see on the            streets of the town has a real life as well - it's possible to            follow someone around for an entire day, see where they live, where            they work and even where they eat lunch.                         Shenmue does grant the player freedom to interact with their            surroundings - right down to having a poke through the drawers in            Ryo's house, or picking up items in a shop to examine them up close            - that is unprecedented in gaming, and this makes it impossible to            compare it to any other type of game. Considered as an RPG or            adventure game, Shenmue is a very poor example; but the addition of            a real, persistent game world adds so much breadth (if not depth)            to the title that it is unfair to put it alongside the likes of            Final Fantasy or its ilk. The limitations which apply to your            progression through the story pale in comparison to your freedom to            do whatever you like outside the storyline, making Shenmue into a            game which is not so much ~played~, as ~experienced~, and            justifying Yu Suzuki's claim to have created a whole new genre.                    Like the real life that it tries so hard to emulate, you only get            from Shenmue whatever it is that you put into it. If you stick            rigidly to the plot and try to get to the end of the game in a            hurry, you will be shockingly disappointed (not least because this            is only the first chapter of a much longer saga, so the story is            not wrapped up at the end) by the game; but if you take the time to            explore, and allow yourself to be sidetracked by the wonders of the            world of Shenmue, you'll experience one of the most compelling and            unusual gaming experiences ever created. While this is certainly            not the last word in gaming which some enthusiasts had hoped for,            it may well be the first word in a whole new page in videogaming            history."}
