{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-dmc", "date": "8 Dec 2001", "game_name": "Devil May Cry", "text": "Devil May Cry is the latest game from Shinji Mikami, the designer            behind the Resident Evil and Dino Crisis series. Devil May Cry is            about as far from the horror survival genre as you can get though,            with the focus firmly on over-the-top madcap action rather than            shambling zombies.                        You play Dante, the son of a devil knight and a mortal woman.            Setting the tone for the rest of the game, the opening cutscene            sees a beautiful blonde in a revealing leather corset come crashing            through your door on a motorcycle to impale you with a sword.            Apparently this is just her way of being friendly though, because            before you know it the pair of you are off to a mysterious castle            on a distant island where the devil prince Mundus is preparing to            invade the land of the living.                        The result is twenty five missions chock full of carnage as you            guide Dante around the castle and the caves beneath it, with            occasional field trips to nearby sites such as a mausoleum and a            colosseum. Along the way you will be indulging in the wholesale            slaughter of some of the most bizarre looking creatures you will            find this side of American McGee's Alice. There are grim reaper            phantoms with lethal scythes, fast-moving lizardmen warriors that            burst out of the ground in a cloud of dust, cackling ghost witches            with what look like giant shears, and life-size marionettes which            drop down from their strings to attack you.                    The action is fast and furious almost from the outset, and in stark            contrast to the awkward controls and stilted movement of Resident            Evil's heroes and heroines, Dante leaps athletically around the            scenery, swinging his sword wildly and blazing away with his guns.                        The controls are incredibly intuitive, and even the special moves            are fairly easy to pull off. Indeed, it could be argued that the            controls are a little too simple, because at times you get            so sucked into the game that it almost feels like it's playing            itself. Whatever you do with the analogue stick, as long as you            keep hammering the circle button Dante will perform an intricate            but lethal ballet, slicing up enemies, thrusting and slashing with            his sword, hurling bodies several feet into the air and splattering            blood everywhere.                        The results are always spectacular, and the longer and more            involved your dance of death becomes, the more the game will reward            you for it. Simply slicing an enemy with a series of wild swings            will bring you a message of ~Dull~ at the top of the screen, but            this turns into ~Cool~ if you keep the blood flowing for long            enough or throw in a special move or two. Taking on a large number            of enemies simultaneously in an orgy of claret spraying action, you            can extend that to ~Bravo~ or ~Awesome~, eventually reaching the            lofty heights of ~Stylish~. It's not just an ego-massage either;            the higher the carnage rating of your kill, the more red orbs the            creature drops when it dies. And orbs mean prizes.                    Well, actually orbs mean power-ups. At the end of each mission you            are given the choice of spending some of your red orbs on buying            special items such as yellow orbs (which act as continues should            you get killed mid-mission), holy water (which damages any nearby            enemies when you use it) and blue orbs (which increase your maximum            health). All of these items can also be found hidden in dark            corners throughout the game if you hunt around a bit.                        More importantly, red orbs can be spent on new special moves,            thanks to the game's devil trigger system. You start out with only            a big hulking family heirloom of a sword inherited from your            demonic father and your trusty pistols Ebony and Ivory, which are            guaranteed not to leave anybody living, in perfect harmony or            otherwise. But as you battle your way through the game you will            come across new weapons - the thunder sword Alastor and the flame            gauntlets Ifrit - which can unleash the devil within you.                        Below your health bar you will see a series of runes lighting up as            you slash and swing with your chosen weapon. Arm yourself with with            Alastor or Ifrit, and once three or more of these runes are ignited            you can go into devil mode by pressing L1, giving you access to a            whole new set of insane special moves for as long as the runes stay            lit, or until you hit L1 again to return to human form. You can fly            through the air, turn your bullets into fireballs or electrical            bolts, create an inferno which spreads around Dante damaging            anything it touches, and generally create mayhem.                    These special powers become particularly useful when you take on            the vast demon boss characters, which include a giant lava spider            and a skeletal eagle the size of a small jet liner. The game only            includes four real bosses, plus Mundus himself, and you will meet            each of them three times, but luckily most of them will behave            slightly differently each time you fight them, with new locations,            powers and strategies to overcome.                        It's not all good news though. Battling the icky looking nightmare            boss does get rather repetitive, and the game in general tails off            a bit towards the end. Most of the monsters are introduced in the            first half of the game and just become more numerous and more            powerful later on, while less attention seems to have gone into the            dramatic camera angles in the closing stages of the game. Most of            the time these do an excellent job of showing off the spectacular            scenery around you without hampering the gameplay, but there are a            few points in the later missions where this doesn't work quite so            well.                        This is really nitpicking though, and apart from a few brief lapses            Devil May Cry is an incredibly enjoyable and well-designed game. It            also sports some of the most impressive graphics I have ever seen            on any platform, with the real-time 3D world in which you are            fighting putting the pre-rendered backdrops of yore to shame. From            the curvaceous castle turrets and semi-organic cathedral to the            lush foliage of the overgrown gardens and decaying splendour of            royal bedrooms, the graphics are nothing short of spectacular. The            audio side of the game is also excellent, with decent voice acting,            solid sound effects and a soundtrack mixing classical-style            background music with pulsing industrial-strength Prodigy-style            techno for the battles. If this doesn't get your blood pumping,            you're probably already dead.                    Devil May Cry is perhaps not the deepest of games, revolving as it            does around slaughtering demons and finding the appropriate            key-substitute to open the next door, but it's certainly one of the            most stylish and downright entertaining I've played in recent            months. It also has plenty of replay value, because although I            finished all twenty five missions in around six hours, each time            you complete the game you will unlock new modes with more powerful            and more numerous monsters, and additional special powers for both            Dante and his enemies. In fact, if anything the game was even more            fun the second time through than it was the first. What, are you            still here? Go out and buy this game now!"}
