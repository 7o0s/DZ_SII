The basic premise is simple enough - instead of charging you                 upwards of \u00a330 for a huge sprawling epic like previous                 Heroes games, you pay \u00a315 a pop for four seperate                 stand-alone episodes.                    These are centered around the exploits of the barbarian Tarnum, who            leads his people to freedom in a costly war against the wizards who            have enslaved them in the first of the four games, ~Warlords of the            Wasteland~. After Tarnum's death he is brought back by his people's            gods to make amends for his sins, and finds himself trying to save            the soul of the man who killed him in ~Conquest of the Underworld~.            He then becomes the immortal champion, and in ~Clash of the            Dragons~ finds himself amongst the long-lived elves, trying to            discover why the once friendly dragons have suddenly disappeared.            Finally in ~Master of the Elements~ he finds himself wandering the            four planes trying to stop a war between the elemental lords which            is threatening to spill over on to his own world. Although the            stories are interlinked and make slightly more sense if played in            the right order, you don't need to play them all in            sequence.                    Each of the four Chronicles has a single linear campaign of eight            scenarios, starting with small maps and easy objectives and working            their way up to vast sprawling missions which can take hours or            even days to complete. These are peppered with text messages which            usually appear at the start of a turn, and which reveal a little            more of the plot or give you an insight into Tarnum's character.            Sadly, as we have come to expect from New World, these are fairly            poorly written, at times long-winded, and rather stilted. In            previous games in the series it didn't matter too much, but in            Chronicles the storyline is central to the game and the little            message boxes seem to pop up almost every other turn, making them            hard to ignore.         Apart from the                 increased focus on storytelling though, the basic gameplay                 will be instantly familiar to fans of the series. Tarnum and                 the other heroes you recruit are moved around on a map,                 picking up the items which have been carelessly left scattered                 around on the ground, taking control of the mines, lumber                 yards and other resource points available, and fighting both                 neutral creatures and any enemy heroes.                    Each map features one or more towns which you can conquer, although            this is not always necessary to win a scenario. These towns can be            upgraded with a wide range of different buildings, from            marketplaces (to trade goods) and taverns (to recruit new heroes)            to various kinds of barracks which can each produce a certain            number of a single type of unit each week ready for you to hire, if            you have the necessary gold.                    There is an almost bewildering range of units on offer, from            dragons and angels to archers and minotaurs, from pegasi and            unicorns to genies and hell hounds. Each type of town can produce            seven different units, plus an upgraded version of each, but the            themed nature of the Chronicles means that unlike in previous            Heroes games you aren't overwhelmed. Instead of bombarding you with            hundreds of units from a dozen different types of town within a            single campaign, they are evenly spread amongst the four games.         As the title of the game suggests though, the focus is very            much on the hero, as his offensive and defensive statistics and any            relevant skills alter the stats of troops under his or her command,            which in turn has a great effect on the outcome of a battle.                    A high level character with a small army can easily destroy a much            larger force with a less experienced leader, and this is especially            true once magic gets involved. Some of the high level spells are            ridiculously effective, such as the infamous ~implosion~ spell,            which causes an obscene amount of damage and can wipe out entire            units in the hands of a powerful wizard. Powerful magical artifacts            only make your heroes even more deadly, increasing their            statistics, giving their troops immunity to certain spells, or            producing extra resources for you.                    Because of this you will find yourself spending a lot of time            shuffling your heroes around the map from one special location to            another to make sure they are as powerful as possible by the time            the scenario ends. For example, there are mercenary camps which you            can improve your combat abilities, towers where you can raise your            magical skills, obelisks which give you extra experience, knowledge            trees which increase your level, and so on and so forth. The maps            are positively packed with items, power-ups, resources, landmarks,            wandering monsters and special locations to visit, and it does look            rather silly at times when you find yourself in a world where it's            hard to walk a couple of miles without treading on a heap of gold            coins or a powerful artifact. Most of the time it's not too bad,            but a few maps just look plain ridiculous, and quickly devolve into            running around hoovering up everything before the enemy can get to            it.         Unlike the last                 release in the on-going Heroes saga, the Chronicles games                 don't include a seperate tutorial, although the slim manuals                 included with each of them do cover all of the basics. Instead                 you will receive suggestions from your advisors as you play                 through the first couple of scenarios in each Chronicle,                 ranging from the blindingly obvious to the fairly useful.                    The learning curve is also somewhat smoother than in Heroes III,            meaning that newcomers to the series are less likely to be left            adrift. That doesn't mean that this is Heroes Lite though - the            last few missions of each campaign are still rather difficult, and            should provide a decent challenge for all but the most hardened of            Heroes addicts. Unfortunately the games offer very little which is            actually new, and although they are a good enough introduction for            newcomers to the series, the continued lack of any development in            the series may start to grate with more experienced players.                    The towns types and buildings are all strangely familiar, as are            the units, the spells, most of the terrain tiles and special items,            many of the heroes you can hire, and even the music. New animated            menus and some impressive pre-rendered cutscenes aren't enough to            shake the feeling that we've seen it all before. The game even uses            an apparently unmodified version of the Heroes III engine, and most            of the artwork is from the previous Heroes games as well. It's all            beginning to look a little tired, and an overhaul with support for            higher resolutions and more detailed and smoothly animated sprites            would be welcome. Maybe in Heroes IV?         At the end                 of the day the Heroes Chronicles games are effectively just                 four more mission packs for the already over-sold Heroes III,                 with little new to offer apart from a new character, a new                 storyline, and a single eight mission campaign for each. Given                 that you can now pick up Heroes III Complete (which includes                 around 20 campaigns) for no more than the cost of two                 Chronicles, it begins to look a little silly.                    If you are new to the series, buying one of the Chronicles is as            good a place to start as any thanks to its budget pricing and            gentle learning curve, but if you find that you like it you would            probably be better off buying one of the many huge Heroes III            bundles on offer instead of getting the other three Chronicles.                    If you are an experienced Heroes player, the Chronicles are more of            a light snack than a four course meal, and you may want to save            your pennies in the hopes that a true sequel will be released next            year. With any luck rather more effort will go into the next            installment...                    -        Heroes                    III : Shadow of Death reviewHeroes                    III : Shadow of Death reviewHeroes                    Chronicles previewHeroes                    Chronicles previewAge of                    Wonders reviewAge of                    Wonders review"}
