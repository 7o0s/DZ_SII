Cataclysm is not a ~true~ sequel to Homeworld in that it only            provides a new set of missions, one new race, and a few interface            and gameplay improvements over the original. However, it does not            require a copy of the original to run, and unlike many mission            packs it retails for the price of a full game.                    For anyone unfamiliar with the original game, Cataclysm is a            real-time strategy game set in space. Taking its initial            inspiration from traditional strategy games such as the ~Command            & Conquer~ series, players must build up a base (or mothership,            in the case of Cataclysm), and use it to construct more ships, both            to gather resources (necessary for sustained construction) and to            attack the enemy.                    The storyline is set 15 years after the colonisation of Hiigara -            the new ~homeworld~ reached at the end of the original game. The            player takes command of what is initially an unimportant mining            vessel, but as you progress through the game you gradually get            given more important missions, and access to new technologies. The            storyline is told through both FMV cutscenes and in-game ones,            although calling it ~full motion~ video is something of a misnomer,            as the video clips are generally rather unanimated panning shots            with a voiceover. The in-game cutscenes are much more impressive            though, putting the Homeworld engine to good use.                    The storyline itself is quite interesting, if rather clich\u00e9d,            and unlike in many games it has a direct effect on the missions -            objectives are varied, and story segments frequently occur during            levels. Voiceovers are used extensively, although unfortunately the            actors used are a mixed bunch, with some sections sounding            distinctly wooden.                    As you might expect, Cataclysm plays very similarly to the original            Homeworld, and many of the ships are simply slightly modified            versions of those found in the original game. Most worthy of note            are the new ~worker~ ships, which combine the functions of most of            the original game's utility vessels into one general-purpose unit,            and the Acolyte and Mimic vessels, two of which can be linked            together to form a single, more powerful unit.                    And in a move that will please those disappointed by the original            game's carbon-copy races, a new and significantly different race            (known as ~the Beast~) has been added, giving the game some            much-needed variety, especially in multiplayer. The Beast do not            have any ships of their own, but instead make use of ships stolen            from other races and then duplicated. This has a significant impact            on the gameplay, as whilst Somtaaw (human) players can research            technologies as in the first game, Beast players must capture and            reverse-engineer ships before they can research the technologies            involved. This makes a huge difference to gameplay strategies, as            keeping the Beast from gaining technologies is extremely important.                    Another change which has a major effect on strategies is the            addition of ~support modules~. Unlike in Homeworld, where you could            build as many ships as you wanted up to an arbitrary game limit, in            Cataclysm it is necessary to build these modules to increase the            number of ships you can construct. Whilst this does reduce the            opportunities to rush players with large numbers of smaller ships,            it has the effect of slowing down the initial stages of the game            massively - it is simply not possible to build enough small ships            to launch a serious assault, so players are forced to research more            advanced technologies before their fleet can pose a threat to            others.                    This is also related to another gameplay problem Cataclysm suffers            from - large ships (especially motherships) are ridiculously hard            to destroy without a huge number of heavy assault vessels, making            fast or stealth attacks virtually worthless. This slows the game            down, and frequently reduces the endgame to a simple war of            attrition, which can drag on due to the limited number of support            modules available, as a result of which players will often have            similar size fleets.                    One of the problems with the original Homeworld was that the            playing area was usually big and uniform (with the exception of            resource positioning), meaning that there was little or no            advantage to holding a particular position.                    Cataclysm has rectified this to a large degree by adding new            terrain elements such as asteroid belts (which damage larger ships            that move through them), and slipgates. Slipgates are simply            wormholes which allow ships to move instantaneously between two            points on the map. This effectively creates ~choke points~ similar            to those found in ground-based games, which offer a significant            strategic advantage to whichever player holds them. Unfortunately            your ships will not use them voluntarily, and when moving ships            through a gate manually they often get spaced out and come through            in small groups - a major problem if the enemy are waiting on the            other side. The camera is also unhelpful, as rather than following            ships through a gate it gets stuck on one side, forcing the player            to manually move it to the destination point.                    There have also been many minor tweaks made to the interface in            Cataclysm. Sadly, many of these changes are fairly arbitrary and            nonsensical - the simple button usage of the first game has been            replaced with an odd mix of right and left-clicking, and many            useful commands (such as the ~harvest~ option for worker ships)            have been moved onto submenus. Fortunately the developers have            included an option to switch to an original Homeworld style control            system for players of the previous game, as well as the ability to            turn individual modifications on and off. The changes are not all            bad though - the ability to display information on selected ships            and items being constructed and researched on the HUD is extremely            useful.                    A few of the interface changes have an effect on the gameplay as            well - the addition of waypoints means that setting up patrols is            now possible, it is easier to select wings of ships whilst in            battle, and the fact that fog-of-war now affects resources means            that it is necessary to go looking for asteroids to mine. The basic            Homeworld problem of being unable to select small, fast-moving            ships remains, however, meaning that micromanagement of battles is            still something of a chore.                    This would not be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that            the ship AI is fairly abysmal, and does not appear to have improved            since the original. Ships can be put into various formations or set            to be ~evasive~, ~neutral~ or ~aggressive~, but in battle they            frequently seem to ignore these orders and do their own thing.            Getting a wing of ships to all attack the same target is very hard.                    Another regular annoyance is the way that selecting one ship out of            an enemy wing will cause your ships to destroy that single ship and            then stop (or wander off elsewhere) rather than destroying the            entire wing. This poor AI often cripples the computer opponents as            well, resulting in ships sitting idle during battle, or even            ignoring enemies attacking them! That said, apart from this the            enemy AI seems reasonably competent, managing to put up a good            fight for the most part.                    One area that has been improved in Cataclysm though are the            graphics, which were already pretty impressive in the original            game. The most obvious changes are the addition of animation on            some of the ship models, and much higher resolution textures. This            second change is particularly important, as ships look            significantly better when they are close to the camera. More            subtly, the backgrounds have been changed to include features such            as lightning storms and planets (although these are strictly            scenery and play no part in battles).                    The sound, on the other hand, is very unremarkable. Sound effects            seem to be almost identical to those in the first game, with a            reasonable collection of explosions, laser sounds, and all the            usual noises you expect to hear in a vacuum. The radio chatter from            the ships adds to the atmosphere, although it can get annoying            after a while - fortunately there is an option to turn it off. The            in-game music isn't particularly bad, or particularly good - for            the most part it's just very average background music. Personally            I'd recommend some of the superb Babylon 5 battle music if you want            something that fits the atmosphere of the game better.                    Cataclysm is largely more of the same. Some of the changes made to            the game have improved it (the new race, slipgates, the new ships),            whilst others (support modules, the interface) have made it worse.            On average though, I would say that Cataclysm is marginally better            than the original. The single player game is undoubtedly more            enjoyable, whilst the multiplayer is still flawed but nevertheless            worth a few games.                    Cataclysm is very definitely worthwhile if you enjoyed the            original, or if you have not played it and think you might be            interested in this unique style of real-time strategy game. If, on            the other hand, you were not a fan of the first game, then            Cataclysm probably does not offer anything sufficiently different            to warrant attention.                        -        Homeworld                    reviewHomeworld                    reviewHomeworld                    Cataclysm screenshotsHomeworld                    Cataclysm screenshots"}
