Now Rowan have added better terrain graphics, more            aircraft, great clouds, a more involving campaign and functioning            multiplayer. Surely this has to be a recipe for success?                         The game offers three modes of play - training missions,            individual missions and campaigns. You can fly the Hurricane or            Spitfire for the Royal Air Force or the Messerschmidt-109 and -110            and the Junkers-87 for the Luftwaffe. As an interesting sideshow            you can even fly as a gunner in the three German medium bombers            used in the battle, fending off aggressive British pilots with your            single machinegun from one of three positions in each aircraft.                         In the campaigns you can direct the air war from either side in as            much detail as you wish, from giving general directives to            specifying raid composition and tactics for individual targets. You            can jump in and fly any of your aircraft at any time, scrambling            from Manston in your Spit or approaching London in your Heinkel.                    The flight simulator section of the game is at once spell-binding            and disappointing. Many new players will be initially put off by            the game's obvious deficiencies, but delve deeper and you will find            a sim whose main asset is the quality of the combat. Rather like            the original Flanker simulation, Battle of Britain eschews eye            candy in favour of tough opponent AI and murderous dogfights that            cartwheel over the Kent coast and tumble over the docks of London.            Get on a Messerschmidt's tail and he will lead you through a merry            dance of turns, scissors, spiral dives and chandelles.            Unsurprisingly the moves are similar to those in Mig Alley - why            change it if it works so well? The addition of clouds has made a            significant improvement - it adds a close reference point to give a            sense of speed that would otherwise be missing at six thousand            feet. Now as your your Hurricane follows the pair of Stukas into            the canyon between the clouds you can actually feel how fast you            are going.                         Unfortunately the clouds will cut some fifty percent off your            framerate, though if you have a fast enough machine this will not            necessarily be a problem - partly because measured framerates are            high and partly because the stuttering problem makes it seem as            though you have a low framerate anyway. Still, at least the clouds            look great, which is more than can be said for the banded sky,            awful propellor, fuzzy aircraft and cartoonish terrain - this is            not a sim you will be buying for its good looks, fancy reflections            notwithstanding. Nor, it must be said, will you be buying it for            the sounds - other aircraft passing seem to sound louder than your            own aircraft and cannon and machinegun fire are barely            distinguishable. Having said that, speech is pretty good,            especially the accurate German radio calls and fighter jargon.                         Furthermore, though streets ahead of much of the competition            Battle of Britain does not demonstrate quite the flight model and            combat fidelity it claims. The flight model appears to have too            little drag and too high a roll rate, leaving the Messerschmidt            markedly inferior in the manoeuvrability stakes, yet without its            power advantage in boom and zoom combat. Indeed the combat model,            suited to Mig Alley where the Mig 15 had a slight edge on the            Sabre, leaves the Messerschmidt using ahistorical tight turn            tactics, easy prey for a competent Spitfire driver. This makes the            Spitfire the aircraft of choice for every mission - kills are much            harder to come by in the 109.                         None of this makes Battle of Britain a game that should be            overlooked. Unlike some other dogfighting games, you never feel            that your opponent has a limited repetoire of scripted moves -            instead you will need to keep your eyes peeled as you follow your            prey through his twists and turns. Rowan's excellent viewing            system, first seen in Flying Corps in 1996, makes a welcome            reappearance here and there is a lot of fun to be had in a Stuka            over Southampton or a Hurricane over Margate.                    The campaign section of the game is an absolute masterpiece. It            gives the player a whole new dimension of the air battle to explore            and sets his individual efforts as a fighter pilot in the wider            context of the war. The player can take the part of the German air            commander, marshalling strikes and choosing targets, or the part of            British fighter control, choosing which squadrons will patrol the            gaps in the radar coverage, who will be on standby to scramble and            who needs a good rest and refit.                         The campaign follows the historical course of events, with the            Germans striking at convoys and radar stations first, followed by            determined attacks on RAF airfields, with the London Blitz as the            grand finale. There is a hindsight option, in which the Germans            play to an optimum game plan, rather than sticking rigidly to the            events of 1940 but it will not vary the game too much, though it is            tougher.                         The screen displays the Channel area divided into fighter group            zones, with little historical markers displaying the squadrons as            they take off. Together with the excellent sound in this section it            is easy to feel part of the defence of Britain, watching the raid            markers come sweeping in over the Channel or head west around your            patrol line. At no point do you have absolute knowledge - if the            south coast radar stations are down you will only pick up the raids            as the Royal Observer Corps spot them from the ground. Even when            you do spot them they are likely to dogleg at the last minute and            fool your intercepting patrols about their real target. If you are            the German commander you will need to reconnoitre constantly to            establish whether the Kent and Sussex airbases you wish to attack            that afternoon are in use and what state they are in.                         It is in this part of the game that Rowan's much vaunted massive            raids take place, with over 300 aircraft in your area at once.            Needless to say this has an impact on your framerate and in fact            it's not really much to look at, just lots of dots with the            occasional single pixel line depicting smoke. Mass dogfights swirl            around you, but your experience of them probably will not be            significantly different from the single squadron battles of the            single missions, though 70 Messerschmidts heading your way will            certainly wake you up. It can be fun to jump into a bomber as top            gunner for a while, but it will not hold your attention for long.                    Rowan are to be commended for putting realism first, denying pilots            easy kills but making it all the more rewarding when they come. The            British aircraft are afflicted with puny armament, the .303            machineguns lacking the punch for quick kills. Getting a kill at            all in a mission is good, two kills being quite difficult given the            ammunition constraints. Unlike other simulations, you are not going            to become an ace in one mission. This may put oof casual players,            but is a nice break from the more arcade flight and damage models            found elsewhere.                         Other realistic elements include a proper engine start-up            sequence, propellor torque and damage to flaps and landing gear if            lowered at high speeds. In dogfights the enemy often disappears            below the nose of your aircraft as you pull lead pursuit to bring            your guns to bear, leaving you essentially blind when you fire, a            feature commented on by pilots of the period. When an aircraft is            fatally hit there may be the conventional explosion, debris and            smoke or the aircraft may simply fail to pull out of a dive, its            pilot dead at the controls - quite a shock if you are racing down            behind him.                         Another facet that will please the hardcore crowd is the            functional multiplayer, including cooperative missions, for up to            eight pilots. This is a marked improvement from Mig Alley, where            multiplayer was the single worst feature. Battle of Britain is            playable, though like most games it can suffer from lag.                    Battle of Britain comes close to achieving excellence, given its            detailed campaign and challenging dogfights. However the game's            flaws lead to an initial poor impression that only partially            dissipates, given that European Air War back in 1998 had better            terrain, skies and smoothness of flight. Flight simulations are            notoriously difficult to get right and Battle of Britain is a            valiant effort: experienced pilots looking for a challenge or a            history lesson should consider this game - beginners might be            better off elsewhere."}
