For the past couple of weeks I                 have been beholding Motocross Madness 2, Microsoft's latest                 hairdryer-'em-up, and my goodness is it beautiful.                    Harping on about a game's graphics right at the start of a review            might seem a little unusual, but this game's sheer aesthetic            delight is what stands out so obviously above all the rest of its            features. Hills roll gently into the distance and disappear into            the light mist. Blimps, planes and helicopters hover above the vast            tracks, slyly vying for your attention as you race, and wonderful            set-pieces creep up on you as you progress across the landscapes.            The game is a visual treat.                    With the graphics engine stroking out of the way then, what is            Motocross Madness 2 all about? Well, as if it wasn't obvious from            the title, you take control of a two-wheeled buzzing death machine            (my affectionate term for 'motorbike') and proceed to propel your            hapless rider across a variety of landscapes and tracks at a            veritably trouser-filling speed. Add to this the opportunity to            throw the poor guy over hillocks and from off the top of huge            cliffs, and you start to get the basic idea.         In order to create some point to your Evel                 Knievel imitations, there are five game modes available for                 you to try out. Enduro is a sprawling free-form checkpoint                 race, with riders making their own routes between each point                 in real life locations such as air strips, building sites and                 small tropical villages.                    Baja is similar, but features more open landscapes like canyons and            desert ranges. Stunt mode has the riders charging around the            landscape performing tricks for points. National is a            straightforward race on tough, tight outdoor circuits, while            Supercross features some extremely tricky indoor tracks.                    Of all these, Stunt is by far the most enjoyable mode simply            because of the sheer freedom to do pretty much anything you like            within the specified time limit. It seems the more freedom handed            to you, the more fun you can have. Something about exploring the            landscapes and accidentally finding the perfect stunt range is            infinitely more enjoyable than being confined to the frustratingly            difficult tracks.                    What makes the circuit racing modes so unpleasant is their harsh            layout and the unfairness to human players. If you so much as            squirm slightly off-course, you are given five seconds to get back            on the track precisely where you came off or be dragged back            there. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so easy to hurtle out            of control and spin off the track in a cloud of dust. Although they            are really a necessary part of a motocross game, the circuit racing            modes could well be done without in this case, as the open            landscape racing modes more than satiated my needs for a fun arcade            racer.         Alongside the freely configurable racing modes                 against computer controlled riders, there is also a single                 player career mode in which you compete in a series of set                 events for money.                    You start this mode at the very bottom of the motocross racing            food-chain as a measly flannel-shirted grub, and race against other            opponents attempting to catch the eye of would-be sponsors by            performing well in each race, as well as displaying your flair for            aerial acrobatics. The money you earn in each race is spent            automatically for you on bike repairs and medical costs, which            disappointingly strips away any form of self-management.                    You don't have any choice at all over what you do in this mode, and            your progress is strictly linear as you unlock each track one by            one. Truth be told, this mode is worth only a fraction of            attention, if any at all, as you can have so much more fun racing            against CPU opponents in games which you can set up yourself.            There's no real reason for you to put yourself through the career            mode, and it serves only as a minor distraction.                    But the game's real beauty lies in the clearly laborious attention            to detail. From the shrubs and trees dotted across the landscape to            the intricate landmarks and breathtaking undulating landscapes,            everything is rendered with a wondrous clarity which I haven't            experienced to this level before.                    This is particularly evident on the Enduro races, as you jostle for            position amongst roaming traffic, as airborne vehicles (including            other riders) travel overhead - everything has a wonderful sense of            simply being that's quite hard to describe unless you see it            all moving. Of course, when you're racing, you hardly get to            appreciate these wonderful details, which is where the facility to            record and playback races comes into its own - only then do you get            a true idea of how gorgeous the game really can be.         If racing against the sometimes strangely                 perfect computer controlled riders begins to bore you, you can                 always take on some real-life opposition online using                 Microsoft's Gaming Zone. Having to use this dire piece of                 Internet Explorer based software is a real pain, and it's                 clearly time that developers realised in-game server browsers                 are where it's at. Man.                    However, once in a game it's all plain sailing from there on in.            The netcode is very solid and is kind to both high and low-ping            players - very rarely did I notice lag having any effect on the            game, and even then it was extremely momentary. Of course, the only            real way to play multiplayer games is over a LAN, and it is            here that MCM2 really shines in most game modes, although the            circuit racing still proves to be a chore.                    Available for use in multiplayer games are all the single player            game modes, as well as the really rather fun Tag game, in which one            rider is ~it~ and the others have to make contact with him to            become ~it~. The player who was ~it~ for the longest period after            the time limit is up is the winner. It's surprising how such a            simple idea can be so much fun, and alongside the Stunt event this            one of the most entertaining parts of the game.         Motocross Madness 2 is a                 tremendous laugh, if exceedingly tough at times for an arcade                 game. The circuit races could be a little more forgiving on                 the human player, and the AI of the CPU players could do with                 some tweaking to ensure that they don't manage to land                 unfeasibly difficult jumps every single time.                    To say that the game couldn't have been better would be to lie -            it's not that much of a progression from the original to be truly            outstanding, but it's definitely a huge leap in the right            direction, particularly in regards to the multiplayer side of            things."}
