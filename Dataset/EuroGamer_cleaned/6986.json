Playing them almost makes you feel like you're part of some            bizarre cult; the cult of the obscure fighter, perhaps, and there            are a lot to play. Some of them even make it to the West.            The PowerStone series did a sterling job, for instance, and now            Sega are having another crack, with AM2's Fighting Vipers 2.                         The original Fighting Vipers was quite a typical Sega            fighter. Enclosed arenas, cutesy models and refreshing gameplay.            All right so it was mildly obscure, but after the success of Virtua            Fighter 3 it deserved a rehash. The game, Fighting Vipers 2,            developed by arcade heroes AM2 hit Japanese arcades in 1997. It            flopped, big style. When it turned up in Western arcades nobody            even raised an eyebrow in its direction.                         Despite proving something of a non-starter for AM2 (which is quite            rare), FV2 was duly converted to the Dreamcast and released to            Japan, where it did tolerably well. Well enough even, to spawn a            translation for the West. Unfortunately, it hasn't been worth the            wait.                    For starters, the game makes you feel like you are controlling a            Power Ranger. The flamboyant uniforms that your ~Vipers~ are decked            out in just make no sense. The Vipers, by the way are an obscure            group of kids who have formed a gang and find themselves hunted by            the infamous (and stupidly named) ~BM~. Who just so happens to be a            raving lunatic. BM has erected an modern-day Alcatraz to keep the            Vipers in, but he has to catch them first.                         The single player game features 11 forgettable character, each of            which boasts two layers of armour for protection. The controls are            similar to Virtua Fighter 3, with one button for blocking, one for            punches and one for kicks. It plays rather like the original            Fighting Vipers, with a couple of additions, like the ability to            use all three buttons in conjunction to initiate a parry or mid-air            block.                         The armour has a major part to play - as you pummel your opponent,            gradually you drain his armour until he is so weak that you can use            a Power Move to finish him off. Generally these Power Moves are            souped up versions of your usual repertoire of kicks and punches,            and before you perform one your character flashes for a second or            so (during which time your opponent can opt to parry or take it            like a man).                    The combat zones are flat, like Virtua Fighters', but are also            fenced off, either by coils of barb wire, walls or similar. If you            execute a Power Move, you can often drive your opponent through the            enclosure in a dramatic conclusion to the bout.                         Rather annoyingly, aside from Power Moves, fighters can also            execute Super Kos, which is described as the ultimate conclusion,            but is actually pretty daft. It gives the person on their last legs            one chance to win the match, by performing an absurd            multi-dimensional and often physics-defying knockout blow. For            instance, one employs a tactical nuclear missile. Need I say more?                         The translation is also a little dodgy here. For instance, the            text gives no hint as to why you plunge your enemy into a city that            then explodes around them. Is this funny? Is it for the benefit of            Anime fans? Is it a programming in-joke?                    Ultimately, Fighting Vipers 2 is a good game, but it's all been            done before. Dead or Alive 2 and Soul Calibur take it to the            cleaners on plenty of counts, and that's before we mention things            like the shoddy backgrounds and bugs.                         Yes, bugs. I won't bore you with examples, but it's mostly            scripting errors. Things like Super KOs not coming off correctly            and just sitting their in limbo.                         Visually the game is rather sub-standard too. The backgrounds are            pretty hideous at times - after playing Capcom's latest ultra            hi-res fighters with their superb texturing, this just looks            shoddy. The character designs are far too childish too. Power            Rangers for heaven's sake. They wear thin very quickly.                         In terms of longevity, the game hasn't got a chance in hell of            keeping up with Dead or Alive 2 or Soul Calibur, again. Beyond the            single player mode (which itself does little to hold your interest)            there is nothing really. Survival Mode is at best blas\u00e9 and at            worst a waste of time, Training is very one-dimensional and as for            the secret characters and such - they aren't worth searching for.                         As we hinted in our preview (which was based on an imported copy),            it's not enough that Fighting Vipers 2 be translated, it needs to            be spruced up as well, and this just hasn't happened. As it is, at            least the Japanese version's incomprehensible gibberish gives it            some character. Fighting Vipers 2 for the West is a dismal swansong            for AM2 and their Dreamcast contributions. Lets hope they pull            something amazing out of the bag in the next few months to make up            for this. Needless to say, don't waste your money on FV2."}
