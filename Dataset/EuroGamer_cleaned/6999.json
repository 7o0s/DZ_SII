For those of you unfamiliar with the basic concept, mechs are huge            bipedal robots (normally roughly human-shaped) which can carry a            bewildering array of offensive weaponry and can traverse virtually            any terrain. In the Mechwarrior universe these walking tanks form            the core of a world's army, and virtually every other battlefield            weapon has been reduced to a support role.                    The previous Mechwarrior games were largely based around conflicts            between the warlike Clans who left the immediate vicinity of the            Solar System, and the people of the ~Inner Sphere~ who remained            behind. However, Mechwarrior 4 is concerned with a much smaller            civil war within the Inner Sphere, and one man's quest for revenge            against those who killed most of his family. By reducing the scope            of the game in this way, the developers have made the game much            more accessible to those who haven't played the previous            installments or read the books.                    While the nicely-produced intro movie manages admirably to            introduce the player to the mech concept and the basis of the            storyline, nobody seems to have pointed out this new            newbie-friendly strategy to whoever wrote the installer - the            preface given during installation is loaded down with unnecessary            details and Mechwarrior terminology.                    However, this is not much of a problem as (in common with the            previous games) the storyline is largely irrelevant anyway - apart            from the occasional bit of plot during missions, the story is            relayed almost entirely through postage-stamp size video messages            from your crewmembers. These would be fine, except that they are            overly lengthy and it is often hard to tell which are actually            relevant to your mission and which are simply filler. To add insult            to injury, the clever feature of letting you prepare for your            mission whilst watching these is ruined as the single most            time-consuming task (altering your mech configuration) causes the            video to stop!                    The missions themselves are pretty standard fare, generally            involving either destroying or defending something. While they are            quite well scripted, it can occasionally be annoying that you are            not given precise information about what is necessary to complete            the tasks. It is often necessary to play a mission several times to            discover what will happen and how to deal with it. To make things            more interesting you get new mech components as salvage from enemy            units destroyed in each mission, and most missions also give you a            choice of Lancemates (the Mechwarrior equivalent of wingmen), who            can be given simple orders.                    Once into a mission the game plays like a cross between a tank            simulator and a first person shooter. Unlike more action-orientated            mecha titles such as ~Shogo~ or ~Virtual On~, Mechwarrior's mechs            are cumbersome beasts. The torso can be rotated independently of            the legs, allowing you to walk in one direction and fire in            another, but there are virtually no opportunities for particularly            sudden maneuvers such as dodging incoming fire. As a result combat            is largely decided by your choice of weapons and basic tactics,            rather than reactions or clever piloting.                    The control system has been simplified slightly since the previous            games, but there are still a large number of controls and it is            highly recommended that you use either a mouse or a joystick in            addition to the keyboard - preferably one with as many buttons as            possible. The complexity of the controls can get annoying at times,            as you struggle to remember what the light-amplification key is, or            how to flush your coolant supply.                    At first the control system actually seems worse than that in the            previous games, as the most useful operation (firing) is now split            across a number of buttons - there is one for each weapon group,            and fire modes can be set to cycle through weapon groups. This does            become more intuitive and useful after a while, but stops just            short of being configurable enough to cope with some of the setups            that ~expert~ pilots will want, and initially it is extremely            annoying as you end up using completely the wrong weapon for no            apparent reason!                    The in-game graphics are pretty good - the animation on the mechs            is simply superb, and there are lots of neat touches like the dust            and snow kicked up by their feet. In comparison, however, most of            the other models look rather bland, and there are frequent ~level            of detail~ artifacts as objects come into view.                    The detail in the environments is somewhat variable as well - great            care has been taken on some locations, whilst others are little            more than collections of stock objects. But a special mention must            be given to the zoom function, which is really nicely implemented.            When activated a rectangular area in the center of the screen is            magnified, allowing you to snipe at enemy units whilst still            keeping an eye on what is going on around you. There is also the            somewhat useful ability to quickly look left, right and behind you,            although annoyingly there is a delay when looking left and right            that makes this feature less useful than it should be.                    Also making a welcome appearance is a health indicator for the            currently targeted unit, alongside the traditional Mechwarrior            damage location indicator. This makes it much easier to judge when            an enemy unit is going to die, allowing you to avoid wasting            precious ammo on it. And as with all the Mechwarrior games,            individual mech components can be damaged, meaning that it is            possible to blow limbs or weapons off enemy craft, correspondingly            reducing their effectiveness. In comparison with the other games            though Mechs seem to be substantially more sturdy this time round -            in particular it is no longer easier to simply remove both legs            from an enemy mech and leave them stranded than to actually kill            them ~properly~.                    The music and sound effects fit the game very well; the sweeping            soundtrack fits the pace of the game's battles perfectly, and while            the effects do not break any new ground they do add immeasurably to            the atmosphere. The only downside is the acting in the cutscenes,            which ranges from being acceptable to simply downright poor.            However, this is only a minor concern as there is relatively little            FMV (and even less of actual importance or interest).                    Overall then Mechwarrior 4 is the best Mechwarrior game to date,            although it still has some small flaws which keep it from being a            must-purchase. Those who prefer first person shooter style action            would be better off looking at games like ~Shogo~ or the ~Heavy            Gear~ series, but for anyone who wants a mech ~simulator~ this is            by far the best offering out there and has much to recommend it            over its predecessors."}
