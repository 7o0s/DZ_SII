I'd guess the answer was            ~ages ago~ for most of us, for the simple reason that home games            machines have become incredibly powerful, and there's no longer the            aspirational value attached to going to a deafening smoky room            chock full of cutting edge gaming cabinets.                    This death of the arcade is one thing, but perhaps the greater            tragedy is the gradual loss of instant 'arcade action' gameplay,            with ever more value placed on the more beardy, more cerebral, but            often less fun world of the simulation.                    And, if one genre has suffered in this respect perhaps more than            any other then it's driving - and rally driving specifically. Not            being of the petrol headed persuasion, the thought of tinkering            with suspension settings and faffing with changing tyres fills me            with an irrational dread. I. Just. Want. To. Play. The. Sodding.            Game.                    So, if there was ever a Rally game tailored specifically to tap            into a gamers' arcade instincts, it's Shox. No faffing, no            tweaking, no murderously dull technical detail, just mentally fast,            in your face 60fps action that hooks you from the off.                    As with every driving game, there's a ton of tracks and cars to            unlock. But the system of unlocking new modes is far more            forgiving, and accessible than many others in the genre. Ploughing            through each of the five car classes relies on getting a good            average placing - but rather than force you to play through each            track in order, you can return later to certain tricky tracks and            master them until you finally get a placing average good enough for            you to win the trophy.        With a greater emphasis            on fun and the casual gamer - in typical EA style - the early            tracks are quite easy, so almost anyone can jump straight into the            game and get some semblance of success, rather than be forced to go            through hoops to learn some anal control mechanics. To add to the            sense of insanity, each track has three 'Shox' zones, which are            essentially checkpoints that reward the player with medals (Gold,            Silver, or Bronze) depending on how quickly you make it through.            And as an added incentive, if you manage to score Gold in each            zone, a screen warping Shockwave is triggered, which if you can            ride adds wads of cash to your total.                    With this in mind, initial impressions can be that Shox is the            bimbo of Rally games, full of graphical gimmicks and slow motion            show off moments, but it's justifiable. To pull off a great arcade            game is to make sure of one basic thing - 60 frames per second -            and Shox is without question one of, if not the smoothest, and            fastest driving game yet seen on the PS2. Word has it that            developers EA UK knocked this up in just eight months - and on the            evidence in front of our eyes, this is one hell of an achievement,            with a slick, assured look that is a world away from the bland,            sterile look of nearly all PS2 racers to date (GT3 aside).                    Ok, so Shox looks nice, granted, but look beyond the eye candy and            the rewards are there. Progression from the second and third car            classes sees Shox really beginning to display a pleasing amount of            depth, while still retaining that classic One-More-Go arcade            gameplay that keeps you up to 4.30 a.m with bleeding eyes.        As always with driving games,            the car's the star, and attempting to tackle Shox with the wrong            one can have frustrating consequences. But if you're really fed up,            there are two ways out of your dilemma: either buy another one (if            you've clocked up enough prize money), or gamble a much lesser            stake in a short one on one race to the finish line. Buying a car            is usually frustratingly out of reach, so gambling ends up being            your most likely avenue of progression. Sadly, EA has, erm,            shockingly misjudged this method, to the point that it can - in            some cases - take 10 or more attempts to win the car - by which            time you've spent almost as much as it cost to buy the damn thing            outright, and suffered a fair bit of frustration into the bargain.                    One of the more controversial elements of Shox that will also            divide gamers is the handling. And guess what? Yes, it's pure            arcade, which is to admit it's entirely unrealistic and any            resemblance to real life is completely co-incidental - thank the            lord. But despite what you may have read elsewhere, the differing            surfaces (ice, gravel, sand, tarmac) do make a huge difference to            the way your car controls. There is a palpable sense of relief when            you make it through some of the later ice stages, and when bombing            it through some of the bumpy Arid courses, the second you make it            to a bit of tarmac gives you a rare section of traction sanity.                    Another area where Shox can annoy is the computer AI. The drones            don't seem to have any semblance of personality, and drive around            all bunched up, meaning that one or two slip ups can result in            going from first to sixth and back again in the space of half a            lap. Shox only seems to really work as a game when you're good            enough to take the lead and stay there, otherwise you'll be hurling            the joypad across the room cursing the game's unforgiving nature.        One area EA UK made very little effort is the game's audio. The            music is reduced to an indistinguishable rattle, while the engine            noise blurs into a sound resembling a swarm of bees. The annoying            yelps from the commentator as you enter and exit each Shox zone can            get on your tits after a while too (~This Is IT!!!~ and ~Coooome            ON!!~ burn into your brain very quickly). Generic, pointless and            lazy are three words that spring to mind here, but to be fair it            doesn't detract from the game too much - the desire to progress            overrides such quibbles.                    On balance, EA has pulled out a product of genuine quality that            with a little more work in a few basic areas would have been a must            have title. As it is, it's more for casual gamers that want a post            pub session on a title they can pick up and play and get stuck            into.                    Me? I enjoyed it immensely, but it frustrated just that little bit            too much to ever be considered a classic. Shox is a typical EA            game: great presentation, instant playability for the mass market,            but one that serious gamers will be able to pick endless holes in."}
