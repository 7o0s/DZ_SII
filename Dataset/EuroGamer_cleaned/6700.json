However, Earth 2150: Lost Souls            hasn't grown a great deal on the back of past outings, and the game            starts off looking tired, despite some nice weather and terrain            effects, and some detailed unit design. Not a good start.                    Fortunately, though the graphics engine may be a bit creaky            compared to current monstrosities, it's very good at what it does            do. Zooming in and out is a very smooth process on all but the            wimpiest of PCs, with units, buildings and terrain scaling nicely,            and the dynamic camerawork throughout is almost always good enough            that you don't need to worry about it, leaving you to concentrate            on the strategy of pummelling your opponent.                    And there's a lot of strategy to worry about in Lost Souls. It's            one of the most detailed, old-school RTS titles we've come across            since StarCraft.        The narrative aims to wrap up those ends still flapping in the            nuclear winds of previous titles, and with the Earth still            teetering on the brink of destruction as it spins uncontrollably            off its axis, players must take the reigns of the Eurasian Dynasty,            Lunar Corporation or United Civilized States' forces and fight            through a number of missions in a story-driven campaign.                    As the final remnants of humanity fight bitterly for survival on            the face of the Earth, you'll find yourself not endowed with            pre-made units to 'tank rush' one another with, but armed with            scientists and lengthy technology trees to build your own units.            Although you can choose from a few of prefab units, the emphasis is            on researching things like chassis and weapons technology            separately, and combining them to build your own custom units from            scratch. These units can then be deployed in battle, and as with            The Moon Project, the last game in the series, you can store these            at your base between missions, and over the course of the campaign            they grow in experience and ability. This approach is obviously a            lot more realistic than the likes of C&C, but sometimes Lost            Souls perhaps goes a little too far - having to worry about how            much ammo individual units have, for instance, can be maddening.                    The attention to detail elsewhere is greatly appreciated though.            Being able to paint your units the colour of enemy troops can lead            to some incredibly sneaky multiplayer tactics, although            disappointingly the computer AI has no trouble spotting impostors.        Apart from that though, AI is on the whole excellent. The            charred remains of the Earth's terrain form a formidable barrier            between you and your enemy's forces, and it'll often take a while            to pick a route to the other end of the map, splitting your forces            asunder unless you're careful. In fact, there's a lot more            real-life battle strategy to Lost Souls than we'd anticipated. The            AI is wise to this, and makes sure to position troops in elevated            positions and to avoid obstacles entirely without waypoints,            maintaining line-of-sight during an encounter and retreating behind            cover if needs be.                    The engine also deals with day and night cycles, which allows you            to attack in the twilight, hopefully when the enemy least expects            it. What's more, because it's so frequently dark in Lost Souls, you            have to pay attention to the headlights setting on your units and            buildings - a bit of floodlighting costs a bit of energy, but it            saves a bit of hassle when enemy tanks roll into the base and you            spot them quickly.                    The only thing in Lost Souls which doesn't match up to the flow of            attention to detail is the audio aspect. Sound effects and unit            voicing is repetitive and mildly irritating after a few missions,            and the soundtrack is puzzlingly static. Tunes play oblivious to            the action, when in this day and age we generally expect the music            to ebb and flow with the mood and situation. A small oversight            though, and it doesn't detract too greatly from the action            on-screen - the music isn't too bad, which helps!                    Lost Souls is an excellent old-school real-time strategy game.            Thanks to the customisable units and obvious thought that has gone            into each of the three campaigns, they're all equally worthy of            your time. Each side feels like an entirely different force.            Although the tech may be a bit long in the tooth, the game is very            well composed and each campaign sufficiently long and challenging            that you'll be playing it for quite a while, particularly if you            can rope some friends into the LAN or internet play. Easy to get            into and hard to let go of, Lost Souls adds an almost unblemished            varnish to the old-school RTS.
