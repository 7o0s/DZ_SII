However, as is also the case with the first person shooter,            strategy games now face a battle of innovation, as fresh new ideas            take precedence over pretty graphics and powerful units. Witness            the relatively poor reception that Westwood's Tiberian Sun received            - proof, if any was needed, that the traditional 2D RTS must evolve            if it is to survive.                    It's in this sort of environment that the greatest innovation takes            place - games such as Homeworld and Ground Control reshape and            redefine the RTS genre to create something new, fresh and exciting.            And now, turning to past history rather than the dreams of a war            torn future for its innovation, Shogun : Total War plants its own            stamp of innovation on the strategy genre.                    If Shogun has any single immediate grab-factor, it is the sheer            scale of the game. Battles are played out over beautiful 3D            landscapes, replete with buildings, forests, weather effects and            even flocks of birds flying overhead. Unlike in standard RTS fare,            individual units have no part to play in these battles - each is a            full military body formed from up to 120 samurai, who can be            ordered into formation and moved about en masse around the            battlefield.                    Often armies will consist of literally thousands of men, and a            zoomed out view of a battle in progress shows the sheer extent of            the carnage to be breathtaking. This epic scale owes more to            Braveheart, Gladiator and the movies of Akira Kurosawa than it does            to more conventional RTS games.         It quickly becomes apparent when playing Shogun                 that this game is all about realism. Every element that could                 affect the outcome of a real-life battle has been taken into                 account - troops become tired if they are marching or fighting                 for too long, demoralised if they are losing, and some will                 even lay down their arms and flee if the advancing enemy seems                 too fearsome.                    The effects of weather have been modelled accurately; you can trade            with the European gaijin to acquire arquebuses, a primitive form of            musket, but they will not work in anything but the lightest rain.            Even the seasons of the year will affect you - if you fight during            winter you must resolve the conflict more speedily, because days            are shorter and your troops are ineffective at night.                    All of this may have some of you thinking of the Close Combat            series, but effects such as troop morale, honour and tiredness are            handled in a much better fashion in Shogun, and manage to            contribute to the gameplay without intruding on it.                    Battles themselves are hugely difficult when compared to the rush            ~tactics~ favoured by many RTS games. You will be forced to            consider carefully the positioning of your units and the orders you            give them, making use of the layout of the terrain and any natural            cover nearby. Archers placed on hills can rout forces in the            valleys below them as they laboriously try to climb the steep            slopes. Cavalry charging against entrenched spearmen will be            dismounted and annihilated by the sharp blades of the enemy            naginata.                    Having a superior force does not mean you will win the day, because            even as commander of a vastly more powerful army than your enemy's,            you will still need to weigh up various factors and issue            positional orders with great care, since one slip-up can give the            enemy the opening they need to rush through your lines.         Of course, one of the main unrealistic concepts                 perpetuated in conventional RTS games is the idea that battle                 units are manufactured or trained on the battlefield itself.                    In Shogun, what you enter a battle with is all you have - you            cannot create additional forces while in the battlefield. Instead            there is a whole separate segment of the game devoted to the            mustering of forces and the control of territory. This turn-based            segment, played on a Risk-like board showing a map of Japan and her            provinces, has none of the visual splendour of the battle engine,            but is just as deep as regards gameplay, if not more so.                    In ways reminiscent of Sid Meier's excellent Civilisation series,            the turn-based game gives a whole new layer of strategy to Shogun.            Starting as daimyo of your own clan, the ultimate aim of the game            is to become shogun, supreme ruler of all Japan. Aside from the            obvious necessity to construct castles and training grounds for            your samurai, as well as moving your armies on the map in order to            defend your territories or invade an enemy's, espionage and            subterfuge also play a vital role in the game.                    The creation of geisha and ninja, expert assassins of feudal Japan,            allows you to strike against the heart of enemy clans by killing            their leaders or emissaries, while the use of shinobi (spies) and            emissaries enables you to stir peasant unrest in the territories of            your enemies.         An alliance with the gaijin Portuguese and Dutch                 explorers will allow you to purchase arquebuses and change                 your religion from Buddhism to Christianity, and religion                 plays quite a major role in the game.                    Buddhist soldiers are unhappy about being asked to do battle with            units of Buddhist warrior monks, for example, while having a            Christian daimyo ruling over a Buddhist province, or vice versa,            will cause unrest among the people of that province. Even your            relationships and alliances with the daimyo of other clans can be            effected by your choice of beliefs.                    All of these factors are determined on the turn-based screen, and            while your skill in commanding the troops on the battlefield is            vital (especially since some units, such as the Sword Dojo, cannot            be built until the requisite level of experience on the battlefield            is acquired), it is ultimately on the turn-based screen that the            outcome of the game will be decided.                    In case you are worried that you might get bored spending too long            in the turn-based system, don't be. This is no mere filler between            the epic battles, it is a superb and entertaining game in its own            right.                    Sadly, the multiplayer game options tend to ignore this entire            aspect of the game, instead throwing people straight into the            battle scenarios. Online play is through the EA|PLAY system, which            seems quite basic but does the job.         Shogun sets out to provide a detailed and                 realistic simulation of warfare in the ~sengoku jidai~ (~Age                 Of The Country At War~) period of Japanese history, and it                 achieves this goal admirably.                    Everything about the game smacks of good research and authenticity,            down to the ability to select a Japanese voiceover with English            subtitles rather than having English voices all the way through.            Fans of samurai movies, fans of medieval warfare, or simply anyone            wishing to play the single most accurate simulation of war ever            created, will have no excuse for not owning a copy of Shogun :            Total War.                    With one caveat... This is not a game for the impatient, and it            will take you several hours of play and a number of humiliating            defeats before you start to have any idea of how to play properly.            However, once you do get to grips with it, Shogun is a highly            rewarding and engrossing game that will quite possibly be            responsible for a large number of sleepless nights."}
