Orthat a couple of geeks messing around in their respective garagewould fundamentally change everything from the way we worked to howwe listened to music.Against this backdrop, Sega's candidate for hero-dom, a spikyblue hedgehog with red sneakers named Sonic seems positively run ofthe mill. And indeed 'run' is the operative word here, becauseunlike your average, garden-variety hedgehog, Sonic moves likestink.So place him in a landscape filled with ramps, loop-the-loopsand jumps, as found in Sonic The Hedgehog Part 1, and you'vegot a sideways-scrolling platform game that's quite unique.Set over three zones, each containing three levels, Sonic is ahedgehog on a mission; to free his animal chums from the clutchesof Dr. Robotnik, an evil scientist who's capturing creatures,brain-washing them and imprisoning them in robot battle-suits inorder to help him conquer Sonic's world.While speed isn't strictly of the essence you're not timed overthe levels, for instance, and you don't get more points forfinishing faster, the design of the levels rewards a smooth, quick,flowing style of play. Cautiously edging your way across the screenfrom left to right just doesn't get it done. To reach the elusiverings and power-ups required to help you through the game, you'llneed to run and seamlessly jump over, spin through or roll down allmanner of obstacles at a literally head-spinning pace.This is the real challenge in Sonic The Hedgehog, becauseif you don't build up a rhythm and get into Sonic's groove youcould find the experience to be fiddly, unforgiving and actuallyquite a turn-off. It's definitely a game that rewards good reflexesand a willingness to throw caution to the wind.All of which makes it essential that you have a good set ofcontrols on your phone. Whilst you can control Sonic using thenumber keys, (with '4' and '6' making him run left and right, '2'to jump and '8' to crouch or roll into a wall-smashing, enemysmiting spiky blue ball), the sheer reaction speeds required cryout for a thumbpad. And it had better be a goodie too - we used aSony Ericsson K700i and it took a good hour before we could leapand land where we intended in anything resembling a reliablefashion.That's the only matter we'd recommend you consider before buyingSonic The Hedgehog Part 1, because if you've struggled withyour phone's thumbpad before, it'll most certainly kill you (andthe hedgehog) here.Having said that, it'd be a shame to miss out even if you wereall thumbs because otherwise this is a simply superb recreation ofan excellent game. Anyone who had the original Sonic TheHedgehog on their Sega Megadrive will be over the moon as it'sa pixel-perfect conversion of that ground-breaking game, even downto a brilliantly replicated theme tune. Those that have managed toavoid the spiky one to date should prepare to welcome a new herointo their lives. Roll on Part 2!"}
