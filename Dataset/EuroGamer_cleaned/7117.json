Each new mission is            introduced with a lengthy narrated background story with your tasks            defined and a few clues thrown in for good measure. Most of the            missions are pretty standard grab item, get key, chop up the            baddies you meet on the way to bits fare, hardly brain surgery but            interesting enough. This is a game that undoubtedly focuses more on            the bloody slashing action than brain-bending adventure.             More depth is added with the                 introduction of Blessing Wisps, which are rewarded for                 successfully completing a mission with additional bonus Wisps                 scattered in secret locations around the levels. Every five of                 these collected can be traded for an upgrade to your character                 by adding an ability or gaining some weapon or piece of                 armour. At the end of each level your given the choice of                 category to upgrade such as Rank, Offence, Defence and various                 different types of magic. Selecting offence will grant new                 weapons, defence will give new armour and the magic categories                 add to your arsenal of offensive and defensive spells. It's a                 far cry from a full on Role Playing Game, but it adds a                 compelling angle to the game, your driven to search for those                 extra Wisps that'll allow you to try out newer spells or wield                 a bigger chopper.                         Letting the player have a choice of which character to take            through the game also gives the title a bit of variety. The beefy            male character Cynric is strong with combat and can take quite a            beating which favours an close up, full on approach to the game,            while the foxy female Aeowyn is more magically gifted and strong            but physically weaker so requires a careful and more considered            approach. While this doesn't change the way you progress through            the game, it does offer a choice based on your preferred approach,            and players wanting maximum value could even have a go at            completing the game with each character greatly adding to the            potential            longevity. By far the most enjoyable element of Dragons            Blood is actually getting your hands wet with the blood of your            evil enemies. Initially the combat looks like a simple hack and            slash affair, it's actually quite involved with various different            sword strokes available and a good selection of combo's to discover            for each different kind of weapon. Marching right up to your foes            and taking a swipe out of them will result in a damp red heap of            hero, you have to approach combat carefully and make liberal use of            the defence button and shoulder button strafing if your going to            get a swipe in without taking damage. The enemy intelligence is            also impressive, you find them circling and dodging, waiting for            you to expose yourself before they take a lunge, making combat            intense and engaging.                         Unfortunately a slew of graphical problems prevent Dragons Blood            from being a fantasy action masterpiece. Textures break up, the            frame often becomes choppier than a butchers block and glitchy            collision detection results in your hero disappearing into walls or            losing half his legs into the landscape. The environments are huge,            and have some fantastic detail but the ambitious rolling hills in            the outdoor areas look extremely angular and suffer from some            fairly close up fogging. Also irritating is the weird save game            system, which allows you to make marker saves at any point, but            will only let you actually save a game to the memory card            in-between levels. Some of the missions are huge, and take ages to            finish making for some long sittings in between saves.                    If you can see past these technical details, and can stomach the            heavy fantasy hack 'n slash theme you'll have a lot of fun with            Dragons Blood. It's not particularly original, and borrows a lot            from previous action titles like the Nightmare Creatures series on            the PlayStation, but it is a lot of fun and with fifteen large            levels it offers an awful lot of bloody barbarian brawn for your            buck.
