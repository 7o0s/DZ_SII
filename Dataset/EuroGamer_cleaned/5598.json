It is the eighth game in a series with a long and illustrious            history that spans three decades. As new formats have appeared and            grown in popularity, the games have migrated to pre-rendering, and            budgets of almost Hollywood proportions. Yet the fans have kept on            buying.                    So the question is, can a game that is shockingly linear and born            on the Playstation really rely so heavily on pre-rendered material            and remain involving?         FF8 is similar in style and                 presentation to the seventh game in the series more than any                 of the others. Each location is presented as a lavishly                 decorated pre-render, some with a varying degree of                 interactivity, and some with visual depth that characters can                 move into and out of.                    It's story-led, essentially linear, and played out with cutscenes            and pre-scripted conversations. This may lead you to conclude that            it lacks replay value, but because you can choose your own path            through the game and the characters you use, replays will            definitely offer new avenues to explore.                    The stigma surrounding pre-rendered footage is the first big            stereotype to be thrown out of the window. On the whole in gaming            circles, pre-rendered cut-scenes, or ~FMV~, is frowned upon as a            way for programmers to divert attention from abysmal gameplay, but            in FF8 it moves the story along and complements rather than            dominates your actions.                    The cutscenes themselves are beautifully presented, with facial            expressions that are both emotive and life-like. The movement too            is perfectly human, with a magnificent level of detail. By the time            you reach the coveted ballroom scene several hours in, any argument            about diverting attention from poor gameplay can be trodden into            the dirt once and for all.         One of the few pitfalls that FF8                 succumbs to is that it is pretty inaccessible to casual                 players. The statistically driven combat and engrossing                 storyline really requires thought and dedication - you                 certainly cannot pick this game up for 5 minutes here and                 there.                    Quirky Japanese RPG conventions are rife throughout, and the fight            sequences will seem absurd to anyone coming to the game without            prior knowledge. Each character takes it in turn to have a swing,            with a power bar recharging after each shot. Another blow can be            landed as soon as the bar has replenished itself to full-strength.                    The way the battles are depicted differs to the way they were in            previous games in the series though, with polygonal backdrops            setting the scene and providing for the first time ever a truly            3-dimensional arena to fight arena.                    The ~drawing~ of spells and magical attacks from enemies is also a            nice touch, and makes battles with new foes desirable, as each new            creature type may herald new and unusual spells. Your magical            repertoire can include all manner of bizarre and fiendish            (sometimes literally) spells - not always offensive in nature -            each of which can be used in certain circumstances.         After a few hours of play                 though, it becomes clear that Guardian Forces (GFs) are the                 most important. These are powerful elemental creatures that                 can inflict serious damage upon opponents.                    There are twenty in all throughout the game world, and each can be            summoned in battle once captured. Some you simply have to locate            and they will join you, but others have to be defeated in battle            before they succumb to servitude.                    Each GF has different attributes, and some even have their own            character-like experience ratings. They become precious, almost as            much as your party members, and when they become more powerful they            can be the predominant factor in many battles. This is a pity,            since there are so many types of magic and weapon-based attacks at            your disposal that just gather proverbial dust as a result - even            the devastating Limit Breaks of previous games pale in comparison            to the might of a GF.                    The physical act of summoning the creatures is just as spectacular            as the result - sparks fly and the light shows may take 15 seconds            or more to complete before you can see the resultant Hit Point            deduction. Each new attack you learn is exciting not only for its            power, but also simply to see the beautiful visuals.                    The GFs have more depth than simple weaponry though - they are in            fact the key to the entire magical system at work in FF8. Each GF            can be linked, or ~junctioned~, to a specific character in your            party, so you have to be choosey in how you pair them to achieve            the most ferocious attacks.         The musical score was one aspect of                 FF7 that made it stand out, with pumping musical interludes                 and sensuous backing music. The pieces could not have fit the                 scenes better, but FF8 isn't much cop by comparison. The music                 is seedy and midi-like in places, hardly the orchestral                 accompaniment promised on the packaging.                    Another criticism is that for a PC title it feels and acts far too            much like a console game. The graphics sometimes seem blocky in            high resolutions, and the menus appear pixellated. The programming            for the conversion has been very lazy on the whole - there's not            even a proper ~Quit~ option!                    Actually, FF8 on the PC is a double blunder in the conversion            stakes. Firstly it's a lazy port from the Playstation, but even            before that the Japanese-to-English text translation has taken its            toll. Conversations are too full of quips and giggles for such a            serious storyline, and it has definitely lost some of the emotion            during translation. Additionally, the character animations that            accompany the dialogue often miss the point or appear excessive.                    The characters themselves really build the game up, however. The            story's main subject, Squall, is a maturing member of the SeeD            organisation. At first quite unlikeable, he subtly matures as you            play with him, and you grow to feel compassion for him and his            companions. Square really must be congratulated for the emotional            undertones present throughout, in spite of the translations            occasional shortcomings.                    I've been chipping away at the game for quite some time now without            saying much about the actual plot. Needless to say it's as exciting            as it is engrossing.                    If I say too much I'm bound to give it away though, so I'll just            echo the cryptic clues given on the outer packaging; that Squall            Leonhart has been thrust into the madness of war as an elite            mercenary member of the ~SeeD~ squad. To graduate from SeeD, he            must settle growing hostilities between the neighbouring countries            of Galbadia and Dollet.                    But this madness is nothing compared to his own emotional turmoil.            A chance encounter with a beautiful young and free-spirited            temptress, Rinoa Heartilly, has turned his world upside down, and            you must help him to seek a peace, of mind and culture.         Final Fantasy                 VIII suffers from console-to-PC conversion issues and lacks                 finesse in many areas, and may alienate newcomers with its                 engrossing story driven gameplay and Japanese approach to                 role-playing.                    But it's still bigger and better than any of its predecessors. Once            again Square are dominating the RPG stakes, and if you do persist            with it, this one will never let you go. It grips you like a good            book, and once you've finished it you feel more empty than when you            began.                    Captivating."}
