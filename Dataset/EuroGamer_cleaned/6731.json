It's incredibly facile. Dream up a stupid name, toss in a shallow back-story about a crusade to champion morals and surround it with adjectives - rinse under a stream of forgettable bad guys and shove it down a TV aerial. Bosh, Knight Rider. But then again... the concept of an indestructible car with a sentient intelligence, armed with the sort of gadgets that would put the entire contents of Q branch across all 20 Bond movies to shame, and a driver who spends most of his time inadvertently showcasing the car's extraordinary assets... that could make good television! And a good game, too.            A quick crash course for the two or three of you that haven't heard            of Knight Rider, and I do mean quick. Deep breath, now. [Ulp.] Cult            TV series starring David Hasselhof as Michael Knight, along with a            helpful scientist called Bonny and a sentient car named KITT            (Knight Industry Two Thousand) - indestructible due to a molecular            bondage structure and equipped with gadgetry - trawling Deep South            helping rednecks win races, clobber bad guys and generally do good,            all whilst trying to bring down moustachioed bad guy Garth, also            played by Hasselhof, and his nefarious KARR, KITT's opposite            number-gone-wrong. Got it?                           The game understandably emphasizes KITT's abilities at the expense            of all else, and for a game about an indestructible car it's            actually quite enjoyable. Instead of a roaming RPG, which is what            we'd kind of wanted, developer Davilex has produced a string of            gadget-oriented missions mixed into the flow of the game's            underlying story. KITT has some basic abilities like Turbo Boost to            increase his speed, but he can also opt for Ski Mode if the surface            demands it, and scan and jamming modes to unearth enemies. As the            game wears on, Bonny will augment KITT's abilities with extras like            Super Pursuit Mode.                           In terms of gameplay mechanics, Knight Rider is an odd one, not            unlike Spy Hunter in its approach, but KITT's super-vehicular            abilities allow him to jump like Mario, and swing himself up onto            two wheels to cross narrow gangways and slip between gaps- a fairly            unusual dynamic to say the least.                    The control system is quite simplistic with all the buttons where            they should be, and the physics model is understandably insane,            with sharp turns and slides pretty much unavoidable due to the            ludicrous manoeuvrability. However this does mean that wrestling to            line the car up isn't much of a problem, and since this has dogged            similar racers for years we can't complain too much. Fast-acting            brakes also help to supplement your driving style in avoiding            obstacles, such as boulders knocked from cliffs, falling masonry            and other hurdles your prey will use to block your progress.                           Graphically, Knight Rider isn't going to win any awards, but the            car is definitely KITT and the driver definitely Hasselhof, and            Davilex has been working closely with the show to emulate the            important details most effectively. The geometry of the levels is            sometimes complex, but often simple and yet detailed enough to seem            fitting. Draw distance is quite impressive, but with a world            inhabited by rocky outcrops, mountains, wooden scaffolding to            tussle on and irregular foliage, this isn't too difficult to            imagine nor to achieve.                           The K.I.T.T model itself is very well produced, with trademark            black and white hubcaps and that distinctive, nose-heavy sports car            look which won it so many admirers back in the day. Although you            don't see too much of the interior thanks to the traditional            jet-black windows, you can just imagine KITT's peculiar voice            reverberating around the cab. In fact, the thing which Davilex have            managed to do best of all is to promote the Knight Rider theme.            It's ever-present, from the dusty, sparsely populated locations and            the cheesy cut-away-camera jumps to the constant procession of the            actual theme tune, which Davilex use to great effect in the intro            movie and elsewhere, and their own Knight Rider-inspired musical            compositions.                    Knight Rider was cheesy when it was on TV, and it's cheesy as a            videogame, too, but by emphasizing KITT's stupendous abilities            above all else it actually transcends the uninspiring format of the            show and offers something potentially quite enjoyable. We'll have            to see how long it can hold up without faltering, but on first            impressions of this and its ported-to-PC sibling, this could be one            shadowy flight worth taking."}
