If you're anything like me, you            will have accumulated about a hundred of these little cloth or            plastic-manufactured ~disposables~, each with a shelf value of            about 2 quid. Personally, ever since I moved over to the            Intellimouse Explorer I've just used a wooden desktop and it has            been fine. I wasn't particularly concerned about the pad beneath my            rodent.                    There has been a lot of talk about these sturdy new rock-hard            mousing surfaces that supposedly increase the accuracy of your aim            in first person shooters and such though. I must admit that I            wasn't all that impressed at first, but I have since been converted            somewhat...                    For this comparison, I decided to focus upon the two main brands -            Ratpadz and Everglide - both of which can be obtained in the UK for            approximately \u00a320 each. Both are very hard and provide a            slightly elevated surface, with rubber feet beneath them which            prevent the pad from sliding all over your desk.        Everglide Giganta -            www.everglide.com After a lot of cajoling from my                 fellow Quakers, I decided shelling out for an Everglide                 Giganta wouldn't be such a bad idea. Featuring a flat but                 textured bright blue finish, and an unusually large surface                 area, the Giganta (shown left) is definitely a precision                 mousing surface.                    When I moved on to it after using a wooden desk for so long, the            movement around Windows felt a whole lot smoother. The small smooth            pads beneath the optical mouse that made up the only points of            contact with the desk were becoming so worn down that there was            friction during movement - something of an enemy to any Quaker.                    As soon as I moved on to the Giganta I felt the friction ease off            completely. The surface is non-abrasive and doesn't scratch or            smear at all. Should you drown it in Coke or something, just as            with the Ratpad, it is completely washable.            The Ratpad -            www.ratpadz.com As a special offer at                 Power Computing,                 any orders amounting to over \u00a350 will get a free Ratpad                 (shown right) for the customer. Otherwise, you can always hand                 over a paltry \u00a317 to secure one. PowerComputing are now                 the official UK supplier for Ratpadz, and they have plenty in                 stock.                    Unlike the Giganta, the Ratpad isn't as precisely crafted. There is            a clear edge around the sides, where the Giganta is smoothed off.            Also unlike the Giganta, the surface tends to attract dirt and            grime a lot more than the stolid, blue coloured deck. What the            Ratpad loses out on with general aesthetic, however, it makes up            for with precision and shape.                    As you can see from the relative shapes of the two pads, the Ratpad            angles out at the lower edges, whereas the Giganta curves inward.            The extra wings (if you like) of the Ratpad are in precisely the            correct position though - when you move your mouse down to the            bottom corners of the desktop or have a really swift curve-shot to            make in mid-air, your mouse does not slide off the edge, as it does            with the Giganta. Although, if it does slide off on the Giganta,            you can easily roll back on to it, whereas with the Ratpad, the            edge prevents easy recovery, as the pads on the underside of the            mouse get caught on the side.                    Aside from the aforementioned flaws in design, the Ratpad is as            solid as the Giganta. It also seems to have been manufactured to a            higher quality! I had the Giganta wedged on to my desk under a            wooden joint to avoid tripping up like a lever and flipping me on            to the floor. The glue attaching the rubber foot furthest away from            me to the Giganta wore down after only a week of use, so that the            rubber foot actually slid off and needed re-gluing. The Ratpad sat            in the same position for nearly a month without needing any sort of            reattachment.                    In order to find out which pad is the best, I decided to do some            tests in ~Quake 3 : Arena~ - I would play on a couple of maps using            the railgun only for ten minutes each, three times over, and            average out the scores I reached against the uber-bot Xaero, on            Hardcore skill setting. Here are the scores - each is an average.                    What does this show? Firstly, this was a high skill setting, the            point being it took a lot of effort to get your own rails off prior            to being railed yourself. Particularly on Q3DM17, a lot of effort            is required in order to score at all - and these two pads helped            immensely. The benefit of using one of them over an average wooden            desk (or even a normal mouse pad) is immense. The precision surface            of each means that your railing accuracy will definitely increase.                    The question of which one you use sadly must come down to personal            preference. I use the Ratpad on my primary computer, and the            Giganta for my secondary rig. This is mainly due to the glue issue,            and if you are a particularly energetic Quaker who tends to slam            the mouse around a lot and put a lot of pressure on the pad itself,            then you may might want to go with the Ratpad, or else you could            lose some of the underside support.                    Again, energetic Quakers may find it interesting to note that while            the Ratpad has a central rubber foot underneath the middle, the            Giganta does not. That means that you can actually find the            Everglide pad dipping in the centre when put under enough pressure.                    The question of whether you need one of these pads is the easiest            to answer. Yes, if you have any interest in succeeding at first            person shooters, you must have a precision mousing surface.            The question of which to buy is harder to answer though. Both are            about the same price, and both offer about the same benefit.                        -                            Razer Boomslang 2000 mouse review                    Razer Boomslang 2000 mouse review                    MS Intellimouse with Intellieye review                    MS Intellimouse with Intellieye review"}
