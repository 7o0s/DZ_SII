Maybe there's some mystical,reflective quality that fish instil in people. If that's true, then Feeding Frenzy is the exception that proves the rule because it's anything but zen-like.Playing the role of a (small) fish in a (big) ocean, you have torapidly increase your size and stature among the aquatic communityby eating your way up the food chain.Feeding Frenzy will of course be instantly recognisable to Xbox 360 owners who like to dabble in Live Arcade, where it was made available earlier this year - and the set-up for mobiles is the same. You start out as a diminutive red fish that doesn't look as though it'd harm a fly, much less eat one, though that soonchanges.Small yellow fish are your first target and you swim around thepatch of ocean you inhabit eating as many of them as you can getyour lipless mouth around. Once you've consumed the requisite amount ofsushi you experience a growth spurt, sometimes accompanied by atransformation into another fish, enabling you to eatcorrespondingly larger prey.And so it goes through the 16 levels. Except that, as you'llremember from school biology lessons, the food chain works bothways and there are plenty of bigger fish who see you as nothingmore than an interesting appetiser.That, in an oyster shell, is Feeding Frenzy. Except for a few power-ups that range fromthe routine (pearls that award extra points) to the sublime (theFury bubble that sends you on the titular Feeding Frenzy, eatingeverything on screen), all the game involves is you swimmingaround, eating things that are smaller than you.The two game modes that are on offer, Normal and Time Attack,aren't different enough to really stand out as divergent ways ofplaying. Normal provides you with three lives and unlimited time tocomplete 16 levels, while Time Attack provides infinite lives butsets you against the clock.Yet, like the aquarium at the dentist's, Feeding Frenzy is very compelling entertainment. Themovement of your fish is, well, watery, and the sensation ofmomentum as you propel yourself through the water is really wellhandled. The visuals are rich in colour and the fish are verydetailed, particularly on a decent handset.There's a strong sense of humour running through the game, too,with satisfying sound effects and a slight air of lunacy that mayor may not be due to nitrogen narcosis. The difficulty level iswell-pitched and you'll make just enough progress each time youplay to encourage you to return to get further.And return to it you will, like a salmon to its spawninggrounds, largely out of curiosity to see what sort of fish you'llturn into next and what you'll be able to eat. Like cod and chips,it's simple, but oh so tasty."}
