But that hasn't            stopped Microsoft and British developer Kuju from attempting the            impossible. And they have almost succeeded.                    The imaginatively titled Microsoft Train Simulator recreates six            different railway routes spread across America, Japan and Europe,            with around 800km of track to explore. Settings vary from the            commuter belt between Washington DC and Philadelphia to the            picturesque Austrian Alps, and the addition of both seasonal and            weather effects provides even more variety for both the game's            graphics and the handling of your train.                    Each of the tracks has been lovingly recreated and, apart from the            dull Tokyo to Hakone route with its narrow strip of tall            featureless buildings on either side of the track, the locations            are generally very good. Highlights include driving over the Marias            Pass in Montana during a winter snow storm and crossing the            Japanese island of Kyushu with its steep gradients, spectacular            scenery and switchbacks. Simply driving a train up and down a            length of track is perhaps not the most exciting way to spend your            evening though, and although it is possible to perform some            impressive gravity-defying high speed derailments, this isn't            likely to keep you entertained for long. And if it does, please            seek immediate professional help.                    Thankfully then Kuju have included several ~activities~ for you to            carry out on each route. These range from a simple summer commuter            run through Tokyo to guiding a mile-long goods train over a steep            mountain pass, or helping to solve the ~Murder On The Orient            Express~ by following a detective's requests to drop off various            carriages along the route.                    The activities are rather hit and miss though, and Kuju seem to            have gone out of their way to make your life a misery at times. For            example, which bright spark came up with the idea of putting a            temporary speed limit in the middle of the game's longest tunnel in            one activity? Spending over a minute driving through a dark winding            tunnel at a snail's pace is not fun, however you look at it.            What's next, Microsoft Subway Simulator? All the excitement of The            Tube on your PC, accurately recreating the entire London            Underground, New York Subway and Paris Metro in sixteen million            shades of black...                    You also have to wonder why Kuju decided to make activities end            after your passengers have disembarked at the last station            on your route. There's no way to skip this, and given that            pedestrians aren't rendered in the game you can't even watch them            getting on and off. Sitting in a station for up to two minutes            waiting for invisible passengers to board your train is frustrating            to say the least, especially when you know that you have            effectively finished the mission already.                    But it's not all bad news. Spending an hour driving a dingy            electric shuttle train through Tokyo stopping at stations every            five hundred meters is not likely to prove particularly            entertaining for any but the most hardcore of train fanatics, but            some of the activities are genuinely enjoyable. The game has a            strange charm about it, and driving a tourist train through the            valleys of Kyushu, for example, can be both relaxing and fun, even            if the lengthy stops for your non-existent passengers to get out            and admire the view are somewhat less amusing.                    The trains themselves are usually very easy to control, with just            three sets of keys that you need to know - throttle, brakes and            reverser, which (as the name suggests) controls whether you move            forwards or backwards. Controlling a steam engine is somewhat more            complicated as you have to worry about pressure and water supply,            although you can at least let the computer shovel coal into the            firebox for you if you're not a total masochist. There are            tutorials for each class of locomotive (steam, diesel and            electric), but as each of them starts with the same introduction to            the interface and there is no way to skip parts of the lesson you            already know about, they can be rather repetitive.                    There are also a number of driver aids to help you out, including a            stats read-out for when you are driving from one of the exterior            cameras and can't see your dashboard, and a ~next station display~            which tells you how far you are from your next stop, when you are            due to get there, and what time it is now. The most important aid            though is the ~track monitor~, a one dimensional map which shows            the track as a straight line, with upcoming signals and speed            limits marked on it for you.                    You will probably spend most of your time driving the train from            inside the cab, but there is a chase cam which can be rotated,            zoomed and moved up and down the length of your train to give you a            better view of your surroundings, while the vertical ~yard view~            can be useful when shunting carriages through sidings, allowing you            to scroll around to see where the points are and how to get your            train from one track to another.                    There is also an artistic but essentially useless trackside view,            which shows you the train speeding past as seen from a series of            fixed cameras dotted along the length of the track. Sure to prove            popular with trainspotters and journalists looking for a pretty            screenshot, it shows off the detailed train models and often            beautiful scenery to maximum effect, although occasionally you will            end up staring at an extreme close-up of the back of a tree sprite.            In passenger trains you can even see the action (such as it is)            from inside one of the carriages, but these are not very pretty to            look at and have a very limited field of view.                    Sadly the audio hasn't received the same attention to detail, and            the steam locomotives in particular sounded decidely wimpy to me.            There are no real ambient sounds apart from the tolling of bells at            level crossings and car horns from nearby traffic, and the sound in            general seems primitive and lacking in punch and imagination. The            low system requirements have also lead to a few strange compromises            in the graphics department, like the way it seems to stop snowing            outside whenever you go into a tunnel. Most worrying though are the            overhead wires, which often stretch for miles with no visible means            of support, just hanging in mid-air above the track.                    Train Simulator is something of a mixed bag. There are some nice            stretches of track to travel on and plenty of things to do along            the way, but several of the activities are downright dull, while            others are marred by questionable design decisions such as lengthy            stops and the excessive use of temporary speed limits in the most            boring parts of a track. This was a brave first attempt by Kuju and            Microsoft which will no doubt appeal to trainspotters and railway            enthusiasts, but for your average gamer there's not really enough            here to make it an essential purchase. Cute, but unrewarding in the            long run."}
