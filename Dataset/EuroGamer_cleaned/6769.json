Don't join us, it says, or one day, you might be involved in            something like this. Despite a lot of people's best efforts, this            third person adventure is too bug-ridden and sloppy to be            enjoyable. I've been waiting for this game for what seems like            years [you have been waiting for years, actually -Ed], and after            all that, it's a buggy, poorly executed blooper. For a start, I            find myself questioning the system requirements. A sticker            on the front warns that you must own a memory card to play this            game, and fair enough, that's a given these days anyway, but each            save consumes 1.5Mb of space (at the speed of your average glacier,            too), and you'll be needing at least two of them in case the game            glitches you into an untenable position and you have to resume from            an earlier save, and it does that a lot. The first time I loaded            the game up, it crashed trying to load the first gameplay sequence            after the opening cutscenes.                         The story follows on from the conclusion of the (excellent) PC            title, with the delectable Rynn and her dragon pal Arokh (who, by            means of a convenient bonding ritual, share a status bar) setting            out on a mission to destroy the maniacal Desert Lords, who seek to            enslave mankind. The story is elaborate, but it has enough draw,            and before long becomes enjoyable and intriguing, with lots of            passion, betrayal, slaughter and typically fantastical            environments, characters and scenarios. However, the dungeon            clearing gameplay at the heart of Drakan is predictable,            repetitive, and at times downright depressing.                         After buying some toys at the Blacksmith's in the city of Surdana,            with a bit of financial help from the Queen, you get to play around            with your inventory system. This is accessed via Select, and lets            you equip weapons, bind your chosen sword, bow and health potions            to a 'quick' interface for hot-swapping in battle, and it also            allows you to spend experience points on four key attributes. And I            do mean key - you will want to develop sword-fighting primarily,            but keep that bow skill up or when, completely without warning, it            becomes the only way to defeat the game's penultimate boss, you'll            be in a bit of a pickle. As I was. You can't keep too many items in            your inventory, but one of the reasons for those enormous save            files is that the game keeps track of every item's position for            you, so you can quite happily stash items on the floor of the            Blacksmith's shop, for instance.                    The third person combat is repetitive and boring - you can target            enemies and perform all sorts of slashing manoeuvres, but the only            one which is likely to keep you alive is the forward slash, and            thus you resort to it for every single bad guy in the game. And            there are a lot of them. Dungeons are themed, so generally they            consist of one or perhaps two sorts of enemy at most, and trying to            separate them so you can pick them off one-by-one is about as            strategic as it gets. If you've been keeping your magic skill in            check, you can cast fear spells and other such tripe to try and            curb the onslaught of ugly Wartoks and bizarre hunched reptiles,            but I was dying of boredom by the time I emerged from the first            area, known as the Shadowmire. This tedious swamp is dragged out            over a series of repetitive tree and water-packed levels with mad,            soon to be extinct frog creatures, and it keeps threatening to end            for three and a half hours before it actually does, at which point            the will to keep playing is somewhat sapped.                         Fortunately, it's at this stage of the game that you get to play            with Arokh, the dragon. Flapping about in the air is great fun,            soaring high above trees and swooping down into villages. The            graphics really show their worth here, with beautiful mountain            ranges and valleys mapped out before you, the sun shining in the            distance and catching the water in the lakes and streams below, and            as you get closer villagers pop up and things become more detailed.            Although the effect is a bit too obvious, it is at least smoothly            done, with a high framerate at all times. Arokh himself looks            magnificent, his wings arching and falling like those of an            enormous bird, and the sound effects here, as with the rest of the            game, are perfect. Arokh also develops a number of handy attacks,            useful for pelting ground units, and when Rynn is on her own in the            open, she can call him down and direct him to incinerate her            assailants, which is nice.                    Sadly though, aerial combat is just as disappointing as its            land-based counterpart. As if clearing out repetitive, poorly            designed dungeons, defeating a tawdry boss character and then            either emerging or teleporting out of there wasn't bad enough,            engaging rival dragons in the sky is reminiscent of the fight for            the top seats on a double-decker bus. In order to avoid being            destroyed in seconds, I had to climb as high as I could into the            sky and use my heat-seeking attacks whilst wrestling to keep            enemies in camera view long enough to lock onto them. It's a good            thing I kept my height, too, because Arokh has a tendency to get            stuck in the ground if you land too close to\u2026 well, if you            land on anything barring a completely flat patch of turf or rock.                         You might well be wondering why I didn't wrap this up a few            paragraphs ago and just warn you off it as well I might warn you            off engaging plague-infested rats in sexual relations, but actually            for those of you with a bit of stamina for such tripe, Drakan            weaves quite an interesting tale. The Ancient Gates of the title            must be opened to allow travel back and forth around the various            lands of the game, and only Rynn and her bonded dragon chum have            the power to do this. The story of the Gates and the Desert Lords            is told gradually through in-game cutscenes, and every character in            the game is voice-acted, mostly by English fellows! Tally ho            what-what hark I hear you say! That's right, and very well            voice-acted to boot. Rynn herself does one of those delightfully            seductive Lara Croft impressions, and since she doesn't resemble a            stick insect with a pair of walnuts stapled to her chest, she's an            endearing central character. Furthermore, the inhumanly deep pitch            of Arokh's voice is enough to convince the player of his dragon            credentials, and there are plenty of comedy accents besides - I            heard cockney, Yorkshire, and I'm pretty sure I even heard a bit of            the old handle-barred, moustachioed 'you're in the RAF now tally ho            sunshine guvnor'. I like it.                    Obviously nobody is going to stick with the game for the comedy            accents alone, but in all honesty, I can't imagine why I plodded            the whole way through this except for the lure of the story.            Admittedly, there's a lot to do and a lot of variation in the            objectives as they sit on the laundry list menu screen, gradually            getting ticked off as you progress, but generally the only thing to            distinguish between ~Defeat so-and-so the unpleasant fellow of            such-and-such~ and ~Retrieve the amulet of what's-her-face~ is a            change of scenery and a different boss character.                         Towards the end of the game things grow in magnitude and you start            to unlock some impressive weaponry, although I was extremely            frustrated to have unlocked three elemental blades, only to            discover that the fourth was in an empty dungeon somewhere under            some stone I left unturned. This seemed bad enough - after all, the            world of Drakan is quite sizeable and it would have taken me a good            half an hour to get to where I needed to be - but when I actually            got there and found a locked door in my way\u2026 Ah well, it            looks like I'll never get to see the magical top-level sword I            would have unlocked with my spoils. Thoughtful game design? I'm not            that charitable.                         It would be nice to be able to say that Drakan is worth pursuing            despite its countless bugs, glitches and design stupidity, and that            the mixture of combat systems was enough to keep me happy while I            was soaking up the fantasy adventure, but in all honesty, Drakan is            the wrong side of average. It has an audience, and those of you who            finished the PC original, and can perhaps put up with bug-infested            game design will lap this up, and more power to you, but don't take            a look at the screenshots and think ~I might try that~. You'll only            wish you hadn't."}
