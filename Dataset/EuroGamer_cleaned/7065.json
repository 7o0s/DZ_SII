Airfix Dogfighter, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air for            this most stale of genres. Real world physics go out the window,            replaced by one of the most ludicrous flight models we have ever            seen, allowing you to pull off gravity defying stunts, and            practically bring your plane to a halt without it stalling. There            are no laser guided bombs or heads-up displays, and you don't have            to press twenty-eight different keys in the right order just to get            your plane into the air.                    In fact it's more of an arcade action game than a flight sim, but            what really seperates it from every other game that involves flying            an aircraft of some kind is that you aren't flying real planes in            the real world, you are flying the little plastic models of the            title around the inside of a house, re-enacting a bizarre parody of            World War II. Like something out of ~Toy Story~ or ~Small            Soldiers~, as soon as the family leaves their home to go on holiday            in the rendered intro movie, the toy soldiers, planes and tanks            come out to wage war. You will fight on the landing, you will fight            on the stairs, you will fight in the kitchen and under the bed. You            will never surrender...                    At the heart of Airfix Dogfighter are two single player campaigns,            one for the Axis forces and one for the western Allies, each            featuring a linear series of ten missions. These vary from            straightforward search and destroy sweeps to raiding enemy            strongholds to capture new Airfix kits, weapons blueprints, or that            most valuable of resources .. glue.                    The sheer range of different missions on offer is enough to keep            you (ugh) glued to your computer throughout. You will find yourself            blowing up enemy radar installations in the front garden, sinking            submarines in the bath tub, and helping to rescue an imprisoned            scientist from the bedroom. The whole thing is very tongue in            cheek, and although the humour is rather hit and miss, the sheer            magic of flying a model aircraft between the legs of a table while            dodging incoming rounds and trying to blow up a vase twice your            size is something which will grab your imagination.                    The whole game is set within a single house, but it's so huge            compared to your tiny aircraft that you never feel too            claustrophobic. At the beginning of each campaign you start off            with access to just one or two rooms, but as the game continues            missions will take you into the sister's bedroom (decorated in a            horrible pastel pink wallpaper), the bathroom (obviously the center            of naval operations), and the kitchen (to help Il Duce and the            Italian forces fight off an attack on his spaghetti cooking            operation, naturally). In all there are around a dozen different            rooms to explore, as well as the landing and downstairs hall, which            you will pass through in most of the missions.                    It's not just new rooms which are unlocked throughout the game            though, you will also gain access to a wider range of aircraft and            weapons as you find kits and blueprints. There are 17 planes to fly            in all, from Stukas through to Spitfires, as well as Mustangs,            Hurricanes, and the Me262 jetfighter.                    Regardless of the plane you are flying your main weapons will be            your machine guns. These handily lock on to targets near your            crosshair, avoiding the need to aim too accurately in the midst of            a big hairy furball. Flying into medals (shaped like a star for            allied pilots and an iron cross for the Germans) will gradually            increase the tech level of your guns, and for every ten you of them            that you find your firing rate, range or damage will rise. Sadly            you always start a mission with a tech level of zero, which means            that towards the end of the two campaigns you will find yourself            flying around looking for power-ups for the first few minutes of            every mission. As there is no way to save your game mid-mission,            this can become tedious.                    Other power-ups include glue, paint and repair kits to fix any            damage which you sustain, and spare ammunition and fuel should you            start to run low. Most of the items you will find are additional            weapons though, from basic bombs, rockets, guided missiles and            parachute bombs through to fanciful laser guns and tesla coils            towards the end of the game. You may even occasionally find an            atomic bomb to unleash on your enemies!                    Limited numbers of these items can be found simply sitting on the            shelves, cupboards, floors and tables of the house, but more often            you will have to work to find them. Blowing up the vases, dishes,            plates, lamps and other ~breakables~ which are scattered around the            house will reveal additional power-ups, as will destroying enemy            units.                    The game is viewed from a third person perspective, with a choice            of two chase cams and an overhead view which can be useful for            (ugh) carpet bombing. The graphics are certainly impressive, and            the house in which you are flying has been lovingly recreated in            full 3D, from the gruesome pink decor of the sister's bedroom to            the dark wood panels of the lounge, and from the u-boats lurking in            the bathroom to the tanks patrolling on the landing.                    Detail levels are high, textures are realistic, and giant            ballustrades and fire places make far more interesting obstacles            for armchair aviators than the mountains and cities of most flight            sims. In fact the only real low point is when you reach the great            outdoors, as an invisible wall stops you from flying too high or            leaving the confines of the garden, and the backdrop which shows            the world beyond the house is rather ugly and pixellated in            comparison to the rest of the game's graphics. Given how frantic            most of the missions which take you outside are though, you don't            really have time to notice these shortcomings.                    If you're not happy with the way that the house has been decorated,            you can always indulge in a spot of home improvement and create            your own missions, placing furniture, breakables and military units            using a simple 3D editor. And when you complete the two single            player campaigns, which shouldn't take you much more than six or            eight hours, you can take the war online and fly against up to            seven other players via the internet or a LAN. You can even            customise your planes by changing their colour schemes and            designing new logos for them in the built-in ~paint room~.                    Airfix Dogfighter is an amusing if slightly shallow arcade flight            sim with ridiculously simple controls - within a few missions you            will find yourself effortlessly weaving your way between armchairs,            strafing beds, and dive bombing the bath.                    It's good clean fun as long as you don't take it too seriously, and            the only real problems are that it's all over fairly soon, and the            stocking up on new weapons and power-ups at the beginning of every            mission can get tedious after a while. The excellent graphics,            solid gameplay and oddball setting mean that it's well worth a look            though, whether you're a newcomer to computer gaming or a hardcore            gamer looking for something completely different."}
