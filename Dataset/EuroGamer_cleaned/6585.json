Arguably, in a gaming sense, the riddle of            why Rayman has no limbs must come high up on that list, as well as            how on earth did this critically murdered franchise end up becoming            the UK's biggest selling platformer? You think we're making it up            don't you? Released at the same time as the launch of the            PlayStation back in September 1995, the game is still            selling around 2,000 copies a week, and has shifted around 1.5            million* copies in the UK alone. That's more than any Mario, Crash,            or Sonic game has ever registered on the ChartTrack panel. The            follow up hasn't fared quite so well commercially, but as with the            original, once its price came down, the sales ramped up. Suffice to            say, this is also selling about 2,000 copies a week at a knockdown            price.                    So the Rayman games are for kids then? And they're French? So why            do we care about the third (fourth if you count the filler release            Rayman M)? If the truth be known, it's down to the likes of Naughty            Dog and Insomniac for restoring our faith in the genre with            classics like Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank. The fact            is, we're really enjoying jumping around, collecting            everything in sight at the moment, and even limbless French            platformers have snared our attention. What's that all            about?                    * Estimated combined sales of PSX, PC, GBC and GBA as of end of Jan            2003, based on ChartTrack data.        The storyline's fairly tenuous, as they tend to be with jump            and collect games, but we'll give you a quick run through in case            you're interested. Basically a 'depraved and hysterical' evil red            Lum by the name of Andre wants to conquer the world, and has            somehow turned his fellow red Lums into black Lums, which steal            animal's hair in order to weave costumes for themselves. Dressed in            big long coats, hooded and armed with guns, the army of 'Hoodlums'            (geddit) have captured all the Teensies, and it's Rayman's job to            liberate them and sort out these pesky Hoods. To make matters even            quirkier, Rayman's long time buddy Globox has somehow managed to            swallow Andre, and develops an unquenchable thirst for Plum juice -            meaning Rayman not only has to defeat all manner of foe, but seek            out three Teensie doctors to cure his pal. No one ever said it            would be straightforward.                    Fortunately, our limbless friend is able to harness the Hoodlum's            five superpowers for a limited time, giving Rayman enhanced            abilities including Vortex (make enemies spin), Heavy Metal Fist            (heavy punch), Lock Jaw (swing between metal handles), Shock Rocket            (guided missile), and Throttle Copter (to reach higher ledges,            etc). The experienced platformers among you will immediately note            plenty of inspiration from the aforementioned Jak & Daxter, as            well as the recently released Ratchet & Clank. Just about every            one of Rayman's superpowers feature in the latter at some stage,            with the major difference being the temporary nature of his powers            - which is the exact mechanic employed in the former. Talent            borrows, genius steals?                    Obviously as a cutesy third person platformer you don't come around            these parts expecting innovation and it's hard to find a tremendous            amount in the core of Rayman 3. As you'd expect from a game such as            this, your experiences will roughly follow this well trodden path:            wander around, collect jewels, shoot enemies, collect temporary            power up, reach previously unattainable part of the level, free the            Teensie from their cage, repeat until boss encounter.        One element that is quite a novel progression is the combat            mechanic, which gives you the ability to curve your (already            detached) fist around corners, giving you the opportunity to knock            out enemies even if they're hiding behind a pillar. Holding down            the right trigger allows Rayman to lock on to the target, which            allows you to not only strafe left and right and avoid their            projectiles, but it keeps the target in sight while you're moving            around. This all sounds very useful in principle, and in practise            it might, were it not for the complete inability of the camera to            behave itself, or for the lock on to work effectively. As with so            many third person action games, if the camera's broken, you're in a            whole heap of trouble, and Rayman 3's potty cameraman gets you in a            mess time and time again. For example, you're normally faced with            around three or four Hoodlums, and in order to lock onto them,            you've got to be pretty close. If you can lock on immediately, then            it's quite straightforward to dispatch almost anything without too            much hassle, but the game's inherent, overriding flaw is that the            camera is so erratic that even it rarely considers your combat            requirements.                    You can, if you like, attempt to wrestle control back from the CPU            and use the right stick to steer the camera back to a position of            your choosing. Except that the drunken cameraman really doesn't            take too kindly to your insolence, and has a tendency to swing            wildly away from your foe at the most inconvenient time, while            enemy bombardment rains down on your blind side. If you could lock            on from a further distance, and cycle between targets then this            kind of thing wouldn't be an issue, but you'll be regularly            tormented by it, especially once the enemies get smarter, harder            and more evil. It really does let down what is a fundamental part            of the game, and after such a long time in the making, you'd think            that they'd at least get that bit right. Another gaffe is the lack            of a persistent state once you clear a level. Annoyingly, unlike            most games in this genre, all items and monsters return should you            decide to go back and replay a world, making the task of clearing            levels rather more taxing than it should be.        In its favour, Rayman 3 does excel in many other fundamental            areas. Top of the pile is its immensely impressive graphics engine,            which at times is jaw dropping. Set across five worlds, the usual            clich\u00e9s are present and correct (lava, snow, caves, forest,            swamp), but it hardly matters when it looks this good. The            reflective surfaces and detail packed levels add a jaw dropping            sheen to everything, and go towards creating environments that you            actually enjoy exploring. Despite there only being five worlds, the            variety within them is often pleasingly broad - for example midway            through the game you get to ascend, (and then descend) through a            crystal tower, which is this reviewer's opinion is one of the most            stunning settings ever seen in a videogame. The characters are also            laden with detail and incidental touches, and create a cartoon            world feel. It's this undoubted quality that drives you through,            and helps you come to terms with the derivative gameplay and combat            issues.                    The general quality of the script and voice acting has moved into a            different league too, and the game feels far less like the kiddies            platform game of old, and much more in line with the Disney-esque            adult humour seen in the best platformers of late. Globox's            delirious antics as he glugs on yet another barrel of plum juice,            or stands around talking to birds give the game a great deal of            warmth, and this buddy dynamic helps Rayman's appeal extend far            further. The between level sections are, however, rather bolted on            and seem to have no real connection to the main game. The basic            principle sees Rayman hopping between fast approaching white lines            in a psychedelic environment. It's all rather abstract, but seems            to be an excuse to play funky tunes for a few minutes, and dazzle            the player with some whacked out visuals. It's all very trial and            error, and is about as far as the game goes towards offering a            break from the main dish.                    Elsewhere, Rayman 3 offers a myriad of extras that are worthy of            note. Rather than dish out pointless concept sketches and new            costumes as so many games do, collecting the various items that are            scattered around rewards you with points, which in turn unlock a            stack of bonus mini games once you reach preset point limits. In            addition, amusing videos unlock, showing Rayman being tortured in            increasingly brutal ways. Admit it, you would, wouldn't you? And if            that wasn't enough, there are also a number of GBA link-up games,            which we will tell you all about in the near future in a separate            review.                    There plenty to admire about Rayman 3, and for the franchise's            millions of fans, it's going to satisfy their needs for limbless            platforming antics. For the platforming connoisseur, you're going            to be reasonably happy with it; it's pretty, it's quite a            challenge, and is loaded with rewards. But you'll quickly come to            the conclusion that for all its charms, it doesn't offer enough new            ideas, and that its competition is just too strong. Still, for us            to enjoy a Rayman game, that's a revelation in itself.
