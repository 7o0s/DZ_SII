You can race cars at suicidal speedswithout losing your licence, take on world champion boxers withoutlosing your teeth or, as is the case with Super Bomberman, simplydelight in blowing stuff up without risking your life or having anational holiday named after you!As the title suggests, the name of the game in this consoleconversion is explosive destruction. You play the role of acartoony spaceman character blessed with the ability to lay bombs,who has been let loose on a series of colourful maze-like levelswith just one aim in mind. Be it blocks that obstruct your path,monsters intent on chowing down on your on screen hero, or evenrival bombermen out for blood in an explosive face-off all needdispatching with the help of your short-fused friends if you are toprogress. Fortunately you have an unlimited supply of bombs withwhich to take on each level and there are a variety of power-upswhich can be collected when blocks blow up to help increase theblast-radius, your character's speed or the number of bombs you canlay at any one time.The control system is simple and responsive, which is just aswell as the action soon gets pretty frantic, taxing both brain andbrawn as you sprint around the progressively tough mazes trying totrap opponents in a bomb blast whilst keeping yourself at a safedistance. Unfortunately, if you manage to misjudgethe fuse (usually a couple of seconds) or box yourself into acorner then its goodnight Vienna and one life chalked off. There's a level time limit to worry about too, adding to the pressure.All these things work to engender a genuine tension when youplay and you'll frequently find yourself stood next to a pulsatingbomb waiting for another one to go off, hoping you have time toescape. Yet, despite the many and varied dangers, the difficultylevel is pretty well pitched, allowing you to sail through the firstfew arenas and, even when you do begin to struggle, you rarely feeldemoralised enough not to try again. Then again, even if you dotire of the main adventure game, there's the whole other versus-CPU gamemode to explore - placing you in a last-man-standing arena with three othermulti-coloured Bombermen. The challenge here is far more tactical and indeedbecomes far more frantic, especially when the power-ups startmounting up and the screen's filled with huge blasts frommultiple bombs.In truth this is worthy of being a game in its ownright and certainly adds even more bang to an already satisfied buck. It's a near-perfect console gameconversion overall. We'd love a multiplayer option in the next edition butfor now we're more than happy to heartily recommend this crackingtitle that's guaranteed to ignite your en-fuse-iasm for mobilegames."}
