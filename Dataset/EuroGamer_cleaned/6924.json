BattleTech is a game where tension springs from elaborately            decorated playing cards, and entire games can be won or lost on the            thermal properties of a certain piece of equipment. While            MechCommander 2 is based on the technology and background of the            board game, it shares relatively few of the carefully scrutinised            details that have drawn players to the former, and those present            seem to have been dumbed down noticeably.                         This will no doubt prove slightly discomforting for fans            approaching FASA Interactive's latest release with a board game            background. Never fear though - even if MechCommander 2 is slightly            less meticulous in its attention to painstaking detail, it is still            a most enjoyable game in its own right.                         The story is fairly light-hearted - you are a mercenary mech            commander, paid to deal forcefully with a recent surge in attacks            on a couple of noble houses; Davion and Steiner. They are hardly            allies, but the two do recognize the mutual benefit of your employ            and allot a certain amount of funds between them to support your            dirty work. Things progress in a predictably startling manner,            proving for the umpteenth time that things are never precisely as            they seem. I've seen a lot better, and I did at times feel that the            storyline served as an interruption to clarify the slaughter rather            than a realistic chain of events. As such the story was not willing            me on, merely occupying the quiet moments here and there before the            carnage went off on its natural course again.                    The carnage is, of course, where the real appeal of the game stems            from. You have a smattering of mechs at your disposal, and the            point of the game is to direct them into battle. Many of them have            certain special skills, such as the ability to scale cliffs by            thrusting briefly upward with jetpacks, and your main duties in the            campaign area of the game involve moving your troops between            waypoints and the planning and carrying out of attacks and            ambushes. Mechs are fairly large and unwieldy beasts, so you have            to be quite calculated, but neither heat effects nor area-specific            targeting systems have as much effect as the developers once            claimed, so you are less interested in the bodily functions of your            mechs and more on the damage they can do.                         You don't have to do much thinking for your mechs either, as they            have managed to evolve somewhat since the first MechCommander game,            growing brains larger than garden peas, meaning that less            childminding of your units is now neccessary. Your enemies also            appear to be more aggressive than before.                         Although many will claim that the game's true strength is on the            battlefield, I'd argue that there is a lot of fun to be had off it            too. Between battles you are responsible for managing your mechs by            training and equipping them with new tools, picking through the            aftermath of fallen comrades for salvageable material, and            generally customizing your mechs. If the storyline failed to            embrace me, the importance I placed on keeping my prime mechs in            good health and condition certainly did.                    MechCommander 2's minimum system requirements are, by modern            standards, fairly acceptable. Given that many games of late have            seemingly required several Cray supercomputers used in tandem to            render their training missions, let alone actual battles, the            recommendation of a Pentium III 450 with a GeForce card to render            the game properly seems almost fair. Of course, that's nothing like            what FASA require as an absolute minimum, but it's a fairly good            bet that if you have that much oomph the game will be fine.                         You will certainly want a machine that can do the job properly,            because MechCommander 2, while not stunningly attractive, does a            good job as far as strategy titles go. The mech models, which you            can zoom in on and swirl around to your heart's content, are finely            detailed (unlike the play mechanics at times) and lose little of            their appeal as you pan out. In a battle of ten or more mechs            barely a single frame is lost, and flecks of laser fire and            suitably rousing explosions litter the battlefield. It's not all            sunken canyons and barren wastelands either; you also duke it out            amidst industrial areas and in areas as varied as beaches and            forests, towns and farms. The land textures are quite dull and            ugly, but they do the job and help to keep the framerate up.                         Moving on to the audio side of things, effects are splendid.            Gunfire, lasers, explosions, the clinking and clanking of mechs as            they manoeuvre into position and all the rest of the noises blend            menacingly into something like a scene from anime spectacular            Evangelion. The daunting silences that punctuate the fighting are            fairly similar too. The visuals are amiss as far as that comparison            is concerned, but you can't have everything.                    The only thing I feel marred my experience of MechCommander 2 was            the multiplayer functions. I'm probably most upset (although hardly            surprised) by the enforced use of Microsoft's ominous Zone. The            real trouble with it is that you often waste several minutes            getting on to the Zone only to discover that nobody else is doing            likewise. Most disheartening, although as long as you are capable            of hooking yourself up to a LAN every once in a while you will            still derive some pleasure from the game's head-to-head options.                         Other quirks include the slightly puzzling lack of a skirmish            mode. Ever since Command & Conquer I've almost relied upon            strategy games including one of those, and the absence of such an            option here is irritating from two angles: you can't dip into it at            random for a quick knockabout, and you can't test out your            customized mechs in advance of battle. Leading them into the            campaign missions is the only real option. Of course, you could try            multiplayer, but that's often impossible due to the lack of online            opposition.                         Apart from Original War, which I thoroughly enjoyed, MechCommander            2 is probably the only strategy title I've played this year which            has had a profound effect on me. It's not without problems, but            it's entertaining enough for me to cast a blind eye.                        -        Mechwarrior                    4: Vengeance reviewMechwarrior                    4: Vengeance review"}
