I suppose it is one of the few things that has not been done            before, but I was a little dubious as to how a first person view            would work in a golfing sim. For example, how will you be able to            tell how far back you are swinging? Perhaps when the golf club            appears out of the top of your monitor, you will know you are at            the top of your swing?                    Having recently played the superb ~PGA Championship Golf 2000~,            this game has a rather tough mountain to climb to match PGA's            ease-of-use and simulation accuracy. But hey, it has to be called            the Ultimate Golf Simulation for a reason, right? Right?         Ultimate Golf                 comes with a nice variety of game modes, including basic                 practice, full tournament, and four ball, which is by far the                 best of the bunch, placing you in a two vs two battle.                    Although you can play all of your rounds on your own if you want            to, you can also select a group of computer controlled golfers to            play alongside you. This at least gives you a little time to think            through what your next shot is going to be, and stops you from            getting too lonely! With or without company though, you certainly            won't need to worry about getting lost, as there are only three            courses for you to learn. A decidedly stingy selection to say the            least.                    Unfortunately the game's other big feature, the first person view,            is rather disappointing as well. It might well be an original idea,            but to be honest I couldn't really see the point of using it in the            end. If anything it only serves to confuse, especially when using            Amateur or Ultimate modes of play, and I found the game is better            played in the traditional third person view.                    Playing in third person mode also gives you more excuse to            customise your player before the round, although this isn't as            exciting as it sounds - your choice of faces and clothing is            limited to eight pre-set players and three different colours for            your shirt! You can choose which clubs you are going to use rather            than accepting the defaults though, and this is also where you            choose which control method you are going to be using.                    One of the things that can make or break a golfing sim is it's            control method, and Ultimate Golf adopts a slight variation on the            normal arc-and-snap style in the Amateur and Ultimate modes, as            well as letting you choose to use the more basic Pro-Click method.            I found that neither gave that all-important feeling that you are            in complete control though.         Playing Ultimate Golf is fairly straight forward, with                 the correct club having already been automatically chosen for                 you. You position yourself either by use of the course map, or                 by clicking on the main game window itself. Foot adjustment is                 also possible, allowing you to perform hook and slice shots.                    Once in position, you simply click the left mouse button and drag            upwards and to the right to establish the power of your shot. Then            with a smooth movement to the left and downwards you instigate the            swing. With any luck you will hit the ball and follow the red            guideline on the course map that indicates the perfect line for            your shot.                    Drive shots are simple to perform, but when it comes to more            complicated putts the game really becomes something of a chore to            play. What looks like a simple tap onto the green turns into a            major event, with the fine line between over- and under-hitting a            ball precariously balanced.                    The ball physics are all wrong too, with hardly any bounce on long            drives, plus the uncanny knack for a ball to land on a downward            slope and then not move! There are no challenging shots involved on            the green either, making it a simple case of not over-hitting the            straight shot to finish the hole. I would have liked for there to            have been sloping approaches to make things a little more            interesting, rather than the game's perfectly flat greens.         Ultimate Golf doesn't                 look too bad, and could have been a lot nicer with the removal                 of the 2D-bitmapped trees and a little more variety in                 scenery. There are no TV camera scaffolds or clubhouses, and                 no crowd watching you either.                    Some nice little animations appear on courses though, like the            buzzards in the desert sky on the canyon course. The fogging effect            on the British course is quite nice as well, while the canyon            course looks suitably hot and dry. With only three courses though,            there's simply not enough variety there to maintain your interest.                    The golfers look fine, until they come to take a shot. They hold            the club more like they are playing cricket, and it's a wonder that            they can putt at all with the weird angles they swing from. Putting            on the green is also rather poorly implemented, completely failing            to capture the smooth and subtle movement of the real game.                    As for sound .. what sound? Apart from the rare ripple of applause            from the invisible crowd and the sound of club on ball, that is            pretty much it. There is no commentary, no music, no shouts of            despair from the golfers, and only the odd duck quacking away            merrily to itself! I know golf is a sedate and quiet game, but this            is ridiculous.         With a bit                 more care and attention this could well have been a                 pleasurable golfing experience. Regrettably, the finicky                 controls on delicate shots, poor player and ball physics, and                 the almost total lack of sound, make this game nothing more                 than average.                    My biggest gripe though is with the absence of course variety, with            just the three courses on offer. Sadly you will have seen all the            courses and their fairways in your first sitting, and the gameplay            just isn't strong enough to keep you interested in playing the same            courses time and time again."}
