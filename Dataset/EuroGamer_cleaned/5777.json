Enter Oddworld : Munch's Oddysee, a 3D sequel to side-scrolling            platformers Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exxodus.                        For those of you not familiar with the series, Munch's Oddysee            includes a handy option to show you the story so far, told through            cutscenes from the previous games. The short version is that the            evil Glukkons (environment-destroying industrialists) and Vykkers            (mad scientists with a penchant for experimenting on live animals)            have been defeated in their scheme to turn the incredibly ugly but            apparently quite tasty Mudokon into canned meat by Abe, who is now            living as a hero amongst his people.                        The game proper begins in the oceans of Oddworld though,            introducing a new (and equally unattractive) character called Munch            - a one-footed bug-eyed amphibian whose fellow Gabbits have been            hunted to extinction for their lungs (used for transplants) and            eggs (sold as Gabbiar). Unfortunately Munch isn't incredibly            bright, and having walked into a trap he starts the game strapped            to a chair in a Vykkers lab with a tracking device bolted to his            head. The good news is that he can use this bizarre cranial implant            to activate machinery and give off electric shocks. Before long            he's loose in the lab with a bunch of furry little animals called            Fuzzles, which look incredibly cute .. until they bare their teeth            and try to bite someone's leg off in a furball frenzy.                    This latest Oddysee is unusual in that it allows you to control            both Abe and Munch, sometimes working seperately but often side by            side in the same level. Each has his own strengths and weaknesses,            as well as unique special abilities that give you several different            ways of approaching most puzzles.                        For example, Abe can pick up and throw objects, which is handy for            getting other characters over obstacles or dropping bombs on your            enemies. He can also call on the services of any Mudokon you            encounter, greeting them with a cheerful ~hello fellow chumps~ when            you press the Y button, or gathering all the Mudokon in an area by            holding it down. Once you have a group of natives under your            command you can use them to chant, pull levers and attack nearby            enemies, although they're not the sharpest tools in the shed. What            little AI the game's characters have is truly pitiful, and            sometimes one of your followers will get lost or caught on a sharp            corner, or just stand around scratching his ugly behind while his            friends get beaten up by guards and you frantically press down on            the B button to try and convince him to get on with it.                        If your Mudokon get slaughtered you can at least resurrect them in            many of the levels by finding the appropriate totem, where you hand            over spooce to bring your dead back to life. Spooce is a green            ball-shaped plant which you will find scattered throughout most            levels, and it's also used by Abe's most amusing special power -            possession. By chanting for a few seconds and expending some spooce            you can create a glowing ball which you then steer towards another            character to take control of them. Rampaging around the map as a            heavily armed big bro slig can be a welcome change of pace and a            good way of letting off steam, although the controls are rather            awkward. Trying to steer with the left analogue pad, point its gun            with the right and fire by holding down the right pad is a bit of a            handful.                    Indeed, the controls in general are a little awkward and took some            getting used to. The easiest buttons to reach are often wasted on            functions which you hardly ever need to use, while vital commands            are assigned to out-of-the-way buttons.                        For example, the camera is controlled with the D-pad located just            beneath the left analogue pad, which you use to move your character            around. Needless to say this makes it unnecessarily hard to adjust            your view and move at the same time, and you have to wonder why            they didn't go for the more usual control system of moving your            character with one analogue pad and using the other for the camera.            This wouldn't be such a big issue if it wasn't for the fact that            the camera frequently manages to end up jammed up close behind your            character or hidden behind an obstacle.                        Whether or not it's getting in your way, the scenery is something            of a disappointment. The outdoors areas are reasonably impressive            (if a little over reliant on distance fogging) and the water            effects are nice, but some of the interiors are made up almost            entirely of bland featureless box-like rooms. Other sections,            particularly in the later stages of the game, are more detailed,            with huge machinery and stained glass windows casting rays of light            into the hall. The various hideous looking characters are nicely            modelled and animated as well, but you could hardly accuse Munch's            Oddysee of stretching the Xbox's capabilities.                    The gameplay can get a little repetitive in places as well, with            some sections relying very much on trial and error. Allowing Abe            and Munch to interact is a nice touch, but often levels devolve            into clambering over an obstacle with Abe, opening a door to let            Munch reach a piece of machinery, using it to unlock another door            for Abe, and so on for another half hour.                        Munch does open up some new possibilities for the game though, such            as the ability to operate cranes. There's a certain satisfaction to            be had from picking up a savage slog from its cage and dropping it            in the middle of a group of guards, or feeding someone into a            recycling machine, producing a shower of meaty chunks. Although            Munch's Oddysee scores high on cuteness, there's plenty of dark            humour there as well, and if you're feeling evil you can get up to            all sorts of mischief what with Abe's possession globes and Munch's            crane operating skills. Jumping into cannons to get hurled into a            new part of the level or bombing around in Munch's little            wheelchair can be strangely amusing as well, although the squeaky            wheel starts to grate after a while.                        Ultimately then Munch's Oddysee is something of a mixed bag. It has            some highly entertaining and at times hilarious moments, but            personally I found the humour very hit and miss. The voice acting            is superb, but there isn't enough variety and the two or three            comments which each of the characters will make in any given            situation soon become grating. If I hear ~hey it's Abe~ one more            time I'm going to drop someone into a scrab pen. Add to that poorly            thought out controls and a camera which can leave you staring at a            blank wall at the most inconvenient of moments and things can get            rather frustrating.                        -        Munch's                    Oddysee screenshotsMunch's                    Oddysee screenshotsXbox                    European launch round-upXbox                    European launch round-up"}
