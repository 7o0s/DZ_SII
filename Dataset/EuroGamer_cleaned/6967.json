Not Tropico.            Transplanting the action to a small Caribbean island and casting            you in the role of ~El Presidente~, this is a game with its tongue            firmly planted in its cheek.                    Starting the game you are given the choice of which dictator to            play as, with options ranging from Fidel Castro and Augusto            Pinochet to Evita Peron and .. um .. Lou Bega. Yes, the man            responsible for that reprehensible slice of pop music ~Mambo #5~.            Like I said, this isn't a game that takes itself seriously. Once            you have picked out your favourite dictator you are given a dossier            on them which allows you to change their characteristics, such as            who they are (from Harvard graduate to former farmer), how they            came to power (democratic election, installed by the CIA, military            coup etc) and what their strengths and weaknesses are (such as            being an alcoholic, flatulent, a diplomat or an entrepreneur).                    Although it sounds silly, all of these choices have a big effect on            how your game will play out. For example, if you were given your            job by the KGB your people won't be too surprised if you refuse to            hold free elections while the Russians will be far more favourable            towards you, showering you with foreign aid. On the other hand, if            you chose to be Lou Bega your island will be more popular with            tasteless Yanqui tourists, and your nightclubs are the toast of the            town.                    Underneath the humour there is a serious sim though, with a complex            economic system and a bewildering array of buildings to construct            and edicts to issue. The game is a fine balancing act, with a            number of domestic factions to keep happy as well as Russia and the            USA, and the threat of being overthrown by a military coup,            revolution, election defeat or foreign invasion is always there to            keep you on your toes.                    Although there is a small selection of preset missions (such as            recovering from an earthquake or building up your island's economy            after its lumber industry is brought to its knees by            deforestation), the real heart of the game is the random scenario            mode. Here you can create your own customised country to rule over            by adjusting the size, height, population and mineral richness of            your island, select how long you want the game to continue, and            choose from optional mission objectives such as padding your own            secret Swiss bank account or making your islanders the happiest in            the Caribbean. If you just want to kick back and soak up the            atmosphere, you can also opt for an open-ended game with no victory            conditions or time limit.                    Generally you will start off with a handful of islanders, a few            farms, a dock and your palace. From this inauspicious start you            must build up your economy with more farms, mines and logging            camps, as well as providing housing for your citizens, who start            the game living in primitive shacks. Distilleries, lumber mills and            cigar factories can provide more valuable exports, while your            people will soon begin to demand entertainment, health care,            education and churches. With a limited cash flow to pay for new            buildings, you have to juggle the requests of the various factions            on the island with your own long term plans. A few hours with            Tropico will make you realise that Fidel Castro isn't doing such a            bad job of things after all...                    The size of your island makes things even harder, as the sea            surrounding your country limits expansion. Those golden beaches            might make the perfect tourist resort, but could you make more            money by strip mining the mountain overlooking them? You need to            build a power plant to supply electricity for a hospital or TV            station, but if you don't place it downwind of your town you will            have to deal with pollution.                    Throw in a range of different crops for your farms to grow (from            corn and bananas to coffee and tobacco) along with a wide selection            of edicts which you can issue (cracking down on littering,            encouraging education or offering part of your island for the USA            or Russia to use as a military base) and you have an almost endless            series of choices to make as you decide how to develop your island,            both physically and politically. Are you going to be a corrupt            dictator filling your pockets from your people's suffering, or a            benevolent leader trying to improve their lot in life? Will you            hold on to power by executing your rivals and building guard posts            all around your city, or will you hold regular free elections, even            if you may have to (cough) re-interpret some of the votes            after the fact.                    All of this is controlled in-game using a fairly simple interface,            allowing you to place new buildings, set construction priorities,            adjust wages, fees and rents, fire people, issue edicts and limit            the number of workers in a particular building. As in most city            management games you have no direct control over your citizens, but            there are enough tools here to indirectly influence them into doing            more or less what you want them to. You can also view them            individually, getting information on what a particular person is            thinking, which (along with the annual report on your economy and            citizens) can give you valuable feedback on what you are doing            wrong, as well as some amusement from comments such as ~what this            island needs is a good railroad simulator~ and ~work, sleep, eat,            sunbathe - there must be more to life~.                    It's not all good news though, and the lack of direct control does            bring up problems. The biggest issue is with teamsters, who seem to            be fat, lazy and incompetent, which is perhaps realistic but does            prove annoying. It's not unusual to see your economy lurching in            and out of debt because of entirely random factors such as which            products your teamsters happened to take to your dock to be            exported and how many ships turned up to collect them. With no way            of ordering them to carry out specific tasks there's little you can            do about this.                    Which can make things rather haphazard, as one year you may earn            tens of thousands of dollars from exporting cigars, lumber, gold            and alcohol, only for you to find your island in the red the very            next year because your dock hands were all asleep when a ship            arrived or your teamsters were transferring food to a marketplace            instead of moving goods to your dock. This can often be solved by            hiring more teamsters, building additional docks closer to mines            and factories, or laying down roads to allow your teamsters to move            around faster. But sometimes even the best planned economy can            collapse overnight for no obvious good reason, leaving you            powerless for a year or more while you wait for enough products to            reach your docks to buy you out of debt.                    Because once your treasury is in the red, there is very little you            can do to get out of debt apart from sitting back and praying - as            soon as funds fall below $0 you are unable to build anything, issue            any edicts or hire any more foreign graduates to work for you. All            you can do is reduce wages and tinker with prices to see if you can            reduce your overheads, while hoping that next year trade will pick            up. This makes relying on exports dangerous, and it pays to have an            alternative source of cash such as tourism to lessen the impact of            random factors on your economy. This is more of a work-around than            a solution though.                    Apart from these annoying glitches in the trade system, Tropico is            both very funny and highly addictive. The graphics are nicely            detailed and beautifully animated, and the whole thing runs fairly            smoothly even at 1600x1200 on a reasonably specced machine, with            the ability to zoom right in on individual buildings and people or            to pull back your view until you can see your entire island below            you. A special mention also goes to the music - I'm not usually a            big fan of latin music, but the soundtrack fits the game so            perfectly that you can't help humming along to it. It's just a            shame that there aren't more songs, as they can get a little            repetitive after several hours of playing the game.                    If you can overlook the niggles with the island's economy, Tropico            is one of the best city building sims of recent years and certainly            the most amusing. Well worth a look for SimCity veterans and            newcomers to the genre alike."}
