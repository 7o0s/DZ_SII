But whether or            not you like the show and whether or not you lust after the            carefully constructed 25-year-old, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is very            nearly one of the best Xbox exclusive titles we've seen.                    The third person Buffy is built around a very simple combat            mechanic - punch and kick repeatedly, in tandem, in combination            with other functions, or with stake in hand. Vampires come at you            with a similarly effective arsenal of moves, and you have to work            through their blocks and empty their energy meter enough to leave            them susceptible to a staking, whether they be on the floor,            walking wounded, lunging for your throat or leaping at you from            above. The first time you stake a vamp you'll grin maniacally, and            the sight of a despised vamp receiving a heartfelt blow and            dissipating into ash, whilst screaming in agony of course, is...            well, worryingly and consistently satisfying.                    Vamps of all shapes and sizes stock the various levels, but as you            progress you run into the much tougher hellhounds, relentless            zombie women, skeletal warriors whose limbs need severing, and            specially imported vamps with much more to say for themselves.                    The good news is that The Collective has created a selection of            Slayer Moves and Super Slayer Moves; one-time attacks which feed            off your Slayer Power. Slayer Power accumulates as you collect the            orbs left behind by former vamps and other creatures, and with a            few grunts out of the way you can unleash everything from powerful            jab cross combos to jumping back fist attacks and bicycle kicks.            Combos, slayer moves and super slayer moves are all easily            performed and rely on Street Fighter-style analogue stick and            action button combinations, which your friendly watcher Giles will            inform you about between missions.        The structure of the game is thus; Buffy goes to a location in            Sunnydale, purges it of vamps and other nasties whilst jumping and            climbing through various obstacles they've set out, learns some            more about the grand plot and then takes on a boss, before retiring            to the library for a conference with Giles, Xander, Cordelia and            Willow. As she goes about her business, she collects various            potions and stakes to keep her going, and even the odd single-use            item like a shovel or mop. Later on she gets her mits on hellfire            and holy water launchers to complement her zoomable crossbow, but            these play a lesser role than her flailing limbs.                    To start the game, Buffy takes on a training course to introduce            her to the controls and combat. It's at this very early stage that            the darkness becomes a problem - even jumping between supposedly            verdant grassy ledges is impeded by an almost jet blackness which            haunts you throughout. Falling from ledges, ladders and worse is            your fate unless you find the brightness option and turn it right            up. Sadly, this leaves the visuals quite washed out and PC-like -            not a good start.                    Fight on through the training course though, and you'll see what            the game is really about - it's a glorified obstacle course with            the odd vaguely mind-warming puzzle and carefully cordoned off            vampire encounters. It's the strength of the combat which keeps you            coming back - certainly not the level design, which is often fairly            pedestrian at best. Take the first real level after the training            section, Sunnydale High, as an example. Some discourteous peeping            Toms interrupt Buffy's cheerleading practice, and so she has to            trawl the halls dispatching them. As she wanders around school, she            can only open doors lit up by a green sign, and she has to kill the            vamps before most of the doors will open anyway.                    The whole level literally revolves around the school hall, which is            regularly visible through internal windows, and there is little or            no variation in design. At one point our heroine runs into Willow            and the others in a classroom and learns some more about the            menace, but otherwise it's simple kill, door, kill, door gameplay            until she gets to the boss fight.        The            deeply formulaic nature of the single player game is almost            shameless by the time you get to Angel's mansion, which is under            siege. Enter a room and a green force field pops up over both            entrance and exit - defeat the enemies, move on and the next room            will behave in the same way. Even the most obscure locations manage            this - in a particular graveyard section, Buffy is surrounded by            decomposing skeletal attackers, and the whole group is surrounded            by a white, mystical force field, which shoehorns Buffy into a            claustrophobic and quite unmanageable encounter, eventually            emerging only to do much the same again.                    Your reward for defeating a section is a chat with the gang back at            HQ. Each character in Buffy has been designed as a cartoonish, but            very representative approximation of their TV counterpart, and with            only a few exceptions they work. Buffy looks very much like Buffy,            even if the voice actress behind her squawks is having difficulty,            and Willow, Xander and Cordelia all look and dress appropriately.            Giles and Angel are a bit of a problem though - Giles' shoulders            look as though they're trying to escape, and his nose clearly wants            out, while Angel looks sheepish and far from the ravenous, beast of            a man he really should be.                    The best character in the game (and arguably the series) though is            Spike. His affected English accent with a Northern lilt provides a            delightful contrast, and his role as deputy badguy, answering only            to The Master, means he's one of the most charismatic and            mysterious enemies in the game - after all, he can't die, or can            he? He gets all the best lines too - a particular favourite being            ~put her down you wanker,~ which had me chuckling away for a few            seconds. It's just not what you expect at the time!        In            bringing Buffy to the Xbox, The Collective has produced what they            describe as a lost episode of season three. If you know where all            the characters were at that point, then good, but if you don't it            doesn't really matter. Events elsewhere are borne out in the            dialogue between characters and events on-screen. Voice acting is            generally very good, and the script is also good, although there            are some aspects which fall short. The sexual innuendo is childish            but neat, but Buffy's one-liners are un-Gellarly and perhaps even a            bit stupid.                    The graphics on the whole match the mayhem, as do the sound effects            and soundtrack. The game never looks like it'll give the Halos and            Gothams of this world a scare, but the level interiors are nicely            textured, and the animation is very dynamic and cleverly            engineered. Plus, there's a sufficient amount of detail that you            can look at your positioning, take a swing at a vamp and send him            backwards onto that outstretched table leg you spotted earlier. The            only problem from our point of view is the camera, which, despite            direct control mapped to the right analogue stick, is not very            helpful at all and often causes problems. Fortunately, you can lock            onto and cycle through targets using the right trigger - without            this, Buffy would be really frustrating.                    In audio terms, the screams, thumps and thwacks are all top notch,            and the soundtrack is mostly ambient and quite fitting. You'll be            pleased to know that the intro sequence (a must-watch) is a gamed            up version of the opening credits, complete with TV theme tune, and            if you make it through the 10 or so hours of this you'll... no, we            won't tell you. You should find out for yourself. However, you            should know that finishing the game unlocks a neat bonus aspect.                    So, however surprisingly, Buffy is mostly very good and mostly            worth having. The combat is quite repetitive, but it's always            rewarding, and the only criticisms we have of the game at large are            the way you're shoehorned into battles and the placing of save            points. Often with only a bit of health and a single stake, you'll            have to retry a section multiple times to get anywhere, and this            can become deeply frustrating before you know it. Like the vamps            though, having your health bar knocked the whole way down isn't the            kiss of death - they still need to take a chunk out of your neck.            And you can always pick the game up from various save points prior            to that - each catalogued and remembered by the Xbox hard disk.                    Do I recommend Buffy? In a word, yes. In several more, it's without            doubt the best game of a TV show to date, and despite a few            niggles, the absence of Sarah Michelle Gellar and the feel of a PC            title, it captures the essence of combat, characters and quests            which runs through the series, and it's easily worth sinking your            teeth into."}
