Presumably fearful ofdisgruntled astronauts being unable to write their postcards home,the Space Agency immediately assigned some of its brightest mindsto the problem. Six months and a million dollars later they solvedit, developing a ballpoint that worked upside down and in zerogravity.The Russians used a pencil.Whether or not this story is actually true [there appears to be some debate - Ed], it's a great analogyfor attempts to simulate football on a mobile phone. Most gamesfollow the example of the million dollar pen, squeezing ever moresubtleties, strategies and tricks onto the straining phone controlsto replicate the home console experience.Playman World Soccer, on the other hand, has mostdefinitely opted to be a pencil, albeit a fabulously colourful onewith a novelty pencil top.Instead of trying to simulate every aspect of the beautifulgame, its creator, Mr. Goodliving, has concentrated on fashioning abeautiful control system that suits the mobile phone.Hence, where other titles demand the use of eight different keysto move your players, here you simply use two (left and right) torotate their direction of movement. And rather than have differentbuttons for short passes and crosses, the power of any kick dependson the length of time you hold the appropriate button. Shootingemploys a similar system: press once for a snapshot, hold down fora power shot with aftertouch.With tackles and speed-bursts similarly handled, the resultingsystem employs just five buttons or, preferably, one mobile joypadto give you full control. Whilst this may sound a bit restrictive(especially to those reared on other footie sims), give it a littletime ooh, say the 30 seconds of 'warm-up' mode and you'll be afan.Admittedly the game favours a dribbling approach over intricatepassing (we won our early games by turning defenders, occasionallyusing the speed burst, and firing in diagonal shots past someinitially hapless keepers) but that doesn't preclude more subtleplay. Your team-mates are permanently on the move, so short passesto create space and better shooting angles are always an option,while the results of a difficult lofted ball or cross can be atruly rewarding (especially when met by the forehead of one of yourplayers en route to goal). Tackling is a similarly dark art tomaster defensive duties are hardly helped by an over enthusiasticreferee and we still haven't completely aced the use of the curvingpower shots.There are a variety of challenges on offer. For a Quick Match,you can pit any of the international teams against teach other,whilst Arcade thrusts you into a succession of sudden-death matchesor penalty competitions. The Career Mode is at the heart of thegame, though. Here you guide your redheaded Playman team through avariety of tournaments against progressively tough opponents.Win a challenge and you earn stars to spend on improving yourteam, as well as unlocking more advanced levels of competition.More determined players will be glad of that option. It's only inthe 'Professional' stage that you must utilise more advancedplaying skills you can easily play successfully for an hour withthe basic controls.Playman World Soccer doesn't offer the intricacies ofGameloft's Real Football. You could even argue that with itssimplified control system, fallible keepers, paucity of headers,and just seven players a-side, the simulation is closer to thelikes of Subbuteo or table football than to the real thing.But that's to miss the point. As with most Playman games(check out Summer Games too), the idea is to distil the spirit ofthe sport into a fun experience that you'll want to keep comingback to, and it does that with unrivalled charm (we particularlylove the stereotypical national players).Playman World Soccer will surely face plenty ofcompetition in the months ahead. But right now, its accessiblecontrols and pure sense of fun put it top of the league."}
