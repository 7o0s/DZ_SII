The hugely successful Street Fighter series of games have undergone many revisions and re-issues and still fall off the shelves at the games stores. Now they're trying the same trick with the popular Resident Evil formula by adding growling Jurassic-Park style dinosaur goodness to the zombie-fest to create an entirely new survival horror game.            The saga begins when a crack team of commandos parachute onto the            mysterious secret island facility of Ibis. We catch an early            glimpse of the dinosaur horrors to come when one of their members            lands dangerously close to a hungry T-Rex with very messy results.            The remaining three members regroup and their mission is to locate            and extract the main villain of the game, Professor Kirk. This            enigmatic scientist was thought to have died, but new information            suggest his death was faked and that he's conducting new            experiments on this remote island, his research apparently            concentrates on finding a way to take energy from the atmosphere            and convert it to a usable form in a bid to clean the polluted            planet of its toxins and create a badly needed new power source in            the process.             When your character, the                 extremely foxy Regina and the rest of the team enter the base                 they find it strangely quiet and empty of human life. Your                 team splits up to investigate, and your left alone to work out                 just what's happened to the bases former inhabitants and                 locate the missing professor Kirk.                         Apart from the obvious shift to large lizards instead of undead,            the most noticeable change from the Resident Evil games are the            real-time environments. Resident Evil used pre-rendered backdrops            with the modelled characters overlaid to create some of the most            atmospheric locations ever seen in a game. Dino Crisis replaces            this with some fantastically detailed three dimensional            environments, but keeps the atmospheric camera angles from the            previous games. What this loses in locational detail, it gains in            flexibility. The camera in Dino Crisis is used to great effect so            that in key events and locations it shifts from its fixed position            to pan a scene, or follows Regina as she jogs down an unexplored            corridor. It's extremely effective and cunningly not over exploited            so that the impact is heightened when the new techniques are            employed. Despite this new graphical complexity, there are no            glitches or polygonal break up found in other fully three            dimensional titles, and the locations are masterfully constructed            with almost the same intricate detail of Resident Evil's            pre-rendered scenes with an impressively smooth frame rate            maintained throughout. A very welcome benefit of the new graphics            engine is a far shorter loading time between sections, and far            larger sections are contained in-between each reload.         Real-time lighting is also                 employed giving the already impressive player and enemy models                 added weight and presence. The dinosaur models look amazing as                 well, highly detailed, fast moving and plenty of teeth! It's a                 visually splendid game, a real achievement on the poor ageing                 Playstation.                         Capcom have added far more than improved visuals and dinosaurs to            the Resident Evil formula. Significantly to combat this new and            faster foe Regina can now walk and hold a weapon simultaneously,            and has a badly needed 180 degree spin button to catch those            rapidly moving dinosaurs. Believe me this is important, the            dinosaurs are a world apart from the slow moving zombies from            Resident Evil, the 'raptors leap and dive about, and at some points            team up and require quick thought, cunning and strategy to defeat.            If they take you down, they can pin you almost like in wrestling,            furious bashing on the joypad is the only way to become free from            its grip.                         The inventory system has been improved, it's far easier to manage            your carried items, and a slightly more complex storage system has            been implemented over Resident Evil's strange chest network. Saving            is no longer restricted to collected items, but can be done            whenever you pass through a 'safe room', however your final score            will reflect the number of saves so its still best to save as            infrequently as you dare. Items can be combined to improve their            effect similar to the coloured plants from Resident Evil, but this            has been improved to encompass many different items throughout the            game, including your weaponry.                         The puzzles also seem to be a touch more complex than the early            zombie outings, with some great variety including colour and            pattern matching and word-based conundrums. A choice has to be made            at certain points of the game too, creating story branches where            the plot changes based on these decisions, adding to the replay            value of the title.         Dino Crisis is almost a perfect                 progression from the Resident Evil series of games. Die hard                 fans on the survival horror genre might not find the game as                 scary as it should be, a couple of big lizards coming at you                 just aren't as creepy as a room full of half rotted zombies,                 but the new enemies are quick and deadly enough to make you                 jump in a darkened room and rest assured there's more than                 plenty of blood. Essentially this is Resident Evil with big                 lizards but there's by far enough added extras to make it                 stand on its own two clawed and scaly feet, making Dino Crisis                 a must have for fans of the genre and newcomers alike."}
