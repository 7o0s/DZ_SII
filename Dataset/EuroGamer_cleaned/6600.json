{"ref": "https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sonicmega-gc", "date": "1 May 2003", "game_name": "Sonic Mega Collection", "text": "In 1991, the idea of Sonic The Hedgehog on a Nintendo console was            ludicrous. The idea of seven Sonic games on one tiny piece of at            the time unheard of proprietary media, sold for \u00a330 at the            average games shop, was even wackier. If you'd turned to us at the            time and said that in 2003 we'd be playing Sonic 1-3 on a Nintendo,            we'd have said ~what are you talking about, man? I don't            play videogames, man - games are so uncool!~ Yeah well, we            all did it, didn't we?        In            a way, that should tell you all you need to know. This is a            Sega-developed compilation which plays host to the first three            'proper' 2D side-scrolling Sonic The Hedgehog titles, companion            cart Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic 3D, Sonic Spinball and Dr.            Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine - and the youngest of these titles is            from the second-to-last generation of Sega consoles. The rest date            back as far as '91, and everything has been perfectly emulated,            right through to the tear-jerking slowdown.                    Sonics 1-3 and Sonic & Knuckles are of course traditional            left-to-right, fast-as-you-can platform jaunts, and remain mostly            intact (and brilliant - they're occasionally brainless but always            entertaining). They dispense with the modern-day formalities of            intrusive, couldn't care less storylines and instead focus on            intricate platform design. Levels are grouped in 'zones', each of            which usually consists of three levels, culminating in an encounter            with Dr. Robotnik in some sort of corpulent mechanical monstrosity,            and each zone is themed in some way. Green Hill was a regular, with            its lush, bright, two-tone greenery and spots of purple flower            petals and other zones would take you through Vegas-like pinball            zones, underwater, through lava-soaked ruins and high up into the            sky, as Sonic and companions tried to rescue the friendly animals            of the world from enslavement in robotic exosuits.                    Of course they aren't the biggest games in the world by modern            standards, but they're all worth finishing, if only to witness the            simplistic beauty of games like Sonic 2 on the big screen. Watching            those simple landscapes roll past in the background, seeing for the            first time in ages the chunky, inexplicably geometric, Tetris-like            arrangement of blocks beneath the grass on the bottom half of the            screen, and struggling against slowdown, water currents and a timer            to get Sonic that vital gasp of air is fantastic. Each game built            on the previous one in a sensible and enjoyable manner, with new            characters, new abilities (like the chargeable spin) and new            levels.                    In terms of changes, we've only spotted a couple of things. First            of all; Sonic The Hedgehog 2's multiplayer mode with both Sonic and            Tails working in unison has been beefed up to full resolution from            its cut-down original, and second; we couldn't get any cheats to            work. Oh don't judge us, we just wanted to see if the old            up/down/left/right/A+start level select worked. It didn't. Leave us            alone.        However, as Saturn owners will be muttering under their breath,            they've had this privilege before thanks to Sonic Jam, and assuming            they took it up, they're wondering what's so great about this ~Mega            Collection~ besides the Mega Drive platform throwbacks.                    Well folks, the sad truth is that there isn't much. Sonic CD didn't            make it onto the disc, despite being one of the best titles in the            long-running series, so we're left with Sonic 3D (an extension of            the Mega Drive Flicky game, which is a bit like Marble Madness with            Sonic darting around an isometric world rounding up little birds            and returning them home), Sonic Spinball (Sonic as a pinball game,            with as much jerkiness as ever), and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean            Machine (a Puyo Puyo-style puzzle game, which isn't as good as            Tetris or anything like that, but warrants the odd go if you're            bored of all the others).                    Beyond that, there are no new games per se, but there are lots of            things to do. You can unlock a number of mini-games, like Blue            Sphere (collect all the blue spheres on a spherical map), and Sega            has packed the disc with DVD-style extras, like each of the games'            manuals, a high-res comic, various illustrations, trailers and even            the 'History of Sonic' video. The fact that you can play it in 60Hz            is another boon, too, but on the other hand, the menus have            blimmin' load screens, which is ludicrous.        So what do we reckon overall? Well, hearing that wonderful            theme tune in all its various incarnations was enough to have us            frothing at the mouth in anticipation, and even the absence of            Sonic CD and a few loose ends here and there weren't enough to            scupper our enjoyment of Mega Collection.                    If you were sceptical about this congregation of low-end            platformers, which artificially preserve their own shortcomings and            haven't seen the light of day for many a year, then you probably            found little to sway you in this review, and should be able to find            better things to spend your money on this month. We're not going to            stop you.                    But in our view, for most people Sonic Mega Collection will either            prove to be a dewy-eyed stroll down memory lane, or a trip through            some truly inspirational platformers for recent converts - and we            can all marvel together at the hilariously low-res parallax            scrolling backgrounds, as Sonic zooms around in glorious RGB            colour, and think about how different things are now.                    Whichever group you fall into though, you've got to applaud Sega            for keeping its end up. It's been original Sonic content only on            GBA so far, and this title is a vastly preferable alternative to a            myriad Sonic Advances in the style of Nintendo's Mario rehashes. If            you buy it, you can look forward to many hours of Sonic-related            fun, and most places are flogging it for \u00a330. Bravo, Sega.
