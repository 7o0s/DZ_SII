You play the Shadow Man, Mike LeRoi, an immortal voodoo warrior who            has to fight his way through both the land of the living and the            land of the dead to save the world from oblivion.                    From the moment the game begins, with a cutscene featuring the            demonic Legion recruiting Victorian serial killer Jack The Ripper            to build a giant adventure playground for the criminally insane            called ~Asylum~, you know this is going to be a bizarre and            downright disturbing experience...                    Shadow Man is an incredibly atmospheric game, especially in            Deadside where blood flows in rivers, wood and stretched skin are            the main building materials, and tortured souls and zombie-like            creatures wander around spitting green goop at you.                    The sound effects and music suck you into the game and send a chill            up your spine. The dialogue is pretty cheesy at times, but it all            adds to the game's charm.                    The graphics engine is hardly cutting edge either, but it does a            competent job. In places the world is rather sparse with far too            many featureless rectangular corridors and big empty rooms, but            generally the level design is very good.                    The models are the only real let down - they look blocky, and are            animated in an awkward, disjointed way that makes them look like            puppets being jerked around by invisible strings.         Unfortunately atmosphere isn't everything though, and the            gameplay can rapidly get frustrating and repetitive.                    To win the game you will need to find and absorb the ~dark souls~            which are scattered throughout the game. These increase your voodoo            powers, allowing you to open more of the sealed gateways in            Darkside, giving you access to new levels. There are also many            weapons, items and powerups which often give you access to parts of            a map that you couldn't reach before.                    This means that you'll be constantly going back to levels you've            already visited to try and find areas you couldn't get to before.            The levels themselves are massive and labyrinthine, making it easy            to get lost, and every time you revisit a level it is restocked            with monsters and items.                    As your voodoo powers increase, the number of enemies you must            fight increases as well. By the end of the game you'll be            struggling through hordes of creatures every time you revisit a            map, running round and round in circles trying to find the one area            you haven't reached yet.         Controls are another big problem, made worse by the game's            reliance on pixel perfect jumps and close quarters combat.                    Swimming is a total nightmare. You use the jump key to move            forwards while underwater, and the backwards and forwards keys            angle your body up and down. This can be very disorientating,            especially as the controls are different when you reach the            surface.                    Shadow Man also has something called ~lock on strafing~. When your            gun locks on to a target, strafing will cause you to circle around            them instead of moving from side to side. Because targetting is            erratic at best, in practice this just makes controlling your            character even more difficult.                    Worst of all, whenever the game's frame rate drops off you get            control lag. When this happens there's a noticeable delay between            pressing a key and your character reacting to it.                    Despite having a 300Mhz Pentium II with a RivaTNT graphics card,            way above the minimum spec for the game, because of control lag            I've had to play at the lowest colour depth and resolution to make            the game playable. Which is annoying.         Mouse support is also terrible. Even on ~high~ sensitivity you            have to move your mouse all the way across your mousepad two or            three times just to get your character to turn around.                    And although you can spin the camera around your character and zoom            in and out, you can't look up and down without going into sniper            mode, at which point you can't move. Sometimes you can't even see            where your feet are without switching camera views, which obviously            makes judging jumps rather difficult...                    On the bright side, the camera does do a great job of keeping clear            of the walls and avoiding the kind of clipping problems that plague            many other third person games.         Shadow Man could                 have been a great game, but the awkward controls and constant                 backtracking makes it very frustrating at times. It's also a                 little disappointing that the game looks virtually identical                 to the Nintendo 64 version.                    On the bright side the game is massive, very atmospheric, and            strangely addictive. It should keep you busy for a week or two at            least, and if you've got the patience it's well worth a dabble.            Release Date - available now                    Don't just take my word for it, check out the            Shadow            Man demo for yourself! It weighs in at a hefty 70Mb, but if you            have the bandwidth to handle it you should definitely check it out            before buying the game.                    All the screenshots in this review are taken from Acclaim's            website. This is because Shadow Man has no screenshot facility, and            whenever I tried to do a screen capture with HyperSnap (every            gaming journalist's best friend) the game crashed and dumped me            back to Windows."}
