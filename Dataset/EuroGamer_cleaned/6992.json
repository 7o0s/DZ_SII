It's certainly been a long time coming, but the good news is that            despite the somewhat protracted development cycle the game is            actually rather good...                    In the best tradition of hack-and-slash fantasy epics down the            ages, Severance gives you a choice of four characters, each with            their own personal preferences when it comes to weaponry, and their            own range of strengths and weaknesses. For example, the dwarf is a            mean hand with axes and hammers but moves relatively slowly, while            the amazon is lighter on her feet and prefers bows and spears. Also            on offer is the traditional brawns-before-brains barbarian            (specialising in two-handed swords) and an ageing knight, who is            most comfortable with a sword in one hand and a shield in the            other.                    What makes Severance really shine though is that each of these            characters follows an entirely different path through the game, so            while the dwarf starts the game battling his way through a string            of mines and fortresses that have been over-run by orcs, the knight            begins in a prison cell having been captured by a traitor and must            escape from a castle before continuing his quest. Effectively you            are getting four games in one, with different missions, maps,            special attacks and tactics for each of the characters.                    As you progress through the game your character will develop thanks            to some fairly rudimentary role-playing elements - slaughtering            your foes will earn you experience points, and experience points            mean prizes! Every time you go up a level your character will gain            more stamina and hit points, allowing them to hold their own in            battle for longer.                    Each attack which you make will cost you stamina, and although it            gradually regenerates you will find yourself getting exhausted if            you are not careful. Run out of steam in the middle of a battle and            your character will have to stop to catch his breath, which leaves            you wide open to attack for a couple of seconds. The more            spectacular your attacks and the larger your weapons, the faster            your stamina will run out, so simply running into a room waving a            dirty big axe around in the air isn't going to get you very far.                    You will also gain special attacks as your level rises. These are            essentially beat 'em up style combo moves, pulled off by pressing            several buttons at once or in sequence. Which weapon you get a            special attack for at each particular level depends on your chosen            character's preferences, and pressing F1 brings up a handy list of            which special attacks you have coming and how to use them. They are            surprisingly easy to pull off in combat, and can be highly            effective when used in moderation.                    Combat is clearly the main focus of the game, and thankfully the            wide range of weapons on offer and the plentiful supply of enemies            to test them out on prevents things from getting too repetitive. A            range of different shield types can also be used alongside any            one-handed weapon to try to deflect attacks, although they can only            absorb a limited amount of damage before shattering, leaving the            target vulnerable for a moment before they can recover.                    Battles are made easier by the ~lock on~ function, which allows you            to select a target and then circle around them simply by pressing            the left and right keys. As a result most battles involve circling            cautiously around your foe, hiding behind your shield and trying to            dodge their attacks, then whacking them while they are off balance            or over-stretched. Fighting multiple foes can be a little hit and            miss at times, but generally combat requires some degree of skill            rather than simply flailing around with a sword and hoping for the            best.                    Other than that there's very little to the game though. Most of            your time is spent exploring the vast maps, slicing and dicing the            monsters you run into, and looking for items to pick up. The puzzle            solving aspects of the game are fairly basic, with lots of levers            to pull and the odd key to find but nothing too challenging.                    Although Severance's graphics don't look quite as revolutionary            today as they did two and a half years ago, they are still close to            the cutting edge. The architecture is grand in scale if a little            spartan in places, while textures vary from drab rock and wooden            surfaces to banners, stained glass windows and painted walls.                    The lighting effects are the real highlight from a technical            standpoint, and are truly in a class of their own, with beautifully            clear shadows being cast in real time by all of the light sources            in the game. Often you will see a shadow approaching around a            corner before you see whatever is causing it, which can lead to            some hilarious moments as that vast shadow on the far wall turns            out to be a tiny little goblin with a torch in its hand.                    The monsters themselves look rather impressive as well, with nicely            detailed skins, and as you bludgeon each other into submission            blood will spray around liberally, coating your weapons and armour            with claret. The game's title is well deserved, with dismemberment            surprisingly common. This is certainly not a game for the faint            hearted, with corpses often ending up in several pieces before they            hit the floor. You can even pick up severed limbs and use them as            weapons, or throw heads around and listen to the reassuring            squelching noise as they hit a wall. Needless to say, Severance has            an 18 rating here in the UK, although there are options to tone            down the gore and ~mutilation~ for younger players.                    Severance is not a role-playing game. It is not a game suitable for            the young or impressionable. It is not a particular deep game, with            the storyline being largely submerged beneath the rivers of blood            which you unleash wherever you go, and your missions generally            consisting of getting from A to B by pulling a lot of levers and            then picking up an item.                    It is however a lot of fun, with gruesome but surprisingly            intelligent combat and some lightweight RPG elements to flesh            things out. With four characters to choose from, each giving an            entirely different experience, it's also good value for money. It            might not be perfect, but it's arguably the best fantasy action            game of recent years, and well worth a look if you're after some            good old fashioned gratuitous violence.                        -        Rebel                    Act interview (February 2000)                Rebel                    Act interview (February 2000)                Severance                    screenshotsSeverance                    screenshots"}
