Developer VIS Entertainment            has had no qualms about dashing a bit of the old ultra-violence all            over the gaming world's collective face, but it's done so with none            of the polish and glamour of the immense, definitive videogame that            is Grand Theft Auto 3.                         In looks alone SOE is a match for its gritty sibling. Immediately            reminding players of the 'on-foot' sections of GTA, it won't be            long before the hunger for some sort of motorized transport sets            in, if only to mow down a few of those rioting bastards. There may            be some hokey premise about fighting the power here, but ultimately            State of Emergency is a 16-bit scrolling beat 'em up in new threads            and there is no escape. As if to emphasize this, throughout the            game you'll find 'exits' and doorways that AI-controlled rioters            can escape into, but which you can't. Nice to know it's upholding            the legacy.                         There are several ways to 'do' a riot simulation, and when I            envisaged SOE as it went through the rigors of development, I had            my heart set on photo-realistic slaughter and mindless anarchy.            Unfortunately, being handed a list of objectives ruins just about            anybody's perception of a riot and that's pretty much why SOE            fails. You have to be organised, so whilst all these people around            you (up to 250 at once) are madly dashing about lootin' and            pillagin', you have to go and blow up something specific, or knock            a particular somebody's block off.                    SOE is also an extremely linear game, for a number of reasons. Take            the Revolution mode, for example. There are plenty of objectives -            185 is often quoted, but I didn't bother to count - and they take            you all over the city, starting out in Capitol City Mall before            heading to Chinatown, Eastside and Corporation Central. But the            layout of these particular areas is worse than a Crash Bandicoot            level. Instead of towering walls flanking you on both sides you            have shopfronts and caf\u00e9s, but the end result is the same,            with the game funnelling you from one objective to the next, all            the time forcing you to fight off the interests of fellow rioters            and security forces. You can almost feel the rails beneath your            feet at times.                         Apart from following this 'story', players can also take on the            might of Chaos mode. Freed from the shackles of a time limit, or            with self-inflicted three or five minute deadlines, players have to            score as many 'points' as possible, picking up bonuses for carrying            out the narrator's instructions - like blowing up cars and smashing            windows - which can earn you up to 5X multipliers. The attraction            of Chaos mode is meant to be beating high scores and bringing the            chaos to order, controlling something as menacing as a full scale            riot by doing as the Romans do with an arsenal of, well, anything,            from M-16s to park benches. But to facilitate this you have to            fight your way through swathes of rioters and riot police, none of            whom wants to lie down for long.                         It's a sad fact, but beyond Revolution (a handful of hours            recycled into new areas) and Chaos (three, five or more minutes per            session, and a great deal more if mindless carnage can            really float your boat for that long), there is nothing to            this game. Okay so what we do have suggests replay value, and            hot-seating the Chaos mode with your friends can be interesting,            but with a finite number of weapons and a playground full of            targets, you won't need more than a few hours to see everything.                    The one thing VIS could perhaps be expected to get right is control            and movement, and fortunately for them it's not too bad, although            the camera is a bastion of lethargy in an otherwise frenetic            setting and often needs manually correcting. I quite like the            option to walk, run or sprint (making it easier to get away if you            can't be bothered to fight), and picking up weapons one at a time            is simple and works well alongside the array of            scrolling-fighter-style moves - the punch, the kick and the throw.            There's even a dash-and-punch move to take out stragglers.                         So what's left? The game's graphics? They're at times toony and at            other times fairly realistic, but a lack of variety in the            animations can lead to quite stunning monotony and bouts of extreme            d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as you take on new levels and see the same thing            over and over again. There are a number of redeeming            features to consider though, such as the spectacular weapon effects            and of course, the sight of 250 swarming rioters.                         That said, I am not impressed by numbers alone. VIS has stopped            short of actually simulating a riot, preferring apparently to apply            Brownian motion to a bunch of character models. If this were a            proper riot people would be beating each other senseless; tripping            over one another; there would be bodies strewn around and people            would not be riding the escalators, nor running around touching            each wall and then doing another circuit on their bit of            floor.                    The game's accompanying sound effects form one of the highlights; a            crescendo of noise consisting of people screaming, dying and            committing mass crime on previously unseen scale. Beyond that the            weapon sounds are a mixed bag, with the shotgun sounding better            than anything else, and having a satisfying visual effect to match.                         Sadly the music is a bit off, and it took me a few moments to            actually identify it from the noise. It won't really bother players            of the game, because you have to be fairly tolerant to play this            game long enough to actually pick it out from the gurgling and the            dying, but it's a mixture of rock and techno as best I can tell.                         Having been forced to play it at length, I would say that the            final nail in SOE's coffin is probably the bitter taste it leaves            in the mouth. For \u00a340 you expect a hell of a lot of            entertainment, and where GTA3 delivered, SOE is a hollow shell of            the game whose simplistic presentation and chunky menu graphics are            an adequate precursor to the inane and repetitive nature of the            actual game. There's a small amount of lasting appeal if you do            enjoy it, but I got bored of the game extremely quickly, and now I            sound extremely cynical whenever I'm asked to comment on it.            Whatever my tone, this is not a bad game; it's just a            disappointing, badly timed one, which if it weren't for the            extraordinary sales figures I would honestly not have expected to            sell to the same punters. Watch out though Take 2, I doubt they'll            fall for the same trick twice.                         Take 2 / Rockstar may have envisaged an adult toybox of            destruction for their next release after Grand Theft Auto, but            instead they've been duped, along with the thousands of you who            have helped propel this game to the top of the charts. After            turning Rockstar into the symbol to shop for, they have, in            this writer's opinion, irreparably damaged it.                        -        State of                    Emergency screenshotsState of                    Emergency screenshotsState                    of Emergency previewState                    of Emergency preview"}
