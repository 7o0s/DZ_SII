Just about every            multi-platform console release to date has turned out best on the            Xbox. Consider Tony Hawk, Onimusha, Spider-Man\u2026 even Jedi            Starfighter was smoother and featured a bonus level. Unfortunately            though, SSX Tricky bucks the trend by arriving in almost identical            attire. With the exception of the control system, this is the same            game that graced the PlayStation 2 oh-so-successfully late last            year. But, as we said at the time, it's the perfect combination of            racing and tricking, and skilled veterans of the original SSX            appreciated the emphasis on showing off. With the exception of a            few minor niggles, it was the perfect follow-up.                        The Xbox control system is less intuitive than its PlayStation 2            counterpart if you ask me, but that's largely the fault of the            developer - Tricky's PS2 control system was inherently flawed            anyway. EA Sports BIG chose to change the way the left analogue            stick and directional pad controlled movement for SSX Tricky,            meaning that it's necessary to juggle a combination of the two,            something that messes with the way you approach jumps and grinds,            and skewers the previously sound SSX dynamic of holding a diagonal            and launching into a spinning grab.                         With the Xbox controller only having two shoulder buttons compared            to the PS2's four, you have to reach for the face buttons to add            extra tweaks and grabs to your aerial display, and given the need            to hold the boost button to maximise your velocity, the jump button            to get yourself into position, and the constant juggling of the            analogue stick and directional pad to keep your position in check,            the end product is far too easy to screw up. When you toss in            associated problems like the occasionally substandard clipping            behaviour, the lack of a decent training mode to ease you into the            big-scoring tricks and a set of far more difficult levels, Tricky            becomes less inviting and exciting and more frightening.                    That said, it's easy to focus on the negative aspects of the game,            and the rest of Tricky more than makes up for these shortcomings.            The single player mode gives you many riders to choose from, each            comically voiced by a second-rate celebrity. The new additions here            are creative and charismatic, and those returning from the first            game have been spiced up. There are ten tracks to race and trick            your way through, and uncovering all of these, maxing out the stats            of every rider and finding every board and rider costume is a            Herculean task made all the more interesting by the exotic track            design, packed with trick opportunities and a myriad of shortcuts,            which, if you're anything like me, you'll still be unearthing in a            year's time.                         The sheer number of different tricks to perform is another thing,            and the much-vaunted signature moves (performed when the boost bar            is maxed out) are a special reward for those willing to push the            game to its limits. Each has an excessively flamboyant animation            and is accompanied by Run DMC yelling ~It's Tricky!~ excitedly. As            you find yourself performing more and more of these signature moves            you will fill up the Tricky meter and get the opportunity to            perform them at your every whim.                        With the exception of some extra bump-mapping and a bit of            all-round smoothness, the graphics remain largely unchanged, which            is a shame when you consider the relative power of the Xbox and            what might have been attempted, but overall, this eclectic mixture            of snowboarding, boardercross and outrageous stunts dwarves any of            the niggles we could care to mention, conspiring to keep you glued            to your TV screen for hours. The delightfully smooth split-screen            multiplayer modes and added DVD-style Making Of content seal the            deal. Amped can keep its realism - if you don't own the PS2 version            of Tricky, and you can deal with a bit of a challenge, then SSX            Tricky is the cocktail of exaggerated physics, daring stunts and            unrivalled longevity you've been waiting for."}
