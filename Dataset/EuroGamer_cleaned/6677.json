The            first on-the-rails light gun shooter to take place in a fully            rendered 3D polygon environment, with a locational damage system            which saw enemies crumple or fall spectacularly depending on where            you hit them. It was also, along with its sequel, one of the more            cerebral light gun games, where one shot killed, but            three-hit-combos were important and accurate blasting was            absolutely critical. It's funny how even the genre's recent success            stories like Time Crisis failed to mimic this approach, and even            Sega themselves abandoned it for their part in the finger-tiring            nocturnal Namco collaboration snooze-fest Vampire Night.        But now a whole new generation of gunners can engage in Sega's            seven-year-old gems thanks to the release of Virtua Cop: Elite            Edition, but as with so many of the former platform holder's            ~modernisations~, condensing two games into one disc has apparently            left them no time to tidy up the graphics, add some more levels or            alter anything whatsoever. Why not a sequel, Sega? Oh yes, you need            the money, we forgot.                    However, Sega isn't likely to get a penny from anybody if it            continues to peddle this sort of soulless re-release. Virtua Cop:            Elite Edition comprises both of the original Virtua Cop games in            their low-poly, intensely short states. Up the continue count on            the option screen and you can actually complete both games in one            sitting - in about 90 minutes.                    AM2 has apparently smoothed over some of the rougher edges,            graphically speaking, but both games certainly look very similar to            the Saturn versions (which we loaded up just for old time's sake at            the weekend). It's true that a few edges are rounder and the            resolution is higher, but that merely serves to accentuate the            blurry, low-resolution textures and emphasize just how blocky the            enemy models are. Certainly, any PS2 owner who's played Time Crisis            2, or even a Dreamcast owner with the likes of Confidential Mission            behind them, will take one look at VCED and scoff.        For the uninitiated, each Virtua Cop consists of several            levels, each set in a different area and at a different skill            level. Armed with a six-chamber cop gun, you have to take out            terrorists as the game highlights them with a big green aiming            reticule. As the green gradually gives way to red and the targets            narrow, the terrorist will take his shot and rob you of a heart.            Take too many hits and it's Game Over.                    The great thing about Virtua Cop and its sequel is that you only            need to make one connection to floor a bad guy. Even if you strike            him in the ankle he'll crumple to the ground and trouble you no            more. The challenge comes in the form of multiple enemies in quick            succession, each of whom shoots in a smaller space of time - with a            shorter fuse, if you like. The quicker you topple them the more            points you get, and the more hits you make the more you get. Each            enemy can take a total of three successive hits, so with a bit of            practice you can go blam-blam-blam, blam-blam-blam, fire off-screen            to reload, blam-blam-blam, etc. Do this and you'll earn a huge            score.                    To begin with though you won't, you'll have to work your way            towards it. Enemies can be fiendishly positioned at times, too, so            you'll spend the early sessions learning layout. Then you can            replay it numerous times to unlock the various extra guns            (automatics, rifles, etc, hidden in crates which have to be shot to            open) and beat your high score. However, unless you can stave off            the feeling that you're playing an outdated, ugly-looking piece of            old skool, the chances are it won't last that long. And that            \u00a340 you just laid down will feel less and less justified.        The biggest            change to the formula as it stands is the new ~gallery~ feature. By            nailing particularly difficult shots in-game (like taking out an            unmarked terrorist hiding behind a sea of head-clutching hostages)            you get a ~gallery shot~ message, which means you've unlocked some            new CG stills in the gallery. However, it would have been nicer to            unlock new levels, new guns, new anything, really, as opposed to            these crusty relics of the Saturn era. Sega fans will of course lap            them up, and if you're blinkered enough to think that the gallery            represents a cool new feature, then don't let us stop you enjoying            it!                    We've some ideas for AM2 if it plans to re-release Virtua Cop on            other platforms. Perhaps a bonus level where you sit there            ploughing bullets into a dead horse? It would be an absolute blast            if they stopped mucking about and made a proper sequel of course -            the likes of House of the Dead simply can't live up to this pure            gameplay approach, something we've missed ever since these games            were new.                    Don't get us wrong, we love Virtua Cop: Elite Edition, but then we            didn't pay for it, and we know if we had done we would feel ripped            off. This is an old game, and AM2 has done virtually nothing to            update it. It still takes less than two hours to complete both            games, the replay value is still questionable and it still            looks dreadfully old and ropey! At full price, only die-hards and            nostalgics need apply. However shallow and mindless the likes of            Time Crisis 2 are, they're a much, much fairer bet for light gun            addicts. Next time, Sega, do a blummin' sequel.
