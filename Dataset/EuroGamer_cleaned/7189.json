It was built up from the start as a            simple cut-and-run kidnapping story, but after about an hour or so            of calm it exploded into a vampire slaughter fest.                    Eventually it concluded with a tattooed and extremely bloody George            Clooney leaving a young girl amongst the ruins and bodies of her            sibling, father, and truck-driving drinkers on the edge of a cliff.            Fantastic. [What the hell does this have to do with Rollcage? -            Ed.]                    Well, in a bizarre sort of way Rollcage Stage II mimics the film.            It starts off as one might expect, but after a while and a lot of            experience you are doing back flips and creating cataclysmic            explosions in order to thwart your opponents. When you complete a            race you are left with a battered and tattered little buggy that            has been literally hurled across chasms and through walls of fire            and debris.                    To continue the ~From Dusk Till Dawn~ metaphor, the game also shuns            realism in favour of out-and-out fun. Instead of staying on the            boring straight-and-narrow route of most racers, it lets you defy            physics and race along the walls and ceilings, ~such is your            velocity~. Newton, slap Psygnosis for me.                    Of course, the original Rollcage did this before, and those of you            who came to Rollcage expecting a completely new game using a few of            the old ideas will be initially disappointed. It is very much the            same, graphically and in terms of gameplay, but it has been tweaked            an awful lot.         As far as design concepts go,            Rollcage's is a unique one, so any small changes to the physics or            arsenal of weapons sway the natural order of things away from the            norm.                    The most shining example of this in Rollcage Stage II is the even            shorter tracks. Rollcage's tracks were pretty short, lets be            honest, but that didn't draw anything away from the entertainment.            By decreasing the track-lengths slightly further however, Psygnosis            have been able to jam in even more death-defying shortcuts and            ceiling-boost-pads.                    Weapons-wise, Rollcage Stage II still suffers from the same            problems as its predecessor. For instance, there is still a            power-up that slows down the entire field of cars, giving an            incredibly unfair advantage to the person who collected it.                    You can turn the power-ups off very easily, but if you do then            you'll lose the more interesting ones, such as the heat-seeking            rocket that takes out the leader of the race, or just the basic            rockets, which actually require skill to use precisely. The mix of            power-ups lets the game down somewhat - you should be able to            specify which you use and which you don't, that would make for a            much more interesting proposition. Ah well, maybe in Stage III...         We've reached a sort of graphical peak in the PC gaming scene            at the moment, with increases in quality like those shown in Quake            3 Arena being considered the norm, and other games aspiring to            compete.                    Rollcage Stage II sidesteps that particular battle by using            cartoon-like graphics that better suit consoles. Actually, the game            feels very much like a console racer, which can only be a good            thing.                    Graphically the game is still as pretty and curvaceous as it was a            year ago. While your jaw won't exactly hit the ground, the graphics            do at least conjure up visions of a neo-futuristic world            appropriate to the game's time setting.                    It's quite clear though that Rollcage Stage II has been designed            for viewing at speed. If you slow your vehicle down you can see            that everything is long and sprawling, and even slightly            pixellated, but at the high speeds that the game encourages            everything blurs together in a fashion that looks just right.         The activities the game has to occupy you are many. There are            Tournaments, the usual Arcade mode (where everyone usually dives in            head first), and even a Scramble mode where you have to scurry            around a track as fast as you can, without the speed barriers that            so many tracks offer for protection.                    It earns copious amounts of brownie points for having double-sided            cars, too. The little buggies that you drive around in can flip            over and continue to race, just like those ludicrously expensive            radio control cars that you see advertised on the TV.                    If you fall off the ceiling (it happens quite often), then you can            land on either side and still right yourself without losing            precious seconds. Your car is indestructible too - this sort of            action is not built for those hindered by mortality!         Rollcage Stage II is definitely            one of my favourite little games this year. If you want a            simulation, leave right now - this is not for you. But if you just            want to have some good old-fashioned unadulterated fun, take a            look.                    I rather thought that I had weaned myself off of silly little            console racing games, but Rollcage Stage II brings it all flooding            back..."}
