Yes, Trophy Bass 4 was my latest assignment, and I installed it in            a dim frame of mind. I muttered under my breath expectations of            boredom, and regarded the jaunty installation screen with a kind of            weak loathing. After recovering from this outburst, I decided to            give the game a fair go though. Let it never be said that I'm too            quick to judge.                    And after a quick look at the manual I learned that this is no            arcade fishing game, unlike some of Sega's recent efforts. It is a            serious simulation, featuring hundreds of real-name manufacturers,            and even some ~famous~ bass fisher-people. Yes, I checked up on            them. Let it never be said that I don't do my research, either.                    But if, like me, you don't know your jig from your trace-bait, and            your flip from your sidearm cast it can all seem a bit confusing            and anal. When I first played it, it took me a long time to work            out all the combinations of rod, bait and cast method, and when to            use them. But after a few sessions on Lake Kissimmee - all the            lakes are based on real American locations, with over 30 in total -            I was reeling in Catfish like a pro.         Maybe ~pro~ is a bit of an                 exaggeration - I was fishing like an amateur, and I had only                 just learned the reel-in system, which in retrospect is rather                 ingenious.                    You use the mouse to reel in, hold the fish steady, and release            tension, giving some interactivity to proceedings. Line pull            tension and strength of reel are controlled with the keyboard, so            you will be frantically changing settings and waving the mouse            around like an idiot to pull in that 40 inch catfish you have been            after. It was a fair bit more hectic than I had expected, and a            hell of a lot more enjoyable.                    Fiddling around with the assorted appliances on board your boat is            also fun, as well as vital to your future success. The gadgets            include a depth sounder, for use when the water is muddy or very            deep, a GPS for navigation, a comprehensive tackle box where you            put together your rod, bait and casting method, and various other            items of varying use.                    You can even switch your boat's outboard motor on and go schussing            across to another side of the lake, much to the distress of the            ducks, and the other competitors.         Your                 competitors can even be real humans as a network mode is                 included, so up to six can enjoy LAN, modem and internet                 games. The standard set of rules is to set a type of fish, a                 time limit, and whoever catches the most fish (in weight, not                 amount!) is the victor.                    This is more or less standard for the single player Tournament mode            too, although a Fishing Trip option is available for more relaxing            play, or to brush up the skills. The Career mode option is quite            enjoyable as well, with money and fame being built up over time            with tournament victories.                    If you're not quite up to Career standard after a few disastrous            outings, you ought to consult the first-class help facility. This            features reams of text outlining every technique from the            indispensable to the intricate. It even features videos of fishing            professionals describing each method and how to execute it. It's            all very polished, and after a few days' play I felt something of            an expert myself.         Since a lot of effort was obviously put                 into realism, physics and gameplay, graphics were evidently on                 something of a back burner down at Sierra HQ. Lego-block style                 characters and clumsy boats are hardly going to win any beauty                 contests, but like the sport itself, the game is best left to                 rugged types who don't mind their pursuits rough around the                 edges.                    The transparent water effects are something of a letdown, however,            with even ~Clear~ conditions appearing unclear. Still, it all adds            to the challenge, but not to such an extent that you will be            cursing with frustration. In fact, the whole product seems            determined to make the whole fishing experience easy. A lazy            angler's dream.                    Of course, even your most laid-back, Jack Daniels-sipping guy would            have some complaints. The Career mode is seriously below its            potential, as the upgrades available to buy with your winnings are            minimal. It might have been better to have to build up your tackle            box and other items through your winnings and even sponsorship            money, but instead almost everything you need is laid out for you            at the start of the game.         I know it's a fishing game and                 there's only so much one can do with a fishing game, but it's                 more or less the same each time you play it. The addition of a                 well-designed career mode would have helped, but many other                 things could have been added to increase the ~come back~                 factor - a lake editor would have been an excellent addition,                 or even some more play modes instead of always going for                 ~highest weight wins~.                    However, Trophy Bass 4 is perhaps not the arena for these pursuits,            as it sticks to the serious, sober side of fishing. It's good at            what it does, and if you are on the look-out for something            different, or if you are a fishing fan, then the chances are it's            your bag."}
