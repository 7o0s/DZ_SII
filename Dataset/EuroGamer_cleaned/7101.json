There is something about the entire            procession that captures even those not usually interested in            athletics.                    To take such a prestigious event and base a computer game around it            is no small task, but ATD felt they were up to the challenge. There            is no getting away from it though - Sydney 2000 is simply a ~Track            and Field~ style arcade jaunt, involving the disintegration of your            keyboard, and strain of the wrists! However, with the official            Olympic sponsorship behind it, we can surely expect something a            little more than that surely? Well, as you would expect there is a            suitably grandiose video which sets the scene for the events            included within the game quite nicely.                    You can then choose to play the game either in straight arcade            mode, where no qualification is needed, or in the far more            entertaining Olympic mode of play. There is also a coaching mode,            taking you step by step through all the events and how to control            your athlete in each. Playing in arcade mode is useful to verse            yourself with all of the events and how they operate, but although            this might make Sydney 2000 sound like a complicated game, in            reality only three of the events don't involve brainless key            bashing!                         The Olympic mode is excellently thought out, and provides a                 stiff challenge, albeit a wrist destroying one! Each event                 puts you through a tough series of training and qualifying                 competitions, and don't think that you can skimp on the                 training either. The result of this will be a poor physique                 and equally poor qualifying performance.                    Training is focused in three areas in a virtual gym, which will            remind you of the Krypton Factor straight away, with it's            futuristic interface. The gym puts you through your paces with a            travelator, weight-lifting, and starter gun reaction tests. Your            first impression will be that it all seems a little pointless, but            once you start seeing your hard training reaping rewards in the            qualifying events, it all becomes a lot of fun.                    With any luck you will be fully trained up and your morale sitting            at 100% for your final Olympic showdown. And once you have            completed that particular event, it's on to the next one. Be            prepared to take a few breaks now and again though, as it really is            that knackering!         There are                 a dozen events in all, including usual events such as the 100m                 sprint and javelin, but also included are a couple of                 surprises in the Kayak K1 slalom and 10m platform diving.                    Controlling your character in the running and throwing events is a            simple case of alternating your left and right power buttons, and            in certain cases pressing your action button at the right moment.            Yes, this is a rather exhausting method of control, but I fail to            see how else you can do it. It's certainly the definitive way of            ensuring that you are putting in the maximum effort, short of            hooking up a travelator to your USB port!                    I had no real problems with the controls except for in the skeet            shooting, where your crosshair moves far too slowly and there is no            support for mouse control, which would have been the ideal            controlling method for this type of event. There is no way you can            change this sadly, with only a pre-determined set of key            combinations for selection, and the optional use of a joypad if you            have one installed.         The graphics range from splendid to extremely average,                 with events like 100m freestyle swimming looking absolutely                 brilliant, while the Kayak K1 rowing is pretty bland. And for                 all of the events the crowd is terribly drawn, looking                 stupidly two-dimensional against their detailed 3D                 surroundings.                    The stadiums are excellently rendered though, with huge television            screens broadcasting the live events in sync with the action, and            all the expected equipment like the throwing event nets and high            jump crash mats looking authentic. The athletes themselves take on            a more cartoon like quality, which works very well, especially in            the weight lifting where the puffing out of the cheeks is highly            comical.                    Appropriate audio is used for each event with the grunts of            exertion in the hammer event sounding really quite painful. The            familiar commentary of Steve Rider accompanies you throughout the            games, and really adds to the whole Olympic atmosphere.         With the quality                 of the events in Sydney 2000, I can't help feeling they really                 should have pushed the boat out and provided a whole lot more                 events. After all, this is to celebrate the Olympic games, so                 why not go overboard and provide the near perfect compilation                 of events?                    With the swimming graphics engine in particular being superbly            done, I would have liked for more events based around this. Also,            what happened to the discus or shot put throwing events, and what            about the rest of the running events? Unfortunately, although            twelve events may seem a lot, you will soon find you have seen all            there is to see.                    What you do get is very accomplished and well presented, but            ultimately it just isn't enough to keep you bashing your keyboard            well into the night. It is certainly my choice in the Sydney 2000            vs Sergei Bubka war though, with a far better qualifying system and            overall feel to the game."}
