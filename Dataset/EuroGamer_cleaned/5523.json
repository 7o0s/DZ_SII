With just threematches to guarantee progression to the next round, no team canafford a bad start. It's why the opening games tend to be dull -whilst all managers would naturally rather win and claim all threepoints, the most important thing is not to lose, and so they adopta decidedly cagey and cautious approach.For its first mobile World Cup simulation, 2006 FIFA WorldCup, EA has taken a markedly similar approach, delivering animmediately accessible but general unremarkable performance.The opening screens are surprisingly minimalist for an EA Sportstitle, with a sole glimpse of the World Cup all that's offered toset the scene. All the teams are present and correct, though.Players feature a range of statistics to help you select your idealsquad, and there's a good choice of formations and strategies butthe lack of any other options beyond Friendly, World Cup and arather poor Penalty Shoot-out Challenge feels adequate rather thaninspiring.Dive into a match and your impressions are similarly muted, theimpact of smooth 3D stadia and players being cancelled out by therough textures that most phones will afford, and the occasionalhabit of players to all but disappear when viewed side on.The control system did raise our expectations, promising a rangeof passing (to-feet, through-balls and crosses) as well asdribbling (this is one of the first mobile titles to enable you toseamlessly direct players in eight directions via the joypad alone)using just one thumb.In practice, however, the passing system is overly fussy andlimited in what it can produce, and any opportunities that arecreated tend to be lost by what seem like lacklustre shootingcontrols.2006 FIFA World Cup isn't terrible, mind, and thoughfirst impressions end in a scoreless stalemate (chances are yourmatch will too), we had high hopes that a little more time to gelwith the controls would yield a more satisfying attackingmatch.Sadly, whilst teams in the World Cup proper might begin to easethrough the gears after their opening encounters, EA's mobile gamenever really develops.You do become more familiar with the passing system after fivematches or so. Recognising the different coloured cursors that showyour passing options, you'll start to string passes together, crossballs in and actually score goals (rewarded by a neat littlereplay). You might also begin to fool around with formation andstrategy options to affect your style of play. But even then thegame remains a fairly flat experience.A combination of uninspiring ball-physics (passes and shots areeither ground huggers or hoofs), limited player animation(especially with the keepers, who tend to collapse rather thandiving) and underwhelming shooting options (no headers or volleys,and you seldom feel in charge) conspire to ensure the game neverreally convinces.Ultimately, while 2006 FIFA World Cup doesn't disgraceitself, it doesn't raise its game in order to squeeze past thegroup stages never mind hold aloft the trophy."}
