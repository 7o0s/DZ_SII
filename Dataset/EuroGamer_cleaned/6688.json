When it comes to Final            Fantasy, the developer has plenty of experience wielding tortuously            complex storylines and injecting gameplay into the fold (by means            of elaborate, winding roads full of random encounters). But at            times, Kingdom Hearts feels more like a mixture of Jak & Daxter            and Zelda, encased in a plot rich with Square's usual effortless            grandiosity. And Disney characters.                    It's an interesting blend, beginning with a bizarre dream sequence            set to catchy pop music, which introduces us to Sora, the plucky            star of this particular adventure, and subsequently his friends            Riku and Kairi. This abstract sequence also aligns your Sora            to the particular methods you plan to use - a two-tone combination            of might, magic and defence.                    Waking as waves lap up on his face, Sora's first few steps in the            game world see you exploring the aptly named Destiny Islands, as a            trio of young friends plan to set sail on a raft and see the world.            Rather like the intro, this dream rapidly evaporates as Things Go            Awry\u2122. Sora finds himself snatched from his idyllic            upbringing and thrust into Traverse Town on the edge of the cosmos,            armed with a sword in the shape of a key and a lot of questions.        And it's here that Disney comes into            play. Square's collaboration with Walt's great company has given            the Japanese giant the opportunity to mix the superbly rounded            comedy characters from every Disney film imaginable (from Snow            White to The Lion King, no-one is exempt) with its own imaginative            creations (cameos include Squall, Cloud and various other FF            heroes, not to mention subtler inclusions like Mog the Moogle).                    The way that Square introduces Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Goofy,            Pluto and various others is, naturally, through the firm's            award-winning and film-powering cut sequences. Each of the Disney            folks is voiced superbly, really living up to their 'traditional'            counterparts. We're shown Donald's discovery that (King) Mickey has            disappeared, leaving only a cryptic clue about a keyblade. Donald,            who appears to be some sort of wizard, is quickly forced to jet off            in search of Sora, with Goofy and Pluto in tow.                    However, it's not until Donald, Goofy and Sora all stumble into one            another in Traverse Town that things really kick off and the game            throws up its first real boss encounter.                    Unlike Final Fantasy though, combat is in real-time, and is based            to begin with on your ability to dodge and wield successful            counterattacks. Before long though, Sora will develop greater            attacks and even magic skills, and by the end of the game you're            performing sho-ryu-ken dragon punch style attacks at the sight of            your enemies, the Heartless.                    All the while, you're flanked by a pair of party members. After            all, an action RPG hardly negates the familiar party aspect, does            it? The good news is that but for a few instances of wall-hugging            and aimless stupidity, Sora's AI-controlled companions hold their            own to a reasonable level of success, and you can modify their            behaviour using the in-game menus. In fact, there are almost too            many ways to change their behaviour - you'll probably just tweak it            occasionally and otherwise steer clear.        You're thinking that apart from an oddly assorted jumble of            Disney characters invading your traditional FF posse, this is a            simple game of travelling from town to town, fighting enemies and            dispatching bosses. Ad nauseum. And to some extent, you're right -            you do travel around fighting evil... But instead of moving from            town to town and keep to keep, Sora and co. travel via space ship            between zones, which are being gradually swallowed up by a            consortium of evil.                    These zones, each themed around a Disney movie, present various            challenges to overcome, and represent a feast of nostalgia. The            first zone is based around Alice in Wonderland, for example, and            starts as you fall down the rabbit hole and have to negotiate a            tiny door using ~eat me~ growers and shrinkers. Then you find your            way into the Queen's court, and have to exonerate poor Alice by            searching for the guilty party in the surrounding woods.                    Later zones have you fishtailing your way through The Little            Mermaid, rapping with Simba in The Lion King and crossing paths            with venerable nasties like Captain Hook.        Unfortunately,            these zones don't quite live up to the magnificent premise. The            first two hours of the game (Destiny Islands and Traverse Town) are            vintage Square, with plenty of FF characters around to smooth            things over as well. Meeting up with child-like incarnations of            Waka, Yuffie and others is charming (as is the voice talent), and            having practiced your way to a decent level of combat skill and            beavered around Destiny Islands and Traverse Town getting your            bearings, you'll be itching to get into the battle proper.                    And sadly you won't enjoy it as much. The Alice in Wonderland zone            is the first, and arguably the worst in the game. Admittedly it            brings the various tenets of Lewis Carroll's story to life vividly;            namely confusion, agony and depression, but this isn't necessarily            a good thing. The jumping puzzles merely show up the somewhat            questionable jump mechanics (with one of those irritating pauses            whenever you land - dammit, we want smoothness!). It isn't until            you end up walking upside down on the ceiling and generally            behaving like a local that things smarten up.                    However, subsequent zones almost make up for this. The overall            story takes a much heavier handed grip on events, you meet a lot of            interesting new characters and (spoilers aside) it's a lot of fun.            The only things we didn't like post-Wonderland were the terrible            shoot 'em up sections which linked the various zones, and the            inclusion of Saturday morning rejects The Chipmunks. Other than            that, the pace is fine, the story is engrossing (and the voice            acting stupendous), and it's a case of gradually venturing closer            and closer to that revelation, negotiating a pack of zones            which vary in quality from the very good (the offbeat, Tim Burton            inspired Nightmare Town sections) to the mediocre. Actually, your            enjoyment of the zones actually rather depends on your appreciation            of the film - here at Eurogamer for example, Tarzan naysayer Rob            found that to be one of his least favourite zones. Can't please            everyone.        Whatever your take, you            can't argue that it looks absolutely stunning. Cut sequences are            extraordinarily detailed, so Square has used a lot of in-game            cut-scenes to pad them out, but you can hardly complain when it            looks this good. Cleverly, the developer has matched FF's often            sci-fi noir darkness with Disney's friendly colour schemes and            cartoon-esque environments. Texturing is varied and comfortably            pastiche, while character modelling and animation is smooth and            beguiling.                    And you know it sounds good. I've tried to mention the voice acting            as much as I can, but don't take my word for it, consider the cast;            Haley Joel Osment (Sora), Billy Zane, David Boreanaz, Mandy Moore,            Brian Blessed, Jim Cummings and even Lance Bass, who puts in a            particularly fine turn as Sephiroth. Furthermore, the soundtrack            mixes tuneful Disney extracts with Square's typical serenity and            ambient bliss.                    So if you fancy leading a ragtag band of enthusiastic young            adventurers through a DVD library's worth of Disney films, in a            game which adheres to Square's phenomenal presentation values, then            you should definitely buy Kingdom Hearts. The combat system is a            stark departure, Final Fantasy fans, but you'll still feel quite at            home - we haven't dipped to the brutish levels of 3D action titles            here. And typically of Square, the adventure is brimming with cute            moments and distractions, in the form of cameos and sub-quests all            over - try keeping an eye out for Dalmatians, for instance.                    Kingdom Hearts isn't perfect - it's as cryptic to begin with as any            game ever conceived by Square, and it lures you in with some            tremendous combat mechanics and a unique selling point (Disney),            but it also tries to piss you off with a vacuous opening zone and            the Chipmunks. The biggest crime here though is that of Square            Europe. It's another diabolical PAL release, on a par with FFX for            borders and so on. And 60Hz? Ha! If you can put up with these            hardships though, this is the best thing since Final Fantasy X."}
