You can            choose to navigate around the hall using the directional buttons,            or choose your door using a menu system. It feels a bit odd walking            round a non-violent game in the Quake style first person mode, but            it does serve to make the rooms feel a little more tactile and            realistic. The left door takes you to the pool room, a garishly            American themed parlour complete with an authentic (and playable)            Wurlitzer style jukebox, arcade machine, slot machine and of course            a chrome edged pool table.                         The atmosphere is perfect with a bar along one wall and plenty of            baseball memorabilia scattered around the pubs, and a basketball            game viewable live on the telly. You can have a quick blast of the            Dropzone arcade game, which is a rather crude defender clone from            the 80's or chose to blow some virtual cash on the one armed            bandit, and while these sub-games are fun for a while, and do offer            a little variety from playing with the balls they don't really            provide much lasting fun or enhancement to the main game. It's a            shame the developers didn't link progress of these games into the            main game, perhaps unlocking some new opponents for pool by getting            a great Dropzone score, or new tunes on the jukebox by earning            money on the slot machine.             The real purpose of the room is                 the Pool table. Pool is great fun, not too stressful, easy                 rules and pockets like the channel tunnel. It's a perfect                 introduction to the game mechanics, and far easier than the                 trickier snooker table. The one player game lets you take on a                 series of opponents of increasing difficulty ending in a                 showdown with the super skilled Mr White himself. Whoever you                 are playing, the opponent is represented in the room as a                 ghostly pair of disembodied white gloves that constantly float                 around the table and while this is less obstructive than                 having a full sized player model filling your screen, it's a                 shame that all the opponents are depicted in the same fashion.                         The vitally important ball and table physics are convincing, and            with the freely movable view down the cue it only takes a little            while to get used to the way you place your shot. Controls using            the Dreamcast controller do seem daunting at first, with some            options quite a few presses away, soon you find however that your            most used features such as shot strength and spin are easily            accessible and easy to use. There's a number of different pool            variants to choose from, with American and British rules and eight            or nine ball            configurations. The room and the table are                 visually impressive, the textures are extremely detailed and                 the ball models are nicely shaded and light-sourced giving                 them a nice solid look. It's unfortunate that the frame rates                 so poor though, a quick touch of the joystick in free look                 mode has the game engine struggling to keep up at a choppy and                 jerky low frame rate. It's not bad enough to interfere with                 play, but it's an irritation nonetheless.                         Moving along through the hallway to the snooker room, your            presented with a more cultured environment, with a grandfather            clock, a roaring log fire and soothing classical music. Diversions            in this room include a very competent, playable draughts game and a            great implementation of darts, both will take a fair amount of            skill to master so offer more of a challenge than the pool room            offerings. The large snooker table dominates the centre of the            room, and its on this monster that you can take on another series            of computer controlled players in the more complex game of snooker.            The snooker is considerably more difficult than the pool, with the            larger table and smaller pockets serving to make those long shots            very tricky. The computer controlled opponents don't seem to suffer            too much, with even the inept sounding Clumsy Colin making tasty            breaks into the double figures. The pool hall is definitely the            place to warm up and hone your skills before moving into the more            challenging snooker room.             Everything's been put together                 into an extremely likeable and authentic package, you can                 almost smell the chalk as you move your virtual player around                 the green felt of the tables, with the sounds of the balls                 connecting and sinking into pockets has been carefully crafted                 for full effect. There's plenty of neat touches too, like a                 book on the bar in the pool room containing pictures of the                 games development like a kind of virtual scrapbook, there's                 obviously a lot of love and attention that has been bestowed                 on this title. It's a great game for when you've got company                 too, my mates weren't eagerly flocking around my lair in the                 way they used to when I had a real table, but we all had a                 blast with the pool mode, although we found the Snooker a                 little too tricky for casual play.                    Jimmy White's 2: Cueball is a highly polished and playable snooker            and pool simulator. Although that said, it does seem a little odd            to be playing a game on your Dreamcast that you could just as            easily be playing down the pub with some buddies. Single player            gets old quickly unless your utterly fanatical about snooker or            pool, but multi-player is a lot more fun. Its nothing like as good            as the real thing of course, but with some mates, some beers and            some heavy farting, its close.                        - Out Now"}
