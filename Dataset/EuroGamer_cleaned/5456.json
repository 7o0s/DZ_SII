They've been around for donkey's years, starting off asdenim overalls for Californian miners and maintaining the Red Tab style pretty much ever since. See - when something's just right, itdoesn't need to be changed or updated.And while Thief's developer might not fully appreciatethis, they've somehow injected the mobile version of the popular sneak-'em-up with that same timelessretro charm. With the look and feel of a mid-eighties computergame, Thief: Deadly Shadows rewards you withuncomplicated gameplay and vintage appeal. Using a standard 2Dplatform format, you navigate each level finding keys,knocking out guards and walking through lots of doors, as isexpected from the genre, but without becoming tiresome or frustrating. The missions are shortand simple enough to grasp without ever being shallow oruninvolving, and to add interest these are broken up with faster-pacedlevels that require running and jumping over a course in theshortest possible time.As you progress, your enemies get stronger and the missions becomemore elaborate, though there are constant hints that'll help youget your bearings. Picking up the right key or using the rightweapon becomes a formality, leaving you to put it all into practicewhich, and let's face it, is the fun part. With some doors you'llneed to work out the correct combination by pressing up, down, leftand right in a certain order, as though you were unlocking a safe.Once opened, there is the option of peeking around the door beforegoing through; you are, after all, playing as a thief trying hisbest to hide in the shadows. And hide you will, crawling behindbushes and sneaking up on unsuspecting passers-by, all in order topick their pockets and steal as much loot as you can.Controlling your character is straightforward, as is navigatingthe levels. The exception is when using your main weapon, thehumble whip. This can only be used at close range and is verydifficult if your enemy's moving, especially when your movement inturn slows to a virtual halt for no apparent reason. That said,speed isn't the aim of the game, and there are plenty of things tokeep you busy as you ramble on your merry way, stealing everythingin sight.The presentation is good - everything you could hope for really.Visually, the graphics and animations are atmospheric, simple andclear, and when it comes to the sounds, there seems to be anemphasis on overly-dramatic effects that ring out every time you dopractically anything. These can be a bit over the top, so bethankful for the volume controls on your handset. But with plentyto offer in terms of playability and objectives, Thiefshould keep you busy for a fair old while. It may not be futuristicand cutting-edge, but then it never set out to be. What it is,however, is an enjoyable treat with a lot to offer the pocket gamerthat's hungry for adventure."}
