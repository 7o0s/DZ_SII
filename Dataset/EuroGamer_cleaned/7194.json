It's been around for years, and it certainly                 wasn't designed with gaming in mind.                    And yet today you can't get anywhere without a mouse. Not only do            you need one to navigate your way around Windows, but most games            require one now as well, and you certainly won't be breaking any            records playing a first person shooter without one. Ok, so it's            hardly suited to most flight sims or driving games, but pretty much            every other genre of game is rodent friendly.                    Enter k\u00e4rna and the bizarrely named Razer BoomSlang mouse,            specifically designed with gamers in mind. It's the Ferrari of            mice, with a price tag to match, claiming improved speed and            responsiveness, as well as some neat new features under the bonnet.                    We took one for a spin to see if it can live up to the hype...         Unlike most rodents, which are sold over the counter in boring            cardboard and plastic boxes, the BoomSlang is only available direct            from the RazerZone website,            and arrives packed in a bed of foam in a circular metal box that            doubles as a nice cake tin...                    The mouse itself is longer than most rodents, with a flashy            ~ergonomic~ design and an iMac style semi-transparent plastic            finish. The two buttons are huge, covering about half of the top of            the mouse, and between them you will find a mouse wheel which            predictably doubles as a third button. The BoomSlang's design is            also totally symmetrical, allowing both normal (right-handed) and            freakish (left-handed) gamers to use it with ease. As a freak            myself this is invaluable.                    Some people have reported finding the design uncomfortable, but            that's usually because they're holding it wrong - try moving your            hand back down the body of the mouse. I use it with my wrist            resting on the mouse mat and my hand just wraps around it            perfectly, though admittedly my hands are fairly small for a bloke.            If you usually hold your rodent in a different way you may find it            harder to adapt to the BoomSlang than I did though.                    Once you have worked out how to handle your mouse correctly, you            should find your fingers resting on the buttons. You will also find            the two thumb buttons - one on each side under the waist. My thumb            and ring finger end up resting on these, but sadly the drivers only            let you use one of them, depending on whether you are left or right            handed, and the other is always disabled. Still, four buttons and a            wheel is nothing to complain about.                    Holding down the thumb button and moving the wheel allows you to            alter the sensitivity of your mouse on the fly, with a small            indicator appearing in the bottom right of the screen to tell you            how high you have it set. The sensitivity ranges from 1.0 to 10.0            in 0.5 intervals, giving you plenty of control.                    This is obviously of limited use in the middle of a frantic Quake            deathmatch session, but in slightly more sedate conditions it can            actually be very useful. I often use it in Unreal Tournament CTF to            decrease my sensitivity while I'm sniping, for example.         The mouse                 also comes with a neat little control utility called the                 customizer, that lets you play with your mouse settings. You                 can, of course, change the sensitivity of the mouse here, as                 well as being able to disable the on-the-fly sensitivity                 feature, set the double-click speed, and adjust how far the                 scroll bar moves each time you move the mouse wheel a notch.                    The customizer is where you tell the mouse whether you are left or            right handed, and it also allows you to individually bind each of            the four buttons to any one of - click (normal left button click),            menu (normal right click), double-click, or universal scrolling            (what normally happens when you click on the mouse wheel).                    I can't immediately think of any real use for this, apart from for            freaking out your friends by swapping all the button functions            around on their mouse when they aren't looking. But if for some            strange reason you do want to edit how all your buttons behave, now            you can...                    Rather more usefully though, you can also use this option screen to            set macros for any of the buttons, which allows you to bind any            series of key presses to a single mouse button click.                    If you have your mouse plugged into a PS/2 socket you can also set            the poll rate (how frequently the mouse tells the computer where it            is) using something called ~PS/2 Flex~, which works the same as the            popular util PS2Rate. This allows you to set the poll rate at            anything from 10 to 200 times a second.                    The mouse comes with a USB to PS/2 adapter, so you can actually use            it in either type of socket depending on what you have available.            As a 200Hz poll rate is actually higher than you would get with            USB, you might want to try using the mouse in a PS/2 socket and            then using PS/2 Flex to increase the poll rate to see if you can            spot the difference...         Now for the            science bit...                    The real selling point for the Razer BoomSlang is its high            sensitivity. Whereas most mice have a sensitivity of about 400 dpi            (~dots per inch~), the BoomSlang 2000 gets its name from its            maximum setting of 2000 dpi. There is also a cheaper version called            the BoomSlang 1000, which can reach a sensitivity of up to (you            guessed it) 1000 dpi.                    What this means in practice is that the mouse is more accurate and            responsive, and if you have your sensitivity set appropriately high            in Windows you will need to move the mouse around a lot less than            you normally would to get the same reaction. This can take some            getting used to, and if you usually play your games by moving your            mouse half way across your desk just to turn around, then this            mouse probably isn't for you.                    For the rest of us though, switching to a BoomSlang can make a            small but noticeable difference to your performance in games,            particularly first person shooters and other fast paced and action            based games.                    It might not turn you into the next Thresh, but it will certainly            help your gaming once you have got used to its unique design and            high sensitivity.         The BoomSlang is one of the best rodents money can buy at the            moment, with the looks and attitude to match. The real question            though is whether the high price tag is justified.                    The answer is .. well, it depends.                    If you are a serious hardcore gamer and love first person shooters,            then this mouse will certainly be worth every cent. If role playing            and strategy games are more your thing, then the cheaper BoomSlang            1000 might be better for you. If you are a casual gamer, still            happy with the $10 rodent that came with your computer when you            bought it, then forget it - the BoomSlang was really not designed            for you.                    Still not sure? Well, the BoomSlang comes with another neat feature            - three years warranty as standard. So if your bedroom is a            graveyard of broken and worn-out rodents, then it's probably worth            buying the BoomSlang just for this, as if the mouse dies before its            time k\u00e4rna will send you another one to replace it for free.                    You can't say fairer than that...
