Sadly nobody has yet found a way to combine            computers with the ultimate in sugar-glazed confectionery, but the            gaudy little plastic building blocks have spawned a string of games            over the years.                    The latest entry is LEGO Racers 2 which, as the title suggests,            features LEGO guys tearing around a series of fanciful tracks in a            range of bizarre looking vehicles. Indeed, if the preset vehicles            on offer aren't oddball enough for you, there is a construction kit            allowing you to design your own, building it up brick by brick from            one of the standard chassis. It's not entirely obvious what effect            (if any) the design of a vehicle has on its handling, but it's a            nice touch anyway. The only disappointment is that there is no            obvious way to remove a brick once you have placed it on your            vehicle, so if you make a mistake you're stuck with it.                    As you would expect from LEGO, the options are virtually endless.            The game includes five worlds to explore, each based on one of the            new fangled LEGO theme kits, and each with its own selection of            unique bricks, preset vehicles and chassis to play around with.            There are post vans and police cars in Sandy Bay, oldsmobiles and            half-tracks on Dino Island, land speeders on Mars and skidoos in            the Arctic, all leading up to the wild vehicles and gravity defying            tracks of Xalax.                    When you first load the game though you only have access to Sandy            Bay; the other four worlds must be unlocked in the game's Adventure            mode by earning enough gold bricks. This can be done simply by            winning the four main races you will find on each of the worlds,            but there is also an exploration mode which allows you to drive            around the world freely.                    Exploring the world allows you to chat with the people who live            there to get clues which can lead you to hidden treasure or bonus            games. These involve collecting a number of objects scattered            around the world, and beating them within the time limit can            provide additional upgrades for your vehicle, giving you more grip,            stronger shields or increased engine power. The middle three worlds            also have bosses which you can race against to pick up further            upgrades, which will be invaluable by the time you reach Xalax and            must face off against Rocket Racer himself in the great dome. And            while the first and last bosses you meet are just men in very fast            cars, the other two are utterly bizarre and offer their own unique            challenges.                    It's all very entertaining, and the animations of the characters            you speak to are surprisingly emotive and full-of-life considering            that they are computer renderings of little chunks of plastic. The            voice acting is also superb, with a string of high-pitched            gobbledegook emerging from the characters as they talk to you and            subtitles providing a translation in your chosen language. The only            real downside to the Adventure mode is that I completed the whole            thing in six hours, unlocking all of the tracks and more than half            of the bonus games, and picking up 32 of the game's 35 gold bricks            in the process.                    Luckily then there are plenty of other options to keep you busy            once the main Adventure is over. For starters there is the            inevitable Arcade mode, allowing you to race in a full field of            eight cars on any of the game's 24 tracks that you have unlocked.                    This is fairly amusing in its own right, although the AI racers            don't always put up much of a fight. They seem to have problems            getting themselves unstuck after becoming wedged between barriers            or vanishing off the track, and even get lost occasionally in some            of the maze-like courses. The AI hasn't really mastered the use of            the power-ups which are included in the game either, and you can            often see drivers firing these off seemingly at random, with chunky            nuclear missiles and bouncing bombs whizzing past in all            directions.                    Power-ups are in plentiful supply though, and can make or break            your race. Slamming a rocket into the rear fender of the vehicle in            front can send it flying into the air thanks to the mushy physics,            as well as removing some of its LEGO bricks courtesy of the fully            destructible nature of the vehicles. In extreme cases entire cars            can disintegrate in a cloud of particles and little primary            coloured plastic bricks, leaving the poor driver running along on            foot towards the pit lane. Absolutely priceless.                    A Time Attack mode is also included, which pits you against            yourself as you try to set a new lap record. Rather than simply            telling you the time you need to beat though, LEGO Racers 2            actually renders a phantom car representing the current fastest            lap. This races around the track with you, allowing you to see at a            glance where you are gaining and losing time on any particular run.                    Trying to shave off those extra few tenths of a second and to            improve your consistency is surpisingly enjoyable, although as your            car is permanently boosted in Time Attack mode you can't really            extend the knowledge of the tracks you pick up here to the other            modes, where you will be travelling somewhat slower. Still, it's a            nice feature that helps give the game some much-needed longevity.                    The tracks themselves provide plenty of variety, from the hill            climbs, narrow streets and beaches of Sandy Bay to the wild            loop-the-loops, force fields and vertigo-inducing mid-air turns of            Xalax. There are spiral ramps to race your way up and down,            dinosaurs to dodge, rivers to splash across, an ice-bound ship to            navigate your way through and non-linear sections where the tracks            open up into a maze of intertwining passages.                    It's all a far cry from the mundane tracks of more realistic racing            games, and although the physics and handling aren't as satisfying            as in more adult-oriented games and you can complete many of the            tracks without having to hit the brakes at all, the game can still            be challenging in its own way. At the end of the day it's really            aimed at kids, but there is enough here to keep older gamers            entertained for a while too.                        -        LEGO                    Racers 2 screenshots (PC)                LEGO                    Racers 2 screenshots (PC)                                    LEGO Racers 2 screenshots (GBA)                                    LEGO Racers 2 screenshots (GBA)"}
