But            one that has just hit the shelves - and belatedly, our desk - is            Bits' Die Hard Vendetta, a first person shooter loosely based on            the movie trilogy. Normally we'd treat movie tie-in fodder with            more than a little suspicion, but given that it's exclusive to the            platform, we assumed this would be a cut above the standard all            formats fare.                    The subject matter certainly lends itself nicely to the FPS genre,            with plenty of characterisation, wise cracks from John McClane, and            the all important selection of weaponry. And according to the press            release blurb, the game features a control system designed from the            ground up for console users, as well as ~unprecedented character            interaction~, ~superbly rich environments~ and ~amazing in-game            cinematics~.        Well, maybe            that was the intention, but the results are a million miles away            from the PR guff. There are so many problems with Die Hard            Vendetta, it's hard to know where to start.                    Firstly the control system is totally unwieldy thanks to Bits            deciding that the cursor should move dramatically, even if you only            nudge the analogue stick a tiny bit. There are various options to            alter sensitivity, turn off auto centre and motion, but none of            these corrects what is a fundamental error. The controls are saved            from complete disaster by having an auto target option, but this            removes any element of skill from playing the game, as it quickly            degenerates into a question of how fast you can hit the fire            button, with the cursor instantly locking onto any target you face.            Why Bits didn't stick with the tried and trusted standard is            anyone's guess.                    Elsewhere, the controls intention to be helpful end up being merely            irritating, with the prime example being the auto jump, which makes            you jump off an edge if you're running at the time. Also, the            system of selecting the weapons and inventory with D pad isn't as            user friendly or intuitive as it could be. All round, they made a            right pig's ear of it, and it ruins any chance you have of getting            into the game from the off.        And all that's before you're 'treated' to the visual element of            the game. Somehow managing to make Half Life look up to date by            comparison, it's actually a shock to see a next gen console game            this bland - especially the show off genre of the first person            shooter.                    We're not aware of the engine used, but it looks like a stripped            down version of Monolith's Lithtech engine, and as such the colours            are garish, while the general texturing and architecture looks            extremely lacklustre stood next to any number of competing games.                    The character models look extremely primitive by today's standards            too, and basic clipping problems mean that often when you walk up            to them, you can see right inside their bodies, which is something            we haven't witnessed this century! It's harsh to judge a game based            on how it looks, but everywhere you look there's something to make            you gasp at how a product such as this could have ever been given            the green light.        In our quest for            objectivity, we played on dutifully to find out what other charms            lay within Die Hard Vendetta. The opening level is as good as any            to pick on: you're faced with a few shell-shocked witnesses to a            hostage incident, and cops taking notes. Walking up to then and            clicking the action button elicits some astonishingly badly            scripted and acted voices from said badly rendered characters, and            eventually you become aware that you've got to go and rescue            someone.                    Except the man busy blow-torching the door open won't get out of            the way, and eventually you're forced to click around on everyone            to find out the 'required' info before the cop gets out of your            way. Fantastically irritating, not a good start, but pretty typical            of what to expect. It feels like an botched attempt to marry the            Half Life narrative system with a Die Hard setting, garnished with            a bit of Max Payne bullet time (or 'Hero time' for the purposes of            the game) to get you through those tricky sections (albeit without            any of the tension, the moves or the wow factor of Remedy's title).            Another complete lift from Max Payne is the use of slow motion when            you kill key baddies, which was pretty annoying first time around -            although at least Max Payne had decent graphics to show off. Here,            it's used too often and just becomes annoying after about the            second time you see it.                    If you're wise enough to switch on auto targeting, then clearing            the early levels shouldn't prove too much of a challenge; just face            vaguely in the right direction of your assailant, and POW, down            they go - even if they're pointing a loaded gun in the face of a            hostage. Handy eh? The A.I is pretty non existent, and makes Halo            look like a genuine work of genius by comparison. The challenge is            raised somewhat as you progress, with more involved stealth based            hostage rescue, more interesting weapons and so on, but the basic            flaws are inherent throughout.                    It was pretty clear from the very first bullet that Die Hard            Vendetta is not a game that even the most, ahem, die hard FPS or            movie fan would want to shell out forty nicker on. If you want a            game that does the franchise justice, you can probably pick up the            fantastically entertaining Die Hard Trilogy on PSone for about one            eighth of the cost of this. We know the graphics have aged somewhat            on that one, but at least it's fun. Die Hard Vendetta feels exactly            like a vendetta - against your patience, good taste and your            wallet. Do yourself a favour and avoid.
