Have we been            sent the rusty old, invariably tedious, hard and annoying            side-scrolling version of the game whilst all the other reviewers            have some sort of money-producing mechanical love toy? We just            can't seem to explain the positive response this game has met with            in the US, where several reviewers said it was only a certain            distance from being a vanguard of its genre. It certainly is, of            course, but that distance is best measured in miles, and developer            Torus is apparently circling the M25\u2026                    What we don't get is how a game which gives you three continues,            two levels for each of four environments, three rather tinny boss            battles, virtually no variation in enemies, and uses the early 90s            'walk left to right and occasionally go back on yourself but            generally don't' shoot 'em up formula can be elevated to anybody's            list of must-haves.                    But let's have a closer look at what you get for your \u00a330+            before we dismiss it entirely, shall we?                    The menu system is like a microcosm of the game itself: few            options, functional presentation and only one obvious route to            take. You can run three save games in tandem if you like, and each            attempt offers you three lives to conquer the game's eight levels.            The story kicks off as Anthony 'Tony' Stark finds his Invincible            Iron Man suit missing and sets off in pursuit (in a, um, spare)            across an industrial setting. Cue many, many prefabricated and            repeated girder-based platform sections, buildings with two set            levels to clamber on, cranes which break up the enemy-strewn            sections of map and a final boss encounter with the would-be thief,            Tony's cousin Morgan. But alas, he used the suit to upload the data            somewhere else, etc, so off you go for a further six levels until            it's all safe - a quest which reveals your other enemies Blizzard            and Crimson Dynamo\u2026                    Iron Man is blessed with a couple of abilities. Using the right            trigger Tony can shoulder charge, which will knock enemies back and            is useful in close encounters, and using the B button he can pop            people with his ~repulsor~. The repulsor is hooked into his suit's            energy gage, displayed along the top of the screen alongside the            health bar, and each shot nips a little bit of the bar. Charge it            up for a big attack and you'll obviously lose a larger,            proportional amount. To keep Tony charged, you have to seek out the            pearl-like energy balls dotted around the level (usually near to            health balls), and this forces you to duck off the obvious left to            right path occasionally to scale a building or climb a crane.                    Otherwise, Tony can jump with A and do a jetpack double-jump by            pressing it again in mid-air, and he can of course crouch. However            we were disappointed that Tony can't shoot up or down, let alone at            diagonals. He is limited to left and right, either at crouching or            standing height, or during a jump. Given that Metroid and countless            other games mastered eight-directional shooting a decade ago, this            is ridiculous.                    Sadly the game Tony finds himself in isn't much better. Your basic            environments are military, jungle, snow and factory, and each is            well detailed to the point of making background and foreground            objects difficult to distinguish. You'll need to keep a sharp eye            open and tread cautiously at all times - we've already been caught            out by platforms which weren't platforms\u2026                    The design isn't too horrible, but it's rarely exciting either. The            approach varies depending on the type of environment, but generally            scaffold and girders (or equivalent) are used to channel you            upwards and along, creating little girder mazes to traverse, whilst            dodging one of the game's three or four main enemies; the plant            which spits blobs of doom from the wall. These plants are very            difficult to take out because of course your repulsor has to be on            the same level to shoot them. Not much use if they're attached to            the ceiling. Oh, and their projectiles can generally make it            through a depth of scenery, whereas yours can't.                    The Iron Man's other enemies aren't all that impressive, but they            are legion. There are the basic laser-toting grunts, which will            harm you if you make contact with them (complete with annoying but            obligatory getting-knocked-back squawk plus animation), but you can            avoid their fire by ducking (yes, really). They take two shots to            dispatch. Then there are the slightly larger, redder faced enemies            whose projectiles dip and tuck. They take three shots. Then there            are a couple of others, sentry drones, etc. Then there are the            bosses - Morgan Stark at the end of level two absorbs a fair amount            of ammo, but doesn't really move or do anything. In fact, the            extent of enemy AI seems to be dashing back and forward along            platforms or falling off and resuming the dash along the ground,            firing their weapons either at you or nearby and then dying in a            predictable and shortly to become tedious way.                    Anyway, there isn't much point dragging this out. The game is about            eight levels long, which takes roughly two hours give or take,            depending on how many times you run out of lives and have to start            over, and the only other distractions are some half-hearted            ~bonuses~ to unlock, a single, special weapon to find in-game            (which isn't much more impressive than the repulsor) and eventually            a level select screen to let you skip through the levels you've            completed. If we were to commend any features, we'd focus on the            automatic saving which keeps your progress well and truly backed up            without any intervention, and the graphical design of the Iron Man            sprite, which is at least fairly detailed and well animated.                    Other than that, in terms of his strength and abilities, The            Invincible Iron Man is one of the wimpiest game heroes we've            encountered and deserves to be locked away in this rather            limp platformer-with-guns. Only super diehard comic book fans need            apply, and if they could preface any bickering planned for the            comments page with some sort of irate comic book fan disclaimer            that would be lovely.
