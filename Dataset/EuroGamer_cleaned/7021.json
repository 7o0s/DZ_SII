The killer combination of a snug physics engine coupled with one of            the most varied reward structures ever completely redefined the            racing genre for the better. In fact, the only game that it's fair            to say has come close to emulating GT's success since then is            Metropolis Street Racer on the Dreamcast, a game that we felt was            so utterly complete that we spent the best part of two weeks            sweating over what we could find to criticize about it.                         Which all in all doesn't bode terribly well for Sega GT, which is            as you may already have guessed a Gran Turismo clone. In its own            right a fairly entertaining title, GT has unfortunately chosen to            arrive in the wake of MSR, and during one of the busiest periods of            the computerized racing calendar. With Christmas looming, the game            really didn't stand a chance, and thanks to some unruly controls            and an unintuitive interface, it sealed its own fate.                         But nonetheless, from the point of view of the average gamer,            beguiled into fritting away his Christmas money in the 'Sale'            section of the local electronics gaff, it may represent an            interesting diversion from the cold turkey sandwiches and stale            wines that otherwise occupy one's time. And so here we are, and I            don't know about you but the sandwiches are starting to look            tempting...                    One of the vast array of issues I have with the current crop of            racing games is that far from encouraging a new and innovative            style, they all seem to have gotten bored and opted for the same            basic configuration. The structure found here is nigh on what was            originally conceived by Gran Turismo in 1997. Each potential driver            has to undergo a series of rigorous driving tests to secure his or            her license, before buying a reasonable beginner's car and racing            against a field of drivers whose skills are comparable to your own            measly levels of performance. From there you win, earn, reinvest            and eventually end up with the biggest, most souped-up car in the            field, with top of the range shocks, springs, turbos and furry            dice. By winning your way into the three higher classes you also            unlock some more powerful motors and gain access to new courses.                         Sadly though, the interface is laughable and ultimately spoils            everything that goes on off-track. For instance, when I first            entered Championship mode, there was no immediate advice on what to            do. After pondering the screenful of whirring levels and icons, I            delved into the manual to discover what was going on. Elsewhere,            car selection is awkward and cumbersome, relying on your being in            possession of a photographic memory of your car before really            allowing you to get anywhere.                         If you do manage to get out onto the racecourse, you will discover            that the tracks, which are wholly original and independent of the            real world's own eccentric bumps and blips, are varied in size and            location. The time of day can play a large part in the outcome of            your race as well, thanks to the often overwhelming lens flare and            other elemental distractions. Fans of Indy pursuits (no pun            intended) will be happy to hear that those neverending ovals that            us Europeans seem to detest make up a reasonable proportion of the            tracks on offer. There are more technical courses too, which invite            the driver to show off his or her ability to handle the advanced            physics of the game, rather than, well, a demonstration of how many            revs one can get on the meter before the wheels fall off.                    In Japan, when the game was originally released, the punters cried            out for a Western revision with an overhauled control system.            Players of the original Japanese version will be aware of the fact            that in GT, the D-Pad is totally unresponsive, and the analogue            stick seems to want to transmit your instructions via carrier            pigeon, such is the lag between cause and effect. Although the            physics of the game are fairly realistic, the fact that you            cannot damage your car should be something of a giveaway that Sega            have, instead of improving the control system, opted to tweak the            physics engine to be overly forgiving. As such, it's no surprise to            find yourself bouncing the car from barrier to barrier with no loss            of momentum in your attempts to put it across the finishing line.            Getting the car to face forward again is a game of chance, and            there were several occasions where I just flung my gamepad down on            the floor and gave up.                         If there's one thing though that driving fanatics will find            relatively satisfying about GT, it's the library of licensed cars.            Although the allocation here is somewhat less than Gran Turismo 2            gave us last year, the names and model numbers will certainly prove            more recognisable for the most part. Top cars like the Supra, Honda            S2000 and even a prototype Dodge Viper GTS-R are available to those            who reach the highest levels of attainment, and if you're not that            patient, a lot of them are also available in the Quick Race and            Head-to-Head playmodes.                         The car models are very accurate, and superbly animated, zooming            past you at a fairly consistent 40 frames per second, with plenty            of different camera angles to admire the bodywork. Motion blur also            makes an appearance, giving the cars a luminescent quality seen as            far as I can remember only in obscure places like Gran Turismo's            opening video. Pop-up is also fairly minimal throughout, thanks to            the powerful 3D engine at the heart of the game.                    Regrettably, as with a lot of things in Sega GT, the graphics are            good in some areas, but much worse in others. The textures are, to            be frank, atrocious at times, with pixelation at a distance of            several metres and on the more unconventional surfaces like            cobblestone, a bizarre sort of dancing effect that skewers the            display. The sounds, too, are somewhat glitchy, and far too deep            and booming, a factor that leads to the entire soundtrack becoming            completely muffled. Thanks to the low tone of the engine roars and            tyre screeches, it's also fairly noticeable when they repeat,            making the process of bouncing your car off every barrier even less            enjoyable.                         If there's one thing that could have saved GT from becoming a real            cornerstone of pain for the Dreamcast, it's the Internet            capability. The single player AI is fairly formidable and offers a            reasonable challenge, but you can also download Ghost cars from the            Sega GT website. This feature alone bumped up the level of            enjoyment I extracted from GT no end. Playing against other people            is fantastic fun, and observing their driving styles and how they            contrast your own is quite an interesting experience. I didn't            manage to upload my own time trials for some reason, but it was            fairly obvious that others were having no trouble with this            feature.                         Ultimately, one of GT's biggest problems is that it feels            unfinished. There's a whole host of things the game could be            commended for, but almost every point is countered by some looming            mass beneath the surface, such as the problems with the graphics            engine overshadowing the wonderful car models, and the repetitive            sound effects obscuring the fairly impressive rock/techno            soundtrack that lurks behind. The only thing that I felt did the            game any justice was the Internet options, and even those were            quite limited. Given a few months more time on the development slab            at Sega, GT could have been one of the best racers of our time, but            in their foolishness, they rushed it out of the door in every            territory.                    A marred effort, is the best appraisal one can give of Sega GT. For            all its achievements, there's always something to be disappointed            about, and in a genre as tightly packed as this, one ought not to            concern one's self with the likes of this. Steer well clear, at            least until the powers that be opt for a sequel."}
