An announcement is made that a                 meteorite discovered in Antarctica, originating from Mars,                 contains possible microfossil bacteria .. primitive life. A                 surveyor flight visits Mars in 2005. It returns with evidence                 that microorganisms may have existed a million years before.                 But nothing conclusive.                    A decade later, the first ever manned mission to Mars is            instigated. Vita 1 base is established a year on. The mission for            the crew is simply to find any evidence of organic life above or            below the surface. Sub-surface exploration begins 252 days after            colonisation, and then on the 254th day, all contact with Vita 1 is            lost.                    June 17th, 2019 - Three investigators are sent to Mars;            microbiologist Diane Matlock, computer expert Kenzo Uji, and            security man Martin Karne. None of them know the nightmare that is            about to unfold before their very eyes. The last message received            from Vita 1 provides the trio with a chilling mission directive -            ~Stay alone... Stay alive...~                         Upon loading up Martian Gothic, the first thing that hits you                 is the simplicity of the main options. Your choices are                 limited to starting a new game, loading a previous save game,                 or quitting. You also have an options screen which allows you                 to redefine the keys, adjust sound volume, and toggle                 subtitles on or off.                    Starting a new game, you are treated to a moody introductory video.            This depicts the journey to Mars of the intrepid trio, along with            an in-game graphic sequence to set the scene. The three characters            each begin in a separate airlock to each other, heeding the warning            to 'stay alone'. Upon entry to the base they contract the air-borne            virus that wiped out the previous occupants. This in mind, you must            not allow any of them to meet each other.                    It soon becomes obvious that the only method of success in the game            is to work together. For a start, only Kenzo can move out of his            airlock, while the other two are locked in. His first task            therefore is to set free his teammates.         As Kenzo steps                 out into the corridor, it's immediately apparent how                 atmospheric the game is. Spot music plays unobtrusively in the                 background, while his boots clang on the metallic floor. Other                 than that, deathly silence!                    The feeling that the place is deserted is superbly done. Wandering            around the base you will discover the dead bodies of the Vita 1            inhabitants, which you will need to search for items and clues. Any            object or item that can be manipulated in some way will flash up a            white magnifying glass when you get near to it.                    Selecting your use/examine key brings up your inventory list, which            also shows you your wristwatch which monitors your health status,            whether you are poisoned, your current weapon .. and the time of            course! That's Mars time. Each character begins with a default set            of items including the watch and a radio, along with a couple of            personal artefacts. You will have to hunt for a weapon to use...         Although                 the bodies strewn around the base may look dead, they are                 decidedly undead! In the beginning only the odd zombie will                 drag itself lazily to its feet. The further you progress into                 the game though, the more bodies become animated.                    A lot of the zombies can be dodged with ease by running past them.            Others loiter around in narrow corridors, where your only option is            to use a weapon on them. Get too near, and they will grab you to            nibble at your neck muscles! Each zombie usually takes five or six            bullets to drop to the floor. Ammo is very scarce though, so you            are advised to evade them as much as possible. This is even more            important when you consider that every zombie will get up again.            They just won't die!                    Zombies found further into the game also have the additional twist            of taking more bullets to knock them down, as well as some of them            getting up straight away! And of course there are alien creatures,            which are just as morbid, but far more lethal.         As                 mentioned previously, working together is the only way to get                 anywhere in this game. One of your team members might find an                 item that is useless to them, but is the key to solving a                 problem for another.                    You can pass items to each other via vac-tubes, which hold a            maximum of four items. The tubes are liberally dotted throughout            the base, and you should memorise their locations.                    Problems occur when you have a full inventory and you want to take            stuff from the tubes. There is no way to drop items, so you will            have to find an empty locker or use up a health syringe to offload            unnecessary items, thus making space. I found this system to be            extremely tedious. What would have been a lot better would be to            have an additional sidepack which could store things away. Or to            simply be able to drop stuff!         You really                 are on your own in Martian Gothic, as the brief history                 of the base and the garbled distress call is the sum of your                 knowledge of the situation.                    Help is at hand though. In some rooms around the base you will find            computer terminals. These have a variety of functions. Solve a few            more puzzles, and you can go speak to MOOD! I won't spoil it for            you.                    One of the main terminal functions is to enable you to save your            current game position. Each terminal has a mini-game called Martian            Mayhem, touted as the worst computer game in the history of            mankind! It's within this game that you can save your position. Be            warned though, there are a limited amount of game saves per            terminal. Use them wisely!                    Each terminal also has a comprehensive database on the base, Mars            and even the team. You will also be able to gain access to            privileged information, which can only be accessed with the correct            pass code. Audio feeds can be played back, and a lot of which have            valuable clues hidden within. You can also activate machinery and            doors from certain screens.         The pre-rendered world of Martian Gothic is fabulous, and each            location has been given the full graphical treatment. The camera            angles on some of the screens can be a little crazy, but it all            adds to the gothic horror of it all.                    The characters themselves are 3D models which are nice enough,            although they are a little lacking compared to the backgrounds. The            zombies look great though .. well, really they look awful, but then            they should! They are horribly gaunt, and shuffle along with arms            outstretched, hell-bent on strangling you to death.                    The most chilling aspect of the zombies is the echoed voices you            hear, as the entities in Martian Gothic have the ability to use            telepathy to get into your mind. Sometimes you can't decypher what            they are saying, but at other times you can hear fragments. Very            haunting.                    The voice acting in general is excellent. In particular the            micro-tape machines with messages recorded by Vita 1 team members            are all nicely done. You can really hear the worry in some of the            recordings. Sound is very well used. Even the simple opening of a            door is a major event with the quietness of the base, and the            Trimorphs make a noise that is quite spine tingling. When the first            one attacks you it is almost guaranteed to make you jump!                    A lot of effort has been put into making this game as horrific and            encapsulating as possible. It shows.         Martian Gothic is                 undoubtably a good game, but there are a few bugs to iron out.                    One of the worst I have come across is when a zombie has grabbed            me, and the location has changed to somewhere totally different. I            was still able to change between characters, but when I flipped to            Kenzo it was just this location without him standing there! This            has happened to me on a few occasions, and at times where I haven't            been anywhere near a computer terminal to save my game.            Growl-worthy I can tell you!                    The actual collision detection between character and enemy can be a            little shoddy too. I've been far enough away from a zombie, only            for it to lock its arms around me. The annoyance is doubled when            you try to perform a grapple break, and this doesn't work either!                    A few people have also reported system hangs whenever Matlock            tightens the screws outside Airlock 2. I didn't suffer this            problem, but I have had four occasions where my machine has hung            solid, for no apparent reason. A patch is planned though, so            hopefully some or all of the problems above will be sorted out.         Comparisons are                 bound to be drawn between Martian Gothic and the Resident Evil                 series. There is far more tension and atmosphere to this game                 though, and you don't have to put up with any door animations                 either! As you push further into the game, you get a really                 nasty feeling that the worst is yet to come. It's this very                 feeling that drives you forward.                    The pre-rendered locations are all superbly done. However, you will            find that some battles will push you off into the next screen,            which usually results in you losing track of where your enemy is!            The curse of most flip screen adventures truth be told. The means            to change video resolution would have been welcome too, as the game            only pumps out a measly 640x480.                    Overall it's entertaining stuff though, but it really needs a patch            to fix the problems I mentioned, along with a few other minor            issues. It's for this reason that I feel I must mark it down a            notch.                        View before you buy! Download the                        Martian Gothic .MPG Video (12Mb)."}
