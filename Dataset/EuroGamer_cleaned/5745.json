Nothing else really matters. I like to think of Silent Hill            2 as a gift-wrapped message for the darling buds of Capcom. It's            nice to look at, it's easy to control and it's built around a            gripping narrative. There are still some niggles, but if I were            Shinji Mikami I'd be somewhat concerned.                         The game puts you in the position of widower James Sunderland,            whose wife Mary has been dead three years. James is extremely            depressed and without a friend in the world, so when he receives a            letter from his dead wife pleading for him to meet her in the town            of Silent Hill, he jumps into the car and steps on the gas. A            letter from beyond the grave is never a good omen though, and            before long after arriving at Silent Hill James is in trouble, and            none of Silent Hill's peculiar occupants can offer much assistance.            Quite the opposite, in fact\u2026                         James' adventures are occasionally depicted from those dramatic            fixed camera angles which run throughout the genre, but for the            most part you can pick your own camera angle using L2. The camera            is always a certain distance away from James, but you can rotate it            while holding down L2 if you use the right analogue stick. This            means it's almost impossible to get yourself in a position where            the camera can't be moved to solve your problem. Moreover, the            camera never clips into the wall or any of the objects in the game,            and there are scant few occasions in the game when you find            yourself set upon in an area with a fixed camera angle.                    Although this reduces the number of problems caused by camera            positioning, there are still some inevitable problems. Weird            looking zombies hang from the ceiling in places, and aiming at            these is still nigh on impossible, just as it was with the aerial            assailants in the last few Resident Evil games.                         Whether you're being chomped on by a zombie or swooping alongside            James as he jogs gracefully from danger, the sheer beauty of the            game cannot escape your attention. Silent Hill is filled with dense            fog, used to great cinematic effect (rather than simply to mask the            draw distance) to create a feeling of claustrophobia. I used to            live in a room that wasn't much more than a cupboard, and if I            wasn't slightly claustrophobic after a year of that, I certainly            was after five minutes of Silent Hill 2. It's the way the fog moves            that really frightens the player. Every scene has a cloudy            presence, but it's always a few inches from James' fingertips.                         Beyond the fog (which is something you will never be\u2026)            Konami have achieved something Capcom have never managed; they have            made the game look dirty. That's right, every location, from the            lowliest cupboard to the grandest dining room is absolutely filthy.            Clouds of dust, bits of dirt and grime have collected everywhere,            and at times it's as if somebody opened all the windows and then            emptied a cesspit over the town during a hurricane. That, along            with the consistent blood red theme of much of the game's interior            artwork helps to create an eerie and totally believable ghost town.                    Like their surroundings, the various creatures that inhabit the            town of Silent Hill are drawn with the devil's own pen. From            roaches to psychotic nurses the animation and excessive detail is            delightful. The fingers move separately; arms flex; necks twist;            hair blows in the wind, and that's just the bad guys. James himself            is thoroughly realistic, moving with the composure and poise of the            average human male and flexing all the right muscles as he does it.                         The game also features some computer-generated movie sequences,            which complement the action nicely. The quality of the game's            visuals means that Konami are in the strange position of being able            to surreptitiously splice in-game and CG footage without much            obvious difference. For me, that's showboating to Capcom, and it            works a treat.                         The reason you keep playing Silent Hill 2 won't be the visuals            though, nor the excellent use of camera angles and the complete            lack of Resident Evil-style clipping, script inadequacy and            boredom. No, the reason I kept on through the game's 15 hours of            gameplay was that it consistently managed to scare me, and I loved            it. Konami have done everything within their power to frighten you.            From footsteps you didn't make on the wet grass to the            sound of breaking glass somewhere not a million miles from your            pale, exposed face, the game is packed with titbits that may or            may not lead to a greater danger. It invites paranoia at every            turn.                    If you aren't scared by the supposed threat of a beast stalking you            through the shadows, the very real and obvious threat of a new and            heinous monster literally within 20 feet of your person with            nothing but fog to hide you will probably fill in the blanks. Like            the first game, you wind up with this little radio, which blasts            static that grows in volume as monsters approach. What a brilliant            idea - a devastating and probably blood-curdlingly hideous monster            within a few feet and you haven't a clue which direction it's            coming from.                         The control system matches the spooky atmosphere and fetching            visuals by remaining practically anonymous. You're never fighting            to get it to do something, and it becomes second nature before            long. If James wants to find and examine a particular object, when            it comes within a certain distance he turns his head to greet it            automatically, and his piercing flashlight singles it out making            the process of scouring a mansion altogether a lot easier.                         The excellent gameplay mechanics of Silent Hill 2 mean that the            player can spend far more time occupying themselves with the game            itself, which comprises a reasonable mixture of action, puzzle and            adventure. There are some pretty bog standard puzzles and action            sequences from time to time, but the breadth of activities and            Konami's ability to reinvigorate proceedings at a moment's notice            mean that time flies when you play Silent Hill 2, and by the end of            the game I had barely had my fill.                    Silent Hill 2 is a very complete survival-horror adventure, with a            good control system, some good camera work and an excellent            narrative. The fact that I spent 15 hours playing the game without            once glancing at my stopwatch (except to stop and start, obviously)            is indicative enough to me of a fantastic game. Resident Evil has            become tired and overdone, and Capcom haven't really scared anybody            with it in a year or so. Silent Hill 2 is a much better game than            any in the RE series, and it solves a number of problems that have            dogged the survival-horror genre forever. Who cares if it's            Christmas, you should be out killing something."}
