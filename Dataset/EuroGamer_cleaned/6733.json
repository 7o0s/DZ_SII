In fact, any            of the editorial staff at Eurogamer would be a bad choice -            spending our spare time in the company of lager swilling louts and            avoiding brawls on a sun kissed beach somewhere in the            Mediterranean is not our idea of fun... We get in enough of a state            at Christmas parties in Brighton [my head still hurts -Ed].            However, in an exit poll conducted at the clubs and bars I            frequent, I was voted the reviewer most likely to hold his drink,            and so I get to design package holidays with Eidos' latest            peculiarity, Beach Life. The others are off to Spain on the company            card to build up their stamina. Apparently.                    Let's get the obvious point out of the way first - Beach Life is,            for all intents and purposes, RollerCoaster Tycoon Ibiza-style,            albeit without rollercoasters, or rides, or... oh shut up, you get            the idea. Instead of the ability to construct rides, you have an            assortment of different types of restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars and            Ebola-riddled beach barbecues alongside tacky souvenir shops, water            sports and amusement arcades.                           Your progress through the game relies on your ability to            successfully fulfil mission objectives on the game's fourteen            islands. These objectives range from simply attracting a set quota            of guests to your resort, to restricting drownings to a certain            degree and getting couples to fornicate on the beach. How lovely.            Your goals are always achieved through clever construction and            placement of buildings and scenery though, and a great deal of care            and attention needs to be put into what type of buildings you            build, where you build them and when. Mission objectives where you            need to attract a certain type of clientele for example, such as            those of particular affluence, rely on distinct types of attraction            and it's down to both common sense and trial and error to find out            exactly what they are.                           Sometimes, you'll need to build a resort from scratch, and this is            when the game is at its most demanding as you rush to get all the            budgeted amenities and entertainment up to scratch as quickly as            possible. This of course means hiring staff to take care of it all,            and each type of staff from holiday reps to cleaners require their            own type of building, and other building types are in turn reliant            on the construction of staff facilities - the beach barbeque is            reliant on the construction of a cleaners hut, for example. The way            the constructions interlock and rely on each other adds a certain            amount of confusion and an extra level of stress, as the guests can            be nagging for something which you can't build because you can't            afford another prerequisite. You can guarantee that your first few            days of business will be disastrous as your funds are emptied and            the guests remain unsatisfied, which can be frustrating.                    Visually, Beach Life is pretty unremarkable. Everything is            pre-rendered and the islands themselves are devoid of animation,            which is particularly disappointing as they're nicely realised for            the most part. The small characters are well detailed and come with            an assortment of amusing animations as the guests (ahem) go through            the motions, and thanks to the game's ability to focus on single            characters and follow them around they can be quite good            entertainment... for about five minutes - The Sims this is not.                           The game is pretty unsurprising on the audio front as well, with            the usual crowd murmurings punctuated by the hum of equipment, the            sizzling of burgers and the gurgled yelps from unfortunate drowning            citizens (much to our continued delight). Thankfully, Deep Red            coded an MP3 player into the game's interface and managed to            include some music from the likes of Kinobe, Alexkid and Laurent            Garnier which is nice, if you like that sort of thing. If you're            anything like me though, you don't, and thankfully to this end            you're able to include your own mp3 collection in the game. Phew.                           Beach Life is good at what it does for a little while, but as is            usually the case the novelty wears extremely thin extremely            quickly. What a game like RollerCoaster Tycoon has over Beach Life            is the ability to customise most of your attractions, and has a            major boost in being able to design coasters and water rides with            almost infinite possibilities, but this is inherent to the theme            park scenario and Beach Life couldn't hope to compete with that            with only a complement of static buildings, pot plants, fountains            and surf shacks to keep you interested. Offering a set variety of            buildings without being able to research new kinds of attraction            also dulls the experience somewhat, and by the time you're halfway            through the game you're ultimately left with a repetitive and            pretty unrewarding experience."}
