Except perhaps for the real-time strategy game, there is no other            genre where the relentless rehashing of ideas is rewarded so            openly. Companies like Nintendo have made leaps forward with three            dimensional platformers like Super Mario 64, but the fundamental            task of bopping from platform to platform has remained a constant.            The graphics may change, but the concepts do not. In terms of            creativity, over the last ten years platform game designers have            virtually stood still. Rayman Advance shamelessly continues this            trend, but sadly takes the lethargic tendencies of platform            designers one step further and simply ports the original            PlayStation 2D platformer, almost pixel for pixel.                         As is usually the case, the storyline plays a distant secondary            role to the game design. Rayman's arch-nemesis Mr. Dark has            captured all the little inhabitants of Rayman's world and            imprisoned the Protoons. Protoons are Rayman's source of power and            as such you set off on a quest across some 6 worlds and 60 levels            in order to rescue the captives. When you first start the game the            state of play is linear, but deceptively so, with branching routes            that all eventually lead to the same conclusion. Also, you soon            learn that you are able to return to any level at any point during            your quest once completed. The point being that you have to uncover            every hidden cage of Protoons in every level before the game is            100% complete.                         During the course of the game a lot of the missions you partake of            seem completely unbeatable, the reason being that developer Digital            Eclipse decided to stagger the introduction of new power-ups across            the whole game. These power-ups include the ability to punch,            swing, hang from ledges and more. You can then go back to earlier            levels and utilise these new skills to access previously            unreachable areas, and by extension uncover more Protoon cages.            It's all been done before of course, most notably in the Donkey            Kong Country series and of course in the original PSX Rayman, but            unlike its predecessor, the learning curve has been tweaked so that            some levels are infuriatingly difficult.                    There's no mistaking the fact that Rayman Advance is a stunning            looker, and possibly one of the best looking GBA games available at            the moment. The areas you come to explore are pleasantly varied if            a little oddball later on. Rich backgrounds woven together with            several layers of smooth parallax scrolling complement the            well-animated sprites as you progress from a jungle scenario            through to bizarre worlds of musical instruments and stationary            (sounds like my office - Ed). Rayman's off-the-wall locales are            extremely reminiscent of classic madcap platformers like Earthworm            Jim and James Pond. The game is a showcase of both the machine's            palette and its ability to shift sprites. However, the development            team has gotten a little overzealous in some areas, in particular            when things get a little speedy and the screen begins to judder            noticeably as it scrolls.                         Rayman's path through each level is frequently eventful, and            you're almost never constrained to just running and jumping for an            entire scene. Digital Eclipse have used all the tricks; power-ups,            varying the pace, forcing players to clamber up steep slopes and            hop to new heights. One level will see you planting seeds in the            ground which grow to form platforms as you attempt to escape rising            water (a la Rainbow Islands), whilst another sees you befriending a            giant defeated mosquito and taking a high-speed journey through the            forest on his back. While they're not all wholly original ideas,            when cobbled together into one package it feels very complete.                         The size of Rayman Advance means that it fits its new host like a            glove. It's not so tedious as to begin to bore dedicated players,            yet it's just fun enough in short bursts to ensnare your attention.            This is thanks, in part, to the game's on-cart save system which            enforces a pick-up-and-play regime. Digital Eclipse decided not to            plump for a password-based system, instead you are able to play the            level of your choice and then hop across the world map to save your            game at the end. This is especially useful as later levels can            become so hugely frustrating that you'll often find yourself just            switching off the GBA without thinking twice.                    Though Rayman Advance makes admirable steps forward in a stale            genre, it's essentially a mish-mash of same-old same-old with a new            lick of paint. That we'll have true classics such as Sonic the            Hedgehog appearing on the machine soon makes us wonder whether or            not we need something like Rayman at all. Certainly it can satiate            your desires for some simplistic jumping and climbing action, but            it's all too easy to look past its cutesy, gimmicky charms and            yearn for something more .. sophisticated."}
