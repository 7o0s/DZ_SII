Herbert Wells prepares to realise a life's dream .. to travel            through time. The design and construction of the Time Machine took            almost ten years, but now it is ready to be tested.                    Herbert starts the machine. With violent convulsions and bright            lights, the machine is propelled into a temporal tunnel. Everything            is functioning as it should, but suddenly the machine begins            shaking again. With a blinding flash the machine appears in a            strange city. According to the chronometer on the machine's            console, he has traversed 800,000 years into the future.                    Suddenly he is ejected from the seat, and the machine disappears.            He is now trapped in the future, in a world totally strange to him.            Temporal storms sweep through this world on a regular basis,            robbing its inhabitants of their memories, and forever changing            their period in life. You can be a child one minute, and an old man            the next.                    You soon learn that your time meddling has upset the very core of            the universe itself, and you must help Herbert to unravel the            secrets locked within the sand swept walls of Hourglass City,            overcoming many puzzles and hazards in your quest to meet the man            behind it all .. Khronos. Only then can you avert universal            catastrophe and return home to your era.         I love my adventure games to have a good solid story line,            with believable characters, twists in the tale and for my interest            to be held throughout. ~The Time Machine~ gets a head start            straight away, being loosely based around the classic HG Wells book            of the same name.                    Indeed, the character you control is Herbert George Wells himself.            Dressed in a Sherlock Holmes style costume, and speaking with an            affable tone, he's everything you would expect from a late 19th            century man.                    The game begins with a stunning piece of video showing you            Herbert's laboratory, and how he takes his machine on its maiden            voyage. Video of equal quality can be seen in the middle of the            game, and obviously the final scene. From the introductory video            alone, you can tell the quality and attention to detail the            developers have poured into this title.         The            Time Machine welcomes you with a neat menu interface, a            construction of animated clock-cogs and golden rectangular menu            buttons which makes it easy to manipulate.                    From the menu you can change video resolution up to a maximum of            1600x1200, and I do recommend you try this. Even with my lowly Riva            TNT2 the game still pumped out smoothly at this resolution! Audio            and keyboard configuration can also be altered here. An option that            is sadly lacking however is the ability to use a joypad of any            sort. There aren't a lot of keys to memorise though, so keyboard            play isn't too much of a hardship.                    Finally you can load and save games through the interface, with a            maximum of twelve slots available. A picture pops up in the middle            of the interface to show you the stage you were at the time of            saving. Useful if, like me, you give totally meaningless names to            your save games!         You begin the game in a            side street, with empty pockets and no clue as to what you should            do. In front of you is a crystal Nautilus, which you need to pick            up, as the spiral shell acts as your inventory selector. It also            shows your energy level via the internal spiral, and the amount of            ~Jad Garrul~ you have in the outer spiral. Jad Gurrul allows you to            cast spells, and if this runs out you will need to top it up again            soon.                    Further exploration will take you out into a street blocked by a            cart, and a small market square. It certainly has you draw breathe            in admiration - the world you are walking around is full of people,            and you can press your 'use' key to speak to any of them if you            wish.                    Most you will find don't have much time to speak with you, but some            will offer you valuable clues and suggestions that will help you            understand what to do next. You will find old people stooped over            and shuffling along, young children wandering around, sometimes            alone, sometimes accompanied by an adult. People stand in the            streets chatting, others go about their business.                    The population of the city really gives a believable setting. You            can quite believe that these people have done what they are doing            for years. Their ways and methods are far different to what Herbert            is used to though, with the main confusion starting with why they            are so obsessed with time.                    You will soon learn that time is everything in this game. You won't            have travelled very far before you experience the first temporal            wave ripping through the city, and when it has passed you will have            turned into a child. But whereas the inhabitants have all lost            their memories, yours remains intact...         Of course, like any            game, you have enemies to contend with. The city guards will be            quite happy for you to roam the streets in the beginning, but            further down the line you won't be able to breathe without one of            them firing on you!                    As an Effahid (child) you are not well liked by some of the guards.            Being small does have its advantages though, as you will discover.            You will also be turned from Effahid to Vissahid (old man) later in            the game, and back to your normal self. All very disconcerting...                    The temporal waves themselves are a joy to watch. A big wave of            blue light sweeps ominously across the lands, reverting anything in            its path from youth to old age to middle age again. The sound the            wave makes is like a hurricane, and sounds excellent with the            volume cranked up!         The key to            your progression within the game is to learn about the Shekandar            monks, and (with their help) to awaken your chronomantic powers.            These spells are learnt inside Chronomantic Spheres, which look            small from the outside but each contain a vast cavern.                    Spells are shown as floating crystals, radiating a cool blue.            Simply touch one of these spells and you will learn it. The sphere            also enables you to practice your spell casting without any            detriment to your Jad Gurrul. A key toggles between normal combat            and spell modes, and when in spell mode the icon for the spell you            currently have selected will appear to the right of your energy            indicator. Simply press the action key to launch the spell at your            enemy.                    Perhaps the most clever of the spells is Slow Motion, which            actually causes yourself or your enemy to slow, while the whole            world carries on around you. Other spells allow you to shield            yourself against magic and attacks. You can also freeze enemies, or            drive them insane with the song of the Mermaids of Time. Don't ask!         It's not all magic and            wizardry though. In fact, the first sort of weapon you will come            across is the Wrist Jadgar. This is the weapon of choice for the            guards, and fires out a blue bolt which can take the enemy down            with four or five shots. You will find the higher priests later on            will take more than the Jadgar to take down though.                    The only other weapon I managed to find is the Chronophore, a            weapon of pure chronomantic power. This little baby fires out            bright green bolts, and makes mincemeat out of the opposition.            There may well be other weapons in the game that I have not            discovered, as there are a few secrets and sub-missions to be            discovered.                    The combat system is not the best in the world though. A lot of the            time you just cannot see the enemy you are fighting. Getting too            close in on the more powerful Priests or Lemurs is a painful            exercise, so the need for keeping your distance is paramount. This            often forces you to fire at an enemy off-screen, hoping you are            making an impact.                    Sometimes you will find that an enemy can quite happily fire at you            from his vantagepoint, but you can't fire back, merely hitting the            parapet the enemy is standing in. Not funny, especially when you            have little or no health to risk close combat.         Saving the            best for last... The location graphics in the game are simply            breathtaking. Although the locations are the usual pre-rendered            backdrops, a rotational system is employed to make them wrap and            rotate around the main character. The 3D effect this produces is            remarkable.                    The characters themselves are 3D real time rendered, and blend in            nicely with the backgrounds. Animation is a little on the rigid            side, with some of the characters walking more like robots than            people. The whole look and variety of the models more than makes up            for this though.                    A lot of the location graphics also need fine-tuning. Although they            look splendid, you will often see blocky groups of pixels on the            exterior of the main graphic. This is particularly noticeable when            a character walks behind part of a location.                    The soundtrack to The Time Machine is perhaps one of the most            original I've heard. Mixing all sorts of styles together, the            composers have created a unique blend. I can only describe it all            as a little bit of Chinese, a hint of Indian, and a smattering of            New Age style. The result is a mysterious set of tunes, which            compliment the equally mysterious game perfectly.                    Unfortunately it's not all good news though - the voice acting is            woeful to say the least. Things start out okay, with Herbert's            voice being perhaps the only reasonable effort, but Herbert as a            child sounds like the adult voice has been used again with the            pitch ramped up. I may be wrong here, but helium balloons spring to            mind...                    The old women sound remarkably like the wicked Witch of the North            from the Wizard Of Oz, while the evil Tetradon Logor Shar doesn't            sound evil at all, sounding more like something from Doctor Who.            They all speak so slowly too. Fortunately it is all subtitled            though, so you can always read ahead and skip on to the next bit,            although some scenes just can't be skipped. Gah!         The Time Machine had me            glued to my seat from start to finish. That in itself gets the game            a merit. Graphically it is possibly the finest 3D adventure to            grace my PC yet. With an original soundtrack accompanying it all,            the whole game oozes atmosphere.                    Some will find the puzzles in the game a little too far fetched,            but in the main they are logical and well thought out. The biggest            problem I found was actually knowing what to do next! You don't            have a nice friendly arrow pointing at the next person you should            speak with, or the next object you should collect. You're very much            on your own! The combat system is a little messy, and can result in            frequent visits to the ~Game Over~ animation. The variety of spells            at your disposal makes up for this though, allowing you to perform            some nasty combinations.                    But perhaps what stands out most of all is the brilliant story that            unravels before your eyes. From start to finish it encapsulates you            and never lets go. The game also boasts one of the finest end            sequences to a game I've seen in a long while. Have you ever had            one of those situations where you sit staring at the end credits in            awe of what you've just experienced? The Time Machine certainly had            that effect on me.                        Try before you buy! Download the (French language only!)                        Time Machine demo (165Mb)"}
