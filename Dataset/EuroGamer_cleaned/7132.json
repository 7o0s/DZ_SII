This would be all well and good from their perspective, except                 that nobody on Earth is terribly pleased about it. In a way                 you can feel their pain.                    Above the Earth orbits The Jim Dandy, spaceship home of Dr. Fluke            Hawkins, his janitor Kurt, and his homemade six-legged hound, Max.            Having saved the world from the villainous alien leader Gunta Glut            in MDK, Kurt and company are now thrown back into the fray to            destroy yet more alien minecrawlers.                    Storytelling takes place in game with often-hilarious cutscenes            featuring the crazy trio. The voice acting is a little suspect at            times, but on the whole passable. The humour also begs question at            times. This was one area in which you could never fault Shiny, the            company behind the original MDK. Dave Perry always knew his sharp            English humour, but it seems that Bioware do not, as some of the            jokes simply don't raise a smile. I actually cringed on occasion.                    But apart from the occasionally poor sense of humour, Bioware have            done a sterling job of continuing the MDK legacy, so you can wipe            that tear from your eye...         If you have played the original MDK as much as I                 have, starting out in MDK2 will feel very comfortable. Don't                 make the mistake of thinking that there won't be more advanced                 things for you to learn though - I made the mistake of dashing                 off without listening to the Doctor's brief tutorial, and                 eventually was forced to come back in order to work out the                 answer to a puzzle later on.                    Bioware have done a good job of sustaining the feel of the MDK            world in that the visual style looks almost exactly the same. Due            to the authenticity of the textures and the detail on Kurt's            bodysuit, you feel immersed in the MDK universe.                    Of course, the graphics themselves have been vastly improved, and            if you reload MDK to compare them, garish pixellations and jagged            single polygon platforms will meet you. It's quite amusing to see            how the original game has aged and been reborn.                    MDK2 takes full advantage of lots of new technologies such as            hardware accelerated Transform & Lighting, which has been            causing a sustained buzz in the industry of late. The colours are            vivid and lighting atmospheric, and the real time reflections in            the ground as little Kurt wafts around the enormous chasms and            halls are simply breathtaking.         Fans of the original MDK will remember the                 freefall parachute sequence at the beginning of each                 minecrawler sequence, and this returns in MDK2. You now glide                 in at an angle to meet the crawler, while being shot at by the                 usual laser beams and heat-seeking rockets. Using the cursor                 keys or mouse to dodge these is good fun, but by the last few                 levels it can become a little tedious.                    The sniper scope, one of the original game's major innovations,            returns with a vengeance. Selecting the scope pops up a new screen            with a zoomable view and a selection of different bullets,            including mortars and other popular weapons from the previous game.            The ability to take out opponents from a mile away from their            positions is fun and important to the overall sense of scale,            although not all of the levels depend on your use of this ingenious            firearm.                    That's largely because you can now also play as the Doctor and Max!            Both have similar controls to Kurt, but due to the lack of the            sniper scope the style of play differs greatly, which brings some            much-needed variety to the rather linear gameplay.                    With the Doctor, you have unique control over both his hands, and            by picking up and combining certain items you can create mass            destruction. Hardly an action man, but nevertheless a devastating            source of explosives and carnage if you use him right. The same can            be said of Max - he can simultaneously hold up to four weapons, and            still have room for his customary Cuban cigar!         Otherwise MDK2 takes on the same basic style of                 play as the original game, presenting you with several                 enormous arenas, each consisting of a disguised puzzle or                 challenge, connected by claustrophobic walkways and tunnels.                    This is acceptable because the game is so entertaining, and finding            the solution to the puzzle is very satisfying, often requiring some            pretty lateral thinking. It's a pleasant blend of challenging            puzzles, exciting, intense gameplay, and creative use of your            inventory. With new items accompanying the old favourites, and a            larger spiel to help out Max and Dr. Hawkins, there is always a            solution hiding somewhere. As with the original, it's very linear,            but who cares!                    And, as with the original, the soundtrack complements the action            perfectly. As I played through MDK2 my mind wasn't on the soothing            tunes playing in the background, but I would rather they remained.            A far cry from the booming rock music that accompanies the menu            system, which, just to put the icing on the cake, is wonderful.         With so many interesting things to do and unique                 puzzle-driven gameplay, the fact that it still harbours a                 linear style of play can be discounted to a certain extent.                    Reinvigorate your childhood fantasies of living in a cartoon and            pick up MDK2 - there ain't much better in the genre."}
