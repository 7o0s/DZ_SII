You've come            to the right place. Nali sympathiser? You'll enjoy this. But before            we head inside, let me ask you a question: just what do you want            from Unreal II? Because if you know what you want, I can give you a            buying decision right now. It's very simple. Are you an FPS fan who            just wants another enjoyable, well-rounded Shooter in the sci-fi            vein? Great stuff. Turn yourself around, and enjoy our            complimentary plane-ride home. You can buy the game tomorrow. By            the way, your in-flight entertainment is a choice of Return to            Castle Wolfenstein, Soldier Of Fortune II: Double Helix and Jedi            Knight II\u2026                    I see that many of you connoisseurs are still with us. Indeed,            those of you with slightly higher expectations should continue on            to the auditorium, where we will make our address. And make            yourselves comfortable - we get the feeling Colin Powell's job was            probably easier than this one.        Unreal II begins with deceptive simplicity - as Marshal John            Dalton arrives on Odyssey IV for his latest briefing. The planet is            a lush, green world and the Terran Colonial Authority (TCA) outpost            is suspended several hundred metres above a sunny peninsula. It's            here that Dalton learns that his new pilot is a Hex-Core alien            called Ne'Ban, that he will not be reinstated to the Marine Corps,            and that he can either get on with his patrols or head downstairs            for some training, or take the unspoken third option of throwing            himself into the sea.                    Faced with this, we left the command tower - a basic structure            rimmed with console banks and serviced by an odd-looking alien, the            likes of which we've seen in Shooters as old as Deus Ex and Quake            II - for all the world grief-stricken at the banality of the whole            thing. Where is the gripping, pivotal event which should shake            John's life and inject some intrigue? Where is the Unreal we've            been missing? However it was then that we went outside and lent            over the balcony, and the view hit us. Bloody hell this Unreal II            technology is good looking.                    It's a theme that runs throughout Unreal II, which gradually picks            up in a predictable manner. Once you've wiped from your face the            admiration at the sheer draw distance, the waves lapping up the            shore and the incredibly detailed character models of the two            marines guarding the elevator in the foreground of this            serene vista, you get on with things much as you'd expect.                    Heading downstairs to the training room, you're treated to basic            jump/crouch initiation and a training course - during which you're            taught that you can clamber up tall crates (unassailable in the            eyes of modern FPS convention) by holding space instead of tapping            it, that your HUD and health system are Halo-esque with a weak            shield bar protecting your actual health, that you can absorb            shield energy from dispatched enemies, and how some of the game's            weapons function. After this, you're given a very brief and very            easy deathmatch runabout by your instructor, whose repertoire            includes ~we've been waiting ages for this tech upgrade~ and an            in-joke about CTF.        From here you head back to your ship, the Atlantis, which will            serve as the hub of your various activities over the course of The            Awakening, tooling you up with weapons and fleshing out the            details. It's here you meet your pointlessly well-endowed but            gravely spoken female first officer Aida, disgraced, chain-smoking            technician Izaak and your Hex-Core pilot Ne'Ban, whose deliberately            broken English is a source of light humour between briefings.            Ne'Ban is a useful tool for the developer, because in explaining            the current galactic situation to him, John can also introduce            us to the concepts at work.                    The Atlantis is another demonstration of the beauty of Unreal II.            It is effectively a couple of stacked round hallways with sleeping            quarters, a storage/armoury room, a briefing room, Ne'Ban's bridge            and your little shuttle's hangar, and a ladder connecting the two            levels, but through the magnificence of the game engine it's            transformed into a Giger-esque monstrosity - reflections beam from            every console and sheet of metal, gangways of gratings clink            beneath your feet and pipes, exposed system boards and technology            flashes at you from all directions, as the shadows plunge much of            your surroundings into hazy darkness - even the fairly hammered            locker doors glint realistically.                    Incidental detail fills the gaps with everything from a            multi-tiered alien chess set, a holographic projector in the            briefing room and Windows-style operating systems on each computer            console to the wobble of Aida's rear-end and the various prosthetic            gizmos sticking out of Izaak - not to mention the wispy smoke            billowing from his cigarette. On a related note, smoke in Unreal II            can be affected by explosions, fans and just about anything else -            a totally unnecessary but helpfully immersive little touch.                    Given the clearly jaw-dropping graphics engine, a selection of well            lip-synched and potentially deep (albeit clich\u00e9d) characters            and a tale of forgotten glory lapsed into marshaldom, we were left            expecting great things. This low-key opening had enough surprises            and unanswered questions to leave us excited - and if the game            could blossom into a Shooter worthy of the name Unreal,            encompassing all the atmosphere, intelligent, varied design and            cinematic cunning that the name demands, then we knew we'd be            singing the game's praises for years to come.        At the end of the first of the game's twelve main missions            though, we knew that we wouldn't. Sanctuary, the fifth planet in            the Elara system plays host to a Liandri mining facility, the            briefing told us. And of course all we've heard from them is a            distress signal. ~Aliens, anyone?~ we muttered, only to have our            suspicions confirmed.                    To begin with, there's an Alien/Unreal-esque reluctance to show us            an enemy. As with the original, you catch fleeting glimpses of an            unknown threat, which seems to move quickly and kill rather messily            - the bodies, impaled heads and limbs strewn about the place speak            volumes. Miners screaming for help are dragged Half-Life-style            beneath closing doors as blood splatters the floor, and on the            whole the suspense is successfully built - not least thanks to the            music. You clutch your machine gun tightly and wander deeper as            Aida voices her ~bad feeling~ concerns over the radio. Then you            encounter the enemy and it's\u2026 a blue monkey with a stick. A            few machine gun rounds later and you wonder what all the fuss was            about.                    Later in the same level, the developer recycles the same            suspense-building trick, only this time in a darkened elevator with            a fiend-like Skaarj enemy, which moves quickly and absorbs more            ammo. The rest of the level has you fighting swathes of blue            monkeys and the occasional Skaarj as you try to reach one last,            surviving miner in the depths of the facility. The level culminates            in a jumping puzzle and a boss encounter, with a slow-moving            monster whose quickfire blobs will kill you almost instantly unless            you keep backing away out of sight between shots.                    Is that it?        It really is! Of course you can't fault the composition. The            worlds of Unreal II are exquisitely detailed and beautiful, from            the metallic, sci-fi templated installation-style of the Sanctuary            and the immense weapons research facility on the snowy desert rock            called Hell, to the lightning-lit, soggy, marshy swamp soiree as            you wait to be rescued from waves of onrushing aliens, and the            throbbing might of a planet-wrapping monster, with a Sarlaac-esque            opening to the misty depths of its Xen-inspired interior.                    Everything is drenched in detail and every sci-fi clich\u00e9 from            as far back as we can remember is in there. Electronic forcefield            type shield walls, which can be used to block entrances? Check.            Automatic sentry guns, which are used both for and against the            player? Check. Ventilation systems packed with legions of pesky            little ~make you jump~ critters? Check. Fiery obstacles, which have            to be rerouted via switch hunting antics? Check. Rooms full of            laser beams, which have to be navigated in order to reach the ~off~            button? Check. Being held captive in a corridor with guns trained            on you while a companion ~hacks the security~? Check.                    There's almost no limit to the amount of sci-fi type scenarios            Legend can pack into a level - it's just there's virtually no sense            of imagination whatsoever! The best moments are all down to the            technology - a huge sleeping alien to be tiptoed past on a bridge,            which will stomp after you (particularly since you dispatched its            baby) if you wake it up; the body of a scientist smothered in flame            as it's char grilled by a leaky plasma stream; and mainly the flame            thrower weapon. There are standout moments in the game, like            marines using rocket launchers to try and snag you with splash            damage, and spiders which leap into the air and land on you to            fearsome effect, but there's almost nothing you haven't seen            before at one time or another. Yes, in fairness it does end on a            high with a few excellent levels, but it doesn't even play like the            original Unreal, really. It just doesn't.        Unreal II really is what we love to call a flawed masterpiece.            There's so much that's done well but so much which counters it to            its doom - like the weapons. At about 15 in total there are simply            too many, and they claw to convention like a headcrab. There's the            basic pistol - totally and literally useless. I've fired it, um,            twice, mostly to admire its alt-fire animation. Then there's the            machine gun - straight out of Halo, except with a Flak Cannon style            alt-fire. The shotgun - satisfying and crunchy, sprays at a            distance and runs out of ammo fast. The grenade launcher - with            loads of alternate ammunition types that will come in useful on a            per-mission basis. The alien shock lance - an ASMD Core. The            flamethrower - a tired but satisfying clich\u00e9, which works best            on a visual level. The magnum style pistol. The this. The that.            It's all so very familiar.                    And how about your mission objectives? Find out why contact was            lost. Find this alien artifact before [insert corporation/alien            race] does. Find out what's causing the spiders to become huge and            stompy. And how about the story? Find the seven sacred artefacts.            Get reinstated to the Marines. Blah blah. I won't spoil it, but to            be honest, you won't remember it when you get to the other end of            your next FPS adventure. You'll just go ~ah!~ in all the right            places and, if you're used to this sort of thing, soak it up with a            sort of sleepy disinterest.                    It's not just clich\u00e9s which conspire to damage Unreal II            either. There are actual problems. Invisible walls pop up now and            again, as do clipping issues (particularly when a scripted ally is            following you and wants to make use of a door at the same time as            you), and other than the bot-style marines, enemy AI is as basic as            you can get. Enemies either line up to be shot, stand around for a            few seconds kindly giving you an angle before leaping up to get you            (spider) or slashing you like an incensed cheetah (Skaarj) or            spitting out more enemies (alien blob thing) or, or, or.                    Perhaps the biggest problem though is something which you're just            going to have to grin and bear. With all its sumptuous detail            enabled, Unreal II sucks up a lot of processing and graphical            power, and you'll need a top-end rig to really enjoy it. Our 1.8GHz            Athlon XP and Radeon 9700 PRO coped as you might expect, but there            was slowdown in combat and hesitation in loading scenes and            so on, and we could drag it down to single figure frame rates in            certain areas. Switch things off and it becomes clear that without            its beautiful exterior, Unreal II doesn't boil down to a great            deal. It's a very visual experience and you want to have the tech            to do it justice.                    At the end of the day, the overriding feeling when you play Unreal            II is just one of ambivalence - it's the same quick save/quick load            dynamic with all the same destinations, enemies, stories and screen            clutter, and you know you're going to play it through to completion            because it's not hard, it's no more than 10 hours' work, it's            nothing you haven't done before and it looks really good. But if            you plan to buy Unreal II, don't be fooled - like Halo before it            it's a wonderful amalgamation of sci-fi FPS principles, but what we            wanted was an exceptionally well-rounded sci-fi shooter which broke            the mould. In this regard, the only mould Legend have broken is            Unreal's.                    It's a bone of contention between myself and many of my PC gaming            associates (you know who you are), but I believe that the original            Unreal was a genuine milestone in First Person Shooter gaming. The            graphics were a revolutionary leap over anything that was being            done by any other company at the time, the level and creature            design was stunning and perhaps most importantly, the game had more            atmosphere than most gas giants - with stunning scripted sequences,            a magnificently conceived alien world, mysterious natives, savage            invading Skaarj enemies and hauntingly wonderful music.                    Okay, so the game lost its way fairly regularly, with certain            aspects of it being below par. The weapons, for example, were            recently described to me as being poorer than those found in the            reviled Half-Life Paintball; the final levels fizzled out rather            than leading to any kind of crescendo; and the constant promise of            meeting up with other survivors was disappointingly not to be.            However, the game was a masterpiece regardless, even if it was a            flawed one.        That's why I had such high expectations of Unreal II; and that,            perhaps, is why I'm ultimately so disappointed with it. The first            game broke free of many of the conventions of the FPS genre at the            time, whereas this sequel, for all its promise, seems only too            happy to conform tightly to every clich\u00e9 and stereotype it can            find. We had all hoped that the solely single-player focus of the            team making the game would create something rather special; sadly,            this was not to be.                    This isn't to say that some aspects of the game aren't rather            special in themselves - most notably the graphics, which put just            about every other PC game ever made to shame. Even Halo doesn't            have a patch on some of the graphical trickery Unreal II has up its            sleeve, and the engine is equally at home rendering claustrophobic            tunnels and lush jungles. Eye candy is the order of the day; it's            one of those rare games, like its predecessor, which will have you            stopping every now and then just to admire the view.        Unfortunately for fans of the first game, the team at Legend            seem to have ripped up the book where everything other than the            visuals of the game is concerned. Gone is the lush world of Na Pali            with its mysterious natives, floating cities, homely villages and            ancient temples; gone are the delicately constructed side stories            and the narrative flow of the whole game. Instead, we've got a            balls-out action game set on a variety of one-dimensional worlds            populated by blokes in massive power-suits, big-breasted tactical            officers and giant spiders, and armed with all the subtlety of a            boot to the head.                    Even the enemies have changed for the worse; although the sections            where you fight enemy human marines and mercenaries are interesting            enough in themselves, the sections featuring the Skaarj are            downright poor. Whereas in Unreal, the Skaarj were sleek, fast and            fearsome, in this they have been redesigned as lumbering beasts            with a clumsy lunge attack - built like an, er, outside toilet, but            not very scary and certainly not very clever.                    Unreal II is a wasted opportunity. This is a game which could have            taken the triumphs of the original and built something wonderful            out of them; instead, it's taken little but its graphical style            from the original, and has built a clich\u00e9-loving FPS title            that desperately wants to be Halo but isn't quite up to standard.            The graphics are very lovely indeed, and there are some nice            moments, but the gameplay practically defines middle of the road.            Enjoyable for an FPS junkie, certainly, but it's impossible to play            it without thinking of how much more it could have been."}
