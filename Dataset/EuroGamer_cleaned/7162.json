Their Organic Art packages created a seed and then produced several            random mutations based on it. The user would then select one or            more of the mutated forms that popped out, breed them to produce            another generation, and so on. The end result of this un-natural            selection was a kind of living digital sculpture that looked like            some bizarre prehistoric life-form.                    The basic idea behind their first game, Evolva, is much the same.            You start with a squad of four ~genohunters~, warriors capable of            absorbing DNA from their enemies to gain their abilities. To do            this you simply absorb the meaty ~gibs~ that are left behind when            you have dismembered the carcass of another creature, and then go            to the mutator screen.                    Here you will see the current abilities of the selected genohunter.            Hit the ~mutate~ button and two random variations are created,            increasing some of their abilities while reducing others. Once you            have found a combination that you are happy with, select it and the            hunter will mutate to match it.                    You can mutate each of your characters hundreds of times during the            course of the game, and the sheer wealth of possibilities is            incredible - you can create literally millions of different            variations, and no two players will end the game with the same team            of genohunters.                    You can mutate genohunters to make them run faster, jump higher,            become invisible for short periods of time, develop thicker hides,            hurl explosive spores, grow savage claws, breathe fire, discharge            electricity, and drop little creatures that scurry along the ground            and throw themselves at the nearest enemy, somewhat reminiscent of            the headcrabs from Half-Life...         At its heart though, Evolva                 is a squad combat game. The single player campaign consists of                 a series of twelve missions, most of them with two or three                 different objectives.                    That might not sound like a lot to the uniniated, but the missions            are set in vast sprawling levels full of tunnels and caves, cliffs,            canyons, vast open spaces, bizarre alien vegetation, and hordes of            hostile life forms just waiting to rip you to pieces. Most of the            missions will take you an hour or more to complete, and the game            should keep you busy for a week or two at least.                    At any particular time you control one of your genohunters from a            third person perspective, and the rest can then be ordered to            either stay where they are or follow you around and assist you in            combat. To help you keep track of where everybody is, you can see            the view from each of your squad mates in a line of little windows            along the bottom of the screen.                    There is also an easy to use command system that lets you order            other members of your squad to recover items, attack a particular            creature, or move to another location. In the heat of combat it can            be hard to keep things under control though, as you are often            jumped by dozens of hostiles at once.                    Battle scenes look like something out of Starship Troopers, and by            the end of the game hordes of aliens will be flocking towards you,            while others lob explosive spores at you from a distance, or send            plumes of flame billowing towards you.         When you do find time to catch your                 breath and admire the scenery though, you will find that                 Evolva is one of the most beautiful games released so far this                 year.                    The alien parasite which you are fighting looks like it has escaped            from an HR Giger painting, made up of vast tentacles that penetrate            the surface of the planet and spread over entire continents.            Combined with the colourful and curvaceous landscape, bizarre            indigenous life-forms, and towering alien plant life, it makes an            unique setting for the game.                    The creatures that inhabit it are also highly detailed, well            animated, and imaginatively designed. The game's graphics engine            does well to keep entire herds of them in view at once while fire,            lightning, and vast explosions light the scene. Even on a            relatively lowly Pentium II the game runs fairly smoothly, and my            new Pentium III 600 handles even the highest detail setting almost            effortlessly.                    For those of you with the latest graphics hardware though, Evolva            supports transform and lighting acceleration, and a patch will soon            be available to add support for the new GeForce 2 GTS and its            per-pixel effects, which will make the game look even more            detailed.         Of course, without solid                 gameplay you just have a fancy graphics demo, and luckily                 Evolva scores highly here as well, although there are a few                 slight niggles...                    The artificial intelligence is mostly excellent, and you get a real            feeling of being in a living world as you watch your enemies flock            and hunt the indigenous life forms. Sometimes your squad mates will            get stuck on the terrain, wander into the line of fire of an enemy,            or fall off a ledge into some lava and die, but generally they do a            good job of following you wherever you go and helping you out in            combat.                    The mutation system is basically just a replacement for the            traditional experience points, ability scores and skills, but the            way it is integrated into the game and its plot helps make the game            that bit more involving, and there is something strangely enjoyable            about mutating your characters and watching as their attributes and            appearances change throughout the game.                    The missions mostly devolve into ~kill all the bad guys, blow stuff            up, and get to the exit~, but there is enough variation here to            keep things interesting most of the time. For example, in one of            the early missions you have to defend the indigenous life forms and            make sure that a certain percentage of them survive an alien            attack.                    Some of the missions can get a little tedious though, mostly            because the levels are a little too vast and sprawling at            times. Without a map it is easy to lose track of where you are, and            the sheer scale of the levels can be intimidating, although there            is a compass to show you the way to your main objective and your            squad mates.                    Often you can take advantage of this expansive terrain to help you            in battle though, and it pays to use your brain. You can lure            enemies into the line of fire of some of the more dangerous native            plants, hold them off in a narrow tunnel or canyon, or get them to            chase you across a slippery surface and then watch as they slide            helplessly over the edge of a cliff.                    Even so, the game is still damned hard! If you are a hardcore            action gamer looking for a new challenge, this is obviously a good            thing. But for the casual gamer it makes for a pretty daunting            experience, as even on ~Easy~ skill level you will find yourself            dying regularly. A ~Really Easy~ skill level would have been            welcome...         Thanks to its difficulty, Evolva gets a little                 frustrating at times, and can devolve into rapid fire use of                 the quick save and quick load buttons if you are feeling                 impatient.                    But there's no denying that this is a classic game, marrying            beautiful graphics and an imaginative alien setting with solid            gameplay and some unique new ideas. Not for the faint of heart, but            highly recommended if you have the patience and skill to take it            on..."}
