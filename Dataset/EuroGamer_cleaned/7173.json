The Allies                 had by then regained most of Europe, and were beginning to                 engage the retreating German army on their own soil.                    The confident American troops stationed in the Ardennes where            completely unprepared for any kind of aggressive action, and were            taken by surprise by a massive German strike force which vastly            outnumbered them. This successful German strike drove the Allied            forces back and came to form a large pocket of German territory            inside the allied lines, the so called Bulge.                    Close Combat IV: The Battle of the Bulge gives you the choice of            fighting this epic struggle from either side. As the Allies your            objective is to contain the German invasion and hold fast for the            incoming reinforcements to arrive. The German objective is to            continue the momentum forward and break through the Allied            defenses.         This is a real time strategy game,                 but unlike most such games, the Close Combat series emphasises                 realism and authenticity. This is no fantasy war - the battles                 are based on actual historical conflicts, and the longer                 campaigns in Close Combat IV are taken from the real situation                 in the Ardennes during the final months of the Second World                 War.                    More importantly, the authenticity also extends to the troops under            your control as the overall commander. The men have feelings that            must be taken into consideration as you plan your conflicts - if            they are tired they won't be able to run, if they feel scared they            will hide.                    This makes it impossible to use the tank rush ~strategies~ that are            common in less realistic games like the Command & Conquer            series, as if you throw your men repeatedly to the slaughter they            will quickly realise the folly in your tactics and run for their            lives. This throws the emphasis more on planning safe and            successful attacks rather than resource management, and makes for a            highly intense strategic experience.                    From the opening menu you are given the choice of tutorial            missions, a single battle and operations, a more involved long term            campaign mode, and a multiplayer option.                    The tutorial boot-camps are effective at teaching you the simple            point and click interface, and go on to teach some basic strategy            techniques together with some hints on the best use of the units            available in battle. They only scratch the surface however - there            is a massive range of units and tactics supplied, so reading the            sixty page manual is essential if you are to become a successful            commander.                    The single battles are fun recreations of actual scenarios, albeit            with the actual numbers of men involved reduced to fit with the            squad based game engine. There's also about a dozen or so            operations available for when you tire of the single battles. These            have an objective set across a number of battles, but this is            really just an introduction to the meat of the game, the fabulous            campaign mode.         This section of the game puts you not                 only in control of the actual skirmishes, but also makes you                 responsible for the overall direction of the fight for the                 Bulge.                    Most of this management is completed on the campaign map, a            representation of the Ardennes area broken up into strategic            sections that represent each battle map. Consideration must be            given not only for your advancing position, but also your supply            and transportation system. Key strategic positions for chain of            supply such as crossroads are vitally important, and must be            protected at all costs.                    Battles on the strategic map are turn based - you complete each of            the outstanding fights in sequence, the game takes a turn, and you            get a picture of the overall impact of each of your skirmishes.            It's a very well thought out system, and gives you a real feeling            that you're influencing the outcome of the campaign with each            battle won or lost.                    The actual battles themselves are incredibly intense and exciting.            The realistic theme is continued throughout, and the enemy can only            be spotted and targeted when in the line of sight of your units, so            you must attempt to anticipate the position and tactics of the            enemy. A long and considered attack on a farmhouse involving            several precious units could reveal it to be empty of enemy forces,            but you won't really know until the strike is complete.         Extreme care must be                 taken to protect your units as they advance, so there are                 plenty of options for conducting tactical movements.                    Smoke can be used by both armored units and infantry to make            advancing under enemy fire safer. Several types of movement are            available, ranging from fast and careless running, to very slow and            alert sneaking. Standard military tactics such as suppressive fire            and flanking are vitally important for a successful battle.                    The artificial intelligence of your troops is such that should            things go pear shaped, they will try their hardest to keep            themselves alive until you can issue new orders. This impressive            intelligence also makes life very difficult, as if you foolishly            leave a unit exposed to enemy attack it will be eliminated very            quickly.                    There are a few annoying faults unfortunately. The visuals aren't            spectacular but they represent the battles clearly, although after            several battles on the same area the scene becomes cluttered and            confused.                    The attacking AI of the computer controlled side seems a bit dimmer            than when it's defending, and the pathing on the maps can            occasionally frustrate you, especially with the tanks and armored            units. None of these problems renders the game unplayable though,            and with long term play you come to learn these faults and plan            around them.         Fans of the Close                 Combat series will lap this game up, and it's a very worthy                 follow-up to it's popular predecessors. Strategists new to the                 series should definitely give Close Combat IV a try too - the                 extra realism makes for a very refreshing change from other                 RTS titles, although it has to be said it makes the game a lot                 more challenging.                    Give it a go if you think you're hard enough."}
