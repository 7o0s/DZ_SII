The past is a nice place to visit at this time of the year, but, like a bumbling old relative, you can only spend so much time in its company before wanting to pop your eyes out with a spoon.But then a game like Heavy Weapon turns up on Live Arcade and reminds you that old fashioned gaming values don't have to be treated like a dotty old nan going on about The Good Old Days in her sleep. Instead, those so-called classic gameplay ingredients can be spiced up and mixed in a way that makes then, in some senses, much more palatable than they ever were in those fabled Days of Old Good.Rather than tell you that Heavy Weapon is like a preposterously frantic Moon Patrol with that beloved dual-stick Robotron control system strapped to its underbelly, here are five good reasons why Heavy Weapon is my favourite New Old Shooter since Geometry Wars, in no particular order.And, if those weren't good enough reasons to like Heavy Weapon, it also won us over for being really good value. For 800 points, it's a game that more than justifies its price tag for the mission mode alone. The other Survival-based modes (War Party and Arms Race) feel comparatively throwaway played alone, but in multiplayer (off or online for up to four players) it's a decent amount of blasting fun for a few minutes. The main difference between the two Survival modes is that War Party lets you respawn as long as someone else is still alive, while Arms Race grants you three lives only - the winner being the one with the best score. It's not nearly as compelling as the missions, but with the leaderboard scores to compete on, it's a worthwhile addition to an already solid package. As an added bonus, completion of the game also adds Boss Rush mode, so you can face-off against all 19 of them in order, but getting that far will be a real effort for mere mortals. At a push, you could moan about how easy some of the boss monsters are, and dismiss it as a pretty repetitive experience, but there's a lot to love about Heavy Weapon. It might not appear as hardcore as something like Geometry Wars, but some of the later levels might change your mind - and if you prefer the endless wave approach of GW, then survival mode does the job there too. So, as much as you might not be thrilled about the prospect of a 2D scrolling tank shooter, Heavy Weapon is far better than it initially appears to be. As an example of how to bring the past up to date, it's one of the best examples on Live to date and definitely one to check out in the shivering January wasteland."}
