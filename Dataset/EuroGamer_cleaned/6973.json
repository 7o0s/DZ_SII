What sets Cossacks apart is its epic scope. There is a sprawling            tech tree to research with literally hundreds of upgrades and            technologies to discover, ranging from improved armour and weapons            for your various troop types to reconnaissance balloons. There are            no less than 16 seperate nationalities to play as, ranging from            England and France to Saxony and the Ukraine, many of them with            their own unique units and graphics. Perhaps most impressive though            is the ability to have anything up to eight thousand            soldiers in a single battle without any serious slow downs.                    Needless to say this can make things pretty hectic at times, and            luckily the mouse-driven interface is simplicity itself, with all            the niceties you would expect from a modern real-time strategy            game. Troops can be set up to follow a series of waypoints, grouped            together into hotkey-selectable armies, and told to hold their fire            or attack everything they see on their way to their destination.            You can even assign them to line, column or square formations,            although unfortunately these are less useful than they should be as            they are rather clumsy to manoeuvre. And whereas in a hardcore            wargame being in a formation would give you some sort of defensive            or morale bonus, in Cossacks it doesn't seem to give any obvious            advantages, apart from looking pretty in screenshots.                    For those of you new to the genre or wanting to brush up on the            slight control differences between this and similar titles, there            is an entire tutorial campaign to ease you into the game and            introduce all the basic concepts. In addition to the tutorial there            are four ~real~ campaigns, varying from cleaning pirates out of the            Caribbean to battling your way across France or Eastern Europe. All            of this is (rather loosely) based on real European wars and            battles.                    These campaigns are at times incredibly difficult, often limiting            the units you can use or even sending you into battle with no way            of replenishing your lost troops, and then throwing hordes of            enemies at your ill-prepared and poorly balanced army. Some            missions are virtually impossible to complete, and will require you            to work out the right approach or even to rely on exploiting any            weaknesses you can find in the AI.                    Sadly these are all too common. Your opponent is surprisingly            passive unless it has been pre-scripted to attack you, and its            offensives are often rather piecemeal. You can usually find small            groups of enemy troops standing around doing nothing, and sometimes            they will continue to do nothing as you bombard them from a safe            distance with artillery or small arms fire, especially if they are            waiting for a trigger or timer in the mission script. They are also            easily tricked by simply opening and closing your city gates - as            the gates open the enemy rushes towards you, only to stop dead or            withdraw as you close them again. Well-placed cannons, defensive            towers or musketeers can gradually whittle away vastly superior            forces in this way, and in one of the campaign missions you are            actually advised to exploit this by an in-game message!                    If the campaigns are mostly too hard, the ten stand-alone scenarios            are too easy. At first they will prove a challenge, but as you            start to work out the weaknesses of the AI, which troops to use in            which situations and what order to construct buildings and research            techologies in, you will soon find that defeating the computer is            more a case of persistence than skill. On a level playing field the            AI simply isn't up to the job, and sadly this also makes random            skirmish games rather unrewarding for more experienced players.                    Overall the game seems to be fairly well balanced, using a            complicated kind of rock, paper and scissors relationship whereby            every troop type has its own strengths and vulnerabilities.            Defensive towers are devestating, especially against large            formations of infantry, but cannons and mortars have a longer            firing range and can destroy them without getting close enough for            the tower to respond. Cannons must be escorted by other soldiers            though, as fast-moving enemy cavalry could easily capture any            unprotected artillery. And so on. In fact the only good all-round            unit is the grenadier, which can use its rifle at medium range,            defend itself with a bayonet in melee, and use grenades to demolish            walls and towers at close range.                    In another nod to realism, terrain has a much greater effect on            gameplay in Cossacks than in most other real-time strategy games.            Walking uphill slows an army down and units on top of a plateau or            hill will have a slightly higher firing range than those below,            giving you more opportunity to annihilate any attacking infantry or            cavalry with musketeers and artillery. This means that occupying            the high ground is a highly effective strategy, and when combined            with towers on top of nearby hills and short lengths of wall to            link highland areas and prevent your enemy from getting on to them,            this can add a lot to your defences.                    Where these kinds of strategies really come into their own is the            multiplayer mode, which supports up to seven players in any single            battle. Getting into a game is easy thanks to a built-in server            browser and chat lobby, and the random map generator used for the            vast majority of internet games (as well as AI skirmishes) is            highly customisable, allowing you to decide everything from the            general layout of the battlefield (islands, continental, in-land            sea etc) to how rugged the terrain is and how common resources are.                    There are also several multiplayer-only historical battles which            you can re-enact online, with two armies fighting it out to achieve            their objectives in a preset map. Unfortunately very few people            seem to be willing to play these, and the sheer number of units            which you start with in some of them can prove a bit overwhelming.                    Overall the multiplayer mode is probably the most enjoyable way of            playing the game, although the sheer scale of the game can make            battles a little longwinded. Most players will ask for at least            half an hour of ~peace time~ at the beginning of every match,            during which you will not attack each other. Your first few battles            will probably end just minutes after this truce ends, as the enemy            overwhelms your pathetic defences. Once you know what you are doing            and can put up more of a fight though, battles can sometimes last            anything up to three or four hours, with anything up to an hour of            peace time at the beginning. If you or one of the other players is            disconnected half way through a battle due to lag (something which            every real-time strategy game suffers from to some extent) it can            obviously be rather frustrating.                    Cossacks is an excellent strategy game which is sadly somewhat            marred by its overly difficult campaigns and unimpressive enemy AI.            The single battle and random skirmish modes should prove            entertaining for less experienced gamers though, and the campaigns            will certainly challenge even real-time strategy veterans, even if            they were a bit too hard at times for my tastes.                    But multiplayer is the real strength of the game, and is well worth            a try if you have a decent internet connection and don't mind being            humiliated in your first few battles by the Germans, who have had a            few months head start on us with the game. You will also no doubt            be entertained by such great examples of Deutschlish as ~er hat            getimed out~ and ~ich bin ein mega newbie~ in the chat rooms..."}
