But it's fun for a            little while.                         That said, the game gets off to a bad start by presenting what is            surely an award-winning seven trademark and logo screens. Shortly            after your tea is finished brewing, the now infamous CG effigy of            Britney pops up and invites you to audition for her dancing            entourage. Admittedly she looks more like a very good waxwork            sculpture than anything else, and the voice actress attempting to            inject some authentic Britnage into proceedings fails to suppress            the southern drawl a couple of times, but otherwise it's Britney.            [I knew you'd get distracted. The game, Tom, write about the            game! -Ed]                         The main body of Britney's Dance Beat is given over to the            Audition section. You pick one of six characters (three extremely            camp blokes, two fanciable young lasses and a crazed black woman)            and take part in a series of ten auditions by tapping buttons in            time to the music. Five Britney tracks are included, and you play a            chunk of each for the first five auditions, before enduring a            complete recital of each for the final five. The tracks (Hit me            baby, Oops\u2026 I did it again, Stronger, Overprotected and Slave            4 U) are suitably infectious, and are ordered by tempo, which adds            some variation.                    As your character and a rival gyrate on-screen, you are expected to            keep an eye on a little radar in the bottom corner (nothing new            there) and tap the face and directional buttons as the pointer            highlights them in time to the beat. If you hit the beat, you get            either a ~Good~ or ~Perfect!~ rating for that beat and some points.            At first it's extremely forgiving, with the slow tempo of ~Hit me            baby~ and the lack of variation giving players the chance to string            beats together, and the fact that most of us will know the tunes            makes it all the more easy, but before long though, the player is            expected to utilise all the face buttons, the directional buttons,            and the two in sync, and the beats are ordered much closer            together. As a challenge though, this I could accept. But then            there's your adversary.                         Quite why auditions are being held in competing pairs is beyond            me, but they are, and if you or your opponent string a ten-button            combo together, the game 'messes' with the other player's radar,            changing required button presses at the last minute, moving them            around, and even doing both of the above and separating the            stacked directional and face buttons so as to completely confuse            you. By the end of the single player game (and with only five            shortish pop songs, it won't take too long), you are completely            overwhelmed and in no position to complete the tasks presented            (especially at the increased pace of the latter songs) without            playing through them repeatedly until you know the order. The order            and button requirements change from character to character of            course, negating anything you may recall of a level and so the            process is repeated ad nauseum.                    After a while, you are good enough to consistently string combos            together in multiples of ten (actually, your humble reviewer has            completed certain levels without missing a beat), but your opponent            can apparently compete, and since the outcome of the audition is            decided based on a yellow ~tug of war~ bar at the bottom of the            screen, he or she often manages to win thanks to completely inhuman            reactions.                         The points you amass from victories go towards your next backstage            pass, and this is where the game gets a bit daft. Your passes can            be used to unlock behind the scenes footage and ~immersive videos~.            The behind the scenes stuff is a collage of random footage from a            Britney tour with the young starlet being thrown around and all            sorts, but it lacks sound and is accompanied by some frankly awful            remixes of the main Britney tunes. Worse still are the ~immersive            videos~, which are actually just concert videos with a QuickTime            VR-style rotating camera. The footage is low-res, the sound quality            is slightly garbled, and the performances are, as with a lot of            concert-recorded stuff, only vaguely watchable. I would have and            the kids definitely would have preferred to unlock the actual music            videos for each of the game's five songs. A missed opportunity.                         But then, Britney's Dance Beat is full of missed opportunities.            For example, it supports dance mats, but it's almost completely            impossible to finish this way, and it has a pause menu so that you            can catch your breath, but hitting start again chooses whichever            option is selected, and there is no ~continue~ option, so it's back            to the beginning of the level. And even with the benefit of a            handicap system, the two-player mode is extremely one-sided, but it            wouldn't have been if there was an option to stop the old            ten-combo-switcheroo.                    Graphically, it's one part ~Slave 4 U~ to eleven parts album            filler. The six dancers are extremely detailed, right down to            chains hanging from their belts and pretentious hairstyles, and the            motion-captured dance routines, although completely linear, are            almost hypnotic to watch (which is presumably the reason why            there's a game mode where you can do just that). Britney herself            pops up for ~Bonus time~ if you play well enough, but she's at a            lower resolution than her counterpart from the introductory            cinematic.                         Our criticisms of the graphics mostly come down to the unmoving,            unblinking rigidity of the characters and the background graphics.            The female dancers are nicely detailed and frankly quite            attractive, and the male dancers might as well be the S Club 7            trio, but none of them has any fluidity. The more they dance, the            more you notice the lack of hair movement, that their clothes hug            their bodies without moving, and that, with apologies to our female            readers, nothing obvious happens when the young ladies jump up and            down like excited school girls. Not very lifelike, and not exactly            titillating either, which was clearly the aim.                         The background sets wheeled out for each audition are quite            spartan, and could be mistaken for simple 3D environment art            projects, but they don't interfere too much, except on the ~Hit me            baby~ level, when the background colour occasionally causes a            little mishap. If they are just there to stand and be ignored            though, why not use the sets from the music videos? Why not just            use the music videos in the first place? Speaking of which, the            music videos play on big screens in the background on each of the            stages, but for some reason they aren't in time with the            music\u2026                         Of course, because the game is too difficult, the single player            game will get a greater workout than the unbalance multiplayer            mode, and for that you won't get the chance to soak up the graphics            at all, so arguably none of this matters a jot.                    Rhythm-action games are - with a couple of exceptions - generally            noted for their wacky graphics, zany music and addictive gameplay.            Britney's Dance Beat makes a valiant effort to live up to its            forerunners, but falls slightly flat thanks to a mixture of poor            game design and a vicious learning curve. It's addictive enough if            you put the hours in, but it's almost impossible to hook casually            interested mates on the multiplayer mode, and with only five songs,            it won't be long before it grates on you."}
