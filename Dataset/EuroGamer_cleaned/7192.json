Without any            major new product 3dfx continues to take a second place in the 3D            speed stakes.                    Despite this potentially crushing defeat, 3dfx have had the            foresight to hedge their bets. Many chip makers have wisely            utilised the resources available through AGP, and as a result have            produced some very impressive products. They have, however,            forgotten about the lower end of the market.                    Strange as it may sound, not everyone is endowed with AGP, and this            AGP divide isn't just limited to older systems. A case in point is            Intel's AGP-less 810 chipset - boards based on the 810 (and its            associated flavours) are perfect for the most budget conscious of            users, but should a user want to upgrade from the rather weak i752            graphics controller they have a somewhat limited choice.                    In step 3dfx.         Despite not being 'the fastest card on the                 market', the Voodoo 3 3000 PCI is still a reasonable                 performer, and certainly a good card for lower end platforms.                    The V3 3000 PCI slightly varies from the original AGP version as it            is significantly larger, which is undoubtedly a result of it being            converted to PCI. It is also missing the TV encoder chip, which (on            the AGP version) allows you to plug the card into a TV for some big            screen gaming. Ultimately many users would never use this feature,            but for the sake of a couple more dollars...                    Other than that the board is virtually the same though. The same            16Mb of SDRAM occupies the board, as does the rather substantial            heatsink attached to the chip. It's curious that 3dfx don't have a            fan in addition, as the board does get very hot, and after only            minutes the heatsink becomes literally too hot to handle.                    On the driver side, 3dfx have implemented their ubiquitous control            panels, so any one used to other 3dfx cards will feel right at            home, and even those who have very little experience will have no            problem tweaking the options.                    One thing I must note though is that installing the drivers isn't            the easiest thing in the world to do, as 3dfx seem to have made            their CD slightly less than user friendly. This is a shame, as they            do include a very nice video on the CD which shows the user how to            install the card itself. Oh well...                    3dfx have also included some extra software in their bundle - EA's            FIFA '99 and Epic's Unreal, both of which are good games and would            certainly show off some of the prowess of the Voodoo 3 chip. There            is also a voucher to redeem a copy of Unreal Tournament, although            this is likely to be replaced soon by the actual game, now that it            has been released.         One question that has to be asked is                 whether the transition from AGP to PCI has harmed the                 performance of the board.                    Due to the way in which 3dfx have designed the Voodoo 3 chip, it            doesn't use any of the advanced features of the AGP bus, such as            AGP 2/4x, Side Band Addressing, or DME [That's enough - jargon            Editor]. It effectively acts like a PCI 66 device anyway, so there            are no real issues to deal with when creating a PCI version of the            card.                    Due to the fall in bus clock speed there is the potential to lose            some performance, but because of the way which 3dfx chips work            there isn't quite as much of a penalty as one could expect.                    As you can see from these results, the PCI version of the Voodoo 3            3000 is not noticeably slower than its AGP cousin. In some ways            this is a good thing, but it does show the total lack of commitment            to AGP in general from 3dfx...                    While it is no speed demon, the Voodoo 3 3000 PCI can at the very            least hold its own at the lower end, and it does represent            reasonable performance for a good price.                    Of course, while the user is getting a fairly cheap graphics card            they are also buying one that is missing some useful features, most            notably the lack of 32 bit colour rendering. 3dfx don't have the            only PCI 3D graphics card available, and it may be worth            investigating some of the others, such as the PCI version of            VideoLogic's Neon250 product.                    Overall though, the Voodoo3 3000 PCI is a great little card for            those who require a PCI graphics solution.                        -        Creative                    Labs Annihilator Pro reviewCreative                    Labs Annihilator Pro review                    Elsa Erazor III Pro Video review                    Elsa Erazor III Pro Video review                    Neon 250 review                    Neon 250 review"}
