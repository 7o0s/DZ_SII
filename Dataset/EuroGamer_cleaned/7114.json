Unfortunately an alien            race has stumbled across your cosmic answer to the Underground, and            is using the gates to travel from world to world, wiping out your            colonies.                    Now it's up to you to spearhead the counter-attack, battling your            way through a couple of dozen alien worlds, destroying alien            facilities, rescuing human prisoners, and generally causing mayhem            along the way. To help your one man army succeed where all others            have so far failed, you have been equipped with a vehicle that is            capable of morphing between different forms, and which can be            upgraded in the field.                    At heart Infestation is an action game, with most of your time            spent driving around and blowing stuff up, although the variety of            mission objectives helps to make this less repetitive than it            sounds. You will find yourself racing against the clock as a            volcanic planet destabilises, busting POWs out of jail, and            destroying force field generators to access new parts of a world.                    The ability to travel back and forth between the alien worlds using            the warp gates makes it rather more free-form than most arcade            shooters as well. Sadly you will probably find yourself using this            ability most often simply because the only time you can save your            game is when you travel through a warp gate to another world...                    There is also a strategy element to the game. Scientists can often            be found wandering around, and if you drop one off near a piece of            alien technology a little lightbulb will appear above his head if            he has discovered anything new from it, at which point you can pick            him up again to get the blueprints.                    Some worlds have factories which are still controlled by your own            forces, while others have alien factories which you can take over            by attacking them with smoke grenades to flush out the alien            workers and then manning them with your own scientists. Either way,            once you have enough men in the factory you can build a wide range            of power-ups, which increases throughout the game as your            scientists discover new technologies.                    Building most items requires resources, in the form of red, green            and blue crystals which can often be found on the ground, usually            near to a mining facility. You can also purchase portable mining            equipment, which you drop off in areas marked on your map as            mineral rich. Leave them there for several seconds and they will            bring the crystals to the surface for you to pick up.                    It's all fairly rudimentary, and particularly later on in the game            you will rarely find yourself short of resources, but it does add            some brains to the brawn.         Probably the most important            power-ups you can build in the factories are the new modes for your            vehicle. You start off with a fairly fast moving buggy, which soon            gains the ability to turn into a big wheeled version during the            training mission.                    The bigfoot truck moves more slowly but can travel over rougher            terrain and keeps your feet dry when crossing shallow water, which            can otherwise damage your vehicle. Although strangely I never found            any use for that after the training mission... Later on in the game            more new modes can be discovered, including hovercraft, heli-jets            and fast moving skimmers. Each mode has its own handling            characterists, and picking the right one to use in a particular            terrain type or situation can be vital.                    The skimmer, for example, moves at a ridiculous speed, but always            goes at full tilt and is almost impossible to control because of            this. The buggy on the other hand is a good all-round vehicle, and            can use its turbo to give it a short-lived speed boost, while the            heli-jet is fairly slow but can lift you high above the action and            get you over mountainous terrain or lakes.                    There is also a wide selection of weapons and equipment to            construct, from improved radar systems to lasers and stun grenades.            Unfortunately most of the weapons will go to waste, as they all            seem to have rechargeable or virtually unlimited ammunition, and            don't have any obvious advantages or disadvantages. By the end of            the game I was only using my over-powered plasma cannons, as they            seemed to be the best solution to almost every problem, despite            having half a dozen other weapons fitted.         Which is a shame, because the weapons            effects are reasonably impressive, as are the rest of the game's            graphics. It's certainly not the most attractive game we've ever            seen, but the skies are beautiful (apart from the occasional            visible seam), the landscapes are vast and nicely detailed, and the            fogging isn't too noticeable most of the time.                    The various units and buildings you run across during the game are            also quite detailed, although sadly the animations are a bit            stilted and repetitive at times. Pyrotechnics are suitably over the            top, with blinding flashes from buildings as you demolish them, and            smoking debris hurled into the air as vehicles explode.                    Unfortunately the artificial intelligence ranges from stupid to            moronic, with enemy units quickly forgetting your existence. In the            few missions where you have any kind of help, your comrades            constantly get in the way, and even the smallest friendly fire            incident can quickly escalate into a full-blown civil war. Leave            them to their own devices though and your allies will all be dead            within seconds.                    The game's biggest problem though are its missions, which can be            virtually impossible at times. Some took me several attempts to            complete, and often I had to rely on fooling the dense AI to defeat            overwhelming hordes of enemies. Other missions had time limits so            tight that the slightest slip meant it was time to restart.            Combined with the lack of a real save game facility this makes for            a rather frustrating experience.                    Infestation was a nice idea, but the implementation is rather            lacklustre. The graphics are good, the physics solid enough most of            the time, and the ability to transform your vehicle between            completely different modes adds a lot to the game. But it is all            let down by shoddy AI and poorly balanced missions, which swing            from push-over to almost impossible seemingly at random.                    With a few months more polish this could perhaps have been a great            game. As it is, the result is a fairly enjoyable but unremarkable            game that is all too often hair-tearingly frustrating."}
