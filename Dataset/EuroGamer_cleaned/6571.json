Differently shaped chunks consisting of four blocks raining            from the sky, and the only way to clear them is by arranging them            into a series of complete, horizontal lines. That's just genius,            isn't it?                    And it works so well! The speed levels gradually ramp up, there are            pre-built scenarios to try and work your way out of, there's that            ever so catchy theme tune which preys on your mind until it's all            you can do not to hum it, and there are even dancing Russians and            space ships. We pity every poor bastard who claims to have topped            it.                    Except Capcom, for two reasons: firstly, it claims to have topped            it in its own press material, which is a bit cheeky, and secondly,            it has come closer than virtually anybody in living memory.                    The paradoxically titled Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, then. How            does it work?                    It's rather like the bastard offspring of Tetris and Bust-a-Move.            You and an AI or human-controlled opponent have six block wide            boards with your little Street Fighter or Dark Stalkers characters            facing one another in the centre. Similar to Tetris, you're faced            with coloured gems tumbling from the sky on your side, this time in            pairs, and the idea is to arrange them adjacent to other gems of            the same colour with the usual Tetris-style controls. Horizontal            lines aren't important - it's all about getting the biggest            possible arrangements of same-colour gems lined up and then            shattering them. If you make a little square of four, they will            merge to become an almighty square ~power gem~. Throw on a couple            more and it's an even larger rectangular gem, and so on.                    Every so often, you won't get a gem from the little gap at the top;            you'll get a coloured circle with a dot in the middle, or a little            spinning jewel. The circle is a ~crash gem~, which when placed next            to a gem of the same colour will - you've guessed it - shatter that            particular gem, and any adjacent gems of the same colour, and then            any adjacent to those, and those, and so on. And if you can snake a            little colour train round the board and then destroy it with a            crash gem, you will create big problems for your AI or human            opponent on the other side of the screen.                    But before we get onto that, we should mention the little spinning            jewel, known as the rainbow gem. These are surprisingly rare and            destroy every gem corresponding to the colour of the one they land            on. Handy for clearing out a particularly packed board.                    However, unlike Tetris, Puzzle Fighter is about beating an            opponent. Whenever a crash gem has its effect, ~counter gems~ are            dumped on your opponent's board. Counter gems fall in a specific            coloured pattern for each character, which you can view on the            character select screen and in the manual, but sadly not in the            heat of the battle, and each is fronted by a number which counts            down from 5 to 0 - one count per gem pair - before solidifying. As            such, you can plan for the onslaught by lining up your existing            gems in a suitable colour array to receive and incorporate them to            your advantage. Failing that, you get a little warning before each            onslaught of counter gems, and smashing some of your own with a            crash gem (if possible) will lessen the subsequent ~counter dump~.            And while gems are counting down, any crash gem-related clearance            will destroy adjacent counters.                    Another good ploy is chaining attacks. With a bit of preparation,            you can get a row of blues to blow up, which in turn drops a lot of            greens on top of a strategically placed crash gem, which in turn            dumps some reds on another crash gem, and so on and so forth. The            bigger the number of chains, the heavier the punishment in store            for your enemy - all the while your little Puzzle Fighter character            smacks his chum around in between the boards. Aw.                    Phew. It's a lot more complicated to type it all out! In practise,            playing Puzzle Fighter is pretty easy. You make your gems as big            and as satisfyingly chunky as you dare, then shatter them to thwart            your opponent. The strategy of the game is in playing to your            opponent's counter gem pattern, and getting those crucial            explosions in prior to being severely countered. But as you'll            quickly learn, neither is all that easy to do, so it's often a case            of seat-of-the-pants puzzling while your opponent is working at the            same rate. As with Tetris, holding down on the D-pad is a shortcut            for sending the gems rattling down quickly, and like Tetris again,            fallen gems give you a split second to shift them left or right,            useful if you send them marginally astray when hurrying. And who            doesn't?                    In terms of the GBA port, it's all as charming as we remember it on            the PSX and PC, with cute, simple, arcadey menus, a watch-and-learn            training mode (or video, effectively), the basic Arcade Mode (split            into three difficulty levels; breezy straight-through three stage            easy, 'normal to rock hard' eight stage medium and 'you will never            get off the first round' hard), an item and game mode-unlocking GBA            specific Puzzle Mode, and a couple of multi-player modes.                    What? Yes, a couple. There's the usual link cable mode for two            players, sadly requiring two cartridges (note to GBA developers,            publishers, etc: stop doing this now, you greedy bastards),            but there's also an enigmatic Versus Mode, which lets you play            two-player on one GBA. Obviously this is a bit of a            non-starter on GlowGuard or Afterburner-less GBAs, but SP owners            will no doubt be delighted to have something to coo about. Well,            something else.                    They'll be less excited about the controls though, as the two of            you huddle together, one hand per side of the GBA. Player one            controls his gems with left/right on the D-pad and the left            shoulder button (tap it to turn the gems anti-clockwise, hold to            send the gems quickly to ground) while player two uses B/A,            corresponding to left/right, and the right shoulder button.            Surprisingly, it works! You can just about get on with a game or            two this way, but we'd say it should probably be reserved for            couples and best friends - or those of you on Ken's buses.            Otherwise, it just makes us wonder why a one-cart link cable mode            wasn't included. Eh, Capcom?                    As you can tell though, the port is largely very good. The menus            are all very obvious, the display is crisp and clear and the            graphics are functional - except for the cutesy, ~super deformed~            (ugh) SF2 and Dark Stalkers folk making up the character roster,            who thrust and gyrate their beat 'em up wares in time to your            gem-crushage. They look splendid.                    It's been a while since we've recommended a puzzler on the GBA, but            with Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo we're tempted to do just that.            Like most puzzle games, it's all in the gameplay, and Puzzle            Fighter's model is more imaginative and works a lot better than            most of the others we've seen lately. Like ZooCube, for example.            And unlike Tetris, there's scope to get much better at it by            learning the counter gem routes and finding your ideal character            match, and there's a single-player game that takes more than a            first-time brain to overcome. Much more. Throw in an adventurous            two-on-one-GBA multi-player mode, the obligatory (and fantastic)            link cable mode and cute, quirky visuals and Puzzle Fighter becomes            an essential purchase for puzzle fans. It's still not Tetris, but            that's no reason to ignore it.
