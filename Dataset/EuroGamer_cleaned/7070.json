To this end, the game            is set not in the present day, where jet fighters battle with            missiles over huge distances, but instead FASA's ~Crimson Skies~            universe, where propeller aircraft rule the skies and combat is up            close and personal.                    The game is set in a world where the air is fought over much like            the sea once was, with aerial pirates clashing both with each other            and with the law - as embodied by the air forces of various            nations. In a break from the norm, the player takes the role not of            one of these aerial policemen, but of a pirate named Nathan            Zachary, who leads a group of misfits known as the Fortune Hunters.            The storyline is centered around their attempts to obtain fame and            fortune by fair means or foul, although it soon emerges that it is            not only the pirates who are playing dirty.                    This storyline soon becomes very interesting, and the atmosphere is            enhanced greatly by the way that the story is carried through            in-game conversations between pilots and in other ~period~ forms,            such as radio broadcasts and newspaper cuttings, rather than            through FMV cutscenes. In fact, there is even a radio drama titled            ~The Tall Tales and Many Lives of Nathan Zachary~ which is played            during installation, with further stories available on the            official            website. And in another nice change from tradition, the voice            acting is actually very well done, although they do take the            opportunity to overplay some of the accents somewhat.                    The unusual storyline also gives Crimson Skies the opportunity to            explore some more interesting types of mission than the normal ~fly            here, destroy that~ style objectives that grace a lot of other            flight sims. For example, one mission requires you to take over a            bomber by destroying its wingmen, before leaping on to the wing and            climbing into the cockpit! Many of the missions also feature            optional objectives which can be completed, as well as little            extras such as daring stunts which can be performed for bonuses.            Each mission flown is logged in a scrapbook, and each objective or            stunt performed adds items to it, including newspaper cuttings and            photos of your daring deeds.                    The graphics in Crimson Skies are quite superb, and much more            vibrant than in other flight games. The effect that this has,            particularly on the scenery, is quite incredible, and the design of            the actual locations is also superb, with varied terrain and highly            distinctive landmarks to aid navigation.                    Unusually for a flight sim, Crimson Skies defaults to an external            view, with the camera positioned behind your plane. This seems a            little unnatural at first, but quickly becomes as usable as the            traditional internal view. It also gives you a chance to admire            your nicely detailed aircraft, as the short range nature of the            dogfighting in the game means that you generally only get to see            your own plane close up. There is also an impressive amount of            ground clutter, and lots of buildings and trees to blow up. On the            downside there is the odd graphics glitch, particularly in the            tracking window, which is supposed to show your current target.            However, this never really interfered with the gameplay in any way.                    The graphics engine is also commendably fast - the game ran at a            perfectly reasonable framerate on a Pentium II 400 with a TNT2 card            with all the detail options on, and this gave a very respectable            draw distance. On a system with a GeForce card Crimson Skies ran            extremely smoothly indeed. Indeed, the only place where the game            seemed to struggle was in some of the menus, where the response to            the mouse was somewhat sluggish.                    The sound is also very impressive - there is lots of pilot chatter,            some of which acts to further the game's plot, and the music is not            only appropriate but alters to fit the current situation. I was            only able to find a handful of faults with the sound in general -            the effects are somewhat mundane (though I guess there is only so            much you can do with bullet and explosion noises), and sometimes            the speech suffers from one of two problems. Firstly, at times the            chatter gets annoying and irrelevant (for example, having a wingman            shout ~bandit in front of you!~ when you are already shooting at            it), and secondly it is sometimes indistinct, which is annoying            (though usually not fatal) when certain mission information is            relayed through radio messages.                    Of course, all the pretty graphics, sound and storyline would be            irrelevant if the gameplay didn't come up to scratch. Fortunately            Crimson Skies scores highly in this department as well - it is            extremely fun to fly the game's aircraft, and dogfights are fast,            furious and exciting.                    As with just about any flight sim, a joystick is an absolutely            essential accessory in order to play Crimson Skies. The flight            model is not particularly realistic compared to the more            simulator-orientated games in this genre, but it is realistic            enough to lift Crimson Skies above the ~arcade~ style of flying,            and all of the more obscure stunts which I tried worked as            expected. The controls are refreshingly simple though, composed            simply of throttle, stick and weapon options. The setting of the            game also gives an excuse to avoid having to take off or land the            aircraft, as they are launched ~Starfury style~ from your zeppelin,            and dock again using a hook arrangement.                    This docking can be quite tricky, so there is an ~autodock~ option            which can be activated when you are reasonably close to the hook.            This user-friendliness also extends to the missions themselves - if            you fail a mission three times, you are asked if you would like to            skip it. I personally felt this was a little too much like            cheating, but if you get really stuck on a level I think this            option would be welcome. Finally, a feature that Crimson Skies            includes which many other games really should take note of is the            ability to restart a mission after dying without having to            reload the entire level. This makes so much difference, as you no            longer have to spend more time loading than playing when trying to            complete a difficult level.                    Crimson Skies also includes a range of multiplayer options for both            internet and LAN play. Whilst these are amusing for a while, the            long-term appeal is somewhat suspect as there is not much beyond            straight dogfighting on offer.                    There also appear to be some problems with cheating in multiplayer            games, although it is probable that a patch will be released to fix            at least some of these issues. The other slight problem with the            multiplayer mode is that, in keeping with the recent trend in            games, it uses MSN's ~Zone~, and hence requires you to open a            browser, log in and so on. All of this means that joining an online            game is a somewhat more tedious process than it should be.                    In single player games the AI provides a good challenge though,            flying reasonably intelligently and putting up a good fight. The            only problem I noticed was that occasionally your wingmen will            crash into you whilst trying to fly somewhere - this can be            annoying, although bizarrely planes do not do very much damage when            crashing into each other!                    Crimson Skies is an exceptionally fun game to play - the fight            model is spot-on (entertainment wise), and the missions and            storyline are both sufficiently interesting to keep the player            involved in the action. The superb graphics and sound are the icing            on the cake, and whilst multiplayer is not as well-polished as the            rest of the package it is still a worthwhile complement to the            singleplayer game.                    The only major flaw in Crimson Skies is the front end - not only is            it unresponsive at times and prone to the odd crash, but the first            version of the game contained several bugs which could erase saved            games under certain circumstances. If you do buy Crimson Skies,            your first port of call should be the            official            website to download the patch for these problems..."}
