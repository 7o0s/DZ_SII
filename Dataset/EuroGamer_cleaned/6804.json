Naturally it's up to you, occupying            the jack boots of all-American gun fetishist and mustachioed            mercenary John Mullins, to put an end to this.                        What ensues is a finely honed mixture of run-and-gun action and            more stealth-oriented missions, with a variety of real world            weaponry to play with and Raven's appropriately named GHOUL            animation system to provide the gut-wrenching gore quotient. Arms,            legs and heads can be shot clean off, leaving almost unrecognisable            mangled remains, while blood stains, bullet holes and gaping wounds            appear on injured enemies. The faint of heart will be glad to hear            they can tone down the gore or switch it off entirely from the            options menu.                        Your armaments vary from a simple combat knife, useful for those            close quarters silent kills, through assault rifles and shotguns            and on up to incendiary grenades and a bazooka. In the last couple            of missions you even have access to the latest state-of-the-art            infantry weapon, the OICW, a prime example of American military            technology in that it's so complex as to be almost completely            unusable in most combat situations. Featuring all mod cons -            machinegun, sniper scope, grenade launcher, range finder,            friend-or-foe target identifier, fluffy dice - it costs a small            fortune, requires the use of at least half a dozen buttons, and is            consistently out-performed in action by an untrained Columbian            rebel with a second hand AK-74 assault rifle.                    Which brings us to the game's single biggest flaw - the AI. Put            simply, every scruffy looking rebel soldier you come up against is            in fact Superman wearing a really cunning disguise. He can see            through walls (and will sometimes attempt to fire through them,            with often hilarious results), poke arms and legs through solid            objects, and consistently land a grenade at your feet from fifty            feet away, over a hill, without being able to see you.                        Smoke grenades and thick foliage are no obstacle for these digital            \u00fcber-mensch either, and in open terrain it's almost impossible            to sneak up on them. The only way to evade their attentions is to            go ~prone~ and crawl along the ground, at which point they will            quite happily stand on your head without seeing you in thick grass.            But as you can't fire your weapon whilst lying down (not even guns            that are specifically designed to be fired from this position) it's            not much of a solution, and the second you pop your head up you'll            be spotted and shot with near perfect accuracy. Needless to say            this makes trying to use the OICW's complex targeting systems and            viewfinder (which only function when you stand perfectly still for            some reason, and forget your zoom settings every time you move)            utterly futile.                        It also makes the game's handful of stealth-based missions            particularly irritating, especially as guards can raise the alarm            telepathically without having to go anywhere near a big red button.            Once the siren has been set off there's no way to turn it off            again, and at least one mission is failed instantly if the alarm            gets activated. While this would be fair enough under most            circumstances, it's pretty annoying when you have to restart a            mission because a guard somehow saw you through a pile of cardboard            boxes. On the bright side, the AI does do a good job of working            together as a team to root you out from under cover, circling round            to get a clean shot or running away to fetch reinforcements, and            the sight of guards vaulting over a railing to reach you or            kneeling behind cover as you open fire is common.                    The shortcomings of the AI aren't enough to spoil the single player            campaign completely, however hard Raven's programmers may have            tried. It's hard not to enjoy yourself sometimes as you run through            a jungle, ducking behind a ruined wall, peering around a tree trunk            to let off a few rounds and catching an enemy guard full in the            face, watching as he slumps to the ground realistically. Until you            get blown to pieces by a grenade, anyway.                        Sadly the level design is something of a mixed bag as well though,            with settings ranging from the streets of Prague and Hong Kong to            the crate-festooned interior of a cargo ship. Some areas are            imaginative and beautifully rendered, while others are lacking in            detail, shrouded in thick fog, or over-ambitious sprawling            locations that bring your graphics card to its knees. Most levels            are also incredibly linear, with a combination of locked doors,            bullet-proof windows and shoddy scripting keeping you on the            straight and narrow. Mullins does carry a tool which acts as a            lockpick, but as you can only use it on a handful of doors and            chests throughout the course of the game it's pretty pointless in            practice.                        Some levels remove any illusion of free will by clamping you to a            fast moving vehicle and giving you a fixed machinegun to fire.            These on-rails missions are frankly awful, marred by pathetic            featureless level design and angular roads that look like something            out of the proverbial ~my first Quake map~. Your escape from Prague            on the back of a truck is especially poor, with the vehicle making            wild unrealistic changes in direction as you sit helplessly            attached to your machinegun. Lorries loaded with enemy soldiers            periodically veer on to the road in front of or behind you, and            then fly high into the air as they explode, your own truck passing            through the flaming wreckage as if it wasn't there.                    Luckily there's more to Soldier Of Fortune II than the up-and-down            single player campaign. For starters you have access to a random            mission generator, and although this is only capable of creating            fog-ridden outdoors maps, it does add longevity. There's a choice            of four terrain types, and missions can involve planting            explosives, killing a particular enemy, escaping to an extraction            point or stealing documents.                        Where the random map generator (and the game itself, for that            matter) really shines is in multiplayer. Here you won't have to            worry about enemies with pixel perfect aim and X-ray vision (until            somebody creates an auto-aim bot, anyway), and capture the flag            games are a joy to behold, with up to 32 players on each side            battling back and forth over a vast map created spontaneously at            the beginning of each match. Occasionally you end up with a map            which is too open (leaving your base difficult to defend) or too            constricted (with everybody funnelled through one or two central            choke points), but usually the result is highly enjoyable anyway.                        The free-for-all and team deathmatch modes tend to be fast and            furious, especially on crowded servers, and although some people            may enjoy this, I found the whole thing pretty chaotic.            Infiltration is more interesting though, offering a Counter-Strike            style round-based game in which one team must capture a briefcase            full of documents and return it to their helicopter. The maps            aren't all suited to large numbers of players, but there's enough            variety here to keep you entertained, from the jungles of Columbia            to a recreation of Raven's offices in snow-covered Wisconsin. On            some maps it's hard to get the documents to the extraction point in            one piece, which tends to reduce the game to a bout of ~last man            standing~ (an option which is also included, as Elimination mode),            but overall it's a lot of fun.                    Soldier Of Fortune II is effectively two games in one box. The            first is a fairly entertaining but deeply flawed single player            campaign, the other a multiplayer shooter with a huge variety of            maps (pre-designed and randomly generated) and at least two great            gameplay modes (capture the flag and infiltration) to keep you            occupied. If you're after some online mayhem, then it's well worth            buying. If you want single player action, you'd be better off            looking elsewhere.Single Player Rating - 6/10            Multiplayer Rating - 9/10"}
