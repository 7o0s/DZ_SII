Bullet time.~ ~Off a project? Pitch a rally            game.~ Ahem. Fortunately I didn't see any such signs or slogans,            thus restoring my faith in humanity, and of the lectures I attended            I certainly didn't hear anybody evangelising such nonsense.            Although EA did tell us how one of its big flops of 2002 took a            mere six months to build\u2026                    But some people, somewhere, continue to throw these uninspired            combinations of familiar elements together with mixed success. And            Dead to Rights is a perfect example. I'm going to roll out some of            the clich\u00e9s now. Say 'when'.        To start with, you're            an elite cop in Grant City (~people aren't born here, they're            forged out of broken bones and blood money~ - Payneful), and after            finding your dead Dad on a building site tutorial mission, you vow            to get revenge and set off (against the run of the law obviously),            guns blazing on the trail of those responsible. Living life to the,            um, Max.                    You control your man, Jack Slate, from the third person perspective            with the left analogue stick, and direct the camera with the right.            You can slide along walls and peer round them for stealthy and            well-protected kills; you can pop up from behind cover to kill your            enemies; you can grab a nearby enemy for a human shield; you can            jump into a slow-motion dive giving you more time to think, lock            and load; and you go about shooting people using a GTA-style right            trigger lock on system (tapping the shoulder button to switch            between targets). For the most part it's a game of running and            gunning from behind cover and killing lots, and lots, and lots of            enemies. An early street level has you slaughtering what seems like            50 men, and it's typical of most locations.                    Then every so often you run out of ammo or have your guns stripped            for plot reasons and have to duke it out with your fists and feet.            This leaves you with a number of options. You can punch, kick and            block, double or triple tapping for combinations; you can reach out            and disarm an enemy to even things up/re-arm yourself; you can            throw your enemies; heck, armed or no, you can even send your            trusty canine sidekick Shadow in to help you out.                    Throw in a series of fairly bland locations (apart from those I've            mentioned, there's a nightclub battle, Matrix style bank scenes,            Death Row, sewers, etc) and an overstated plot, which seems to go            against the unrelenting flow of death and carnage, and that's the            game pretty much sewn up. Your job is to get from one end of the            gauntlet to the other, dispatching many men, and to get your            revenge.                    And fundamentally Dead to Rights can't escape this linearity.        Now to some extent that's a good thing! The combat system is            split down the middle between the enjoyable and mostly intelligent            gunplay system and the tedious hand-to-hand mechanism. When armed,            Jack has a number of weapons to consider - dual pistols, shotguns,            etc - and he can augment his one-man-army approach by tossing            explosive canisters at enemies and shooting them in mid-air.                    On the whole, it'll be a good few hours before you get bored of            leaping in and out of cover, with fantasies of the Wild West, The            Matrix, and pretty much every James Bond/action film ever made            running around inside your head. The lock on system and number of            targets gives the game an appreciably different feel to Max Payne,            and if you're a fan of shooting, shooting, shooting and shooting,            Dead to Rights has a lot to offer.                    But even that gets repetitive before the game is over, and you'll            drive yourself mad trying to get out of fist fights way before            then. The prison sequence epitomises the problem for me. It's            probably not the biggest concentration of fistfights and it's            punctuated by some mini-games (of which more later) but it does see            you fighting a series of goons (some strong, some weak), dishing            out karate kicks and roundhouse clobberings as best you can. But            the disarm system is irrelevant here, as is human shielding, and            left to its ham-fisted devices, the Final Fight-esque basics don't            stand up to repetition. Unfortunately, Namco has piled on a lot of            repetition.                    And coupled with the game's linearity, this leaves you bored and            unamused, as you toil between the ethereal walls funnelling you            between objectives, getting more and more acquainted with the same            set of moves.        Then there are other issues. The graphics, for example, are            good and bad in equal measure. When I first started playing, I            commented that the whole game looked a bit like a Quake 2 Total            Conversion, such is the lack of detail in some places (and I was            playing Panzer Dragoon Orta yesterday, which really throws            the might of Xbox around). Character models are quite well animated            in battle and in death, but they're stodgy, chunky bastards. To go            back to the nightclub again - DTR's club now looks worse than Max            Payne's did quite some time ago. The light show is pretty weak, and            the environment is pretty blocky. There isn't a great deal of            destructible scenery in the game either, so you're left with some            old-fashioned arenas in every sense of the word.                    Then again, the choice of locations isn't very helpful to the            graphical cause. It's difficult to forgive Namco for making the            endless repeating corridors and ashen doorways of Death Row look            about as comforting as a cold shower in February; for failing to            give the tunnels beneath anything other than a brown/black palette            and for throwing more greys, browns and slushy textures around than            a Golgothan [the, er, 'shit demon' from Dogma - Ed]; and for            generally trying to fill levels with atmosphere by plunging them            into near-darkness.                    At its heart, Dead to Rights is a simple game of running, gunning            and slapping, dressed up with arbitrary tricks and abilities which            make for a slightly more exciting game. It's a bit like being            on-foot and tooled to the teeth in Grand Theft Auto, but in a            scenario where your character is less of a jerky, hard-to-control            klutz who jumps like a silly walks campaigner. But when you run out            of ammo, it feels a lot more like GTA, as you struggle to enjoy            yourself smacking people around.                    Like a bit of blam-blam-blam and like the sound of the combat            system? You will probably enjoy Dead to Rights. You won't spend            endless hours with it and love no other, but I would strongly            advise a rental - because even if you don't buy it, you'll have            plenty of fun for the first few hours. But despite throwing in a            canine companion, button-tapping mini-games and retweaking            difficulty levels and so on between NTSC and PAL, Dead to Rights is            fundamentally underwhelming to look at, repetitive to play and            riddled with more flaws than bullet holes, and this'll stick like            rigour mortis after your fiftieth fistfight."}
