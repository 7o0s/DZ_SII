Which is hardly surprising, as Earth 2140                 wasn't one of the most memorable games from the 90's, and it                 appears that they want to start with a clean slate for Earth                 2150.                    As is common for such games, Earth 2150 does have a 'plot' which            attempts to make some sense out of the fact that you have to build            a thousand tanks and destroy someone with them. In the case of            Earth 2150, the basic premise is very simple - you have 183 days to            leave the Earth and begin travelling to Mars. The reason for this            is that as a result of constant wars, the Earth's orbit has gone a            bit funny, meaning that it will hit the moon and send both straight            into the sun. Imaginative, isn't it?                    Anyway, as a result you get to play as one of three factions that            are trying to escape the Earth before it burns up. The Eurasian            Dynasty is a conglomeration of super-industrialised communist            fanatics, The Lunar Corporation are a bunch of rich capitalists            that live on the moon and are in it for the money, while the United            Civilised States is a kind of future USA. The UCS typify lazy            Americans everywhere as most of their armoury consists of robotic            units that don't require human intervention.         So how do                 you get off the planet? Money of course! The aim of the game                 is to earn one million in cold hard currency, which must then                 be diverted to the player's space base for safe keeping. It is                 here that the Lunar Corporation have an advantage - onstead of                 having to collect the full million, they only need 500,000.                    The required money is collected by the usual mining operations that            we have all come to know and love from previous real time strategy            games. Of course, not all of the resources mined should be sent to            the space base for safe keeping - money is also required in order            to research new technology, which means that you must decide how            much to spend and how much to save.                    The research and upgrade system for the units is rather good,            allowing for older weaker units to be upgraded with any new            technologies which you might have discovered. This kind of            upgrading extends to all of the units available in the game, which            encompass land, sea and air vehicles.                    Another nice touch is that as units engage in more battles and            survive them, they become more experienced. You get to keep hold of            them from mission to mission, which allows you to get into the flow            of the game a little better. After all, there is nothing worse than            spending half an hour building an army that you will never see            again.         The AI is fairly effective, and certainly                 not as stupid as we have seen in so many other strategy                 titles. In fact, at times the AI will put up a tremendous                 fight and give you a serious hiding should you fail to manage                 your units properly.                    One way around enemy defences is subterranean units, which allow            for sneak attacks on enemy positions, but the AI will wise up to            these tactics sooner or later. The old favourite 'tank rush' style            of attack won't work either, and only a concerted effort from every            direction with a sensible range of weapons will get you through any            given battle.                    Once you have completed or got bored of the single player game,            there is also multiplayer support. The game is fairly happy with a            56k modem, although the odd drop out did occur, which led to some            significant bouts of shouting at the monitor.                    Multiplayer comes in several varities. ~Uncle Sam~ has no mining,            leaving you with just your starting cash. ~Earn Money~ leaves you            to amass as much cash as you can in the time. ~Hide and Seek~ is a            capture the flag style game, whereas ~Arena~ is pure deathmatch            style action, with no bases or resources. Finally there is a            ~Destroy Structures~ mode, where the aim is to destroy enemy            buildings to earn points - pure carnage!         Something else that the developers                 have got right is the camera. Many other 3D strategy titles,                 such as Warzone 2100, Machines and Force Commander, have                 suffered somewhat because their camera control was rather                 difficult to use efficiently.                    The camera in Earth 2150 can be positioned in any way, and moved            fluidly from one view to another. This makes it extremely useful            during the many battles that will occur in the course of the game,            as it allows the player to more finely position their troops.                    The graphics themselves are excellent, and the landscapes are well            designed and very detailed. But despite this detail, the graphics            can seem a little dull and colourless at times. While this may be            realistic, in that nobody with sense is going to build a bright red            tank, it does make for some dull looking units.                    The lighting system more than makes up for this lack of colour            though, with pyrotechnic multi-coloured dynamic lighting, and full            day and night cycles. It can be extremely eerie sending units in            under strange light conditions, especially when an enemy battalion            can be waiting around the next hill. It also means that a real            world necessity like a spotlight suddenly becomes a very powerful            tool in the game.                    The weather system is another marvel, yielding great effects as it            generates everything from light rain to heavy snow fall. It            certainly adds an extra dimension to an already impressive looking            game.         Earth 2150 is a great title, and thankfully its                 forgotten prequel won't be able to damage the reputation that                 this game will bring TopWare. Certainly anybody that has                 played and enjoyed other 3D strategy games like Warzone 2100                 will find Earth 2150 an extremely fun and challenging game to                 play.                    One warning though - the game doesn't perform so well on lower end            systems, which is in part due to the level of graphic detail that            the game features. It is possible to turn down the realism, which            doesn't effect the gameplay, but it will lessen the experience.            Release Date - Friday 7th July 2000"}
