Strangely, the focus of this debate has not been the            gameplay merits, graphics or even the gothic atmosphere of American            McGee's Alice, but rather the title. ~Who is American McGee?~            people cry, ~and how can he defile Lewis Carroll's original work            like this, and then attach his own name to it?~. The answer to the            first question is relatively simple - American McGee is a level            designer who previously worked at iD software on games including            Doom 2 and Quake. The second, however, is harder, and largely            depends on how you perceive the games' take on the original            stories.                         Alice is set some years after the original Wonderland tales. A            fire in Alice's house killed both her parents, leaving her the only            survivor - but psychologically scarred by the experience. Relegated            to a mental asylum, she is drawn once again into Wonderland, only            to find that the fairytale world has become twisted and evil under            the influence of the Queen of Hearts. Thus begins Alice's quest to            free Wonderland from tyranny - and herself from madness. Worthy of            special mention is the excellent trailer for the game, which can be            found at http://www.alice.ea.com, which shows off some of the            superb FMV from the game.                    The first thing that strikes you about the game is the sheer style            with which the storyline and world are crafted. By taking familiar            elements of the original books and twisting them into new forms,            Rogue have produced a game that is a wonder to behold. This style            is backed up by some of the best graphics to appear on the PC in            recent times, powered by the Quake 3 engine. Technically, the            engine is not much improved over that used in Quake 3, but the            levels and characters are so well-designed that it looks like a            brand new system. The game is split up into a number of themed            worlds, with smooth transitions between most of them. The            environments range from the monochrome castles of the chess pieces,            to lush green forests and the mechanical hell of the Hatters'            asylum.                         The constant variation in the levels and the wonderful graphics            provide a compelling incentive to keep playing, but Alice does not            fall short in the gameplay department, either. The game is played            from a third-person perspective as you guide Alice through the            part-platformer, part-combat levels. Quake-style mouse and keyboard            controls are used, and whilst this takes a little bit of getting            used to, it soon becomes second nature, and makes navigating the            environments much easier. To aid the player further, a glowing            crosshair acts as an aiming point for Alice's weapons, and can also            provide an indicator of where it is safe to stand on ledges.                    The platform elements of the game are pretty standard fare - jump            across bouncy mushrooms, swing on ropes and make use of moving            platforms. Again, though, Alice manages to make many of these            well-trodden paths seem fresh by adding unique styling - for            example, in one area platforms break up into a myriad of tumbling            jigsaw pieces as you walk on them, and in another a huge steel ball            chases you down a tunnel, shattering thin ice underneath you as you            attempt to escape.                         The combat is less conventional, although reminiscent of some            other third person games like Rune and Drakan. All but your default            knife weapon use up Mana, which can be replenished by picking up            crystals left behind by defeated foes, which also serve to            replenish your health. Since the nature of the combat means that            you will inevitably lose some health in each encounter, and using            your long-range weapons costs Mana, the trick quickly becomes to            make sure you gain more from killing a particularly enemy than you            lose. This can add a great deal of tactics to the game, as some            enemies drop larger crystals when defeated, although at times this            can seem random and annoying as some large, tough enemies only give            pitiful amounts of power back when dead.                    The only real downside to Alice's gameplay is that it does get a            bit tedious about half-way through the game, where there is a lot            of combat with small but annoying foes and few puzzles. Fortunately            the game picks up after that, with more interesting enemies that            actually require real tactics to defeat, and some cleverly designed            levels. The bosses are a bit of a disappointment, too - for the            most part beating them involves little more than circle-strafing a            lot and collecting the regenerating powerups that are present in            every boss area.                         The audio in Alice is also exemplary - the music, fittingly            enough, takes the form of twisted, haunting remixes of nursery            rhymes and childhood songs, which matches the tone of the game            perfectly. The sound is equally good - the effects match the action            well, and the speech is wonderful, made even better by the well            written script. In particular, I found Alice's dry humour and the            Cheshire Cat's sarcasm a refreshing change after the soulless            dialogue that accompanies many games.                    All in all, Alice is something of an odd game. If you ignore the            setting and graphics, there is a good but not outstanding action            platformer underneath. However, with the polish and sheer            excellence of the atmosphere generated, Alice becomes much greater            than that. If you let the game draw you in, the fantasy world            becomes much more real than you could imagine -and the game much            more compelling. Alice is well worth a look, even if you feel that            the original is best left unaltered."}
