Thy plot shall be incidental, badly acted and insultingly            unoriginal, and thou shalt not move from the rails beneath your            feet. Capcom's Dino Stalker breaks both of these rules.        You're in a plane over Pearl            Harbour. You've just been shot. You eject and suddenly find            yourself ripped through time and space and floating through a sky            filled with Pterodactyls. A futuristic machine gun appears in your            hands and a bizarre electronic wristband materialises on your arm.            The blasting commences.                    The game's hero, Mike Wired, continues his journey through jungle,            river, desert and beyond, and on the way he meets a peculiar young            blonde in a tight leather outfit, and struggles to find out what            happened to 1943 and why the sky looks so peculiar. All will be            revealed, Mike.                    Given the genre, this interesting and - dare I say it - original            storyline (it is) gives the game quite an interesting set of            parameters to play with. After all, do you even remember what the            felons were up to in Virtua Cop? Or why you were on that train in            Time Crisis 2? Or why you were shooting Sarcophagi in Confidential            Mission? Of course not. It didn't matter - all that did was having            something to shoot at.                    However, Dino Stalker is no popgun stall. Mike Wired controls his            own feet, moving where your directional pad (and A and B strafe            buttons) tell him to, and wheeling round of his own accord only in            the face of imminent danger. A decent plot and free roaming gunplay            - an unlikely match, but one which Capcom has exploited            successfully. Instead of memorising the position of a bad guy and            taking him out quickly ~the next time~, Dino Stalker sees you            moving around literally stalking dinosaurs using the radar in the            middle of your heads-up display. From fleets of Pterodactyls and            Raptor packs to prehistoric Crocodiles and giant twin Carnotaurus            beasts, they all tumble into your sights one after another.        The            game's first level sees you parachuting through the clouds and            firing at Pterodactyls, and this is a good chance to get used to            the radar and directional pad controls. A cone on your radar            indicates your current field of view, and by employing the            directional pad, you can - and must - move forwards, backwards,            left and right. Before long, you're tracking the 'dactyls as they            swoop across your picture.                    Soon enough you're on the ground, fighting through a forest filled            with (destructible) trees and a blanket of foliage, which makes the            jungle in Turok: Evolution seem like the product of fifty million            years of naptime. The sky is barely visible through the mesh of            branches and leaves, and a mixture of thick tree trunks, fallen            branches, bushes and other foliage form a barrier too thick to            penetrate. This is a fixture throughout - you can trundle wherever            you like, but only within a certain degree of reason. Fortunately,            dinos can come at you even from areas you can't get to on foot, so            there's no ~edge of the level~ to ignore. You know it. Your radar            knows it.                    It's ironic perhaps that we're applauding such a physically linear            game for its supposedly free-roaming gameplay, but Dino Stalker            really does challenge the traditional shoot-'em-up concept. What it            does not do is perfect an alternative.        Despite Capcom's            best efforts, the gameplay is still very unwieldy, and the playing            position uncomfortable. There's no easy way to use the strafe            buttons and directional pad whilst firing, and juggling your            fingers to keep yourself moving is frustrating, particularly during            boss fights where the target keeps on coming. The addition of a            sniper mode is a nice idea - pressing A and B simultaneously takes            you there and lets you zoom in and out - but spend more than a few            seconds with your eye on the horizon and you'll find the timer            ticking perilously close to zero, or worse, you'll find yourself            jumped by a sneaky Raptor.                    With the timer constantly ticking down, you find yourself rushing            through the environment; never quite sure of how much there is left            to do, or what's coming next. If you stalk quietly through each            level picking your enemies off one by one, you won't even make it            past the halfway mark, and this is a missed opportunity for Capcom            - Dino Stalker is a lot more fun when you're, ironically, stalking!        Like just about every PS2            shooter to date, Dino Stalker looks quite nice, but there are some            issues of clarity and animation to address. For a start, there's            quite a lot of fog on the horizon, which sets our cheap programming            trick klaxon buzzing, and the dinos, though they exist in great            numbers and rarely drag the game from its standard 60 frames per            second, do look rather bland. With the exception of the Carnotaurus            and his brother, who both look like the T-Rex from Jurassic Park on            a bad hair day. The simple dinos and short-range fog do add to the            suspense, and have allowed Capcom to introduce some stunning            environments. The aforementioned jungle is an impressive sight, and            the riverboat ride offers a surprisingly good interpretation of            choppy water and rocky shores. A handsome setting is good for the            level design too, although in most cases the actual layout of the            levels is incredibly simple, with corridors through scenery linking            big clearings, and the occasional bridged gap or environmental            obstacle. But on the whole it works on account of the visuals, and            the variety and distribution of power-ups.                    Yes, power-ups - the mainstay of any decent shooter. In addition to            his standard firearm, Mike can also pick up shotguns, machine guns,            bazookas and other improved firepower, although he can only carry            one at a time. A degree of strategy quickly emerges though as Mike            has to manage his arsenal and save the best items over for boss            encounters.                    The only serious thing to be said against Dino Stalker concerns the            length. Like most light gun titles, it's over before you've really            started to get comfortable, but to its credit, the game is brimming            with extras. Once you've polished off the single player game, for            example, a two-player mode is unlocked, which definitely provides            incentive to persevere on your lonesome. Furthermore, your            performance on each level is rated on a scale of D through A with a            special bonus award for stunners - and your points score is based            on your physical state and proficiency behind the sights, so            there's lots of headroom even after a few playthroughs.                    The real question, though, is whether it's still fun when you're            playing it the third or fourth time, and that really depends on            your relationship with the control system. If you can juggle the            buttons and move unrestrained then you'll find Dino Stalker            refreshing and replayable, but if you find the D-pad more of a            hindrance than a heart warmer, then it might make sense to leave            this one on the shelf."}
