So it was only a            matter of time before the ubiquitous pyromaniac appeared on            Nintendo's new GameBoy Advance.                        For those of you not familiar with Bomberman, the game boils down            to running around the screen dropping bombs in an attempt to trap            your enemies with the horizontal and vertical explosions they            cause. Matches begin with a liberal scattering of crates, tyres or            other obstructions to blow up, and these sometimes reveal power-ups            that increase the number of bombs you can have on screen at once or            the range of the blasts they produce, or offer special powers such            as the ability to shove bombs across the screen.                        It's a simple concept which can prove strangely addictive,            particularly when played head-to-head against human opponents, and            thanks to the wonders of the GameBoy Advance's link cable up to            four people can play Bomberman Tournament using a single cartridge.            Solo gamers can test their skills against three difficulty levels            of AI opponent, although this can be a little boring if you find            yourself knocked out early in a round and then have to watch the            rest of the bombermen battling it out for another two minutes.                    Bomberman Tournament comes with eight maps, which might not sound            like much until you realise that although the fixed scenery is            constant, the positions of the power-ups and the destructible            objects that conceal them are randomly adjusted every game.                        All of the maps offer a change of scenery, ranging from lunar            craters and go kart circuits to a winter wonderland of igloos, fir            trees and snowmen. Some of them also radically change the gameplay,            adding landmines, teleporter pads and conveyor belts into the            equation. There is even a ~hi power~ map which starts with no            obstructions apart from the fixed grid of permanent blocks, and            gives every player the most powerful bombs from the outset, leading            to explosions that can span almost the entire screen. Personally I            found this map a little too frantic, but there's plenty of            choice on offer.                        This is aided by a range of options which allow you to set            everything from the number of rounds and the time limit for each to            more bizarre offerings such as ~fishing~ and ~revenge~. Enabling            fishing allows the winner of each match to indulge in a little            angling, using a fishing rod to grab a power-up floating beneath            their boat which they will then start the next match with.            Meanwhile the revenge option causes dead players to appear on the            sidelines of the arena, from where they can lob bombs at the living            to get their own back. Switching this to ~super revenge~ even            allows fallen opponents to get back into the game if they can blow            up one of the remaining players.                    It's not all about multiplayer mayhem though, and Bomberman            Tournament also includes a Quest mode. This is essentially classic            Bomberman gameplay married to a Japanese-style role-playing game,            with added Pokemon elements thrown in for good measure.                        Instead of limiting the action to a single small arena, the Quest            mode allows you to wander around villages, forests and mountains in            search of a missing colleague. There are shrubs to blow up, buttons            to activate, blocks to push around, a variety of characters to talk            to, monsters to kill, fortresses to explore and bosses to destroy.                        Annoyingly though the game often forgets the scenery and enemies            which you have destroyed when you travel between zones, and as the            game world is fairly open and a fair degree of backtracking is            involved you can find yourself battling through the same locations            two or three times. You can also abuse this ~feature~ to gather            more power-ups, which can be found by blowing up obstructions, much            as in the standard battle mode.                    These power-ups don't effect your own character, but the ~karabon~            which you carry. These are essentially Pokemon clones which can be            found scattered throughout the game or created by merging two you            have already collected, and each has its own unique special            ability, allowing you to kick bombs, teleport between villages and            push special blocks around.                        The power-ups uncovered by blowing up the scenery can boost their            defensive, offensive or special attack skills, but these stats are            only used in rare and pointless karabon duels. Theoretically the            outcome of a fight is determined by the sequence of moves you            select at the beginning and the elemental nature of the karabon            involved - fire, earth, water and electricity. All of this is            largely academic though, because if you are reasonably            conscientious about clearing the scenery to discover power-ups your            karabon will often be so much more powerful than your opponent that            the battle is over after a single blow.                        Overall though the Quest mode is fairly entertaining, with all            kinds of bizarre sub-missions to carry out, including photographing            a giant green rabbit and recovering a lost fishing hook. There's a            wide selection of enemies to blow up and varied scenery to explore,            as well as a handful of mini-games to try your luck with. It's            hardly groundbreaking stuff, and indeed Quest modes have appeared            in various forms in previous Bomberman games, but it does provide a            welcome change of pace if you want to waste half an hour on the way            to the office.                        Which pretty much sums up Bomberman Tournament. It's nothing we            haven't seen before, but the simplistic gameplay and cute            cartoonish graphics work well on Nintendo's new hand-held. Solo            gamers will miss out on a lot of the fun, but even the single            player modes are enjoyable enough. And if you have one or more            like-minded friends with a GameBoy Advance then it's a bit of a            no-brainer, especially as you only need one copy of the game for            the link-up multiplayer mode."}
