It mildly impressed the gaming            journalists who critically analysed it, but the public remained            unconvinced; it sold fairly well, but its crude difficulty levels            left it impenetrable and untouchable to the majority.                         Rayman 2 has been completely overhauled though - it's in true 3D            for starters, and its previously hardcore puzzles are now taxing,            but nothing frustrating. Thanks greatly to this; the game is very            accessible, both to young and old.                         Instead of simply rehashing an old platform title in a different            guise, Rayman 2 borrows the odd bit here and there, but the best            sections have been put together by the creative geniuses at            Ubisoft, and it all melds them all together into one seamless            classic.             Despite being developed in the West, Rayman 2            features the over-the-top madness approach of its Nipponese            competitors in abundance. Each of the non-player-characters (NPCs)            that you meet is Manga-like in appearance and full of quirky tales            and one-liners. The way that you read the subtitles while the            characters spiel unintelligible gibberish is one such Japanesey            touch that adds to the experience. Larger than life characters like            the hefty ~Globox~ and the colourful ~Teensies~ set the story            alight and compel you to continue, in much the same way as Mario 64            did when Nintendo unveiled it.                         Again in true Japanese platform style, the artwork is exquisitely            rendered, from shimmering waterfalls to rocky outcrops, it all            looks beautiful and your jaw will definitely hit the ground on            occasion. I had to pinch myself at times to remind myself that this            was a console game, not a high-end PC title. In fact, the genre is            basically there, right now.                         You view all this spectacular scenery from a camera positioned            Tomb Raider-style just above and behind our hero. Unlike the            aforementioned adventure title though, Rayman 2's camera moves and            positions itself perfectly to view the action and rarely needs            adjustment, although that thoughtful option is still easily            accessible via the Dreamcast's X and Y            buttons. Accessible is probably the best word to describe            Rayman 2's control system on the whole. It's flawlessly executed            for the most part, although Rayman's swimming mechanics are a bit            irksome. On the whole though, controlling Rayman is simple and            instantaneous; there's no half-second pause between cause and            effect, which is present in other, lesser platform titles, and the            game makes wonderful use of the whole Dreamcast controller.                         New abilities and options are presented to you via a cunning            in-game tutorial interface. Whenever you see a ~magical stone~, you            walk up to and jump on it and a little green flying chappy appears            from nowhere, glimmering with magical dust and instructs you on a            new technique or gives you a valuable clue on how to complete a            particular puzzle. Even hours into the game, I found my useful            companion revealing movements and techniques that I would never            have figured upon!                         The puzzles are never conceptually challenging, thanks to clearly            defined graphics. You can always either see what the            solution is and it's the physical task of achieving it that            requires thought, or you can ascertain how you're going to            be tested in order to complete it. Usually your charming chum in            the air will offer a hint for success too.                         Some puzzles trigger in-game cutscenes and pre-defined action            sequences, such a bouncing down river rapids in a barrel or racing            away from an approaching pirate ship, and thanks to the responsive            control system, split second decisions are possible, and            necessary in order to succeed.             The soundtrack is another area that impressed me.            From raging torrents of rock to accompany the action sequences to            the soothing ambience of your more benign surroundings, everything            fits in perfectly. Sound effects too, are precise and at time            coquettish. I really enjoyed them and even turned down my customary            Stereo-gaming-accompaniment in order to hear them better.                         In fact, there's very little of Rayman 2 that I found            disagreeable. It's over fairly quickly, a quite insignificant 11 or            12 hours should suffice, which is nothing by today's standards, but            you only notice it because you're so desperately scrabbling through            the thing that time really does fly past you.                    Ubisoft could have chosen a very different route with Rayman 2.            They could quite easily have just created a Mario-a-like 3D            platformer and shovelled it onto store shelves with a broad grin,            ready to rake in the money, but they haven't, they've done their            homework and found what makes the genre tick, then melded it all            together, throwing in their own innovative design ideas and            approaches, and squeezed Rayman 2 out of it all.                         It's not just one thing that sets it apart either, every            department has done their job. There are even Dreamcast-exclusive            sub-games to be found within the mayhem - there's just so much to            do and see, it really does make you wonder what all these other            games developers have been wasting their time doing while this has            been in production.                         One last thing that I would like to say, and this is for those of            you out there who might criticize console gaming as a kiddies            alternative to the real thing, and who might argue that there's no            skill in the creation of a console game; if you don't think console            game development is a creditable artform, take a spin in Rayman's            world and think again.                        - Out Now"}
