We were almost uneasy            ducking, weaving and racing for cover in NovaLogic's latest Delta            Force release, but questionable ethics aside, the real question on            every gamer's lips is whether it can rival the other major tactical            shooter out in March, Raven Shield. Can it, or is it destined to            recoil into the shadows?        The first Delta Force title            really impressed some years back, because we hadn't seen anything            like it before. Huge, rolling landscapes driven by a voxel-based            engine, coupled with simplistic sniper gunnery and seasoned with            one-shot-kill dynamics for tension, all came together in a rather            engaging package. The series steadily declined over the years,            however, and the last we saw of it was the incredibly lacklustre            Task Force Dagger.                    Obviously prompted by the book and film of the same name, but not            borrowing directly from the scenes therein, Black Hawk Down is a            vast improvement from the outset. Set in Somalia, the game            sometimes accurately portrays the events that occurred in 1993,            when the UN entered the country in order to provide aid for the            raging famine that was blighting the citizens, in the face of a            collapsed government and factional clan power struggles. The UN's            job of delivering aid where it was needed was severely crippled by            some clans who would attack and loot aid convoys, relying on            starving other warring factions as a weapon. The chief problem was            one General Aidid and his Mogadishu-based clan Habr Gedir.                    Your operations picks up just at the time of the events that give            the game its name, when US soldiers were deployed to arrest Aidid            and his lieutenants. Two Black Hawk helicopters were brought down            during the operation, and 18 soldiers were killed in a battle that            stretched the length of the US involvement in Somalia to months. If            you've seen the Ridley Scott film, you'll recall the scenes of            horrific and tense fighting as troops are constantly pinned down by            hundreds of raging Somali footmen, and the game usually depicts            this feeling quite accurately.        To            start with, the majority of the game looks the part. Most of the            time, you're charged with rooftop and ground-based assaults on            shantytowns, where the architecture comprises tin boxes and ruined            concrete blocks. NovaLogic has actually done a fine job of making            this look good as good as it can, and as you swoop in overhead on            board a Black Hawk for the first time picking off rooftop enemies            with a side-mounted minigun, the experience is actually quite            exhilarating.                    There are some wonderful special effects at work too, such as the            dust kicking up into your face interfering with your vision            appropriately, and the water swirling and frothing as your chopper            takes you low. Bullets strike and spark off the tin housing, and            kick up puffs of sand, and bullet-riddled vehicles explode with            convincing cinematic enormity, sending flaming tyres and debris            skywards.                    Areas that could have done with some work occasionally ruin the            experience, however, such as some strange clipping problems where            characters end up with limbs through doors, or the floor of a            helicopter for example. Also, character models in general could            have done with a great deal more work; your troops are low-poly and            quite poorly animated, while the hundreds of Somali soldiers -            despite being far more favourably animated than their American            counterparts, particularly in the death animations - take their            form from a stock of about three or four different models which            gets very boring, very quickly.        The game's main tactic is to just fling enemy after enemy at            you, as the clan members were not the most sophisticated or well            trained of soldiers. The AI on show depict as much, and while            enemies will occasionally attempt to duck out of the way or find            cover, they're usually just happy to run kamikaze-like toward their            deaths in the hope that they can overwhelm you with numbers.            Sometimes their thinking really does glitch, however, when you            catch one standing in a hallway shooting at a wall, or another            standing still and staring at you without flinching.                    Your teammates are marginally better equipped in the brain            department, and will usually follow simple orders issued to them            via the SWAT 3-style command menu with efficiency. Occasionally            though, they seem to get stuck in a rut of absolutely infuriating            inadequacy.                    Most of our problems with the team AI all occurred on one mission            where it was our job to clear out a garage of enemy foot soldiers.            As we cautiously led our team inside, they were so keen to get on            with the job that they completely disregarded any thought of being            careful, and barged us into the room headfirst whereby we were            promptly shot in the face. Reload; try again. We made it into the            garage and cleared it out properly this time, and were notified of            masses of incoming troops. We take up positions and the enemies            start to flood in. Some of them make it into the garage, but our            soldiers seemed more interested in staring at them or shooting at            either walls or us than the enemy. The number of times we watched a            trooper turn around in the middle of combat and slaughter us for no            apparent reason was stunning, and at times it ruined an otherwise            competent game for us.        Mission types are surprisingly varied, from chopper-to-rooftop            assaults and nighttime stealth raids, to air and ground-based            vehicular attacks which are like on-rails shooting sections in            which you man a mounted machine gun. Usually, one single mission            will encompass a mixture of these different dynamics, and it lends            the action a very fluid, on-the-fly feel despite a strictly linear            progression and a scripted approach to much of the combat.                    The feature-packed multiplayer mode doesn't really engage, sadly.            It seems as if NovaLogic has concentrated on packing in as many            features as they could, when what we really could have done with            was their concentrating on developing a decent Counter-Strike-style            game and perfecting it. As it stands the various modes on            offer serve as a diversion and not a lot more.                    After giving the game a decent amount of play, to compare it to            something like Raven Shield would be grossly unfair. They're            completely different types of game; Raven Shield is one for the            hardcore - minutely detailed tactical pornography, so good it has            to be bad for you. Black Hawk Down is simply a fun shooter, with            mere designs on being squad-based, instead thrusting you into some            sort of crazed Rambo role as chief gunner.                    While the subject matter itself is indeed not to be taken lightly,            Black Hawk Down is in the end a fun and fairly rudimentary shooter.            At the start it fools you with its waypoints and its (barely used)            command interfaces and stacks of weaponry, but once you get            properly stuck into it there's very little that isn't            straightforward about it. There are moments of sheer hellish            frustration that marred the experience for us somewhat, but the            majority of the game is enjoyable, and overall we would have            trouble criticising it too much on that basis.                    You might not think that we need another first person shooter in            our collections, but when such a simple game can be fun,            exhilarating, affecting, tense and stressful all at once, you begin            to wonder why you ever needed more. It's no Raven Shield, but it's            a return to form for NovaLogic."}
