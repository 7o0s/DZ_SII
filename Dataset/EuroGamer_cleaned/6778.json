But the question is; can the game stave off            competition from the likes of GT Advance 2, which has had time to            refine itself, and propel itself into pole position as the serious            handheld racer? Surprisingly, and despite numerous problems, it            can!                         Graphically it's a cut above ever other GBA racer currently on the            market, with lots of relatively detailed trackside scenery with            simple polygonal buildings, banks of trees and bushes, spectators            flashing cameras and uniformly excellent texturing. Although there            are similarities to Outrun, with the car centred in the middle of            the screen and the landscape rolling beneath your car as you speed            along, tracks are littered with rises and falls, sharp bends and            narrow straights, and the overall sense of three dimensions has            been conveyed V-convincingly, which makes all the difference.                         The handling of the cars is a bit slippery, but like the illusion            of 3D, it's mostly convincing, and the toggleable in-car view (in            itself a triumph for a GBA racer) adds to the effect. Sadly, there            isn't much evidence of a damage engine except when using the in-car            view, which emphasizes collisions by adding huge streaking cracks            to the windscreen, making it harder and harder to see where you're            going, but as you'll soon learn, V-Rally 3 isn't to be taken as a            sim. Rounding off the vehicular side of things, sound effects are            very bassy and believable, with the engine revving hard between            gears and tyres throwing up gut-wrenching screeches. Crash noises            are also suitably crunchy.                         Unfortunately there are some out-of-body issues which do need            addressing, like the amount of pop-up as you speed along, leading            this writer to speculate that some greater entity was still            shovelling bricks and mortar together a few metres ahead. The            collision detection and clipping can also be a bit flaky, with the            camera revealing more than it should on occasions, and then there's            the issue of invisible barriers shoehorning the player along the            track. Mistime a jump and head in the direction of the boundary and            you'll find yourself scraping down the side and onto the track            without disturbing the foliage. Fortunately though, various faults            are soon forgotten, because V-Rally 3 is incredibly fun to play.                    Your standard V-Rally mode invites you to compete in a number of            circuits all over the world, each comprising five stages, with 20            or so other racers trying to post a better time than you. Tracks            here are rally-style point A to point B, with no visible on-track            opposition. V-Rally Cross mode is an alternative, more arcadey mode            with five ~licenses~ to acquire (unlocked sequentially), each            consisting of a simple circuit demanding several laps. You compete            against three other cars on the track, first in a normal mode and            second going round the track the other way.                         The problem here is that the game is way too easy. I completed the            whole of V-Rally Cross in one go, and V-Rally mode slipped past me            in about a day, leaving me to ponder to where the rest of it had            disappeared off. There are also Time Trial and Multiplayer modes,            but as V-Rally mode is effectively a time trial anyway, that isn't            going to help. Multiplayer mode is more of a package, with Time            Trial and V-Rally Cross options so you can race your chums            theoretically and physically.                         The developer has clearly attempted to spice up proceedings here            and there by adding in multiple car manufacturers and lots of            tweaking options for your car, with tyres, steering, suspension and            so on all given multiple settings (and speaking of tweaks, you can            have speed displayed in KPH or MPH - hurrah!). Sadly though, the            tweaks are mostly for show, and the different car manufacturers            don't add a huge amount anyway. Thanks to layers of advertising            plastered over them the rally cars all look alike, and due to the            lack of formidable opposition, V-Rally 3 is more of an arcade racer            to be played without too much brain input, so there isn't much            impetus to complete it with every manufacturer.                         So how come V-Rally 3 is good, if it's so intimately flawed? Quite            simply, it's just plain fun. Zooming around a rally circuit in a            pretty friendly environment, braking into corners and lurching this            way and that makes for very compelling gameplay. The game feels            fast, maintaining a solid framerate and the track design is nicely            varied and challenging, even if you still win whether you bounce            off walls or not. Ultimately, you forget about the problems and            find yourself switching it on to unwind while you're blabbering on            the phone to an aged relative, or sat on a sweaty sardine tin of a            train in the middle of July.                    It seems odd that I'm summarising a game with so many problems and            all I can think about is how much I want to finish so I can dart            off and play it again, but in truth, I really am! Despite its            flaws, V-Rally 3 is an extremely enjoyable racer - it falls some            way short of Mario Kart Super Circuit and Konami Krazy Racers in            the handheld racing genre, but it's a very different game to those            two, and if you fancy some light-hearted rally driving of a            PlayStation calibre on your handheld, this is the answer. Just            don't expect to be uncovering new things for too long."}
