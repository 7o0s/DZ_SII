Owing to the General's            untimely departure during the war, Archer was put in charge of the            Gunmen; a group of soldiers looking like something from the US            colonial wars. Now the Xenomes are back in force, only this time            there appears to be someone calling the shots.                    It is time for you, Major Archer, to stand up and snuff out this            menace once and for all. The aliens are wiping your troops out, and            it is now up to you to face the genetically enhanced aliens, and to            eliminate whoever or whatever is controlling them. With just your            knife and a nervous group of soldiers at your side you head off for            the planet to unravel the mysteries within .. but you are most            certainly not alone.                    Gunman Chronicles began life as a free user-made ~total conversion~            for Half-Life, and its developers, Rewolf Software, are a group of            designers, artists and programmers from various parts of the globe            who all met online. But the project caught the attention of            publisher Sierra and eventually became a full retail publication,            the first new stand-alone release built on the Half-Life engine.         Gunman            begins with a great video scene setter, which despite its            relatively poor visual quality in places serves to set the scene            nicely. After this you are dropped into the familiar Half-Life            driven first person world of Gunman Chronicles, beginning with a            tutorial that shows you how to perform basic manoeuvres, and more            importantly weapons handling.                    You might be thinking that you won't need to be shown how to            operate the weapons, and indeed you could very well enter the foray            using the basic weapon modes and go on to complete the game.            However, you would not be getting the most of them, in particular            the M.U.L.E. (Multiple Unit Launch Engine) which is fully            programmable to fire rockets in all manner of combinations. With            the exception of the humble knife, all of the weapons have an            alternative firing mode of some description.                    There isn't a vast array of weapons in the game, but they are all            solid mad chuckling fun, and with the programmable element it gives            them enough variety to prevent them becoming boring. The one thing            that confuses the hell out of me though is why you begin the game            armed only with a knife, when your accompanying troops all wield            firearms. Admittedly it is not that long before you come across the            pistol, but it is still a little weird nonetheless.                    Apart from this though the story is built up nicely from the            opening sequence, and there are four different worlds to be            explored in the game. I found the desert location to be by far the            most enjoyable, riddled with scorpions, genetically modified            dinosaurs, and of course rogue Gunmen. What makes this section            particularly good though is you get to drive around in a tank            letting rip with guided missiles, rockets and twin machine gun            turrets. Oh the simple pleasures in life!         The            bestiary in Gunman Chronicles ranges from the hugely impressive to            the extremely dull and uninspired. You will discover a couple of            huge monsters in the game which are guaranteed to astound and            impress, and if you are of a nervous disposition probably scare you            witless too!                    Unfortunately not enough is made of these creatures, and the giant            dinosaur you discover near the beginning of the game is never seen            again after. It would certainly make for a far more scary            experience if more enemies of this size were used in the game. The            biomechanical and alien creatures look great though, with neat            animation and impressive firepower, but there are a couple of poor            inclusions. For example, the alien that looks like a pink scorpion            is particularly uninspired, and looks almost like they have taken            the acid spitting critter from Half-Life and stuck a different            model on top. On the flipside you have the rather fearsome            creatures with a flower like crown who fire homing green insects at            you, which are almost totally inescapable.                    Enemy AI is generally good, inheriting the established Half-Life AI            code, but still suffers from the same gung-ho nature of some of the            enemies, most notably that of the human opposition. Often they hide            behind something and then roll out into the open letting all guns            blaze for a few seconds, which makes them a stupidly easy target to            hit in the meantime.         The Half-Life engine            is still pumping out eye candy as ever, with my only criticism            being levelled at the poor quality background images that fail to            give the game any real sense of depth. The landscape detail is            excellent, and some of the buildings you get to creep around are            straight from the Counter-Strike top drawer. When the only sound            inside one particular building is the tick-tock of a grandfather            clock and your clumping footsteps on the floorboards, the sense of            dread is amazingly real.                    The enemies are all superbly animated, with the aliens having a            flesh-like quality that at times is quite grotesque to look at.            Rogue soldiers look fabulous in their assorted cowboy style            garments, and really give the game a kind of strange Wild West            feel. The ability for the Half-Life engine to handle large ships            and monsters is in evidence again, and you will be astonished at            some of the examples of this within the game.                    Voice acting is fine, but lacks a decent sample definition which            means they are often lost in the environment sounds going on around            you, and also sound annoyingly tinny. There is far too much reverb            going on too, and frequently in places that really would not            reverberate sound in a million years.         I have been            deliberately vague about the locations and enemies in the game, for            to go into any further detail risks spoiling the game for you.            Gunman Chronicles has a cracking storyline running throughout with            its fair share of twists and turns. All of this is set upon some            truly stunning landscapes and against some pretty fearsome foes.            Though the AI has its flaws and a couple of the enemies are            unimaginative to say the least, the game still shines through.                    With a little more thought put into the puzzle elements of the            game, and a few other nips and tucks this could well have been            something truly special. It is still a good blast though, even if            the price tag is a little extreme for a game which is essentially            just another Half-Life mission pack. Certainly a worthy addition to            your single player FPS collection."}
