It would be a sign that the right team - a team that had already made a decent Transformers game, when left to its own devices - could tackle that most treacherous of propositions, the movie tie-in, and emerge with something brilliant. Sadly, this is not a particularly just world. The bad go unpunished, the good are rarely rewarded, and Dark of the Moon is yet another victim of the brutal race to match a film\u2019s release date.High Moon\u2019s follow-up to the thoroughly decent War for Cybertron isn\u2019t a disaster, it\u2019s just rushed. Tied to a movie\u2019s schedule, the designers have opted for a single-player campaign that\u2019s limp, unambitious and short, and bolted it onto a multiplayer suite with only three game modes, two of which end in \u201cdeath match\u201d.The plot, which provides a confused build-up to the new film, leaves the developers messing around with Michael Bay\u2019s off-cuts, while the cinematics, front-end and absence of co-op support all suggest something that was put together with one eye on the clock. This feels like a work project rather than a game: you can sign off on the deliverables, but you won\u2019t really want to play it.What really does Dark of the Moon in is a lack of weight. Whether you\u2019re clomping through the campaign as a three-storey robot or firing explosive rounds from the gun you\u2019ve got bolted to your arm, Dark of the Moon struggles to create a convincing world of heavy metal and ten-ton warriors.The robots you get to play as may look the part - character models have a toymaker\u2019s eye for detailing, transformations are suitably intricate and the voice actors are all there and doing their best to provide Shakespearian treatments of lines like \u201cYou must defeat Mixmaster!\u201d - but they float through a series of environments that often barely register their presence. There are no earth-shaking thuds as Ironhide drops down from a ledge, and little in the way of genuine impact as Soundwave fires off a sonic boom. In the Detroit section you can blow nearby cars to pieces, but there\u2019s little to indicate that you\u2019re genuinely causing extra-terrestrial havoc.Beyond that crucial disappointment, the campaign\u2019s something of a non-event. The story\u2019s made up of seven missions that shuffle you back and forth between roles as A-list Autobots and Decepticons, but two of those stages are little more than slightly expanded boss fights. While the levels often come with pretty skyboxes, whether you\u2019re in a chewed-up urban centre or a Mayan ruin complete with a terrible secret, you\u2019ll likely find yourself moving through endless corridors and clearing out room after room of identikit enemies."}
