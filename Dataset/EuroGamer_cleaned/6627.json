Total and            utter global domination. Swirls around the mouth nicely, doesn't            it? Imagine the power, and feel your ego stir. You are a world            leader, and nothing can stand in your way! A crazy dream? Maybe,            but it fuels the strategy market.                    Yeah, yeah, powermongerdom is the classic gaming nerd clich\u00e9,            and the hardcore RTS player has long been considered a bearded            loner, hunched at his PC, shaping the destiny of his little sprite            legions. But they're a loyal group, armchair strategists, and it's            this market of die-hard study-dwellers that EA is targeting with            its recent bid for global domination of global domination. Between            C&C, SimCity and Anno 1503: The New World, they're making quite            an effort.                    What's that last one you say? Well you'd be forgiven for not            knowing, as the previous game in the series, Anno 1602, made little            impact here in Blighty. It was nonetheless the biggest-selling PC            game in Germany (so some of you will be familiar with it), and made            enough of an impact for EA to pick up distribution and add it to            its roster. So how does it measure up? Is it worthy of standing            high with those other two behemoths of the strategy world? And what            is this strange growth on Eurogamer's chin?        The scene is set during the opening credits as a young boy            listens to an old seadog's tale of adventure on the high seas - the            hardships, the excitement, and the opportunities. But be warned:            any spirit of discovery will be quashed should you boldly decide to            skip the tutorials on offer. We cannot stress enough how much you            need them. It's a tough and dangerous world out there, and you            won't get far unprepared. Thankfully, the tutorials are friendly            and accessible, teaching you the basics of town planning, trading            and combat. Structured as they are in a logical, step-by-step            approach, you leave them with a good understanding of the game            mechanics and should be prepared for the challenge ahead. But don't            expect to be instantly proficient, as this is a difficult game that            benefits from a measured approach.                    Properly educated you'll be ready for one of the three game types            on offer. The campaign game is structured around a story, and you            will be set targets to reach or tasks to perform, the achievement            of which will unlock the next chapter in the story and set new            goals. The temptation for many will be to rush straight into this.            We've gotten used to endless narratives in our games and feel            comfortable with the structure that they offer. But, make no            mistake, this is really hard going, a certain skill level and            experience is assumed, and unless you are already proficient within            the Anno world it will be a frustrating experience. So save it for            later, look on it as a treat to be enjoyed once you have become            skilled in the game styles employed here.                    The best place to start is the continuous game - the familiar,            open-ended strategy game that tradition demands. There is no            ultimate goal as such, you just keep on going as long as you want,            the challenge being to expand your empire and build up your cities            until you fill the map. There are plenty of levels to choose from            to match your experience and the type of game you want. You can            choose to operate in a peaceful world filled with fertile lands or            choose a harsher existence with aggressive inhabitants.        What makes this the best place to start is the excellent            auto-help feature, which is missing from the campaign game. As you            play, alerts will highlight your mistakes and give tips on making            progress. We found that this was essential to learning how to make            our way in the Anno world, and it gave the game such a high level            of accessibility that despite its eventual toughness, we'd have no            qualms about recommending it to strategy debutants. There is also            an indexed help section that covers every element of the game in            fantastic detail, though we wouldn't recommend you try to get by            just by reading this, as it is encyclopedic in size. Reading            through this lot would test the patience of the most Zen-like            gamer. So stick with auto-help as your initial guide then use the            indexed section as a memory jogger or reference manual.                    Graphically, Anno 1503 may not employ the latest in 3D bump-mapping            delights, but it is nevertheless very pleasing to behold. The            landscapes are well detailed and the buildings impressive. In fact            you, like us, will be impressed at the care and attention that has            gone into the look and the feel of the game. The islands that fill            the world have distinctive terrains from desert through to ice            regions, with the appropriate fauna and flora - nothing less than            you'd expect from Sunflowers Interactive, mind. There are various            tribes of inhabitants also appropriate to their location and the            impression is that of a fully functioning ecosystem.                    The user interface is fairly simple, employing the usual mouse and            menu system, with the left button selecting menu options or units            in the play area and the right performing actions depending on the            context-sensitive cursor. Mostly the gameplay focuses on just two            of the four menus; one for building and one titled 'info', which            holds the various options for the unit you have selected. The other            two menus provide player stats and configuration options. We found            this to be a simple, effective system. Initially, we feared that            the simplicity indicated a lack of depth but thankfully we were            proved wrong. At times there is so much going on that a more            complicated control interface would only hamper the player.        Building a            settlement is a matter of organising supply chains. You can build            units to harvest or mine raw materials such as wood or stone, and            then you need to build more units to refine your materials into            finished products. Finally you need warehouses to store the            finished products and marketplaces to trade or distribute them to            your population. Thankfully, setting up an economy is reasonably            easy once you have an understanding of these supply chains.                    When selected, each unit shows a highlighted area of the map known            as the service area, and the next part of the chain needs to be            within this area for the process to work. Building roads is also            essential to link parts of the chain together. Before long you will            have a thriving network of workshops and farms supplying each other            and producing the goods you need to keep the population happy. Once            a supply chain is set up it will pretty much run itself, as long as            there is a sufficient supply of raw material. When you build a            sheep farm, for example, it is important to demolish trees in the            service area so that there is sufficient grazing land.                    Micromanagement is limited to switching production on and off - for            units that supply two or more goods, halting production of one will            increase production of the other. Again, this may be seen as a            little shallow for this type of game, but there is so much crammed            in that we can't really complain and indeed feel that the overall            balance is so good that an overemphasis on micromanagement would            harm the dynamic.        As more houses are built the            population will increase and other types of building are made            available to you. Clicking on a house shows the needs of the            population, and as these demands are met, the civilisation will            advance from pioneer to settler and so on through five levels. One            rather neat touch is being able to hear vocal prompts from the            people regarding their requirements at the closest level of zoom.            For example, you will hear superstitious comments until a church is            built and the religious requirements are met.                    One early quirk that took us by surprise was the thirst of the            inhabitants. For a town of 150, we needed three farms: one            producing food and the other two to meet the alcohol demand. As the            only crop available to plant was potato, we can only assume that            our people had a taste for the hard stuff, although this seems to            be an isolated oddity. As the population grows you will need            additional supply chains to meet their needs and a cycle of growth            and development emerges that is both challenging and rewarding.                    It is essential that you develop a self-sufficient colony fairly            early on, as one resource that you can't easily harvest is money.            In the beginning, you can trade for raw materials that you can't            make yourself, with regular ships that stop at your harbour, but            you'll soon be penniless unless you start producing the essentials            yourself. Once you are self-sufficient you can start trading in the            more luxurious goods that, while not essential to survival, do meet            the requirements for the population to advance. Exploring the map            by sailing around and sending out scouts will uncover more natural            resources to harvest and other colonies to trade with or conquer.            Trading is initially is pretty easy and is further simplified by            setting up automated trading routes.                    This all makes for a satisfyingly complete game in itself, but the            ante is further upped when you start building military            installations. The construction of a small fort will allow you to            train troops of various skills depending on your available            resources and civilisation level. This is fairly familiar in            gameplay terms to C&C choose a gathering point for the fort on            the map than select the type soldier to train. A progress bar ticks            up - if you have enough cash - and a little guy emerges to wait by            the gathering point. By this process an army is built.        Once again the attention to detail is            evident; this is no tacked on feature. There are 14 types of            military unit from pike men to archers and cannon crew, fighting            styles can be adjusted from passive to aggressive depending on the            situation, and combat itself has a simple paper, scissors, stone            basis where a swordsman beats an archer close up, and cavalry will            beat swordsmen. This works really well, and when you are in the            midst of battle it will feel a long way from simple.                    Storming a city, for instance, requires you to employ appropriate            troops to take on the defenders, then siege towers or catapults can            be used to breach the walls. Finally, taking control of a city is a            matter of reducing the main market building to rubble then sending            a scout to build your own market building on the same spot, against            a time limit or the economy will collapse and the city will            disappear.                    Defending your own city also becomes important; walls and cannon            emplacements can be built to achieve this. The sight of a large            army on the offensive is always impressive and this area of the            game is similarly well implemented. One niggle on the control front            is that the viewpoint is isometric, but the selecting box you can            draw around troops isn't. This can cause some problems selecting            groups of soldiers in the heat of battle, but is only really a            minor irritation.                    So, rather like Norwich City's woeful performances of late, it's            very much a game of two halves, but unlike the Canaries, they're            halves that work so well together. Fusing the city-building dynamic            of SimCity with the real time warfare of C&C may sound            ambitious, but that's exactly what Anno 1503 attempts, and to a            large part achieves.                    It's always a tricky balancing act when two styles of play are            catered for, and the streets of gaming are littered with the            corpses of rotting titles that fell off this tightrope. Eyebrows            are always raised when a developer claims to have merged game            styles; you can't help but brace yourself for the ill-conceived            tacked-on combat or trading element. But it's obvious when playing            Anno that its evolution has been natural, and, a few niggles aside,            it works as a cohesive whole.                    Don't get us wrong; Anno 1503 is not perfect, but so many            well-implemented features have been crammed in that we can forgive            a few minor irritations. We can safely say that the combat and            trading aspects of the game contain enough depth to be good            examples of each genre. Not benchmark, but good. Put them together            though and you do have a game that deserves to be called great.            It's obvious that this has been very much a labour of love from            Sunflowers; once bitten by the game you can't fail to be impressed            by the level of care and attention within. Definitely a big enough            challenge for the hardcore, yet accessible enough for the beginner,            Anno 1503 earns its place next to the big hitters\u2026 and,            thankfully, the beards are optional."}
