Needless to say, last year's Crash Bandicoot XS has been one of the            elite few commercially successful titles on the handheld platform -            shifting around 100,000 copies in the UK to date. It's a rarity for            us to be in possession of a GBA review cart, so it's safe to assume            that Vivendi has high hopes for this 'keenly-awaited' sequel, but            will fans of the grinning, apple-gobbling Marsupial want to splash            out another thirty odd quid?                    With 26 million sales worldwide of the various Crash Bandicoot            games, the chances are you'll know the drill by now. Yep, it's            another colourful platform romp about smashing crates, chomping            apples, and defeating a succession of evil henchmen. Except this            time the bad guys are your chums, who have been brainwashed by the            ~hypnotically evil~ N. Trance, who has teamed up with the nefarious            N. Tropy, the mastermind of evil from Crash's last pocket outing.            Suffice to say it's up to you to face off against them and wrench            them back from the dark side.                    As with the previous adventure, the action takes place in left to            right side-scrolling 2D. The game could hardly be less complicated            to explain: guide Crash to the portal (exit) at the far right of            each level, smashing crates, collecting apples, negotiating traps            and enemies, before eventually finding your way to the level's            exit. The game is set across 40 levels, encompassing eight distinct            environments, and each houses a wakeboarding sub-level, a Marble            Madness-style sub-level, as well as the obligatory end of world            boss encounter. Mercifully, for this platform-overdosed reviewer            (14 in three months and counting) it's not just a marathon            of jumping, spinning, collectathon antics.                    Given that platforming is officially the most oversubscribed genre            in gaming, let's concentrate on what's new, rather than what's been            done before. This time around, Crash gets to play with new crates            and new moves, which adds a vital element of variety to the            proceeding. To start with Crash is merely capable of jumping (A),            spinning (B) with a floor slide manoeuvre possible by running and            tapping R - a belly-flop move can also be pulled off by jumping and            tapping R. But as a reward for completing a world and thus            converting one of your buddies back, you get a new move added to            your roster; the Rocket Jump (press L and A together) allows for            super high leaps, the Tornado Spin (push B repeatedly) gives Crash            a longer spin and a temporary float ability, while the Super Slide            (Hold down L and R while running) lets our hero smash into a            succession of crates or just slide further, with more added as you            plough through the marathon 40 levels.                    To add to the new moves is a selection of new crates, each of which            gives Crash temporary abilities. Copter, as the name implies, gives            Mr Bandicoot the brief chance to hover around levels, while Flying            Carpet allows him to float around and, curiously, shoot baddies            while he's at it.        Interspersed            with the platforming comes the welcome interruption of the            Atlasphere levels, along with the enjoyable Wakeboarding levels.            The former tasks you with guiding the 'monkeyballed' Crash around            trap-laden isometric environments in the manner of mid-80s Atari            arcade classic Marble Madness. The principle is the same as the            platform levels, with Crash breaking open as many crates as            possible, avoiding obstacles and fatal Nitro crates, with the aim            of reaching the exit, all the while using just A to brake, and B to            speed up. Unexpectedly, these levels prove to be the highlight of            Crash's latest adventure, requiring a level of concentration and            skill, and providing a satisfying interlude to relentless            platforming.                    The Wakeboarding levels also provide a decent sub-quest, with Crash            being dragged into the screen at high speed, on the run from a            hungry shark. Naturally, plenty of apples and crates are there for            the taking, while ramps allow Crash to reach the higher goodies as            well as avoiding Jaws. Graphically, it's a treat for a GBA title,            and certainly an unusual perspective.                    The regular boss encounters, meanwhile, are seemingly simple on the            surface, but nearly always require multiple lives and continues to            beat, as well as the patience of a saint. If you can stop yourself            swearing and/or beating up your GBA, then the chances are you're            doing very well indeed. One boss in particular stands out as a very            neat piece of gaming design, and that's the fake Crash, which            mirrors your movements. Bumping into him kills you, so you're            forced to guide him over a series of spikes, with the aim of            forcing your doppelganger into them instead. Simple, cunning and            fiendishly difficult all at the same time, and undoubtedly one of            the highlights of a game otherwise not brimming with invention.                    Visually it's crisp, colourful, well animated fare, perfectly            suited to a diminutive platformer, without ever really stretching            the machine's capabilities. Developer Vicarious Visions has a proud            record of hits on the platform now, and clearly knows what its            doing, but given the game's fan base, its hardly surprising Crash's            latest outing doesn't differ wildly from what's gone before.                    All told, it's an evolutionary affair, with just about enough            variation to hold your interest for a good ten hours or so if you            can stick with it. Once you're 20 odd levels in (which is unlikely            to take you more than three hours), things do start to get            seriously tricky, so don't be put off by the ridiculous ease with            which you can breeze through the early stages. If ever there was a            game tailored for kids, this is it.                    Owners of the first GBA adventure have an extra incentive to            purchase the sequel, with an unspecified number of ~secret levels,            characters and more~ to unlock. The game is also playable as            Crash's buddies Coco and Crunch, but to get that far, you're going            to be investing a lot of hours. Multi-player frolics are also in            store; the Atlasphere mode, and Link Race, but sadly thanks to the            necessity to have multiple carts to play, we were unable to indulge            in this area.                    If you're a die-hard Crash fan, there's no doubt plenty on offer            here to quench your thirst for platforming thrills, and it won't            disappoint. The game succeeds in delivering another typically            tailored and cheery Crash adventure to satisfy its massive            audience, but given its high price tag and scant innovation Crash            Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced is unlikely to win over any new converts by            playing it so safe and so young.
