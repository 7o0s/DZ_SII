But thanks to a genuinely interesting storyline            pushed along by a healthy supply of in-game dialogue and scripted            sequences, it manages to be more than just another retro throwback.                    As the game begins the eponymous anti-hero has just been shot down            over an uncharted alien planet, and at first your job is simply to            collect crystals and ore to help your on-board AI repair the            damage. Before long though you are dragged into the middle of a            conflict between a vicious god and the naive, peace-loving natives            of the planet, who seem to think that you are their saviour. What            makes the whole experience so involving is that over the course of            the game Zax is gradually transformed from a self-centered loner            who is only interested in the reward to someone who genuinely cares            about the fate of the aliens.                    The story is perhaps not the most original ever to grace a computer            game, and the conversations mostly serve to send you from one            dangerous spot to another collecting McGuffins (something which is            neatly explained in an end-of-game plot twist), but the overall            effect is impressive enough. The voice acting is also fairly good            for the most part, although the leading bad guys sound kind of            goofy thanks to the ersatz Darth Vader effects applied to their            dialogue.                    The heart of the game though is very much the action, and the good            news is that it's a lot of fun, in a brainless sort of way. Zax is            moved around the world using the cursor keys, while the mouse is            used to aim his gun. A target cursor shows you where on the screen            it is targetted, and so firing is simply a case of            pointing-and-clicking. It's all very easy to get to grips with and            quickly becomes second nature.                    Which is lucky, because there is a lot of combat; the score sheet            at the end of the final mission showed that I had killed well over            4000 enemies during the course of the game, and that was on the            medium difficulty level! The action is fast and furious throughout,            but there is enough variety to keep things interesting, with an            entire arsenal of robots to blow up as well as a few indigenous            life forms, including wild boars and yeti-like creatures that lob            rocks at you.                    There are also some really nice set-pieces to give you a change of            pace, including a heart-stopping race to escape from a            robot-infested mine before it is flooded by lava, with the ground            steadily cracking up and turning red behind you as the magma            advances. Elsewhere you will dodge rotating blades and spike traps            in an underground temple, lead native workers to safety from a            forced labour camp, and try to sneak your way out of an icy prison            without being seen.                    Having said that, much of your time is spent simply shooting            robots, pulling levers, collecting keys and searching for various            objects that the natives want you to recover for them. It's all            good clean fun though, and the way in which it's done just adds to            the frantic action.                    For example, the main source of energy for your shields and weapons            are the robots themselves. Whenever you kill one it drops a small            yellow or blue globe which you can then pick up to recharge your            own batteries. Meanwhile many areas include spawn pads which            continue pumping out more enemies until you can find the control            panel and destroy it. As a result you are positively encouraged to            charge in guns blazing and take out as many of the enemy as            possible, and after a fight the ground is often littered with            power-ups to bring you back up to strength without having to play            hunt-the-health-pack.                    Ore and crystals also play an important part in the game, and can            be picked up off the ground or found hidden in vases, crates and            boxes. These can then be fed into the material generator on your            ship and exchanged for upgraded equipment developed by your ship's            on-board AI, which monitors your progress throughout the game and            periodically comes up with some new doohickey based on what she has            seen. Conveniently placed teleporters scattered around the world            allow you to return to your ship and kit up, then beam straight            back into the thick of it. All of this makes sure that as much of            your time as possible is spent actually doing (or killing)            something.                    With this kind of wall-to-wall action an old-fashioned 2D            sprite-based engine is still the most effective solution, and            allows for dozens of enemies on screen without any slow downs while            maintaining modest system requirements. Characters are bright and            nicely detailed, with smooth life-like animations for the most            part.                    Annoyingly the only real disappointment is Zax himself; for some            reason his diagonal movements were a little jerky on my system at            times, and trying to focus on his slightly juddery motion caused            eye strain after a few hours of non-stop play. Otherwise everything            looks a treat though. The weapon effects are suitably pyrotechnic,            with rockets and laser bolts flying around all over the place as            you battle your way through the hordes of robots.                    Settings are lovingly pre-rendered and often animated for good            measure, with lava bubbling up in pools, smoke escaping from pipes,            and computer panels flashing menacingly. The result is a colourful            and believable alien world, with everything from dense jungles and            stalactite-filled caves to pipe-lined corridors and eerie            laboratories where the natives are cut up and turned into cyborg            killing machines. This is backed up by the audio, with solid punchy            sound effects for most of the weapons and a driving dance music            soundtrack in the background.                    Zax doesn't have cutting edge 3D graphics or fashionable            role-playing style character development. What it does have is lots            of fast-paced action, some attractive backdrops, an entertaining            storyline and a host of powerful weapons. There's even support for            up to sixteen players to battle it out in online deathmatch and            capture the flag modes once you have exhausted the single player            campaign.                    It's hardly groundbreaking, but Zax is a lot of fun in a            check-your-brains-at-the-door kind of way."}
