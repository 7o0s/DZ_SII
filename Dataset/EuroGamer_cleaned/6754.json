Wouldn't it be nice if we got this sort of exclusive perk in Europe in exchange for a measly pre-order, instead of rebadged demos from official console publications? [Stop whinging - Ed]            The demo is a short, utilitarian preview of the game, covering the            train sections demonstrated in the myriad screenshots saturating            the internet at the moment. The player controls both Billy and            Rebecca through some early areas, fighting to reunite them as they            struggle at opposite ends of the train.                        Beginning with Rebecca, the player is immediately thrust into            combat with a carriage-full of zombies. Rebecca is your typical            female Resi protagonist; pert and unassumingly beautiful, decked            out in what at first appears to be combat gear but soon turns out            to be a medic's uniform. Moving around the first carriage reveals a            couple of lurking zombies (met with great roars of ~damn you            Capcom!~ as I spat my drink unceremoniously onto the carpet in            fright) and also highlights a few refinements to the control            scheme. Although ostensibly the same as the Resi remake, the            C-stick at first appears to do nothing, but more on that later.                         Once composed and (hopefully) safe you can switch to Billy, who            starts off near the back of the train. Thankfully, loading between            the two characters takes no longer than loading a new room. Billy            is clearly some sort of escaped prisoner, with tattoos all over his            shoulder like George Clooney in Dusk Till Dawn, and a busted            handcuff swinging from his left wrist. Wandering around quickly            reveals that Billy has more train to play with, as he stumbles out            of the back door and proceeds to find himself mauled by a legless            zombie clawing onto his leg. Billy also has to fend off dogs in a            typically frightening bit of canine-leaping-from-off-screen            gameplay, but it quickly becomes clear that neither Billy nor            Rebecca can get too far. Pooling their talents seems to be the best            bet.                    The first major puzzle involves opening a locked door (surprise,            surprise), but the key itself is locked away, and you will need two            crests to open the bag containing it - one for Billy to find and            one for Rebecca. Trawling the passenger coaches, dreary kitchens            and burning dining room upstairs (complete with burning zombies,            who continue to burn post-slaying), the first crest is quickly            uncovered, but how to get Becca's bit to Billy? As it happens, the            train is a double-decker, and kitchen staff rarely carry plates up            and down flights of stairs, do they? As you might expect, the            puzzles all fit the environment in this way, which will hopefully            mean some intuitive ideas later on, and the pooling of talents when            separated is very Project Eden - not a bad formula to inject into            the ageing Resident embryo.                         When handling control of one character, the other is left to their            own devices, but you can issue simple instructions to open fire or            ignore aggressors and such. As you take on new areas though, you            finally work out where the C-stick comes in, using it to move the            other character around. The AI for your partner when under CPU            control is pretty good, although you do end up wasting a bit of            ammo when you're both firing at the same zombie. Then again, the            team of two has given Shinji Mikami and his team license to fill            rooms with zombies, as many as five at a time, and this challenge            of fending off hordes of the undead is pretty intense.                         Another good thing about Resident Evil Zero is the train            environment. We don't know how much of the game will be set here -            Capcom has said not much - but the claustrophobic settings really            help the polygon-characters-on-animated-backgrounds technique to            work effectively, and the sights and sounds seem a lot more            atmospheric than in the GameCube's first Resident Evil, which at            times seemed a bit too glossy and momentarily lifeless. Resi Zero            is a game with a brooding atmosphere.                    So far then it looks like a case of a lot of changes, but a lot of            positives. Resident Evil Zero is shaping up to challenge a lot of            people's perceptions of the series, and as it will unearth a lot of            the back-story while mixing in new concepts, it should end up            pleasing an awful lot of people; both fans and naysayers."}
