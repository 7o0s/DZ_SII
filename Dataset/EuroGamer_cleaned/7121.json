Proclaiming            itself to be ~today's most realistic 3D tennis simulation~, I            couldn't help but get enthused.                    With Open Tennis almost providing us with the perfect tennis game,            All Star certainly has a long path to tread in matching the            standards already set. The inclusion of seven actual tennis star            names certainly gives the title some weight before it has even been            installed.                    Unfortunately, All Star Tennis is a shadow of the promises daubed            on the back of the box, and is yet another example of tennis poorly            implemented onto the PC. ~The realism of this simulation will amaze            you!~ is another choice quote, but I can safely assure you now that            the only thing amazing about this game is that it ever reached the            shop shelf.                    Grit your teeth, it's going to be a rough ride!         After installation,            prepare yourself to bear witness to perhaps the worst quality video            sequence you are ever likely to experience in your life. Picture            the worst Vivo-based internet video you have ever seen, and you            won't be too far off the mark. The better option would have been to            simply not have bothered at all.                    Wanting to check the game out quickly, I fired up the Exhibition            mode to get stuck into a single match .. only to find that my            Sidewinder game pad didn't function. In the control configuration I            managed to re-define the keys to all the buttons on my pad. Surely            if it's recognising the button presses within the game, it isn't            that difficult to write a proper detection routine?                    All Star Tennis allows you to play out an entire season over ten            tournament locations, or you can select an individual tournament.            Tournaments are held in different countries and on varying court            surfaces, but sadly none of them actually resemble real life            locations.                    Before a match you can select to play as any of the game's seven            tennis stars. Maybe you would like to be Richard Krajicek, or            search your feminine side as Conchita Martinez? Each player walks            into view, and does a small leap of delight if you pick them to            play with.                    You can choose to play a game of singles, doubles, or even mixed            doubles, the latter being a refreshing inclusion. By default all            matches play for just one set, making it necessary to get it right            the first time or be eliminated. To give yourself a little            breathing space, I suggest you change the match length to three            sets.         Regardless of            what match mode you are in though, you won't be able to escape how            absolutely dire this game is. I can't put it any other way - the            game plays like some public domain effort by a wannabe programmer.                    Your movement is extremely limited, with hardly enough response            from the controls to get yourself from one side of the court to the            other. Even when you manage to get yourself in a perfect position            to return a shot, you will very often find your player either fails            to respond to your button press, or the game's lousy collision            detection will come into play.                    The method to serve and return shots is really clumsy too, with far            too much emphasis on guesswork than true skill. Some sort of marker            system would have been far better, even if it was just for the            service. Umpire and line calls are perhaps some of the most            diabolical yet witnessed in a tennis game, and that just further            infuriates you.                    If all that isn't enough to have warned you off this game, then            perhaps the computer controlled players' wonderful ability to be in            totally the wrong place a lot of the time will. There is one            advantage to this though - while you are wrestling with the            controls, you may well fluke a shot past the computer, who has            temporarily lost the ability to predict where the ball is going.         Not only does the            game play like a nightmare, it looks like one too. To be fair the            court graphics aren't too bad, but the players look terrible, with            some of the most jerky motion captures you're likely to see, and            even the pre-match player stills are poorly done, making me wonder            if the stars ever actually saw just how they were being represented            in the game.                    The game also suffers from the old 'Spot the Ball' syndrome, with            you all too often having to squint at the screen to establish the            ball's location. Exterior visuals like the crowd are all very            careless too, looking more like a multi-coloured video corruption            than a group of appreciative and adoring fans.                    The downward trend doesn't stop at the sound either, with this            being some of the most dull and uninspired audio I have heard in a            long while. Crowd hecklers sound out every five seconds, either            encouraging a particular player or answering a mobile phone. All            well and good, but when you hear the same rubbish time and time            again it just gets plain annoying.                    I think the umpire sums everything up perfectly though, sounding            about as interested in the game as I am in playing it ever again. I            had visions of this guy standing next to the microphone recording            each sample, and afterwards shouting ~can I go home yet?~                    Oh, and if I hear that menu music ever again, I swear I will commit            suicide!         All Star Tennis is            absolutely terrible, and I really have tried to find a spark of            something good in the game. The fact that the game is not even            mentioned on UbiSoft's webpage is kinda ironic in itself.                    There are no redeeming features at all, with clumsy gameplay, awful            graphics and sound that will have you drop-kicking your speakers            through a window. There is a multiplayer option for up to four            players, but I think you will find the biggest challenge is finding            someone else that would want to play it.                    Steer well clear!                        -                            Open Tennis 2000 review                    Open Tennis 2000 review"}
