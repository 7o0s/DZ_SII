The Sting is the            latest game to focus on the legally-challenged, putting you in the            shoes of a sharply dressed gangster by the name of Matt Tucker.                    Having just been released from prison, Tucker is back in business            within hours, giving you the opportunity to break into eighteen            buildings ranging from hotels and cinemas to shops and banks. The            focus here is on meticulous planning and preparation rather than            action though, and every excursion will begin at your desk. Here            you choose a target, select up to three accomplices to take along            with you, decide on a getaway car, and hand out vital equipment            such as lockpicks, crowbars and drills.                    The next step is to devise your plan, guiding Tucker and friends            around the target building using a simple point-and-click            interface. This is all done in a stop-start manner, so if you            wander into the field of view of a guard, think you may have been            heard, or waste time picking a lock on something that doesn't            contain any loot, you can simply rewind the recording and change            the movements of your characters. While it's a novel approach that            has more in common with the planning stage of a Rainbow Six mission            than a game like Thief, it does mean that there isn't much in the            way of suspense. Once you have finished recording your plan you            simply sit back and watch the resulting break-in, then return to            the editing interface if anything went unexpectedly wrong. Which            doesn't happen very often if you were paying attention during the            planning.                    It's not all about breaking and entering though. The entire city is            modelled in cartoon-like 3D, not just the target buildings. Between            burglaries you can wander through the streets, chatting with any            suspicious characters you think you may be able to recruit, selling            your loot and laundering money at the pawn shop, buying new cars            and equipment and casing out potential targets.                    Annoyingly though you have to walk from one location to another,            and as the city is very large this can be a time consuming affair.            There are taxis, but they move fairly slowly and are few and far            between at the best of times. Too much of your time is wasted            walking from one shop to another, and it can be doubly annoying if            you get half way through planning a burglary only to discover that            there is a safe you need to break into and you don't have the right            tool for the job. Cue a two minute trek to the local tool shop and            back. It would have been nice if an option had been included            allowing you to jump instantly to a location which you had already            visited.                    There is also no artificial intelligence; guards always follow            predictable pre-programmed routes and only raise the alarm if they            see or hear you. It's entirely possible to walk right up behind one            without being spotted, and as you can endlessly rewind and            re-record your plan it can all get a bit routine at times. Matt            Tucker's code of conduct doesn't allow him to harm anyone in the            course of a burglary either, so the game boils down to simply            avoiding the view-cone of the guards, disabling any alarm systems            and picking lots of locks.                    The Sting is really more of a puzzle game than anything else, and            it works fairly well for what it does. The problem is that there's            so much more that it could have done, and the whole thing            lacks any kind of tension or excitement because of the way the            planning system works. The endless back-tracking and aimless            wandering around the labyrinthine city only serves to slow things            down still further, making the game decidely plodding.                    If you have the patience and methodical mindset to put up with this            slow pace then you might enjoy the game, but personally I found            that it's charm wore off fairly quickly."}
