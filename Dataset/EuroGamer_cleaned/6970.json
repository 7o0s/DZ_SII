That's the conclusion I've            come to after a fortnight's worth of solid gameplay. Every FPS            taste is catered for, and the world is already warming to it, with            servers across Europe full from dawn till dusk.                         The main focus of the game is of course teamplay, but you needn't            scour the neighbourhood for 15 willing friends before handing over            your cash - over the past week I've seen people band together on            public servers, creating elaborate networks of motion sensors and            defensive turrets around the flag in CTF to weed out stealthy            intruders, and incredible battleship offensives streaking across            the skies and laying waste to enemy generators and defence systems            thanks to well-trained bombardiers.                         Apart from CTF the game also features Capture and Hold, straight            Deathmatch, Hunters (rather akin to the classic Quake Headhunters            game), Team Hunters, Rabbit (single flag, many players, with the            object being to hold onto the flag for as long as possible to            accrue points) and Siege (one team defends a control switch in a            base whilst the other tries to capture it). CTF is the best            represented, and my personal favourite so far, but the others            (Rabbit in particular) can be incredibly intense!                         Weapons-wise Tribes 2 is a definite improvement over Tribes, with            a refined arsenal, including such classics as a tweaked Spinfusor            (the weapon of choice for Scout classes), flare gun, missile            launcher, grenade launcher, mine launcher, mines, yadda yadda.            There's a lot of hardware to play with, depending on your loadout.                         Speaking of improvement, the graphics (although they have taken a            bit of a hammering in certain circles) are fantastic. Play it with            anti-aliasing enabled and you won't want to leave. Huge, rolling            landscapes and detailed player models and weapons make it one of            the nicest looking first person shooters for a while. And that's            got to be difficult to do on levels so open and vast. There are            even 512x512 high quality player models tucked away on the CD.            Aurally the game is nothing to complain about either, with some            nice ambient, rumbling backing music to match each level.                    Moving on, the game's player system is broken down into            customisable classes. As a team player you should work out which            best suits your style of play and work around it. The default            loadout is fairly weak, so making your way to the main base and an            Inventory Station is of paramount importance when you first spawn.                         The inventory system is a big improvement over Tribes. You can hit            Numpad Enter at any time to pull up the inventory screen and select            a class (you can alter them via drop-down menus as you see fit),            and you can preselect any class by hitting its number on the            Numpad. Once selected, wander up to an inventory station and you're            upgraded in two seconds flat. This is a much more team friendly            approach than that of Tribes, where all inventory work had to be            done on the pad, often holding entire teams up whilst one            player fiddled with the settings, and making them an easy target            for nippy Scouts.                         The three main armour classes are Scout, Assault and Juggernaut.            Scouts can be Assassins or anything they like, and pilot any            vehicles, whereas Assaulters can pilot some vehicles but can't            carry certain weapons (like the Laser Rifle). Juggernauts on the            other hand, carry extraordinarily powerful weapons but have no            piloting abilities. The trade-off is speed. Scouts can zoom across            levels in moments with the use of their jetpacks, but Assault            classes can only sweep across the sky at a medium pace, while            Juggernauts are practically glacial under most circumstances.                         Through the inventory you can also select which packs to load your            favourite classes with. As a defender, a repair pack is useful for            putting right damage to generators and remote stations, and as an            attacker extra shield or health packs are necessary for success.            Cloak packs are great for assassins, because when coupled with a            Shocklance, a crafty fella can sneak into a base, wait for an            opportunity and sneak up cloaked behind an Assault class defender            or repair worker. One hit with the Shocklance (has to be direct            contact) can take almost anybody down.                         The jetpack plays a very important part once again. For moving            yourself up and around the hilly terrain, and for escaping the            deadly splash damage of the Spinfusor, there is nothing like it.            And considering most defenders' propensity to mine the flag,            swooping in from above is somewhat crucial.                         Jetpacks are also very useful for mad-dashes across the landscape            with the flag, but for real lightning raids, you need to start            delving into the vehicle options.                    Vehicles are what makes Tribes 2 so special. This isn't just a            little infantry showdown any more, this is war. Any map with            vehicle stations is incredible fun. There are ground-based            hoverbikes, assault style fighters (Shrikes) and full-blown bombers            and personnel carriers. Clans-sorry, Tribes, have been putting            together elite flight teams for the big bombers, and the APC-alike            carriers are very popular too on 32, 48 and 64 player maps.                         Creating a decent equilibrium between the attacking and defensive            divisions makes the difference between a rout and a proper fight.            Actually watching this happen on public servers shows that it's not            always as fluidic as it could be, but thanks to Tribes 2's            community features, finding a Tribe that's willing to take you on            for a bit of organised teamplay shouldn't be too difficult.                         The community features have taken a while to catch up with the            enormous interest in the game, but at the time of writing,            everything (with the possible exception of the community email            function) is up and running. The profile system, which was very            slow when this writer originally signed up, is now easy enough to            access and play around with. Finding a Tribe is quite easy too,            with plenty advertising on the game's IRC server and in-built            Forums.                         A few people have taken issue with the way the game authenticates            clients when they first buy it. I've heard reports of people who            have been burnt by ~CD key already in use~ errors, requiring a            return to the store or an angry phone call to Sierra tech support,            but my own experience wasn't all that troublesome. All it took was            to enter my name as my login and then a password, along with my            Warrior name and CD key, to wait a few seconds and I was            registered. I originally prefixed my warrior name with my clan tag            but realising this was a mistake changed it in the Profile section            afterward - useful, since warrior names have to be unique. You can            also select aliases (for instance if you like to play when you            should be working and avoid detection!)                         The game does authenticate you every time you want to play it            online, but so far the authentication server has only been down            once.                    I've been pretty happy with Tribes 2 on the whole, as must be            evident, but that's not to say its ambitious design hasn't caused a            few problems. In fairness, I persevered and now I enjoy the game            more every time I play it, but for some people, these issues will            be simply unacceptable.                         For starters, the system requirements for Tribes 2 are simply over            the top. Our general test machine was a 1.33GHz Athlon with 256Mb            of RAM and a GeForce 3. That's a very high spec, and it's slightly            worrying that it actually required that GeForce 3 (which of course            you can't yet buy anywhere) to run without any framerate issues            with all settings enabled and maxed out at 1024x768 - the way I            like to play my games. Changing the video card to a 64Mb Radeon DDR            (the next best thing), proved acceptable, but not without            inexplicable jerking in built up areas on certain maps. Changing            the processor for an 800MHz Athlon and the graphics card for a 32Mb            GeForce 2 GTS offered pretty much the same result, with lower            framerates across the board until a number of detail levels were            reduced.                         On the same note, load times are pretty hefty, even on the best            technology we could throw at the game. Be prepared to wait for a            while whenever you join a new server.                         Another problem the game has thrown up is the number of patches            required to play. Since signup, more than five have been            downloaded. In actual fact, embarrassingly I've lost count now. The            most notable is a patch for the actual patching utility,            which spontaneously failed and crashed my machine unless I            downloaded it separately and performed the update manually. The            netcode may be brilliant and capable of letting gamers to play            laglessly (a good word, but stop making them up -Ed) on            servers with more players than kilobytes their modems can push per            week, but having to download 5Mb or so of patches is a bit of a            joke just to play online.                         That said, if you're clever, when you buy Tribes 2 (and you            should buy Tribes 2) then you will set your PC off            downloading patches from a fansite while you duck into the single            player game for the limited training. I don't really rate the            training (and it is itself bugged if you can believe that) but it's            worth completing anyway.                    At the end of the day, Tribes 2 has won me over and no mistake,            with just so much to offer. I haven't even touched on some of the            more refined points the game picks up on and I'm practically 50%            over my word limit. Things like the impressive control system (with            presets for every sort of player) and the useful server filter            option. Skiing, too, which has stopped being an annoying            gameplay-destroying detraction and become damnably useful. You'll            just have to take my word for it.                         In short, then, you should buy this game, and if you play anything            online this year, make it Tribes 2. However, you might want to buy            it from a store with a good returns policy, in case the game's            mammoth system requirements or currently buggy disposition puts you            off. I doubt they will, but unless you're a Tribes nut, you'll            appreciate a get-out clause.                         Anyway, off to the shops with you.
