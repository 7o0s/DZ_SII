Picking up where            Episode II left off, you control a number of vehicles in            ground-based combat on worlds ranging from Geonosis (as you take on            the forces of Count Dooku) to Kashyyyk (the Wookiee homeworld). You            even get your saber out occasionally for a bit of hand-to-hand            combat.        Mission            objectives are so varied we could spend all day talking about them.            The first level alone has you fighting your way through Dooku's            forces to save Natalie Portman and her Jedi friends, before taking            out planetary cannons, securing a landing platform, defending it            from aggressors, escorting a newly landed convoy through a valley,            hopping into a gunship and taking out Techno Union ships, defending            your assault cannons so they can take out those huge spherical            capital ships and then battling three sharp-shooting 'Dark            Acolytes' as Anakin gets his arm lopped off. And there are bonus            objectives to consider, too.                    First impressions are very good - it's hard not to be overwhelmed            by the enormous visual spectacle and it's all very accessible.            Controls are as simple as they come - analogue for movement,            shoulders for strafing and face buttons for firing and boosting.            Oh, and the D pad is given over to wingman commands, much as it was            in Rogue Leader and Battle for Naboo. Geonosis, the game's opening            level, is one big mess of sand dunes, plateaus, rocky mountains and            canyons, with every crack in the rock occupied by stationary            cannons. On the ground there's a sea of clones and droids locked in            combat, with those wheeled rocket launchers, early walkers and            hover tanks milling about. Then above them you have Republic            gunships, scouts and a number of Dooku's aerial forces. And that's            ignoring the installations, capital ships, planetary cannons and            the build-up of countless other units we've forgotten about. It's            hard not to feel like you're at war, especially when most of it is            on-screen at any one time.        Head up close and the illusion starts to fade a little.            Individual clones and droids have a handful of levels of detail,            but they always look blocky, and unfortunately any in-game cut            sequences involving the main characters face to face also suffer            from this low-poly outlook, with bad movement animation to boot.            What's more, you can't actually shoot the clone troopers or battle            droids - they're merely cosmetic. Vehicles, cannons and ships are            more detailed, but they all only really have one or two death            animations - spinning as they disintegrate or exploding instantly.            The good news is that the visual tapestry is so rich when viewed            from afar (which is most of the time) that it rarely grates.                    What does grate about the visuals though is, ironically, the thing            we thought would make it so much better: the sheer scale. It's easy            to become overwhelmed by the influx of units over hills from all            directions, and in the heat of the battle, things can get very            confusing. Sadly the enormous number of units on anything above            Padawan skill level (which should be avoided if you want to get            more than a handful of hours out of The Clone Wars) means that one            of the game's most useful features is also somewhat stunted - the            automatic targeting.                    Auto-targeting is something Rogue Leader veterans will immediately            snort at, but it's quite integral to The Clone Wars. With so many            units, Pandemic have made it a case of simply pointing your craft            in vaguely the right direction, at which point the HUD locks onto            the unit nearest to the centre of the screen, providing a little            aiming reticule complete with health readout. You can then mash the            A button for all its worth or launch some missiles with B.                    This approach works most of the time, but caught in a            particularly vigorous encounter with a multitude of units,            sometimes it gets confused or just plain skips over the enemy you            want it to target. This can be a problem if, for example, you're            trying to defend a convoy from wheeled rocket launchers and one of            them has managed to scoot in-between the train of friendly            vehicles...                    However, it makes strafing enemies or dealing with a blanket force            of enemies somewhat easier. Wading into battle and pasting the A            button knowing full well that every shot is hitting a mark is            useful.        Sadly, the volume of enemies engaged in conflict often confuses            the issue. Much of the game is ground-based, in hover tanks, on            speeders, in walkers, on Maru-back etc, etc, but you can't help but            feel that the majority of the challenge is on account of the            numbers, not intelligent mission design. With ammo and shield            supplies scattered generously across each level, it's often a case            of waiting till the munitions come into view, offloading your salvo            of 20 missiles in a few split-seconds and then retooling to start            again. What's more, instead of learning weaknesses and really            working at boss fights (of which there are several, including a            rather obvious ambush preceded by the line ~something doesn't feel            right~), the job is as simple as avoiding enemy fire until you're            out of rockets, collecting a batch from the sidelines and            repeating.                    Furthermore, the game's attempts to mix in on-foot sections are            disastrous. The early Windu section sees you slicing through            Geonosians like butter, but the mechanics are extremely awkward -            like you're controlling a tank with legs - and the poor animation            and bland texturing all round merely serve to remind you that this            is not Jedi Knight II.                    The aerial sections do their best to make up for the rest. Zooming            around in a gunship, racing over the battlefield, firing those            devastating lightsaber-esque charge beams at all and sundry, is            something which Pandemic clearly worked hard at. If the whole game            was set in a gunship, I'd feel a lot better about it.        But it is not. Much of The Clone Wars is given over to            laborious auto-target-fests - the sci-fi shoot 'em up equivalent of            a hackandslash in this instance, and after a while the missions            deteriorate into the process of killing wave after wave of enemies,            blowing open doors, rinsing and repeating. Although some sections            of the game are extremely entertaining, a lot of it feels like            filler, and lacks the charm of the gunship sections. Highlights            include the opening battle, a speeder-back section racing through            wastelands in pursuit of droids - as fast and frenetic as anything            Return of the Jedi threw at us, minus the Ewoks - and the defence            of a Republic battle cruiser (which is very, very big).                    Lowlights include anything and everything on Kashyyyk (so tedious            we almost gave up), inconsistent visuals, often soulless mission            design and combat, and some things we just plain can't abide in any            game - like a lack of mid-level save points and sections of mesh            wire roping you into a linear path. Want to take a shortcut over a            small mound of garbage to hasten the speeder-back pursuit? Sorry            old chum, let's get you stuck on the scenery! No, no, no.                    It's not all bad, and anybody who loved Episode II as much as we            did will want to see it through to the end - which takes about 15            hours on the normal or harder difficulty levels. The addition of            multiplayer (with various levels to unlock by completing bonus            objectives) is also quite handy, and the soundtrack (ripped            straight from John Williams' best of) is as rousing and            invigorating as ever. It's just a shame that for all the initial            graphical beauty, complexity and diversity of The Clone Wars, it            really boils down to a simple, flawed, over-stretched game design.            One for the fans.
