Somehow it seems part of the natural order.Especially when the mouse turns around and whacks the cat in thechops with a saucepan.Okay, so Chu Chu Rocket isn't quite Tom and Jerryterritory, but the basic idea is the same. Here, cats chase mice,and mice have to escape.Set in space, each level contains an escape rocket (or perhapsmore than one), that you have to guide your Chu Chus - space mice- into. Out to foil your plans are the Kapu Kapus - space cats - who willeat any Chu Chus they collide with. Don't let the cats get into therockets either, or it's game over.Chu Chu Rocket has two modes: puzzle and challenge. Inthe puzzle section - consisting of 25 easy and 25 hard puzzles - you'represented with a scenario and a certain number of placeable arrows(of the up, down, left or right variety). Using your phone'sjoystick (or keypad), you have to position the arrows in such amanner as to guide the Chu Chus into their escape rocket withoutcolliding with their enemies.There are some basic rules to help you along. Chu Chus movefaster than Kapu Kapus, and both species turn right whenever theycollide with a barrier or the edge of the screen. Working withinsuch a basic range of options, you'll really have to work yourbrain to use the limited amount of arrows provided to fulfil eachscenario, because most are only solveable in one specific way.If you're the kind of person who's happy to experiment, though,this isn't a game to deny your pleasure. You can set the mice andcats off a'running time and again without any penalty arising fromcontinuous failure. But to get the best out of Chu ChuRocket, you should take each puzzle seriously and attempt towork out what's going to happen and where you need to place yourarrows to complete each level.It's all good fun, but there are some out-of-game difficultieswe need to mention. Most notably, the longer you take to considereach level, the more likely it is that your phone's screensaver (orpower saving mechanism) will kick in, which is extremelyannoying.Equally, the fine detail of the levels will have you cursing thelack of precision of your phone's joystick. This is especially thecase when it comes to the frantic challenge mode, where you canplace up to three arrows of any orientation at a time to deal withthe situation you're thrown into, whether it's getting 100 Chu Chusto escape or perversely feeding 100 Chu Chus to some KapuKapus.Still, the contrast between the two game modes measured andmindful puzzle versus fast and frantic challenge can provide awelcome change of pace, particularly when you're stuck on aparticularly hard puzzle.In fact, the only downsides to the game itself are the colourscheme - thoughtlessly, your cursor is the same colour as the ChuChus - and the lack of any funky music when you're playing. Thegraphics are great and there's plenty of menu-side melodies, butsurprisingly the game is almost silent during the actual action,which is strange considering that when Chu Chu Rocket firstappeared on Sega's short-lived Dreamcast console, the music was oneof the strongest elements.Nevertheless, this solid conversion of a brain-tingling consolegame into an admirable phone-sized puzzler makes Chu ChuRocket worthy of your time and cash.
