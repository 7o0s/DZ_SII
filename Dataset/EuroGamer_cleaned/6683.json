Full of slick, but US centric sports            titles, and playable, but shallow arcade ports, the publishing            veteran has realised it needed to start producing content with            depth, and a broader appeal than the quick fix gameplay it relied            upon before the arse fell out of the amusement arcade market.                    Haven is one of the first fruits of its change of emphasis, and has            been, unusually, been developed by an unheralded British outfit,            the team behind all manner of Disney related titles such as Toy            Story (1&2), A Bug's Life and more recently the            ok-but-not-great Crash Bandicoot - Wrath Of Cortex. Haven is,            apparently, the game the team has always wanted to make and,            finally, after years of coding to order it has a chance to            establish itself as a British developer to be reckoned with.        The PR machine has certainly            gone to town to impress the point that Haven is ~A game that is all            games~, featuring multiple genres in the same package, including            racing, shooting, combat, as well as the obvious platforming            elements that the whole game hangs everything on. The fact that            Midway has trademarked ~Freeformer\u2122~ gameplay tells you that            the publisher is either a tad misguided or supremely confident that            Haven really is ~the next major development in videogaming~. But            more of that later.                    Haven, the star of the game, is haunted by dreams of the ~Golden            Voice~, which is actually a bell that is rung in times of need, and            one that needs to be chimed to free the people from the slavery            imposed by the evil Lord Vetch. Yes, it's the usual good versus            evil tale, and is structured in the traditional level based            platform game way, with sub objectives having to be completed in            order to move the story on and allow Haven to access the next            section of the game.                    Haven himself is a bug eyed crusty dwarf with bright red dreads and            a Yo Yo for a weapon. Hardly the things that gaming legends are            made of, and as such it's hard to find this Trustafarian lookalike            endearing in any sense, but hey, if the game's as ~revolutionary~,            ~visually stunning~, ~cinematic~, ~remarkable~, and ~virtually            limitless~ as Midway would have us believe, we wouldn't care if the            lead character was a foul mouthed brickie.        Being mainly            a platform game with sub sections to add variety, it comes across            as being more heavily indebted to the likes of Jak & Daxter and            Ratchet & Clank than being anything revolutionary. Both the            aforementioned have lots in common with Haven, so it's almost            impossible to approach it without comparing it directly to these            extremely similar titles.                    The weapon system, for example, feels embarrassingly limited next            to the gadget laden R&C, or even J&D for that matter. The            poxy Yo Yo you're given is almost completely hopeless at destroying            anything, and you have to position young Haven with frustrating            precision to take out explosive barrels. Occasionally you get to            pick up a laser gun, but it runs out so quickly it's next to            useless. Most of the time you're better off jumping around avoiding            everything the best you can, which makes it feel pointless having            enemies at all.                    The mission structures are also hardly the stuff of revolution            either: find five leaves or cogs or whatever to open up the next            obstacle in your way. Occasionally you get to indulge in a spot of            shooting or racing to further your quest, which helps break up the            jump and collect staple. In one instance Haven gets to use a            jetpack and fly around with a water cannon putting out fires, while            in another area you're testing out your shooting skills in an            on-rails section taking out alien craft. Other sections have you            driving around in a speed boat, or a fast car blowing up tanks, and            while they're fun diversions they're generally all over very            quickly, and as such feel like side shows to the main event.                    Meanwhile, the visual side of the game rarely matches the cinematic            billing. Despite having art input from ~world-renowned fantasy and            science fiction illustrator~ Rodney Matthews, the overall look and            feel is not as striking or impressive as either of its rivals. The            character models vary from being brilliantly conceived (for which            we assume Matthews input has to take credit), to the lacklustre,            especially the mindless NPC drones that wander around the village            getting in your way. The cut scenes also hardly inspire much            excitement, and in comparison to R&C's Pixar-esque efforts,            look pretty lacklustre.        Meanwhile, each level is            big, impressive and delivers a good sense of scale, but they really            don't deliver the same amount of character, and simply aren't as            technically as detailed or pleasing on the eye. Texturing is            limited at times, and the dreaded PS2 jaggie is ruefully present            and incorrect.                    The linear structure of the story also limits your ability to go to            and fro from levels like you can in both J&D and R&C, and            thus there isn't the comparable desire to go back and explore later            for things you've missed. You can replay any level you've completed            at any time, but the incentives to retread old ground just aren't            there. The story struggles to establish itself as a cut above its            rivals - it lacks the punch and black adult humour of recent            efforts, and instead comes across as a feeble good versus evil            tale.                    The net result is that you never really care about the characters,            and instead it's just an excuse to give your thumbs a quick rest            before the next challenge. The voices hardly help endear you to            most of the characters you encounter, either, with most adopting a            sprightly, but irritating yank tone, while the occasional            stereotypical Scot or Chinese character pops up to remind you            exactly why Rockstar hired the likes of Ray Liotta and co in GTA:            Vice City, and not a bunch of jobbing nobodies to do the vocal            duties. We're aware that budgetary restraints will prevent to use            of named actors, but it really does irk to have to be subjected to            poor dialogue in these days of multi million pound development            projects.        Sound wise, the presence of            surround is a welcome addition, but we had trouble detecting it            'before and after'. The score is typically epic and sweeping, and            while it washed over us most of the time, that's probably a good            thing.                    The controls borrow heavily from, surprise surprise, J&D and            R&C, with the left stick for movement and the right for camera            adjustment. And even less of a surprise is that the same camera            issues crop up as a result, with the player often engaging in a            tussle with the CPU over which angle is best for the given moment.            The decision to assign the first person view to R3 or L3 is            annoying, but for the most part the controls are simple, with just            jump and attack being used.                    The difficulty level has at least been judged quite nicely, with            most tasks never holding you up for frustrating lengths of time            (although putting the fires out pushed our patience), and as such            you'll be able to make swift, satisfying progress in what appears            to be a pretty big game - although how big is hard to gauge in the            absence of a percentage complete meter.                    Haven's pretensions to be some kind of revolutionary product seem            sound and exciting on the surface, but scratch that surface for            more than an hour or so, and it's apparent that what we're really            dealing with is a better than average platformer with cleverly            interspersed mini games to present the illusion of expansiveness            and freedom. The marketing team has done the best job they can of            trying to excite us, but any vaguely experienced gamer will see            right through the puff of Freeformer\u2122. If it had arrived 18            months ago it might have been hailed as a breakthrough, but it's            neither the best looking nor the most playable platformer out            there. That's not to say it's a bad game, or that you won't enjoy            it. If you're a real died in the wool platform gamer, Haven has            plenty to admire, but it just fails to match or better what's gone            before. But for those looking for the benchmark title in the genre,            the cold reality is that Haven isn't it.
