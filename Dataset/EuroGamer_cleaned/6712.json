In 1995, Nintendo delivered            a sequel to Super Mario World which left 16-bit fans gasping.            Rejecting the comfortable Mario dynamic, Shigeru Miyamoto's            resourceful team produced a whopping great adventure brimming with            originality, and in the eyes of many topped their previous release            by quite some distance.                    Super Mario Advance 3 sees the infant Mario stranded on Yoshi's            Island, his brother Luigi having been kidnapped by the Koopa            family. Fortunately for the hapless baby, Yoshi and his            multicoloured kin set about transporting Mario by dinosaur-back to            the grounds of Koopa castle, in an attempt to retrieve Luigi and            end the madness - a pretty tall order given how peculiar Yoshi's            Island turns out to be.                    As Yoshi races through the game's seven varied worlds, he can bop            enemies on the head, old-school, or swallow them and then spit them            out as a ground-sweeping projectile. Swallowing an enemy and            hitting down on the directional pad produces an egg, and by tapping            the R button players can target and launch the egg to knock            collectibles out of the sky or simply to vanquish pesky plants,            turtles and other aggressors. If Yoshi can find a watermelon,            depending on the colour, he can even spit seeds, fire and ice.        The action of jumping has changed,            too. Instead of just tapping the button to do a small jump and            really mashing it to do a big one, Yoshi can also flap his little            wings and kick his little legs to float even further through the            air by holding the A button down. Once airborne, the diminutive            dino can stomp the ground by pressing down on the directional pad -            an attack strong enough to dispatch even the worthiest enemy, or to            break through the strongest barrier.                    Another change is in Yoshi's pain receptors. Forget growing,            shrinking or donning a cape or fire suit ala Mario when powering up            and down - Yoshi's too tough for that. Short of falling down a            bottomless pit, all but the sharpest objects in the game leave him            unharmed, but when struck Yoshi does lose track of his cargo! When            Yoshi finds himself caught off-guard, Mario floats about in an air            bubble, whinging like a, well, a frightened baby, until Yoshi can            safely retrieve him. A timer counts down while Mario is detached            from his ride, and if the clock reaches zero than Koopa's minions            will swoop down and drag Mario kicking and screaming away, leaving            you to start over or from the last mid-level save spot.                    Yoshi does however kick Mario off of his own accord here and there.            At certain points in the game, he thrusts his famous passenger down            a tube and transforms into a helicopter, a mechanical mole, a            sports car and even a toy train, racing through obscure sections of            the level before meeting Mario at the other end of the pipe and            turning into a dino once again.                    Those seconds on the baby Mario countdown are a valuable commodity            in Yoshi's Island, and you can supplement the timer's total by            seeking various bouncing stars, which often fall from            question-marked clouds when you launch an egg at them (see, it is            peculiar). If you can build up a clock of more than 30 seconds by            the end of each level, as well as collecting all five flower icons            and all 20 hidden red coins, and you can do it on each of the            world's levels, you build up a 100 percent record for that area,            and in the most significant change to the game's design on the GBA,            you unlock a secret GBA-exclusive level. One for each world, and            they're tough nuts to crack, I'll tell you that much...        Level            design is the game's strongest point, and the fact that the game            very rarely repeats itself is quite telling. Instead of narrowly            pigeonholing each world into a set theme, Nintendo has built up a            succession of varied challenges which always leave you wondering            what's round the next corner.                    Apart from the task of platforming your way through some of the            most imaginative levels ever seen in a 2D adventure, players can            also test their mettle in one of Yoshi's mini-games. Dotted around            the various worlds behind locked doors (watch out for keys flapping            about nearby - yes I did say flapping), these mini-games are based            around speedy reactions and various other skills. For example, one            of the first sees Yoshi trying to tap a sequence of buttons quicker            than a CPU-controlled opponent. Victory in these cute little            diversions will unlock power-ups, including a +10 star power-up            which adds a nice 10 seconds to your Mario clock - useful if you're            about to hop through the starry ring at the end of a level a few            seconds short of 100 percent...        At the time, Nintendo's choice to go            for a cartoony, stylistic graphical approach was thought to be            edgy, risky and perhaps even mildly insane, but it's no            exaggeration to say that the effect is among the best the developer            has ever produced. The graphics are really lively; bouncing,            expanding, contracting and quivering with each passing sight, and            the character designs - in particular Yoshi, Mario and the various            boss characters, are ornately detailed and in the case of the            bosses, determinedly creative. If there's one thing 2D platformers            had been guilty of before 1995 it was producing boring, piddly            bosses, but Yoshi's Island rewrote the rulebook.                    Sadly, things have changed since 1995, and Nintendo certainly has a            rulebook for Mario Advance titles, and plans to stick to it. With            each passing release, we get an almost pixel-perfect port of the            single player title in question, coupled with a rather shabby            bop-turtles multiplayer Mario Bros. mode. In the case of the            previous two decidedly single player adventures, it felt like a            reasonable afterthought.                    In the case of Yoshi's Island, a game renowned for its            player-versus-CPU mini-games, it feels like an insult. Playing            button-combo-against-the-clock back and forth with another player            would have made a much better two-player mode, and it's a shame            that Nintendo is sticking with such an incidental multiplayer            distraction after three titles.                    The presence of this so-called multiplayer option is representative            of the work which has gone into Yoshi's Island on the GBA as a            whole. Best 2D platformer on the system or not, as a port it's a            mite uninspired. Slowdown has crept into the equation for the first            time in a Mario Advance title, and the wealth of Super FX2 chip            effects present in the SNES version has been wittled down and            emulated with only varying degrees of success here - the screen            still undulates where necessary, but the effect has lost a lot of            its panache in the transition.                    All things considered though, there's still no argument against            buying this. Whether you played the original or not, Yoshi's Island            is a timeless platform classic, and deserves to be enjoyed for the            first or second time by all and sundry. The fact that it has more            longevity than most games on major platforms at the moment - and a            darn sight more than the previous two Mario Advance titles put            together - should make it an obvious enough purchase. Few titles            are this engaging. It's just a shame that Nintendo didn't have the            time or inclination to reshape it properly for the portable            hardware.
