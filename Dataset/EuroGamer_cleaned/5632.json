The game starts with a psychedelic swirly thing\u2122 appearing on            your screen, out of which appears a stocky police officer called            Kay'l who invites you to transfer your soul into his body through            your computer.                    You see, this isn't just a computer game, it is actually a link to            a parallel dimension, where your soul will occupy other people's            bodies and help save their world... No, really.                    Once you arrive in Omikron though, things start to look up. The            futuristic cityscape is impressive, with long winding streets, tall            buildings looming out of the fog, neon signs and banners, and            literally dozens of people and cars moving around.                    Unfortunately all those people look the same, they all drive            identical looking cars, and none of them actually seem to be going            anywhere, which rather spoils the effect. A little variation would            be nice - the city looks like it is populated by clones with no            sense of direction.                    After another lengthy cutscene showing you round the city and            featuring music by David Bowie (yes, the David Bowie, the            thin white duke himself), you are finally given control of Kay'l            and the game begins for real.                    At first sight Nomad Soul appears to be a standard third person            adventure game, though admittedly with a nice 3D environment and no            end of dramatic camera angles.                    You visit various locations around the city, talking to other            characters and collecting clues, equipment and weapons. A device            called a ~SNEAK~ stores up to 18 items at once, and if you run out            of space you can put any surplus items into a ~Multiplan virtual            locker~. There are dozens of these scattered throughout the game,            and you can retrieve and deposit items at any of them.                    But occasionally you have to resort to violence, and when that            happens the game changes. It becomes a first person shooter at            times, giving you the chance to take out your enemies with a range            of different guns. And sometimes you have to resort to fisticuffs,            turning the game into a full 3D rotatey spinny\u2122 arcade style            beat 'em up.         Sadly by trying to                 make three games in one, Quantic Dream have failed on all                 counts.                    The adventure sections are almost entirely linear, forcing you to            carry out a series of tasks in a particular order to unlock the            next section of the game. Control is imprecise, and at times the            camera angles can make judging jumps rather difficult.                    The first person shooter sections are, to be blunt, terrible. The            viewpoint feels wrong, the controls are poor, the AI is truly            appalling, and there is no way to access your SNEAK during a            shoot-out. So even if you are carrying around several medikits, you            can't actually use any of them until the fight is over.                    The beat 'em up sections are quite fun at first, but this is hardly            Tekken. Fighting often devolves into randomly stabbing at the keys,            and I found special moves almost impossible to replicate. It            doesn't help that you are trying to use a mouse and keyboard to            control your character - this is one type of game where joypads are            actually useful...                    The save game system is a pain as well. You can only save at            certain points marked by three interlocking rings floating in            mid-air (~something tells me only I can see them...~), and you have            to spend a ~magic ring~ each time you save your position.                    You can also buy advice at these points, which costs several magic            rings. But of course, anyone with half a brain will just save their            position, buy the advice, note it down, and then reload. Presto,            free advice. For that matter you can also find all the hints on            Quantic's website.                    And although the storyline is generally quite good, it occasionally            falls back into the pretentious silliness of the introduction. At            one point a character tells you that ~Omikron~ (apparently somebody            forget to tell her that the title of the game was changed) is a            demonic ploy to suck the souls of unsuspecting gamers from our own            dimension into their world.                    Oh dear...         Even the ~virtual                 reincarnation~ system doesn't really work. The idea is that                 instead of dying, your soul is transferred to another body                 when the one it was occupying is destroyed. But in practice                 you just switch bodies when you need to to complete a task -                 only a handful of characters in the game can actually be                 possessed by you.                    When you switch bodies is often totally arbritary as well. At one            point I needed to switch into the body of Iman (a character based            on David Bowie's wife) to get some information from a shop keeper            by offering him sexual favours.                    I wouldn't mind, but the vital information he gave me was that the            secret Tetra factory I was looking for was in the big building next            door with ~Tetra~ written all over it. No shit Sherlock.                    Which brings me to another point... This game is absolutely full of            sex - within minutes of starting, Kay'l's wife will try to get you            into bed thinking you are her husband. One section of the city is a            huge red light district, complete with strip joints, prostitutes,            and sex shops. You'll even hear adverts for ~biomechanical penis            implants~!                    This game is not for the easily offended...         Luckily                 it's not all bad news though.                    The game's plot might be rather linear, but when the characters            stop talking about soul transfers for a few minutes it is actually            quite involving. Which is lucky, because Nomad Soul should keep you            busy for a week or two at least.                    The graphics are hardly up to the standards of a good first person            shooter, but they do have their own charm. The city is grimy and            atmospheric, and the difference between night and day is nicely            handled. The models are blocky and often poorly animated, but apart            from that the visuals are quietly impressive.                    There's even a ~virtual concert~ by David Bowie and Reeves Gabrels,            which is rather good .. until David's alter ego suddenly starts            flailing around the stage like a puppet whose controller is having            an epileptic fit.                    Let's hope Quantic find a real animator before their next game,            because many of Nomad Soul's models were obviously animated by a            blind monkey with a nervous twitch.                    It's also a little disappointing that having sat through the            concert (you can't skip in-game cutscenes), the game doesn't let            you talk to David's character. You can't even prostrate yourself on            the floor at his feet and chant ~We're not worthy, we're not            worthy~. Which is a shame...         Quantic                 Dream have overstretched themselves with Nomad Soul, trying to                 shoehorn too many different ideas and features into a single                 game. The end result is sadly deficient in most areas, and the                 first person shooter sections especially just don't gel with                 the rest of the game.                    On the bright side the game does have an immersive storyline with a            few twists and turns to keep you guessing, attractive graphics and            atmospheric settings, a great soundtrack by David Bowie, and plenty            of tasks to keep you busy.                    The whole is thankfully better than the sum of its parts, but it is            still a long long way from being a classic...            Release Date - available now"}
