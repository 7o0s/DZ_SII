Sure            enough they have failed to reach this lofty target, but for the            most part the result is still a highly entertaining first person            shooter.                        The first thing to get out of the way is that this is not a            realistic game. If you come to Allied Assault expecting Rainbow Six            meets Private Ryan you will be disappointed. For all the talk of            being ~steeped in authenticity~ and ~moving players away from the            Rambo style run and gun gameplay~, it's still a fairly traditional            action game. Your character can pick up and carry an entire arsenal            of lethal weaponry, from pistols and grenades to sniper rifles and            bazookas; you just need to keep an eye on the ammo gauge and plan            ahead to make sure that you don't reach the end of a clip in the            middle of a fight.                        This does make combat somewhat more tactical than in your average            shooter, and in the early stages of the game at least you will find            yourself ducking in and out of cover, falling back to reload, and            cautiously sneaking around corners and along rubble strewn streets.            But while your health bar dwindles fairly rapidly if you find            yourself on the wrong end of the gun, first aid packs are liberally            scattered throughout the levels to instantly cure you. Which seems            a bit of a cop out.                    This is also not a revolutionary game. There's nothing here that            hasn't been done before - Allied Assault just does it that little            bit bigger and better thanks to a combination of high production            values and the grunt of the Quake 3 engine.                        Like Half-Life, it uses scripted sequences to great effect to add            to the atmosphere and draw you into the game, from the opening            missions in north Africa to the awe-inspiring Omaha Beach sequence.            The D-Day missions are particularly effective at making you feel            like you're in the middle of a battle, even if there are really            only a couple of dozen allied soldiers on the beach with you. Your            friends cower behind any cover they can find as the officers try to            convince you to carry on up the beach, and the whole time you can            hear men screaming out for medics and machinegun bullets whistling            past you.                        The downside to this is that the scripting is inflexible and, at            times, downright bloody minded. Storming the beaches of Normandy            with mortars landing around you might look spectacular, but getting            blown up by one of those shells without any warning is an            incredibly frustrating experience. Making it to the dunes in one            piece is more down to trial and error than skill as you shelter            behind a post, quick save, run to the next post, quick save, get            blown up, quick load, wait a few seconds for the shelling to stop            and then set off again. I haven't used the F5 key this much since I            finished Max Payne.                    Unfortunately Normandy marks the high point of the game, and after            a few more missions in France things start to tail off noticeably.            There are less scripted sequences, the level design becomes            sloppier, and there's more and more reliance on throwing hordes of            German soldiers at you.                        The worst part of this is that the Germans aren't always in the map            with you when you begin a mission. Instead the game spawns            additional soldiers to keep you busy and (in some cases) to force            you to keep moving. Usually the game gets away with this, because            reinforcements emerge perfectly believably from ruined buildings or            sleeping quarters. Sometimes though things go horribly wrong, and            you find yourself being shot in the back by a gaggle of Germans who            have just streamed out of a previously empty building that you            cleared only a minute earlier. On a few occasions I even saw a            German soldier materialise out of thin air right in front of me,            which is unforgiveable.                        The game's rare attempts at stealth missions are also something of            a missed opportunity, falling far short of dedicated sneaking games            like Thief and Metal Gear Solid. The Wehrmacht obviously goes for            the strong silent type, because often your first warning that            there's an enemy soldier nearby is when they start peppering you            with bullets or make a dash for the nearest alarm. Detection tends            to be rather hit and miss as well - sometimes you can get away with            firing a deafening shot with your sniper rifle to take out a            sentry, only to get killed a few minutes later when a guard somehow            spots you crouching silently in a dark corner from a couple of            hundred feet away. There's no obvious logic to any of this and            you've no way of knowing how visible you are. And as the game            starts spawning more soldiers to track you down once the alarm has            been raised, this obviously leads to a lot of quick loading.                    Once you've exhausted the single player campaign, it's time to get            cracking on the multiplayer. As you would expect from a Quake 3            engined game, Allied Assault features solid online play and a range            of multiplayer modes, mostly using highly modified versions of            single player maps.                        First up is deathmatch, which is something of a non-starter. As in            all of the multiplayer modes you spawn with your choice of primary            weapon, and a pistol and half a dozen grenades as backup. Fighting            tends to be brief and brutal as everyone starts with a powerful            weapon and many of the deathmatch servers are using maps which are            far too small for the number of players. Team deathmatch is rather            more entertaining as only half the other players on the server are            trying to kill you, and there's a certain satisfaction to be had            from grouping together with a couple of machinegun-toting tank            drivers and an SS sniper to roam around the map picking off            American soldiers.                        The star attraction though is a selection of objective-based            teamplay maps which meld Counter-Strike gameplay with World War II            weaponry. Highlights include fighting your way through a ruined            French village to blow up German artillery, demolishing a bridge to            delay an American offensive, and re-enacting D-Day on a vast            revamped Omaha Beach map. Most of these maps are round-based, with            dead players having to wait and watch until one side has won, but            on Omaha soldiers on both sides respawn when they die, with the            battle continuing until the Americans can blow up a pair of German            cannons on top of the cliff overlooking the beach. The result is an            epic battle which rages across the beach and up through the German            bunkers, and can prove to be even more intense than the single            player version of the Normandy landings.                    Allied Assault isn't quite the seminal World War II action game we            were hoping for and the final product is rather uneven. It has            moments of pure genius, but these are accompanied by occasionally            sloppy level design and scripting, particularly in the later stages            of the game.                        If you can overlook these flaws Allied Assault should be at the top            of your shopping list, and even if you can't forgive them it's            probably still worth playing just for the excellent multiplayer            support and the first few hours of the single player campaign,            which ranks as arguably the most immersive first person shooter            experience ever. If only the rest of the campaign had maintained            those high standards we could have been looking at the game of the            year.                        -        Allied                    Assault interviewAllied                    Assault interview                    Medal Of Honor : Frontline PS2 preview                    Medal Of Honor : Frontline PS2 previewAllied                    Assault underwayAllied                    Assault underway"}
