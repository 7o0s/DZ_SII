Then I suggest you go            back to the front page and pick something else to read, because            Metal Slug X is a game for people who love 2D shooters, games which            defy convention and contemporary design techniques in favour of            pure gameplay. And explosions. Tons of them. MSX is the PlayStation            port of one of the most excessively difficult but downright            enjoyable 2D shooters SNK ever developed. Admittedly it isn't as            good as the Neo Geo originals, but then how does one improve upon            perfection?                         For those of you intrigued by the notion of a new 2D shooter, but            without a clue in the world what Neo Geo or Metal Slug is, here is            a brief introduction. Metal Slug X is a side-scrolling 2D shooter            starring four commandos and screen upon screen of Nazi equivalent            troops in locations ranging from Egypt to Siberia. You pick a            trooper and land at the start of the war zone, armed with your            trusty blaster and a full complement of bombs. As you move from            left to right, and occasionally in other directions, you pick up            more impressive weapons dropped off by POWs you manage to free and            by downed soldiers on the opposite side, not to mention vehicles,            and you put them to use eradicating the enemy threat.                         Being gifted weapons by POWs may sound ludicrous, but it's a            gameplay decision. Much of the rest of the game is also geared            towards entertainment, a perfect example being the graphics. Oh how            easy it would have been to create a fairly boring 3D world of            platforms and low-poly models, but unlike polygon monstrosities            which threaten to split at the seams on the straining PSX hardware,            Metal Slug X is hand-drawn through and through. The overall            resolution is quite low, but within the system's confines SNK has            crafted some beautiful sights. The main characters are all            diligently animated, and unlike many other PlayStation games where            detail deficiency is a part of the design rendered mandatory by            high-poly characters hogging all the resources, SNK can allot the            same amount of cartoon detail to each and every sprite; and so they            have.                    The menu and in-game interfaces are as spartan as they possibly can            be, enjoying more in common with a beat 'em up aesthetically. Your            HUD tells you (and your optional partner) how many lives, bullets            and bombs are at your disposal, as well as how many points you have            accrued. When you pick up a weapon your ammo measure is adjusted            and the game shouts the name of the weapon. Your model will be seen            changing his weapon, with the new skin viewable in each of the            usual positions; facing left and right, firing up and firing down            as you jump around, and the firing animations grow steadily more            exotic and spectacularly violent as the game continues.                         Meating the player out with a ferocious arsenal is the least SNK            could do, however. Fighting across moving trains, Indy Jones style,            trawling the catacombs and blasting your way through a busy street            is no walk in the park\u2026 by er, more than definition. Your            enemies are legion and pissed off. The troopers come in waves,            firing from a standing or crawling position, or hiding behind            objects and throwing grenades at you. Often they take up elevated            positions too, and projectiles vary in rhythm and rhyme. If you            simply pasted down the fire button you wouldn't get more than a few            feet. Apart from the troopers, you face tanks, planes and all            manner of other war machines, and various stage-specific bad guys            like Mummies in Egypt (with their mummification guns and grenades,            which bind you in cloth and lessen your mobility), and the aliens            who seem to be working with the pseudo-Nazis. Or are they?                         At the culmination of each of the game's six levels, you have a            massive boss encounter to deal with. When I say massive, I mean            screen-filling pandemonium. A little Armageddon with each passing            task. Even mid-level bosses fill the screen, and the end of            level attacks are great. The best has to be during your ascent from            the depths of the Egyptian tombs to the surface, as you leap            upwards in classic 2D style from platform to platform evading a            mechanical chomper as it crawls slowly along munching the route in            your wake. I haven't done that in a long time, and it was a welcome            challenge after so much contemporary 'innovation' in blasters of            late.                    Throughout the game you swap your trusty blaster for the likes of            machine guns, shotguns, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, even a            peculiar remote controlled bomb toy (rather like the sheep from            Worms) and a laser gun, which carves up enemies like a lightsaber.            Supplementing your arsenal besides are a number of pilotable            vehicles, and these are what give the series its notoriety, and            they are an asset here for sure. From the obvious trucks and tanks            to the less obvious camels with rotary guns, tanks with jump            buttons and Harrier-style hover jets, the game goes a long way            towards entertaining you. After screens and screens of delicate,            evasive blasting with the tension building and one life left on the            counter, hopping into the cockpit of something large and powerful            and ploughing through the amassed bad guys is a pleasant release. A            good, old fashioned gaming experience.                         'Good old fashioned' is indeed the overall theme, and as such the            game is an absolute bitch to play. Stupidly hard. Swarms of enemies            rain down upon you and you soak them up and have to introduce them            to the business end of a machine gun or whatever else you're            packing. MSX features five difficulty levels, and the least of them            is itself pretty difficult, although those not anxious to fight            through on one life can make use of the generous number of            continues.                         The level design is of the highest quality not only in terms of            visual impact and artistic achievement, but in terms of challenge            and the way it helps to live up to the deceptively simple premise.            You never once feel as though you have seen it all. By the end of            the game you are still waiting to be bored by the design. It            doesn't happen, and the grand finale rivals any battle witnessed in            a 3D shooter. The final boss is a tenacious sonofabitch, and the            battle reveals an interesting twist in the plot, matched by a            comedic end sequence which at first leaves you musing 'so, are we            still fighting?', before answering the question and getting a            laugh.                    Further to the basic single player game, SNK has thrown in ~Combat            School~, and the ~Another Mission~ mode as an added bonus. The            latter consists of 20 fairly simple levels, each of which consists            of one simple task and ten scores to beat. The first of them for            example asks you to race between a series of pylons without            dropping into the abyss, all the while avoiding cutlass-throwing            rogues on a bridge above and bomb-throwing troopers from left and            right. This wouldn't be too difficult, but you only have bombs - no            primary weapons - which makes getting to the end on one life to            register your score something of a challenge. Fans of the game will            lap up these extras, and they definitely add to the replay value,            although in itself I could play the single player game mindlessly            for the next two or three years. Co-op too is unputdownable. Is            that a word? It is now.                         That said, there are several chinks in the game's armour. The            digitised speech has been taken directly from the Neo Geo            originals, and as such falls short of the PlayStation's            capabilities. It adds to the low-budget feel of the game, but it            isn't great, and although the graphics never look pixellated, the            game does slow down from time to time when there's a lot happening            on-screen, which you would never have seen in the Neo Geo and            arcade originals. Furthermore, the music is mostly forgettable, and            although the Egyptian tune used on the first level is quite            memorable it isn't exactly something you might play in the car on            the way to work.                         Metal Slug X is a fan-pleasingly simple update to the MS series,            and to the rest of us it's the best game of its kind on the            PlayStation. At a wallet-friendly \u00a319.99 (and even less if you            shop around), this is an excellent investment, and the co-operative            multiplayer mode is a delightful inclusion. Let's just hope that it            isn't the last 2D shooter we see on a Sony platform."}
