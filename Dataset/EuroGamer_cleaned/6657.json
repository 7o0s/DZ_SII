It's not that            we don't like Disney (who could?), it's just our experiences of the            associated videogames have left us with nothing but the bad taste            of license exploitation in our mouths (with the exception of the            Square collaboration Kingdom Hearts, of course).                    So a couple of months on, and the madness of Christmas out of the            way, we decided that with the release date looming we should check            it out. Then we saw the Bizarre Creations logo appear once we            popped the disk in, and suddenly our attention was grabbed - after            all, this is the same studio that brought us the delights of            Project Gotham Racing. If only we'd have known this crucial fact            from the start.        But            even so - this is interactive merchandise, right? Surely Disney's            meddling would ensure it could only appeal to five year olds who            don't know any better? In fact, Sony's own promotional literature            admits it is ~aimed at the junior PlayStation 2 audience.~ Ulp.                    The description hardly sounded promising: ~A combination of            platform exploration adventure and space flying game~, or in other            words another cutesy game where you collect coins and jump around a            lot, biffing dimbo baddies around the chops occasionally, and fly            about collecting coins.                    Well, near enough. The game puts you in control of identikit Disney            hero Jim Hawkins, a sort of Guybrush Threepwood without the charm            or repartee, with his mimic pet Morph tagging along for the ride.            As you'd expect, you get to meet characters featured in the movie,            such as John Silver, Dr Doppler and B.E.N the robot, as well as            traverse five ~areas~ of the galaxy: Montressor, the spaceport,            Crescentia, the Legacy spaceship and eventually Treasure Planet            itself.        Each area is broken down into three or            more levels, with a number of familiar platform adventure            objectives. The basics are the staple of any game in this            overstocked genre - collect all the Drubloons (coins) and Green            Energies, complete the energy ring race challenges and other more            level specific tasks - and all the while tackling or avoiding the            marauding smugglers, space police or whatever else that deems it            necessary to get in your way. Every task you complete activates            another navigational beacon, and this in turn helps unlock more            levels. To begin with only one level is available, but as you            complete tasks, it becomes apparent that there are a minimum amount            of beacons you have to activate before you can visit other worlds.                    In a level structure reminiscent of Ratchet & Clank the game            allows you to progress without having to finish every single task -            but sometimes being thorough is the only way. And thoroughness is            essential if you're to stand a chance of getting anywhere in            Treasure Planet. Breaking every barrel and scouring every nook is            the way forward, and dying untold number of deaths is to be            expected - but fortunately much of your progress is saved            automatically in a Jak & Daxter style.                    We say ~much~, but frustratingly while the game always keeps a            track of how many Drubloons you've accumulated, it wipes the slate            clean of Green Energy orbs, and when you've found nine out of the            ten available, to find yourself having to go through the same            tediously basic task over and over again is a positively old school            approach, and frankly a daft design decision for a kid's game.        Elsewhere, the game has a few tricks up its sleeve, giving an            assortment of temporary power ups, such as Cyborg Arms (to break            otherwise impermeable objects), Jetpack (to get to those hard to            reach areas), and the Helping Hand (to move switches or levers). It            helps to break up the platform familiarity to an extent, but the            means of dispatching your foes are embarrassingly basic - punch or            a spin kick, or a combo of X (jump) and square for a diving attack.                    As we said earlier, it's a ~platform exploration adventure/space            flying game~, and it's the latter element that gave us the most            fun, combining elements of Tony Hawk with futuristic racing, giving            Jim a sort of mini Hover Yacht with which to cruise around with on            several of the levels. The same collect 'em up element remains, but            instead you're tasked with grinding rails, performing jumps with R1            and folding the sail down (to duck under low objects) with L1. The            game almost becomes compelling during the energy ring races - in            fact one of the levels had us hooked on that one task for over an            hour, but the trick based challenges won't hold your attention for            more than a few minutes.                    Graphically it's hardly in the same league as the PS2's trio of            platform classics (Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and as of            this week, Sly Raccoon), but for a Disney title it's the best we've            seen by a mile. The character art isn't bad at all, and the            animation is full of Disney touches that finally make it look            relatively faithful - albeit in a Pixar rendered style. One day a            developer will be able to create a Disney game that actually            looks like a Disney movie - rather than a video game with            characters that look a bit like the real thing.                    Sadly, the same amount of attention to detail hasn't been lavished            on the surroundings and scenery. While they are by no means a            disgrace, the lack of attention to detail in the distance is            obvious when you've been playing a Sly Raccoon or R&C. When Jim            falls into the abyss (which is regularly thanks to some less than            forgiving camera angles and jump mechanics) he plunges into a blank            blue space, giving it a feel of being somehow unfinished.                    Talking of camera angles - having just played the superbly polished            Sly Raccoon, Treasure Planet is a jarring return to normality, with            the game requiring you to manually dictate the viewpoint with the            right stick - leading to endless situations where you're fiddling            with the angle so you can stand a chance of not dying when you take            that next (theoretically fairly easy) jump. As a game it's pretty            straightforward in most respects, but being killed through a lame            camera mechanic should be a punishable offence these days.                    Treasure Planet sets out to be a kid's game, and at its core it            succeeds. It's peppered with movie clips, has cute environments and            well realised characters and easy to understand objectives, and            even a soundtrack that deserves some credit. But overall, we can't            help but feel that the difficulty level of certain sections could            have been made a little more forgiving - and in many cases this is            down to a dreadful camera design rather than anything genuinely            challenging. As a Disney game it's the best one we've played (which            isn't saying much), but ultimately in the context of other games in            the genre, it's a long way down the pecking order - especially when            you consider than all the recent Sony published platformers are            perfect for kids already.
