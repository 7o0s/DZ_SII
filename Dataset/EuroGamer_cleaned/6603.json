With each passing            year, we all watch the endless procession of increasingly beautiful            and expansive racers pass us by, like little blurs of metallic            lightning. Some are crap and some are good, but the truly excellent            ones have uniform stunning visuals, all manner of vehicles to toy            with, and varied, authentic tracks. The top one or two per cent            will play better than Ridge Racer Type 4. If you only buy a couple            every year, the chances are that any given driver has to have Heidi            Klum's looks, Michael Schumacher's skill behind the wheel and            Jay-K's fleet of sports cars to even come close. Unfortunately for            WorldRacing, at first glance it doesn't seem to check all the right            boxes.        Mercedes-Benz WorldRacing, to give it the title TDK dropped but            the world retained, is centred entirely around one brand of car,            and surely that's a problem to start with? However much effort            German developer Synetic put into WR, it's always going to be            limited in one key area. However, as you gallivant around the globe            competing in races, completing the odd mission-based level and            free-riding over oodles of scenery, you'll actually unlock as many            as 109 cars, both old and new and from every class imaginable.                    You see, Mercedes make nice cars, and lots of them. I've driven one            in real-life (although I forget which), and they do handle very            nicely, they obviously look very swish, and they come in all sorts            of reasonably affordable models. There are even off-roaders for            goodness sake. So I guess that's one box checked.                    And we can tick off awe-inspiring visuals too, because WorldRacing            makes huge gains thanks to its amazingly detailed landscapes, which            stretch as far as the eye can see and rarely drag the frame rate            anywhere south of optimal, except in split-screen multi-player.            We've been told that the game can render 6km squared of level, and            it's not too hard to believe when you've scrambled your car to the            top of a mountain and had a glance over your shoulder\u2026        Few technical compromises have been made, either. Cars are            given plenty of detail, from the three-pointed-star to the curve of            the chassis and the colour of the seats. Your driver, as selected            from a group of rather stern-looking men and women, can clearly be            seen from front-side views churning away at the wheel as you donut            someone's village green in a C-class, as can your custom number            plate, helmet and so on.                    The environment is also finely detailed, with massive efforts            thrown at everything from Area 51 (complete with flying saucers,            fighter jets and scrambling military personnel) and a sun-drenched            jungle to snowy Alpine peaks and the rippling seas down in the            harbour. This is no Project Gotham in terms of urban detail, but            looking at the broader picture as you often are, it's hard not to            be taken aback by the serene beauty of it all.                    Sadly though, the game lets itself down in other technical areas.            We love the look of the game, but the vehicle damage is a bit daft            - if you're not going to bother doing it properly, then don't just            opt for token dents. It looks mighty stupid when experimental types            like myself throw an SLK off the top of a mountain only to land on            all four wheels and drive off smoothly. And there's evidence of            serious laziness elsewhere - you can drive through people, palm            trees and other bits of scenery if you want, and most astonishing            of all, you can drive on top of the sea. Despite ships            bobbing up and down nearby (which you can of course drive straight            through), the water acts like road and even feels like road to            drive on. They couldn't even be bothered to fence it off properly -            very shoddy.        Then there's the final area, which makes all the difference -            the handling. Ignoring the fact that wacky UFOs, ocean-racing and            granite-strength barriers are trying very hard to upset the flow of            realism, Synetic has opted to try and emulate the various Mercedes            cars accurately. And unlike Gotham, this means we have to deal as            much with of the tedium of real driving as we do with the            entertaining side. Handling improves and cars become more fun, the            more of the game you unlock, but it's never as smooth and enjoyable            as games like Gotham, RalliSport and Racing Evoluzione. These            titles cracked the balance between realism and arcade with gusto,            and were much better for it. WorldRacing just feels like a            simulation of Mercedes-Benz and The National Inquirer.                    And there are other niggles, too. The CPU AI is basically modelled            on Michael Schumacher as best we can tell. It cheats; it drives to            perfection, and losing out on any given turn generally means you            won't make up the gap. Only by shunting people around did we ever            make much difference. Other problems include Synetic's decision to            have the obligatory ~replace car on track instantly~ button on            White and the ~rear view~ button on Black. Guess how many times we            hit the wrong one? It was plenty, and you can't alter the controls.            Oh, and then there's the apparent lack of a proper ~pick a track            and race on it~ option. You know, the Single Race bit, which every            racing game in existence besides WorldRacing apparently has? As if            that wasn't enough, the music is all courtesy of Ministry of Sound.            Not for us.                    In the end, WorldRacing ticks enough of the boxes to be a            contender, but it doesn't have that final lap adrenaline injection            to send it sailing through the finish line competitively. It's too            hard, it's a bit feebly constructed in places, and it plays too            much like real driving, which, for a game laden with UFOs, is a bit            of a contradiction.
