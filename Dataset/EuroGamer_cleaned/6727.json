Still, what sort of port is it, and would it be one to spend one's hard-earned readies on? That ultimately depends on how much you like SSX, and specifically, the notion of SSX on a bike. Do you like it? Read on.            SSX on a bike, or FreekStyle to its friends, is an excellent idea            flawed in its execution. The game suffers from too much repetition,            a challenge that falls on the wrong side of hard and collision            detection implemented by blind people. But on the other hand, it's            a fast-paced, oft exciting game of motocross with stupendous tracks            and the usual complement of boost features, insane stunts and            ~street~ stylings, including a soundtrack which upset our delicate            sensibilities but seems to have enthralled a lot of others.                           The mechanics of FreekStyle remain unchanged for this port. You            line up for a series of races in three stages each, with each stage            consisting of three laps. So you perform nine increasingly            difficult laps and if you place first at the end, you get the next            track. Unfortunately, the chance of being pipped right at the post            is very likely, and even if you do only have to repeat the stage            (three laps), this has a tendency to mount up, and the gameplay            dynamic isn't rewarding enough in itself to carry that amount of            repetition. Before long though, if you persevere, you'll make it to            the trick stages, which are neither Tony Hawk's nor SSX but still            quite good fun, and then a series of gruelling one-time races to            finish the game off.                           As it's SSX, you spend most of the time building up your            character's statistics and watching them pick fights with fellow            competitors. Which isn't too bad, since you can choose to be            voluptuous ladies (or simply bully them instead), and the same is            true of the graphics on the whole - not too bad. The Cube version            of the game has been given a bit of polish and sparkle, and the            extra oomph the Cube can offer has solved the dodgy framerate            problem which marred FreekStyle on the PS2. However, although you            would expect a four-player split-screen option what with the Cube's            multi port goodness and its enhanced ability to render the game            decisively, the Cube port offers no such option. It's two-player or            nothing. That said, multiplayer was an overlooked plus point for            the original - although it doesn't elevate it above the status of            an SSX wannabe, it does add a few hours to the longevity.                    If you lap up everything SSX and liked the look of the PS2            original, FreekStyle will probably seem worthwhile. It's            fast-paced, mostly enjoyable and quite engaging, but it does suffer            from issues of repetition and, well, groovyness. There's only so            much ~street~ ~spirit~ we can put up with, you know."}
