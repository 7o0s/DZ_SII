Running at speeds of 566 and            600MHz (and most recently 633, 667 and 700MHz), the chip loses a            lot of performance due to having only half the L2 cache of its big            brother the Pentium III, but as a result also has an extremely            wallet-friendly price.                         Another contributing factor in the performance deficit is the            frontside and memory bus speed of 66MHz. This causes a problem for            any application that expects the CPU to process large amounts of            data and transfer them back and forth in quick succession. Of            course, one such example is a 3D game. So even if you're using a            GeForce 2 GTS at 4x AGP, you're going to be limited to a very            stunted memory throughput, and your framerate will be limited            disastrously by the CPU; something no gamer wants.                         Obviously then the most important points in the construction of a            competing budget chip are a higher frontside bus and memory bus,            and enough cache to be safe but not to drag the price to stupid            levels.                         This is where the construction process of the CPU becomes very            important. With the Celeron, Intel takes Pentium IIIs that have a            certain about of bad cache blocks during production and basically            disables half of the cache. With the Duron, AMD use the same            process as they do with the Thunderbird Athlons, giving them the            same FSB and memory bus speed; 100MHz DDR, effectively three times            that of the Celeron. The performance difference between the two is            hefty, and to add insult to injury, not only is the Duron cheaper            than the Celeron at corresponding frequencies, but it's also            available at higher clock speeds anyway!                    The Duron we're looking at is a 750MHz part, currently second only            to the recently released 800MHz part. It's a 0.18micron core with            some 25 million transistors, a multiplier of 7.5x, 128Kb of on-die            L1 cache running at core speed, and 64-bit exclusive 64Kb of L2            cache running at clock speed. For details on the exclusive versus            non-exclusive cache question, see our review of the            Thunderbird.                         The packaging type is the now-familiar Socket A format, with 462            pins, similar to Intel's ~flip-chip~ format, and the processor uses            a core voltage of 1.6V, although lower-speed Durons may use 1.5V.                         Interestingly, the Duron is only using Aluminium interconnects at            the moment. This may have something to do with the fact that the            high speed Copper interconnects are being reserved for chips of            1GHz and beyond. The chips are therefore being produced at AMD's            Austin plant rather than its Dresden fab. As such the manufacturing            process may need an update for the Duron to hit 1GHz, or at least a            shift toward the Dresden fab.                         However, although the Duron is an impressive beast in itself and            not just a ~PIII reject~ ala the Celeron, the question of its            relative performance is still outstanding. Surely the only things            standing between it and budget market domination are price,            stability, performance and Intel's good name. AMD can't do much            about the latter, but it looks as though the first three are in            check.                    The installation process went without a hitch. Our test board, an            ASUS A7V, is one of the best in its class, and after the            application of a thin layer of thermal paste and a GlobalWin FOP32            heatsink/fan we were all set. Although the A7V offers advanced            options for memory tweaking, we felt it prudent to keep them at            default settings so as not to influence the test. However if you            are building a new PC and are stuck between the Celeron and Duron,            this should be a concern, since the latest VIA chipset used here is            asynchronous to a large extent, meaning that you can tweak memory            performance without stressing the FSB in any way. Quite a feat, and            something the BX chipset and even the i815 cannot yet do.                         Testing the chip wasn't too difficult; we pitted it against a            Celeron running at 700MHz, a chip costing some \u00a340 more than            AMD's 750MHz part. You may think this is slightly unfair on Intel,            but with the chip giant's prices looking as unshakable as ever we            do not.                         As with the Thunderbird, as far as we're concerned, the most            important test is its real-life performance in Quake III. This is            what we care about, and a lot of gamers feel the same way. We used            a fairly generic stick of 128Mb PC100 memory and a 3d Prophet II            GeForce 2 GTS, with two boxes both running Windows Millenium on            7200RPM hard-drives. The first box featured the ASUS A7V and Duron            750MHz, with the second using an ABit SE6 and Celeron 700MHz.                    : the low-end                    : the other extreme                    As the tests clearly show, at the low resolution, the Duron            outperforms the Celeron by a long shot. At the highest resolution            things aren't so clear-cut, but this has more to do with the            graphics card limitations anyway. We found that at low resolutions,            effectively the Duron 750 performs at the same level or thereabouts            as the Athlon 700, whereas the Celeron has difficulty keeping up            with a 500MHz processor or thereabouts.                    If you're going to buy a budget processor with the intention of            gaming with it, then you should buy a Duron. There are so many            factors in its favour that it negates discussion. If you intend to            use it for business work then there's a good argument for that too.            Overall, the Duron pummels the Celeron into the ground. The only            thing that can really save the Celeron now is the introduction of a            100MHz frontside bus, scheduled for the very near future. I feel we            shall have to re-examine the issue then, however in the meantime,            there is no argument."}
