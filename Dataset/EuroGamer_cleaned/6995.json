Feeling a            bit bored with first-person shooters? Growing tired of beardy RPG            types jabbering on and on about elves and wizards and\u2026 stuff?            Well, along come our far eastern chums with yet another oddball            solution to our plain, dull little existences, this time in the            form of a (Drrrrrrrrrrrrrr -Drumroll Ed) typing tutor!                         Hmm\u2026 that doesn't sound too promising does it? Perhaps            simplifying it (admittedly for my own convenience) down to being a            typing tutor isn't the correct thing to do, because it's not really            such a thing. Don't fret, because this is no ordinary Mavis Beacon            doldrums affair, this is a modified version of the arcade classic            lightgun shooter The House of the Dead 2, but instead of wielding a            zombie-pulping shotgun, you have to type your way through the            rampaging hordes of the rabid undead. I know, it sounds absolutely            crazy, but god damn, IT WORKS!                         Frankly, I don't quite know what got into Sega, but replacing            characters guns with keyboards and Dreamcast's strapped to their            backs and sending them into battle happens to be a master-stroke of            innovation whilst even being a little self-improving. Play takes            the form of the aforementioned shooter on rails whilst phrases and            words appear on the screen over the appropriate bad guy. In the            game's simplest form, you just have to type the words as quick as            possible, with longer words for bigger enemies. All the while, a            particularly hammy B-Movie plot is being played during short            intermissions replete with dreadful voice acting and not an iota of            depth.                    But really, who cares about lack of storytelling prowess when a            game can let you have this much fun by typing for goodness sake?            Extended play even reveals a surprising level of depth, as the game            style often shifts and skews as you progress through the stage and            onto the enormous boss creatures. Aside from simply typing words to            dispatch the beasties, you are required to type answers to multiple            choice questions in order to score a direct hit whilst others            require complex phrase repetition.                         Also included are tutorials hosted by the game characters who lend            you a helping hand in getting to grips with the rigmarole of            learning to touch type - even this scribe managed to pick up a few            pointers. After you finish a stage you're presented with a            wonderfully detailed assessment of your performance, and you can            even go to a Drill mode, which lets you, practice typing with your            weakest letters should you feel the need to work on them some more.                         It's surprising how many playing tactics there are to learn in            TTOTD, as well. As you progress you'll begin to learn how best to            deal with large groups of zombies, or how to tackle small and fast            creatures. There's a myriad of ways to take on different types of            enemy, and the fact that you're literally being rewarded with your            determination only builds the incentive for sticking with the game.            The game itself is actually huge, as well as the additional            tutorial stages, and it would take even the fastest typist a good            few hours to complete.                         Graphically it's pretty solid although the occasional glitch pops            up here and there, but seeing as you're panicking for a good deal            of the time looking to and from the keyboard you rarely get a            chance to admire to scenery. It's surprising how much of a            crowd-puller the title can be as well, as I often had an audience            and people queuing for a go whenever I started it up. The laughs            the experience creates are quite unlike anything else of recent            times, which is a testament to how simply enjoyable and original            the idea is.                    The Typing of the Dead is a game practically anyone can have a go            at without failing to have a good time. The frantic, shifting pace            allows for a game that can be played at length without growing            repetitive, but the serious skills building that lies underneath            the brash surface offers any player the chance to brush up on their            typing talent."}
