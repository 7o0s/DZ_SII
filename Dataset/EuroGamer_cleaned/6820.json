And despite the limitations of the format, the            result is a surprisingly faithful translation.                        Once again you step into the shoes of hapless American tourist            George Stobbart, who turns detective when he narrowly escapes an            explosion at a Paris cafe. Determined to track down those            responsible for the blast, he teams up with local photographer            Nicole Collard to follow a trail of clues that vary from a dirty            handkerchief to an ancient manuscript, all leading inexorably back            to the shadowy Knights Templar and an ancient conspiracy.                        Thankfully the game doesn't take itself too seriously though, a            fact which should be abundantly clear by the time you've made it to            the end of the bizarre opening cinematic. The humour is a bit hit            and miss, but the dialogue can be very funny at times, with plenty            of parody, sarcasm and satire thrown in, and characters ranging            from an unsanitary Syrian kebab stall owner to a pub full of            Irishmen. Stop to chat to someone and little icons illustrating            your conversation options will appear in the top left of the            screen, allowing you to choose your responses and questions with            the D-pad. Often you'll have to work your way through all of these            options to get the information you need, and the dialogue doesn't            always make a lot of sense if you ask the questions out of order,            but generally it works quite well.                    The puzzles are also very good for the most part - not too            easy, but perfectly logical if you stop to think about them, even            if you have to switch off your GameBoy for a few minutes while you            ponder what to do next.                        Things are made simpler by the new streamlined interface, which            suits the GameBoy Advance perfectly. The right shoulder trigger            cycles through any ~hot spots~, and although adventure game            veterans might consider this cheating, it does save you squinting            at the screen in search of items to interact with. Meanwhile the            left shoulder button lets you explore your inventory and use or            combine the items therein. As in any good adventure game you'll            find yourself amassing a variety of unusual objects in your            voluminous trouser pockets, but managing them is straightforward,            and you should never have much more than a dozen items to deal with            at any one time.                        Visually the translation to hand-held gaming has been excellent as            well, from the gorgeous snapshots that make up the introduction to            the detailed locations and smooth character animations. It's been            quite an effort to cram that much data on to a GameBoy cartridge,            and there are some noticeable compression artifacts in a couple of            areas, but overall the graphics are impressive, and highlights of            Barrington Pheloung's soundtrack have also been included to build            up the atmosphere. Sadly there isn't much sound in the game apart            from the music, but what little is included is used to great            effect, such as the sound of a cardiograph flatlining.                    Broken Sword isn't without its flaws - the romance angle is pretty            tacky and unconvincing, certain parts of the storyline seem to get            glossed over, and the game comes to a rather abrupt (if explosive)            end. There's also at least one point where you can get completely            stuck by visiting locations in the wrong order, and given that            there are a few places where you can get killed if you're careless,            it does pay to save frequently and keep more than one copy of your            progress in case you need to backtrack.                        Aside from these slight niggles though, Broken Sword is a gripping            little adventure that should keep you busy for at least six to            eight hours. Replay value is obviously fairly limited, and you can            still pick up the original PC version of the game for under a fiver            from Sold Out, but if you absolutely must have an adventure game on            the go, this is the best there is at the moment."}
