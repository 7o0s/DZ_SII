However, it seems            that the question itself is rather irrelevant now, with the game            available in such miniscule quantities that anybody still perched            on the fence without a pre-order to their name is unlikely to end            up with a copy, online auctions notwithstanding. So, ultimately,            the fact that we wouldn't pay \u00a3129.99 to play it seems quite            moot.        You're all no doubt aware of why the game costs so much, but            let's recap just in case. Steel Battalion is a 'mech simulator'            rather than an action game, and it comes bundled with a three-part,            40-button controller, three times the size of Xbox, complete with            gear sticks, joysticks, foot pedals and pointless flip switches.            And Capcom's idea of a mech isn't the super-sleek, humanlike anime            realisation, but more of a genuine piece of heavy machinery - with            quirky handling, acceleration that would shame a Sinclair C5, and            the lumbering posture of a constipated knight in armour.                    As a result, it's a game with a worryingly steep learning curve.            Whereas other mech games are happy to shower you with praise for            being the only man in the universe capable of hitting the A and B            buttons occasionally, you generally are elite if you can            overcome the odds in Steel Battalion.                    At the heart of the game is a menacing campaign mode with a boring            military story, which starts off by thrusting you into the cockpit            of the Pacific Rim's prized Vertical Tank and screaming RTFM - no            exaggeration. Fortunately, the manual in question is mercifully            brief for a game like this and acts as a handy reference guide            throughout. You'll quickly get used to the VT boot-up sequence;            hitting buttons, reaching for flip switches and cranking gears.            After a while it's second nature.                    But as you start off it's obvious that this is no mere arcade            shooter with a fancy peripheral. You'll need to keep an eye on your            gears, because acceleration is slow and cumbersome, whilst watching            your joysticks, watching the radar, maintaining ammo levels,            washing your screen occasionally and keeping in touch with wingmen.            Your joysticks have many uses - the left stick controls steering            primarily, with a little thumb stick on top handling the viewfinder            (click it in, ~R3-style~, to centre), and the right stick controls            the right-side arm of the mech, which is equipped with rockets and            so on. There's a trigger on it and lock on/fire buttons under your            thumb. On the whole, controlling a VT sounds complex because it is.        However, the actual game (i.e. the on-screen bit) is slightly            less inspiring than the grown-up kiddy controller. A lot of the            screen is taken over by mostly static details, like ammo counters,            radars, readouts and data overlays. You can toggle certain            elements, like the radar screen, and later on in the game you're            rewarded with large-screen mechs, but even then you're still going            to be squinting at what goes on outside the cockpit on anything            less than a 28~ TV. In fact, it wasn't until we saw the game            running on Kristan's 36~ widescreen TV [my pride and joy - Ed] that            we realised the radar shows flying shells. The relatively short            distance from couch to 25~ TV in our lounge is enough to obscure            the pixel-sized projectiles entirely.                    The limitations of your VT, too, contribute to the difficulty. To            begin with, your objectives are generally 'seek and destroy',            clearing the way for reinforcements, and latterly you'll be working            under tremendous pressure in confined spaces in the face of            insurmountable odds. As such, the core of the gameplay is spread            between marshalling your resources effectively (shooting at clearly            visible and threatening targets only, getting clear of buildings            before firing, saving your limited-ammo, mech-busting weapons for            enemy VTs, etc) and pushing your own VT to its fullest without            overdoing it. Each VT will tip over like a Robin Reliant in a gale            if you turn sharply above a particular speed threshold, and if you            hurl shells around the battlefield like George Bush on a Friday            night then you'll overheat and risk temporary shutdown - and coming            to a dead stop in the midst of a fire fight is not            advisable.                    Engaging the enemy quickly becomes a case of keeping up a good            speed, relying on the lock-on for a sure-fire hit and making            liberal use of the dash pedal. The dash pedal is where you'd expect            the clutch to be on the heavy, foot-facing aspect of the            peripheral. Depending on the gear you're in or the angle of your            steering stick, hitting this will give the mech a great burst of            speed in a certain direction, useful for evasive manoeuvres when            confronted by homing missiles.        Given the price tag, the learning curve, and the fact that            failing to hit the eject button when your VT goes critical will            wipe your save games, it's fairly obvious that Steel Battalion is            aimed at the super hardcore, so it seems a little odd that more            effort hasn't gone into the AI and visuals. The control scheme and            mechanics of warfare were clearly the focus, but the pop-up, for            example, is atrocious. As you chase a red blip in one of the early            levels, a city literally pops out of the mist - it's an effect            comparable to Daytona USA on the Saturn, something we hoped we'd            never have to say - and although Capcom has made clever use of            visual effects, underscoring the simulation aspect with a black and            white displays for some VTs, and varying the time of missions to            highlight the effect of different light conditions, the overall            aesthetic would look more at home on a PS2 than an Xbox at times.                    What's worse is that for all the pop-up and grainy, greyscale            visuals (however deliberate), the architecture is often no more            exciting than that of Panzer Front on the PSX. Buildings are too            chunky, enemy units are often just painted bricks, and soldiers on            the ground look like toy soldiers. However clever it is to have            mechs which move like mechanical diggers rather than Olympic            gymnasts, and a massive HUD with a simulation feel, nothing makes            up for this sort of detail deficit, particularly given the pop-up            and occasional slowdown evident elsewhere. The best thing about the            visuals is the constant barrage of explosions, and the way your            cockpit goes haywire when you're on the verge of death. Apart from            that, we could take them or leave them.                    And we're not going to leave out the AI, either - if you can call            it that. Although your enemies can handle a rocket launcher with            relative skill, your wingmen are so hilariously inept that as they            bump into one another for the fiftieth time, get caught on the            scenery and generally walk around in circles, you'll wonder just            why they're there at all.                    Fortunately, the audio side of things hits home with all the force            of a rocket propelled grenade in a napalm depository, with some of            the most expert use of Dolby Digital 5.1 we've encountered. You            really can tell the difference between each kind of incoming and            outgoing threat, quickly pinpointing that 100mm cannon shell flying            in from the rear, and realising that a bit of dash pedal evasion            might be in order. It's just a shame that this precision is limited            to the audio.                    On the whole, Steel Battalion just doesn't feel like it's worth            \u00a3129.99. It's a month on and we're not as thrilled by the            mostly plastic controller any more. It's big, it flashes and it has            that intangible coolness to it, but it'll quickly gather dust and            it really does monopolise your living room. And although the game            itself is cleverly built in places with nice touches (like forcing            you to spend credits wisely, trading off mech features against the            ability to ship in supplies mid-mission; and the way the game            punishes you for resetting before it can save by stripping you of            your mech), you can't escape the technical limitations, the little            niggles, the frustration of having to start over every time your            flick-and-tap skills desert you, and having to perform that boot-up            sequence every single time, and the stupidity of Daytona-level            pop-up in an Xbox-exclusive game.                    Steel Battalion started off as a fantastic idea - a sort of            grown-up Fisher Price spinning mobile to sate the child inside us            all - but with a prohibitive price tag and a less than stellar game            to back it up, we'd be tempted to wait for a sequel and maybe think            about buying it then."}
