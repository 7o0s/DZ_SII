Any similarity to real            events and persons living or dead is purely coincidental though, as            this is an old fashioned side-scrolling action game. As such you            take control of a gun-toting hero as he pounds his way through four            themed areas, ranging from desert bunkers to snow-covered            mountains, all of which are packed full of evil doers to eliminate.                        Most of the game is spent running, gunning and hopping between            ledges, and although the whole thing is rather primitive, it's            entertaining enough. As you might expect, AI is non-existent, with            enemy soldiers following pre-scripted paths and stopping at            seemingly random moments to let off a few shots. And in true retro            fashion, their bullets generally move slowly enough for you to hop            over or duck under them if you're quick. At first you'll be facing            grunts with the same lousy slow firing assault rifle as you, but as            the game progresses you come across burly chaingunners,            mortar-firing soldiers and even jeeps and buggies with mounted            machineguns. Your own arsenal will expand to include a faster            firing rifle, grenades, a rocket launcher and last (and mostly            certainly least) a flamethrower, which is frankly useless - it            can't be fired while crouching and has such a short range that the            only thing I ever used it for was burning down doors and other            obstacles. Handcuffs can be used to capture enemy officers, and a            grappling hook is occasionally needed to reach the next area, but            that's about your lot.                        This doesn't leave you with much variety in weaponry or targets, so            it's perhaps lucky that there's (slightly) more to the game than            side-on shooting. Sometimes you'll find a parachute in the level,            causing your character to leap off the nearest cliff, and leaving            you to watch a pair of markers that show your horizontal and            vertical position. If you're outside of the thin red marks when you            open the parachute, it's back to the top and start again, minus one            life. This takes some practice to get right, and can be incredibly            infuriating. There are also some sniper sections, where you're            given a small crosshair view of the world to sweep across the            landscape, picking off a certain number of terrorists to free five            hostages against a time limit. Succeed and you will gain an extra            life, but more often than not you'll have lost at least one life in            the process. Finally there are the vertical scrolling sections,            where you get to pilot a helicopter, dropping bombs on tanks and            SAM sites beneath you and firing your machineguns at enemy            choppers.                    All of which is fairly entertaining, if somewhat repetitive. But            sadly the game is let down by one major flaw - not only can you not            save your position, but you are only given a password when you            reach the end of one of the game's four missions. Needless to say            this makes for a very frustrating experience, and there's nothing            worse than spending twenty minutes on a mission only to run out of            lives while battling the final boss, forcing you to start the whole            thing over again from scratch. This was presumably done to make the            game seem longer than it is, because if you were able to save more            frequently you'd easily complete the whole thing in an hour or two.            As a full price game this doesn't make for good value for money...            UK Release            Date - now available"}
