When that name is 'Turbo Camels: CircusExtreme', the answer is ~camels and circuses~, obviously - but you'd still be forgiven for running a mile. It smacks of contrived wackiness, which is enough to give any mobilegamer the, erm, hump.Suffice to say, 'Turbo Camels: Circus Extreme' doesn'tconjure up visions of a marvellously playable casual game that's asaddictive as crack-laced Haribo Tangfastics. But stick with us.Circus Extreme is actually the second Turbo Camelsgame, following last year's moderately successful racing titlewhose sole distinguishing feature was its knobbly-backeddromedaries.If Circus Extreme trod the same path, it wouldn't beworth your time and money. With or without clowns.But thankfully, Mr Goodliving has torn up its camel rulebook andproduced, yes, a marvellously playable casual game that's asaddictive as... well, you get the picture.Yes, it's still about a camel. He's called Baldwin and he's thebounciest camel we've ever seen. He comes with a rider calledGunther, whose sole purpose is to dangle wildly from a set of reinswhile Baldwin bounces around a series of colourful levelscollecting objects as he goes.The gameplay is a straight cross between DigitalChocolate's Johnny Crash and the pinball levels in the originalconsole Sonic The Hedgehog games.At the start of every level, you fire Baldwin from a cannon, andthen have to guide him around the screen using your rocket booster.You build up boost energy by hitting the walls andbouncing off obstacles, and then use it to propel yourself in anyone of eight directions. Great fun.The levels are colourful and varied, grouped into three basicthemes (Circus, Zoo and Ghost Train), and below that intosub-categories of four to five levels, each with their ownmini-theme. Yes, there are clowns, but also snakes, pandas, turtlesand all manner of other animals, most of which you interact with bybouncing on them.But what really makes Turbo Camels: Circus Extreme soaddictive is its multi-layered scoring system. Each level has aminimum number of objects to collect. Bag that minimum and you gaina Silver Star for completing the level. However, if you collect allthe available objects, you get a Gold Star.These are used to fill your 'Fame-ometer', which tells you howcameltastic you are. Oh, and you also get a points score for eachlevel, based on how quickly you finish it, how much you've bounced,and how much boost energy you have left when you land on the finishmarker.Beat the high score for a level, and you'll get a Trophy, whichbesides making you feel special helps open new stages and bonusgoodies.All this sounds complicated, but basically it means even whenyou've beaten a level once and gained a silver star, you'll want tokeep playing it to earn the gold Star and trophy.We'll make no bones about it, Circus Extreme ismarvellous. It's simple to pick up, but once it gets its camellyclaws into you, you won't be able to stop playing. Our onlycriticism is that as you get further into the game, it does getreally hard.We're currently stumped on the Pit section of the Ghost Traintheme after three weeks of solid play, to be perfectly honest,although upping our Gold Star quota from earlier levels is helpingus to drive our Fame-ometer rating beyond its current 85/130level.Our difficulties aside, this is one of the most characterful,fun and, yes, quirky mobile games you'll get your hands on thisyear. So when you see it pop up on your mobile operator's portal,look beyond the name. You'll be enchanted for weeks."}
