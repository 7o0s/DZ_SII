Due to the teacher's                 inconsistency with decisions and his firm belief that any                 untoward tackling was just a case of getting used to the                 rules, playing hockey was literally putting your life out on a                 limb.                    So when it comes to reviewing NHL Championship 2000 (or C2K for            short), I probably know more about ice hockey (there can't be            that many differences, can there?) than anyone else at            EuroGamer.                    Ironically, not even my feeble repertoire of hockey facts could            stand up to C2K...                    When you first load up NHL Championship 2000, the first thing that            strikes you is the snazzy interface. It's very sharply contoured,            and navigation is swift. Should you be interested in customising            the various statistics and rules you can do so to your heart's            content. Equally, if you have next to no comprehension of how any            of this ice hockey mumbo-jumbo works, you can just hit ~Play~ to go            through a game with the default teams and settings. In order to            work out how the game played (not because I was clueless), I tried            this first...                    Since just about every sports game in the world these days requires            a gamepad, I put my hard-earned to good use and picked up an MS            Sidewinder a few months ago. It has served me well with games like            FIFA 2000 and EA's NHL 2000, and I've never wanted for another pad.                    I only tell you this, because in spite of the manual's insistence            to the contrary, the controls just don't work as specified.            For instance, buttons Y and Z on the pad are supposedly unbound,            but instead buttons B and C seem to be devoid of function and            buttons Y and Z do other things completely. Another control-related            quibble is that when the goalie receives the puck there seems to be            no way of dispatching it again using the pad! Believe me, I've            tried!                    This quickly made the game very hard to play (and frustrating too),            so I reverted to the keyboard and fired it up once more. Disaster!            The game's configurations are shockingly bad - you either cram            yourself into the top-right corner of the keyboard or spread            yourself across the left. Either way the game is impossible to            control effectively, and of course you can't reconfigure the            controls either...         Nevertheless, I wanted to enjoy the                 game, so I put aside my qualms and tried to play the game with                 one of the keyboard configurations. Things can only improve                 from here .. or so I thought.                    I skated around aimlessly for a while, trying to grasp the game in            the same way that I had grasped EA's ice hockey titles, but to no            avail. For all its official statistics and supposedly simplistic            control system, I could never manage to put together the hasty and            effective passing movements that had made NHL 2000 so much fun.                    Nor could I culminate anything with a finishing shot. Instead I            would usually either put the puck safely into the keeper's glove or            lose it in transit and risk reprise from my opponent's            counter-attack.                    To NHL Championship 2000's credit, its defensive and attacking AI            is very well done, at times reminding me of just how inexperienced            I am when it comes to ice hockey. But then at times it's just plain            unfair.                    If I'm on an attack I don't expect to see a 6ft hockey stick            wielded in my face to prevent my shot - even I know that's breaking            the rules. You are supposed to be penalised for that kind of            behaviour, but the referee sees nothing - play on. At least in NHL            2000, this sort of event would lead to a Street Fighter-esque            beat-em-up round. I haven't seen anything like that in C2K...         One area that any sports title should try to avoid falling            down in is graphics. EA Sports really have set the trend in terms            of authenticity, and Fox Sports like so many others have yet to            catch up.                    Graphically the game is functional, although at times impressive -            the interface, for example. But even though competition comes by            way of EA, that's no excuse for the rather dodgy player animations            found throughout. You press down the Wrist Shot button and, unlike            the smooth backswing of NHL 2000, your player's arm flicks into            position without so much as a transitional frame!                    While I'm on the subject of graphics, why oh why does the game            insist on replaying every little incident and minutely exciting            moment? The goalie covers up the puck (which I can't help, seeing            as I don't have any way of getting rid of it) and, oh look, a            replay of the events leading to it. It gets depressing, and you end            up scrambling to try turn it off.                    Speaking of average-ness, the sound effects are of the usual            acceptable sports-game standard, with pucks flying and sticks            swirling as expected. That said, sticks don't swirl too much at            all.                    The high level of fisticuffs seen in NHL 2000 are not present            within NHL Championship 2000, although the players do fly across            the ice in a fury after somewhat faint clashes with their            opponents. The realism factor just isn't there.         The ~play-by-play~ (as the Americans like to call it)                 isn't all that great, with the commentators being unable to                 explain which teams are playing or what the score is! ~It's a                 one-goal game!~ is a wimp's way out (although the difficulty                 is such that you won't get that many more goals anyway).                    To their credit, during stoppages in the game the commentators            focus on particular players and recount a few anecdotes about each.            Thankfully there's enough material to prevent this growing stale,            but amassing this knowledge base seems to have taken precedent over            getting the commentators to accurately comment on the events as            they happen! Quite the paradox.                    In fact, NHL Championship 2000 as a game is a bit of a paradox. Ice            hockey by reputation is a fast, furious, and violent game of            end-to-end mayhem. C2K barely warms up by the half-time hooter. In            order to experience anything like an exciting experience you have            to set the PC up to play against itself.                    Even the multiplayer mode is lacking, and networked games where the            puck runs loose for several seconds are common, because both            players are hunched over the keyboard trying to understand how to            play the damned thing! The frustration is overwhelming.                    To be fair on Fox Sports though, the game is not devoid of virtue.            The statistics are very impressive (every single statistical            abbreviation that you might find used in the NHL is included herein            - I could barely contain myself), as are the various authentic            play-modes (Season Play, Playoffs, World Tournament, anyone?).                    At the end of the day though it has not done enough to keep me            interested, because I don't want to fight through incomprehensible            statistics, unplayable controls, and downright unfair AI for my            gaming experience.         Although Fox                 Sports' latest title is a far cry from the proverbial that                 they were shovelling only last year, the game is still dogged                 with problems that will make it inaccessible to all but the                 most enthusiastic of ice hockey fans.                    I don't doubt that a lot of entertainment could be gleaned from            this title, but for the average gamer it will be a step too far."}
