We know The Thing has been out for a few months now, but given            that we got sent it late in the first place (in true Vivendi            style), we thought we'd return the compliment and take a look at            The Thing once the traditional post Christmas lull kicked in, and            the sales are in full swing.                    In the company of an unusual number of big name releases, it's            perhaps a better time to evaluate The Thing than when it first hit            the high street. Set in the aftermath of the 20 year old John            Carpenter horror movie, it's essentially a third person squad based            survival horror game with some rather nifty innovations - namely            the much vaunted trust/fear elements that decide whether your team            mates will co-operate with you.        Despite its squad based nature, you only get to control one            character - that of Captain Blake, the leader of a military rescue            team sent to Antarctica to investigate the scenes of carnage at an            American scientific outpost. Aliens, you see. Shape shifting, vile,            horrifying, and plain bloody angry for some reason. Whatever their            beef, these writhing, slimy beings from another world aren't nice            'Things' to do business with and hence must be dispatched with the            minimum of fuss - except they have a rather irritating and            deceptive ability to sneakily host themselves in the body of human            beings, and burst out without the decency of warning us first.                    But despite such ominous overtones, the start of the game is a mere            taster of the horror to come. Accompanied by three (mostly            dispensable) team mates Blake must work his way through the icy            outpost in temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees centigrade, but            despite his leadership abilities, he mostly needs the skills of            others to progress. Early on, you have to call on the Engineer to            repair damaged electronics, while a Medic will be on hand to            administer help if you need it. Meanwhile, the Soldier helps out in            a fire fight situation, and can be relied on to be the bravest of            your (fairly lily livered) team.        Similar to most action adventure/survival horror titles, The            Thing relies upon the locked door/puzzle gameplay mechanic, so            you're forced to scuttle around searching every nook and cranny for            that all important discarded key card or passcode. Likewise,            weapons and ammo are vital to your progress, and you'll be doing a            fair bit of backtracking within confined areas in a simple linear            'level' progression.                    Seeing as it's bloody cold outside, Blake can only cope for a short            while in such conditions. A blue bar depletes gradually to let you            know how close to hypothermia you are, but nipping inside for a few            seconds usually does the trick - although curiously your team mates            seem to be able to withstand the cold indefinitely.                    Often, you'll find yourself forced to 'prove' your trustworthiness            to your extremely paranoid team mates. Early on, you have to find            some blood test kits to show that you're not infected by an alien -            the fact that two of your team mates become aliens at that exact            point goes to show that you can't always trust them either. Some            NPCs merely need you to give them a weapon before they'll budge,            but otherwise it's a fairly straightforward system that's nowhere            near as much of a neat gameplay innovation as the hype had some            people believe.        Basically, it            seems that your team mates will either work with you or not, and            the whole trust system just serves as another reason to troop            around looking for some random object or an excuse to bring on a            posse of baddies that you have to kill before you can move on.            Certain things you do will increase or decrease that trust; for            example giving them health will increase their trust in you, while            hitting them with a stray bullet won't do you any favours.                    On the fear side, some of your more delicate team members freak out            at the sight of dismembered bodies and weird shape shifting aliens.            Understandable, but there is a way to calm them down, which            generally involves either moving them away from the source of the            terror and waiting a while, or administering an Adrenaline Hypo            shot, which speeds up their return to normality.                    The whole system is icon driven, and hence gives you the ability to            direct your team's actions, but during our time with the game it            serves as a constant interruption, and seems to involve far more            button presses than is strictly necessary. For example, you'll            regularly need to give health to your idiotic team mates, who            couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. But in order to do            this, you'll find yourself having to go through several menus,            select the medi kit, then go back to the game, wander over to the            afflicted, administer the health and hope that you're not getting            beaten up in the process, which is not easy when there are dozens            of scuttling critters biting every part of your body. Similarly,            the transfer of ammo and weaponry isn't as slick as it could be,            and again, you'll be fiddling around checking everyone's tooled up            rather than getting on with the game itself.        Compared to the neat system featured in Conflict Desert Storm,            it feels clunky and irritating, and the fact you can't control            anyone else but Blake seems like an oversight. Another annoyance            that will have you howling at the moon is the way you can use a            health pack on yourself, even if you're at full strength. And given            that you'll be regularly under attack, you need every medi pack you            can get. It's often the little things that make you irritated, and            the more you play it the more of these foibles crop up.                    As a squad based game it would work far better if you ever had to            care a great deal for anyone's survival. As it is, most of the team            seem to split off once a level's over (or turn into aliens at            pre-determined moments during it), so you're left merely using each            NPC as a means of progression. You never build up an affinity for            your team mates, and that strikes us as a missed opportunity.                    Once the combat element kicks off in earnest, it becomes apparent            that the game design is once again beating the player over the head            for no good reason. Firstly the lack of friendly fire option means            it's all too easy to injure your (already paranoid) team mates,            while the game's insistence that you can only finish off aliens by            roasting them with the use of a flame weapon means you're faced            with the crushing spectre of having a weapon that you can't move            forwards with. ~But why?~ I hear you cry. Because you'll set            yourself on fire, that's why, and be dead in approximately three            seconds. Genius game design eh? Having dispensed with the Resident            Evil problems of dodgy camera angles, giving players the welcome            ability to control the viewpoint yourself (with the movement            assigned to the left stick and camera to the right, and a first            person mode to target the really annoying enemies), The Thing            merely introduces a whole host of baffling quirks of its own, and            manages to make you long for Capcom's far more polished approach.        The proliferation of            save points also strips any element of tension away from the            experience. Its level based structure is obviously a world away            from Capcom's more free form approach, but giving the player            multiple save points on the same level just seems generous in the            extreme, meaning you're rarely tested for any length of time, and            as a result we'd blitzed though a huge chunk of The Thing in no            time at all.                    As a spectacle, The Thing really doesn't excite a great deal,            either, using a functional engine that wouldn't have impressed PC            gamers four years ago, never mind now in this far more demanding            age. The icy wastes and indoor environments are lacking in panache            and detail, and are far from the promised ~groundbreaking snow and            lighting effects~, just managing to look ordinary. Also, every            version we've seen looks almost identical to the PS2 one, giving            the impression of a game ported onto multiple platforms with the            minimum of fuss or optimisation. The character models for both the            humans and the enemies are average at best (hardly what you'd            describe as ~hyper detailed~), and while no one could be offended            particularly by The Thing's overall look, there's nothing on show            that can touch the more technically impressive action adventures            out there - and judging it in the context of Resident Evil, Devil            May Cry, Splinter Cell or even Halo, it merely looks old school,            with bad texturing, uninteresting particle effects, and vanilla            architecture.                    The voiceovers are also crushingly generic, featuring the kind of            stereotypical scripts that gamers ought to be well and truly sick            of by now. Nearly every character in the game could get a job doing            voiceovers for movie trailers, adding ever dramatic and smoky            throated Yankee punch where it's just not needed. Fans of the movie            might get something from the game if they're an obsessive, but for            those of us that just want a cracking horror based action            adventure, the license means nothing - and stood next to something            like Half Life it's faintly embarrassing.                    If you can pick up The Thing cheap you won't be too disappointed;            it's by no means a bad game, but it's all the more disappointing            thanks to the fact that it could and should have been brilliant. As            it stands, it pales in comparison to any number of quality releases            that have hit the shelves recently, and at full price should be            avoided.
