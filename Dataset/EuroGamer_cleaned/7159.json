In this age of press hype and the internet, games are            almost totally uncovered prior to their release, and so for the            most part we know all there is to know about them by the time it            comes to actually buying them.                    So it's a pleasant surprise when you discover a game that you have            never heard of to be damned enjoyable throughout. Like getting a            Christmas present from that old Aunt, expecting a knitted sweater            and instead receiving an Armani suit...                    The game's menu system is modest and unassuming, and can be            navigated smoothly. Once you have chosen a name and face for your            character, you can then move on to choose either a career game, a            single match, or some external options.                    The gist of things seems to be flying around on the back of            enormous winged beasts and flying machines. If you ever played            Warcraft 2, you can probably remember the Orc Flying Machine used            for peeping in on your foes, and you will be pleased to hear that            Flying Heroes has similar contraptions - the mythological era            Flying Heroes appears to be set in is not dissimilar to that of            Warcraft.                    If at this point you are beginning to wonder quite what Flying            Heroes actually is, then you are in good company - I was rather            uncertain myself. So I opted for the single match mode, and was            asked to choose an enemy (or enemies) and a landscape. Yet more            confusion. Anyway, I was eager to start, so I jumped into the            fray...         The controls                 didn't make sense at first, so I used the simple menu system                 to reconfigure them. The default is somewhat akin to Quake, in                 that you use the mouse for turning (on both the horizontal and                 vertical axis) and the keyboard for navigation and armament                 selection.                    At this point I realised that Flying Heroes is something of a cross            between a flight sim, Quake 3 Arena, and Drakan. Your objective is            to shoot down enemies as often as possible in a series of matches.            In the career mode you can start off with lesser enemies and move            on to more skilled prey, while the single match mode puts you in at            the proverbial deep end.                    The career mode deposits you into the fantasy realm of Hesperia,            the location of the ~Hesperian League~ air tournament. A very            prestigious event in medieval circles, apparently.                    The tournament is a battle between four rival clans - the Sky            Knights, Lizard Riders, Magion, and Hammercraft. Their names give            away their mounts and their armoury. For instance, the Lizard            Riders may fly atop fire-breathing dragons, while the Magion cast            magical spells to deal with their competition.                    During the game there are a lot of powerups and mana balls floating            around, and picking these up may aid or disadvantage you. If you            pick up ammo or armour for instance, obviously it is going to help,            but if you pick up poison by accident it is going to make it more            difficult for you.                    The game plays very well indeed, and while challenging (and            probably the wrong side of hard) the game doesn't ever leave you            too frustrated. The fluidity of movement and animation makes it            very easy to control and adapt to. Swooping between peaks and            majestically hunting your opponents perched on top of a huge            reptilian monster with a wingspan of many metres is a surreal            experience, and a wholly enjoyable one.                    Even though the game is tough, there is a ~slow~ mode included,            which the developers enthuse will make a good training option for            younger players. It's this sort of forethought and ingenuity that            makes Flying Heroes so complete.         Each battle takes place above sumptuous                 medieval castles and naturally carved landscapes. The game                 uses Direct3D foremost, but performs very well on 3dfx cards                 too.                    Each mystical beast is portrayed very realistically, and I would            hazard a guess that the animations and movements are modelled on            real birds of prey. The action can be viewed from several            perspectives (you can swap between them in-game using the C button)            and each is perfectly easy to use.                    One thing that I felt was rather disappointing was the actual            firing of your weapons. The effect is very minimalist, when it            could have been very spectacular. The grandeur of the spells in            games like Final Fantasy VIII would not have gone amiss here. When            I breathe fire, I want to be so impressed that I can practically            feel the heat. To be fair, some of the bigger weapons do have a            satisfying onomatopoeic thrust to them, but it's something I would            like to have seen more of...                    The only area of Flying Heroes that I felt proved a little feeble            was the sound. While the hawks craw and the dragons roar, the            weapons sound puny, and there is not much to be heard from the            surroundings aside from a bit of ambient noise.                    This is actually something I have seen before in fantasy games -            it's ever so hard to determine quite how over-the-top it should be,            and in order to remain neutral to press-abuse and misunderstanding,            developers choose to be modest and understated with their approach,            instead of just throwing as many hideously explosive sounds at us            as possible. Which is a shame, because I love games that push back            the threshold for sheer loudness.         Playing on my home LAN against a                 couple of chums revealed a lot about Flying Heroes'                 ease-of-use. We all picked up the playing style quickly and                 learnt the various turns and manoeuvres necessary to out-fox                 our opponents.                    Eventually it was just as exciting as any first person shooter that            you might promote. I didn't get the opportunity to try it over the            Internet, as at the time of writing the game had yet to come out in            America, and my usual slew of frag-buddies were busy charging            themselves up for tournaments elsewhere.                    Still, if you have the option of playing this at home against            friends, don't be afraid to - it will most likely prove worth your            while.         Fundamentally Flying Heroes is a                 mishmash of ideas and concepts - it has action, character                 development, hell, even resource management! Thankfully, for                 all its complexity, it doesn't take itself too seriously,                 being at the end of the day, a big air battle between winged                 beasts.                    There are problems of course - it really suffers from being almost            too modest for its own good, and I would love to see this concept            taken and really worked on. Pirouetting in mid-air and diving into            combat against aeroplanes and enormous dinosaurs would be so much            more involving! Still, it is the first game in five years to make            me feel like Bullfrogs' classic ~Magic Carpet~ did, so I can't but            help like it..."}
