Take a look at the directional pad - it was built to be treated like a second set of individual buttons, pretty much the way it been treated so far. Then there are the four main face buttons, which are clustered for simple control systems, not attacks and blocks arranged by force and limb. And despite the developer's best efforts to the contrary, Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO never really feels right.            That said, there is one significant thing which cannot be blamed on            the hardware, and that's the state of the port. Changes to the            make-up bring it more into line with the Cube control system, but            graphically it's unchanged from the PS2 and Dreamcast versions,            which were released nearly a year ago. That's not to say the            graphics are bad, but however smoothly they are animated,            Capcom's 2D designs are ageing quite quickly, and the opportunity            to revamp them for this Cube version has been overlooked.                             The biggest change to the Cube version of the game is the concept            of -isms. AC-ism is the old-school approach, which most people will            stick with, allowing you to fight your opponents and execute            special moves in much the same way as always, but those of you            without any experience in Capcom fighters may find the GC-ism a            superior approach, and a good way of getting into the series. By            mapping various special moves to the C-stick, Capcom removes a lot            of the challenge, but also allows you to get the hang of combining            them to gratuitous effect. That said, the idea is that you can            progress to the AC-ism after a while, and this would be tricky with            a Dual Shock II, but the Cube's directional pad really doesn't            help.                             There is also a question mark hanging over the structure of the            game as a whole, even aside from port issues. For a start, the            choice of characters is at best unadventurous, and at worst            somewhat lazy. The box boasts ~over 44 characters~ from various            Capcom and SNK fighters, but when you consider how similar Sakura,            Akuma, Ryu and Ken are to one another, and that this isn't the only            example of closely related characters - both in terms of gameplay            and graphical design - then the number seems slightly less            impressive. That said, you can pick between six ~grooves~ for the            various characters, which alter the way you build up super moves            and other aspects of your battle strategy. Pitting Ryu against Ryu,            even if you reckon you and your mate are as evenly matched as can            be, can still produce varied bouts if you opt for different            grooves.                    Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO is a brave attempt to port an excellent 2D beat            'em up to a platform which doesn't really want to play ball, but            various problems on both sides conspire to thwart the effort. The            GC/AC-ism system is a nice idea, but it oversimplifies and suffers            at the hands of the Cube's dodgy dpad, and the game itself is            growing older with every passing day. If you want a 2D beat 'em up            for your Cube, this is definitely your best choice, but it might be            worth investing in an arcade stick or a third party pad if you want            to get the most out of it."}
