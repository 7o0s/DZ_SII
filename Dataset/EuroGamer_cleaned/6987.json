And yet very few Korean-made games have come to the west            thus far. Enter ~Kingdom Under Fire~, a hybrid of real-time            strategy and role-playing elements set in a fantasy world of orcs            and elves.                    At first glance it looks like a straightforward Warcraft clone,            with a story involving the usual battle between good and evil, a            sprite-based 2D graphics engine clunking along behind it all, and            the same tired old mixture of base building and resource gathering.            There is also a relatively limited selection of units available in            the early stages of the single player campaigns, and as a result            you are usually heavily out-gunned by the enemy. Luckily later on            in the game and in random battles there is a much wider range of            units to train, buildings to construct and technologies to buy, and            things start to get more interesting.                    Dig a little deeper and you will find there is more to the game            though. Units gain experience as they kill their enemies, which in            turn gradually improves their abilities. This gives you some            incentive to nurse your units through a battle rather than simply            throwing them at your opponent, although the pace of the action is            often so fast that it's hard to find time to micro-manage your            troops or to keep track of which are rookies and which have become            veterans. It's a nice touch, but doesn't have quite as much impact            on the game as you might expect thanks to the fast and brutal            nature of combat.                    Each side also has a small cast of heroes, including the main            character who you will guide throughout the entire campaign. These            add some much needed variety to the proceedings, carrying their            experience from one battle to the next throughout the single player            campaign and gradually amassing a range of spells and special            abilities which can help turn the course of a battle. An effective            attack with your hero can easily lay waste to an entire enemy base            as they reach ever higher levels.                    Phantagram have also taken the lone wolf missions so beloved of the            Command & Conquer series to the next logical level.            Interrupting the two campaigns are a few missions which seem to            have more in common with Diablo than Warcraft, putting you in            control of your hero and allowing you to guide him through castles            and dungeons, slaughtering any enemies that cross his path. Items            such as armour and weapons can be picked up, increasing your            character's stats and carrying over into the strategy sections,            while scripted sequences help to push the storyline forward.                    The only real problem with the heroes is that most of them must            survive for you to win a mission, meaning that you will get a ~game            over~ screen if any important characters are killed. This would be            a little annoying at the best of times, as a single moment of            carelessness or a sneak attack while your attention is on another            part of the battlefield can rather abruptly end your mission.            Unfortunately Kingdom Under Fire currently lacks a proper save game            mechanism, meaning that if you lose you have to start the battle            again from scratch. This can obviously make things rather tedious            as some missions take upwards of an hour to complete, and the            further you get into a mission the less keen you are to risk            getting one of your heroes killed, although ironically this is when            they would perhaps be most useful.                    Sadly while the game has a lot of promise, it fails to gel. The            artificial intelligence, even after applying the latest patch, is            rather hit and miss - units can wander off in completely the            opposite direction to the one you expected them to go in, and you            will sometimes see enemy soldiers standing around picking their            noses while you lay waste to their base just half a screen away.                    Meanwhile your enemy keeps throwing troops at your base piecemeal,            even when you have a solid wall of guard towers in place waiting to            slaughter them when they get there. Offensives tend to be fairly            half-hearted and wasteful, while defence is usually chaotic and            ineffective. This doesn't make for much of a challenge in the            single player game. The units are also somewhat unbalanced, with            air troops tending to dominate the game as only three types of            soldier on each side can fight back against them, and none of them            are particularly strong.                    Other units can lead to annoyingly cheap kills, such as the bizarre            swamp monsters which spawn little bouncing blobs that jump on to            buildings or units and then explode, or the suicide bombers which            can wipe out a dozen or more low level troops in a single blast. An            invisibility spell makes these even more irritating, as none of            your units will respond to or attack them, leaving them free to            slaughter your workers, destroy your buildings and harrass your            troops until the spell wears off. And a well placed mage can keep            them invisible pretty much indefinitely, or at least until you can            find and kill him. It's all too easy for an enemy with a handful of            these units to cause serious damage.                    The game doesn't exactly look like it is at the pinnacle of            technology either. The graphics are locked at 800x600 with 16 bit            colour, and although the unit and building sprites are fairly large            and detailed, the whole thing looks decidely antiquated. Animations            are of variable quality as well, with troops often seeming to glide            over the ground as if they are moonwalking.                    Sounds are highly repetitive, and the standard unit acknowledgement            voices soon become annoying, although the music is good and the            rendered cutscenes are quite impressive - it's just a shame that            there aren't more of them. You can't help but think that the game's            storyline has lost something in the translation from Korean as            well, with names like Rick Blood, the great wizard Moonlight and            the Black Dragon Nibles, not to mention the constant cries of ~not            enough food, build more farm~.                    Where the game does shine though is with its multiplayer support.            In-game chat rooms make finding opponents and setting up or joining            a game incredibly easy, and up to eight players can battle it out            together over a LAN or online using the WarGate service.            Multiplayer is actually rather fun, although unit balancing issues            do mean that battles tend to end rather suddenly once one of the            players has managed to summon a hero or put together a large enough            air force to flatten your base with. Still, it's an enjoyable            enough experience.                    Kingdom Under Fire isn't a bad game, just unremarkable. The poor AI            and lack of an in-game save option makes the single player            campaigns frustrating and unrewarding, and the role-playing            elements don't quite work as well as they perhaps should. The            rather primitive graphics engine doesn't do the game justice            either, which is a shame because there is a good game somewhere in            there trying to break out. If you're a multiplayer strategy fanatic            it might be worth a look, and you will almost always find opponents            waiting online to play against, but for the lone gamer it's hard to            recommend."}
