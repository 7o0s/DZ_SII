Zak, hero of Evil Islands, very much            falls into this third category. Waking up amongst the ancient ruins            of a strange island with no memory of who he is or how he got            there, he is declared The Chosen by the local villagers and            promptly co-opted into carrying out a series of menial tasks for            them. When you're not killing goblins or wolves you are recovering            stolen goods from brigands and filching magical items from the            orcs. It's certainly humble beginnings for a would-be messiah.                    As you work your way through the game you will gradually gain            experience as well as more powerful weapons, armour and magic. But            whereas many such role-playing games become mindless hack and slash            affairs, in Evil Islands there is always something bigger and            meaner than you. Fighting is dangerous at the best of times, and            just when you think you have finally created a true tank of a            character capable of taking on anything the game can throw at you,            along comes a monster which is all but immune to your attacks and            can kill you without raising a sweat.                    Instead of charging into combat waving a big axe around, you            frequently have to rely on stealth and cunning to win the day.            Sneak up behind an enemy and you can deliver a backstab attack            which, if you spent your experience points on the appropriate            skill, can cause a truly obscene amount of damage. Or you can try            to crawl around monsters without them ever seeing you. Of course,            this all takes patience and skill, and if you lack either of these            qualities you will find yourself reaching for the quick load key            with alarming frequency.                    Luckily you are not alone for most of your quest. You can recruit            two other characters to join you, and most of the time you will            have a choice of three possible companions - usually a warrior, a            magician and an archer or thief - giving you plenty of variety even            before they start earning experience points for you to spend on            tweaking their skills and attributes.                    The characters can be controlled either individually or en masse            through a simple point and click interface, with additional buttons            arranged around the edges of the screen to adjust your stance (run,            walk, sneak or crawl), cast spells, switch weapons, follow someone,            try to pick an enemy's pocket or use an object. If this is still            too complicated for you, you can pause the action and give out            orders to your characters in your own sweet time. It's all very            easy, and there's even a handy little tutorial mission at the            beginning to get you used to the basic controls and concepts of the            game.                    In fact the only real gripe we have with the controls is that your            characters are constantly spoiling for a fight; whenever you order            one of them to attack somebody, the rest try to pile in. You can            order each character to attack a different target, but sadly there            is no way to tell one of them to just stay out of it. This can            obviously be a nuisance if a character is badly injured but keeps            wanting to charge back into battle, or if you are trying to sneak            up behind a guard to bop him over the head with a large blunt            instrument and the rest of your party suddenly decides to stand up            and start firing arrows at him...                    The other quirk of the combat system is critical hits, which            frequently cause a huge amount of damage and tend to make combat            rather random. When you go up against an enemy which is about the            same strength as you, anything can happen - a single lucky blow can            knock somebody down to half strength and completely change the            balance of the fight. Again, this tends to lead to overuse of the            quick load and save keys.                    Apart from this slight annoyance though, combat is far more            tactical than in most role-playing games. As well as adding the            ability to sneak up on enemies for a backstab attack, Evil Islands            also allows you to target a specific part of their body with a            highly intuitive interface. Just imagine that there is a body            spread out on your keyboard's number pad (work with me here), and            hold down the appropriate key when you attack - 8 for the head, 5            for the body, 1 and 3 for the legs and 4 and 6 for the arms.                    Blows to the head are harder to pull off but cause much more            damage, and are best used in combination with a backstab, resulting            in a lethal strike which can often kill an enemy outright. Damaging            an enemy's legs makes it harder for them to either run away or to            pursue you, and hurting their arms reduces the effectiveness of            their attacks. Although you can comfortably get through the entire            game without ever using this system, it gives added depth for more            advanced players and can make your life somewhat easier.                    And anything that can make your life easier is very welcome, as            this game is very hard and very long. There are three            sizeable islands to explore, each with its own ecosystem and            economy, as well as a whole array of quests to complete. Every time            you teleport to another island you will soon discover that the            weapons and armour you brought with you are all but useless against            the new island's monsters and soldiers.                    Luckily there is an almost infinite range of new items to upgrade            to once you have earned some hard currency. Weapons come in dozens            of different forms, and your armour is split into six seperate            pieces, from leggings and boots to gauntlets and helmets, each of            which can be replaced individually. There are many designs for each            class of armour, which vary from island to island, and each is            available in a whole range of different materials. For example, a            chainmail shirt could be made using anything from common bronze or            steel right up to mithril or adamantine, each giving a different            balance of cost, weight and effectiveness.                    And if you fancy a bit of DIY, you can combine raw materials that            you find during your adventures with a blueprint bought from a            store to create your own custom weapons and armour. A similar            system is also used to customise spells, boosting their            effectiveness with runes that can increase damage, duration, range            and other factors. There are even runes which can add a spell            effect to an object, allowing you to create weapons that fire            lightning bolts and armour that heals you or boosts your strength.            Once you start meddling with these options the possibilities are            virtually limitless.                    Evil Islands is a huge, varied and utterly addictive game. Acting            and dialogue is a bit hit and miss at times, and the voice            acknowledgements when you give your characters orders soon get            rather repetitive, but overall the storyline is strong enough to            keep you involved in the game. It also looks great, with a solid            new 3D engine providing vast open terrain to explore and a wide            range of highly detailed characters and monsters, as well as some            fairly spectacular spell effects.                    The only real let-down is the sometimes random nature of combat,            with critical hits being far too common and getting in the way of            what would otherwise be a very tactical experience. Still, if            you're a role-playing fan looking to lose yourself for a few weeks,            this could be just the thing."}
