Sony            recent track record in introducing new ~brands~ deserves credit,            with recent examples such as Jak & Daxter, and the forthcoming            The Getaway, Sly Racoon and Primal all looking worthy of any            discerning gamer's attention.                    So what of Ratchet & Clank, its second double act platformer in            a year? Following on from the critical and commercial success of            Naughty Dog's lauded Jak & Daxter, we hoped that Insomniac's            first non Spyro effort would be in a similar league.        As with any platformer worth            its salt, it has the usual good versus evil tale to tell, and guess            which side you're on? The evil Chairman Drek is determined to use            the best bits of other planets to build a new planet for the            inhabitants of his polluted world, Orxon. This, obviously, doesn't            sit very well with the rest of the galaxy, and it's up to crack            floppy eared mechanic Ratchet and cunning robot Clank to foil his            dastardly plans.                    Anyone familiar with last year's Jak & Daxter will be            immediately at home with Ratchet & Clank. Technically, it's on            the same solid ground, being built with Naughty Dog's rather nifty            technology that grants the player stunning views of each            intricately designed level.                    And the control system is practically identical, with movement            controlled by the left analogue stick and camera rotation with the            right stick, while the four main buttons are used for jump, and            weapon select/usage. Meanwhile, the shoulder buttons activate first            person view, and crouch, and it's a system that works well for the            most part.        Each            level, or planet if you will, presents you with a number of            objectives, which basically boil down to having to work through            each level destroying progressively tougher enemies, pick up the            resulting bolts (which are magnetically attracted to Clank), and            eventually reach a particular character who will present you with a            crucial object or Infobot with which to travel to your next planet            - and hence move on the plot.                    Hardly revolutionary stuff, we're sure you're thinking, but where            Ratchet & Clank tries to innovate and charm is through the            numerous gadgets and weapons that you get to grips with. The            aforementioned bolts you gather act as currency, and each planet            has its own shop in which you can buy ammo and meatier firepower.            But in addition, you also get rewarded with assorted artefacts for            your pains, which vary from the humdrum, but effective Blaster to            the surreal Taunter - a device that emits comedy noises, and often            stupefies enemies to allow for easy despatch.                    In fact, each of the 35 gadgets and weapons you gather during the            game have their own specific uses, although strictly speaking there            are often multiple ways to wipe out your enemies - and progression            can be a case of working out which is the most effective weapon.            But time is of the essence, and selecting the right gadget or            weapon at any one time can seem a bit fiddly to begin with, as it            involves hitting triangle, scrolling through the available choices            with the D-pad, and selecting the one you want. This, when there            are multiple enemies descending upon you, can easily result in            death, but it's possible to define a quick select weapon, enabled            by double tapping triangle. Even so, in a major battle it's still a            muddle trying to juggle which weapon you need, and this should have            been managed with more elegance.                    Just as well, then, that you're never forced to backtrack too far,            as the game intelligently and mercifully saves your progress for            you. You still have to wipe out the enemies all over again, but it            does at least spare you the task of breaking open boxes again. This            approach certainly saves it from being a Blinx-esque joypad            smashing horror show, and recognition of your progression, rather            than forcing you to start from scratch every time. Such basics make            you feel good about playing R&C, and will drive you on towards            completing the game, although we reckon most of you will have it            cracked in 15 to 20 hours.        If you objected to Spyro's kid friendly leanings, you'll be            pleasantly surprised to find that R&C has much more of a            universal appeal than the cutesy dragon ever did. The game can come            across as quirky and comical, and it is, but R&C never descends            to irritating slapstick, and instead there it ascends to almost            Pixar-esque heights - especially during the many amusing and            exceptionally well rendered cut scenes.                    Variety is also one of R&C's strengths, and as with its            spiritual cousin Jak & Daxter, you get to engage in some            welcome diversions such as rail grinding and hoverboard racing. The            occasional set piece, such as having to escape from a flooded area,            also helps break up the action, as does the appearance of a            (predictably gigantic) boss. Somehow these disparate elements all            add up to one compelling whole, which drives you on in search of            the next section.                    Another area Insomniac deserve serious applause is on the visual            side. Nearly every planet is stunning, featuring vast views, and            incredibly detailed flora and fauna that even moves convincingly            when you brush against it. Often you get the chance to ride            elevators that sweep you through the level, giving players a chance            to really take in the sights. The character modelling is also well            up to standard and is not only detailed and well animated, but full            of incidental touches that really bring the game to life. R&C            pushes the PS2 further than just about any game of its type; it's            almost entirely bereft of the dreaded jaggy, and has none of the            cardboard cut-out/blocky scenery that blights so many games.            However, if there is one criticism it's the slightly muddy colour            scheme that sometimes doesn't quite do the artwork justice, but            that's just down to personal taste.        Naturally there are a few            areas that make R&C slightly less than perfect. For starters            it's saddled with is the same camera problems that blighted            J&D. Most of the time it acts intelligently and you'll hardly            have to use the right analogue to adjust it. However, when it does            choose to be idiotic, it generally waits for the moments that you            need it to be on your side - such as during boss encounters where            it decides that giving you a good view of the boss is a much better            idea than allowing you to see where the hell you're going.                    Also, the game lacks the freedom of J&D to roam from one end of            the game world to another, being limited instead to a comparatively            linear approach where you're forced to wait thirty seconds while            you fly between planets. The abandonment of the fantastic ~no load~            principle makes R&C feel something of a backward step, and as a            result makes it feel more like the linear platform games of old            rather than the expansive cohesive experience of Naughty Dog's            recent epic.                    That's not to say we didn't enjoy R&C, because we obviously            did. In fact it's hard not to enjoy what is quite easily one of the            best platformers on the PS2. It's addictive, tells a good, amusing            yarn, looks spectacular and is challenging without ever being            annoying. If you're even remotely into run, jump and collect epics,            then you have to give R&C a look. It's not our favourite            platform game ever, but it's pretty damn close.
