Simplicity canbe bliss. However, as the spartan Sudoku Easy Vol. 1 proves,simplest isn't always best.For those not familiar with it, Sudoku is a Japanese puzzlebased around a 9x9 grid that requires the player to place numbersin such a way that every column, row and 3x3 box within the gridincludes the numbers 1 to 9. If that sounds either fiendishlycomplicated or a little on the dull side to you, then you probablyhaven't yet turned to the back page of one of the nationalnewspapers to give it a try. Once you do, chances are that you'lljoin the growing masses that are utterly addicted to this puzzlephenomenon.The concept of bringing the game to mobile is an inspired one.Rather than having to cart around a pile of bulky newspapers and apocket full of pens, you can fit hundreds of games comfortably inyour denims to enjoy whenever and wherever you want. What's more,it'll be easy to change answers without messy scrubbing out andthere'll probably be loads of new features and variations to makethe challenge even more fun, right?Erm, no.At least not in the case of Teazel's version of the game, whichadds absolutely no extra thrills or visual enhancements to thebasic premise, offering what can only be described as a'functional' interpretation of the paper game. Granted, the controlsystem works well enough, enabling you to enter numbers as firm'penned' selections or smaller, temporary 'pencilled in' thoughts.There's also a check option which lets you know if your selectionsare right so far and, if you get really stuck over a particularsquare, you can even cheat. Although in the version we played thisoption was redundant as the distinctly unchallenging grids wereunlikely to stretch even a complete Sudoku newbie (for the recordwe finished all the grids comfortably within an hour-long tubejourney!)Combine this over-simplicity with the fact that there's only ameagre 10 grids to play and, quite frankly, you'd be better offgoing out and buying 10 copies of the Sun. With 2 games per paperyou'd get twice as much gaming value for considerably less than the\u00c2\u00a34.50 it cost us to download this, plus some interestingupdates on sport, current affairs and a quick study of femaleanatomy. Whilst there's no denying that the game delivers what itsays on the box (i.e. Easy Sudoku) and promised future versionswill undoubtedly provide an escalated challenge, it doesn't take amaths genius to see that 10 games per volume just doesn't add up.Throw in some lacklustre presentation and those expecting a mobileversion to enhance their Sudoku experience will be leftpuzzled."}
