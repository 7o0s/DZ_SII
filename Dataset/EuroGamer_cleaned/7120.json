Suzuki Alstare Racing is the                 latest in a long line of fast paced and easy on the realism                 racers, complete with it's very own lens flare rendition.                    Don't get me wrong though, I like a little arcade racing now and            again, as long as it is a challenge, and not something that will be            played a couple of times only to be car boot sold the next week.                    If you happen to be a fan of Superbike racing, then you will be            pleased to hear that you are racing against none other than the            Suzuki Alstare racing team themselves. Fancy your chances against            Pierfrancesco Chili then? This is your chance to prove you have            what it takes.                    So what does Suzuki have to offer us in the way of originality?            Does it take the genre by the scruff of the neck, shake it around            and come up with something enlightening? Or is it a pure case of            the same old same old? Read on...         Suzuki                 concentrates on getting you onto a bike and racing with the                 minimum of fuss. Rather than dazzle you with a snazzy video                 sequence and animated menus, you are simply dropped at a                 straightforward menu page.                    There are three main modes of play, and you will probably have an            idea what these are already - single race, split-screen two player,            and tournament mode, which you begin with a humble Suzuki GSX-R600            standard roadbike. Fortunately for you though, your opponents are            not exactly blessed with ninja bikes themselves, so at least the            race is balanced and fair. You race a set of three to five groups            of circuits per championship, with the idea being to finish top of            the table for each.                    As you win each championship new bikes and circuits become            available, until you have all six bikes and all twelve circuits at            your disposal. Each group stage will introduce you to at least one            new map, but also mixes in the ones you have already raced on.            There are three skill bands that you must get through to become            part of the Suzuki team - novice, reserve and team. Once you are in            the team you will be introduced to the most powerful bike in the            game, the GSX-R Superbike.                    There are no qualifying sessions for the races, and instead you are            dumped to the back of the grid for every single race. Initially            this is very annoying, as the computer controlled bikes speed off.            But even if you get off to a bad start, your bike at top speed is            far more powerful than all of the others, and you will soon be back            battling for pole position.                    If you are after something a little more realistic, then your best            option is to fire up the two player split screen mode, or if you            have no friends the game can be played over the internet, where up            to eight players can scrap it out utilising UbiSoft's Game Service.                         Controlling the bike is simple, with the only other feature to                 worry about being the turbo drive. As you drive around                 circuits, you have a set amount of time to reach each                 checkpoint, and passing them grants you more fuel for the                 turbo drive. Not that you will need this, as it is perfectly                 feasible to win each race on maximum acceleration alone. Miss                 a checkpoint and you will be out of the race though.                    This was my first sitting with Alstare Racing, and within three            hours I had completed it, having only lost one race in the entire            nine championships. I only just lost that single race too,            thanks to me trying to find a shortcut! Yes folks, once again an            arcade racer that is just too damn easy to beat.                    The action is blisteringly fast paced though, with the scenery            hurtling past and making for some really quite amazing tests of            reflexes - it's a bit like Screamer on drugs! Unfortunately            regardless of whether you are racing around snowy mountains or a            tropical beach, there is absolutely no dynamics involved whatsoever            - snow and ice means hazardous road conditions, but sadly none of            this is represented in the game.                    The other disappointing factor is that there is virtually no effect            if your bike makes contact with another, making it ridiculously            easy to pass other bikes on even the tightest of bends. If you do            happen to make contact, then the length of time between crash and            returning to the race is overly long compared to that of the            computer's in the same situation. That's hardly fair now, is it?         The visuals whiz                 past at such a fast rate that you often don't appreciate the                 scenery you are riding through. Graphically the game looks                 very nice indeed, with some beautiful backdrops and detailed                 roadside scenery. The result is a very solid looking game,                 with enough variation from track to track to keep you                 interested in seeing those newer tracks later on.                    Bike models are also impressive, although they do look a little            cartoon-like against the slick moving scenery. The bikes pivot            realistically into corners, and riders react with realism to            speeding up, slowing down, and coming to a complete halt.                    The engine sound is suitably beefy for all of the bikes, and there            is something satisfying about your bike's ignition kick upon the            start of each race. As you would expect though, there isn't a great            deal else in the spot effects department, except for the sounds of            passing or being passed by other bikes, and the screech of brakes.                    Music is the usual instantly forgettable techno mixed with a heavy            rock style, which drones on in the background. Strange though - you            would miss it if it wasn't there, but pay it no mind when you are            playing!         There's nothing drastically                 wrong with Suzuki Alstare Racing, in fact it is a fairly                 enjoyable experience for the short time it takes to complete                 it. Alas, the total lack of realism coupled with how quick and                 easy it is to win simply dent any chance of this game being                 something you will keep coming back to.                    The main problem is that there is simply nothing new on show here.            How long will it be before developers realise that we need a bit            more of a challenge for our money? Suzuki's version of furthering            the game once completed is to offer you all the same tracks again,            but in reverse! Hardly imaginative. How about a stiff increase in            difficulty, along with another five or six evil circuits to get            stuck into?                    I'm not after a hardcore simulation, I just want to play one of            these arcade racers and get mad when I can't win. That to me is            what a game is all about, but instead you will be yawning all the            way to the finish line."}
