SSX Tricky is the finest            example of a snowboarding game on any system, boasting tweaked            control, improved visuals, added aggression and a boatload of new            tricks. Arguably there are only two 'new' courses, but you would be            a fool to gloss over the changes.                         There must still be some people who are new to SSX, so allow me to            explain briefly what we are dealing with. SSX is a snowboarding            game consisting of single and multiplayer races and a World Circuit            mode, with two main sections to the latter - Race and Show-off. In            Race mode you have to hurl yourself down increasingly elaborate            courses, staying ahead of five other riders for three heats per            track, whereas in Show-off mode you are all by yourself, with a            certain points total to reach and floating snowflake multipliers to            grab.                        You can just direct yourself with the analogue stick, but the idea            is to take advantage of some of the series of jumps along the way            to pull off mind-blowing tricks and, as the man said, Tricks equals            boost: boost equals speed. You perform tricks by jumping at the            right time and using a combination of your directional pads to turn            in mid-air and the four shoulder buttons to handle different grabs.            The boost button takes on the 'tweak' function during jumps,            allowing you to pick up maximum points, while careering into a            snowflake in mid-air can multiply the score for that jump by two,            three or five, depending on the snowflake. Perform enough tricks            and your boost bar will start to fill up, allowing you to improve            your speed. Power it up the whole way and you can perform a special            '\u00dcber' trick, a masterful new addition to Tricky which are            activated by holding a shoulder button for two seconds and then            tweaking. They consist of anything from breakdancing on the board            in mid-air to twirling it around your neck. \u00dcber tricks are            signature moves, with a certain number per character, and pulling            one off is so rewarding that the prospect of playing through the            game with every character just to see them all is fine by me.                    Many of the first game's critics took pleasure from the            announcement that Tricky would consist mostly of the same old            tracks with two new additions. But it's abundantly clear from even            a few minutes with one of the 'old' tracks that EA Sports' BIG            Canada team took the revamps very seriously. In fact, for the most            part any recognition is more d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu than anything, and            fans will be amazed at the boldness of the changes. Famous sections            of notable tracks, such as the hidden cross-country shortcut at the            start of Mesablanca, are entirely different, with multiple paths            leading off the shortcut to boot.                        But Tricky's track design isn't merely impressive for the placement            of new grinds that stretch across half the level and the enormous            number of new and intricate shortcuts concealed behind breakable            glass SSX symbols. The biggest and most important improvement has            to be the tweaks to the more glitch-prone SSX tracks. Through a            combination of insane airtime, boosts and power-ups, you could bear            witness to questionable clipping (putting your head through a            grinding bar, for example) and respawn problems. In theory the            self-right system, controlled by the Select key, deposits you back            in a safe position on the course from wherever you are, and is            automatically triggered if you end up somewhere silly (such as in a            rock crevice). Our litmus test for how thorough EA had been with            the bug-testing and reworking was a particular point on Elysium            Alps in the first game. Hurl yourself in a certain direction at the            right speed and you will need to respawn, so the game puts you in            mid-air, crashing towards - you guessed it - another rockface            requiring another spawn. This wasted time. So is it gone from SSX            Tricky? Yes, and the clipping problems are gone, too.                        SSX Tricky is also a strikingly solid game to look at, and much            clearer than its ancestor. The fuzzy visuals of the first game have            been sharpened considerably and the textures, character animations            and visual effects have been vastly improved. Fog and mist swirl in            the valleys and atop the peaks, and whereas even the sight of this            would reduce the original game to half its optimal framerate,            Tricky barely breaks a sweat. It's amazing just how many things EA            Sports managed to do with snow without stressing the hardware, and            they have carved tracks out of just about every kind of mountain at            every time of day.                    SSX Tricky looks magnificent, right down to the interface, which            has seen a significant overhaul. Characters dance around the select            screen and entice you to pick them, and once you do you can check            their attributes, boards, and even change their outfits. It's a            much more graphical user interface, but there are some operational            changes too.                        For example, you can now restart any track - race or show-off - by            hitting Start and selecting Restart from the pop-up menu. You could            only do this in Single Race mode before, which was annoying. And            unlike in the original game, this preserves your place in whichever            heat of the race you happened to be on. There is no lives system or            anything like that - EA recognizes that you're going to mess up in            the first minute or so now and then. Another improvement is the            ability to go directly to the event of your choice at the end of a            race. In the first game, you often had to head through various            menus, but not here. You can choose which track to race on and even            see your rank there.                        One of the most lauded-over features in the new game though is the            aggression system. I seem to remember being knocked for six by the            likes of Jurgen (now replaced by Luther) anyway, but this is a nice            change. At the start of each race you get to see what each rider            thinks of you; whether they are a friend, an enemy of indifferent            to you. Depending on how much you thump them out of the way during            the race (which you actually gain boost for, perversely), they may            come back at you. The aggression system adds to the difficulty of            each race, because you do not want to line up a perfect jump only            to be smacked down and left to trickle off a cliff. Each of the            other characters' individual aggression is remarkable, but no more            so than the voice acting and sheer personality of each of them. The            voice acting is professionally done with the likes of Lucy Lui and            Macy Gray amongst the cast. It adds some spice to the game, and the            cheesy put-downs and backchat are sublime.                    The AI has also been spiced up for the sequel, and it's a lot            fairer now. Whereas in the first game the difficulty doubled for            the final heat, it's a lot more relaxed now, which means things are            less frustrating. It's still not an easy game though, and the sheer            volume of things to do and see will keep even the biggest SSX fan            occupied for months. That's me, by the way. I've been playing the            original game for about a year on and off, and I know it inside            out. And yet SSX Tricky, a game built almost entirely upon the            shoulders of its predecessor, still appeals to me like nothing you            can imagine. From the networks of overhead grinding rails in Tokyo            Megaplex to the jaw-dropping freefall into the mist on the very            first cliff-top of Garibaldi, this game is a treat.                         Talk about a complete package, too. DVD extras are included which            chart the making of the game, including interviews with the team,            voice actors and more, and a little insight into the minds of the            programmers behind some of the world's coolest trick jumps. Add to            this already inexplicably cool package one of the hippest            soundtracks in any game. Amongst the tunes are Run DMC's Tricky            (including remix) and a number of other pieces to fit the scenery            from the likes of the Beastie Boys. From techno to break beats to            pseudo-classical, the game has everything needed to help get your            pulse racing. Each racetrack starts off with a simple tune, but as            soon as you max out your boost bar Tricky kicks in, climaxing with            a yell of ~TRICK-Y!~ when you pull off an \u00dcber trick. SSX            Tricky is the height of cool.                         If I had to pick a few random faults, I probably could though.            Let's see... I still think the game's less-than-obvious appraisal            of what constitutes a boardable surface needs a bit of polish; if            you touch certain surfaces you're knocked flat, whereas others can            be ridden like the snow. And I still think there's too much going            on in SSX for the split-screen mode to work properly, so it's a            shame there's no i.Link option. Another problem is the so-called            control tweaking. When you hold the jump key down your position is            supposed to be locked so you can set up the angle and rotation for            your jump, but in Tricky waggling the analogue stick still moves            you from side to side, making it impossible to choose a direction.            The D-pad on the other hand allows you to get into position, as the            analogue stick used to. The two do have plenty of different            functions now within the trick setting, but it's a real bitch            having to change your play style after a year.                    Never before has there been a better example of a 'cool' videogame.            EA Sports BIG have defied their critics and come out with the best            snowboarding game ever, a hundred times improved on its            predecessor. The same tracks? Pfft, they're anything but that. One            of the key successes is the complete abandonment of convention -            screw physics, we want to breakdance on the boards in mid-air. SSX            Tricky is bigger and better, with more explosions. Everybody with a            PS2 should buy this game - it's the stuff of legends.                        -        SSX                    reviewSSX                    review"}
