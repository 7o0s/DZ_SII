Not that many really good ones, anyway. Thankfully,            Monaco Racing Simulation ups the ante a bit, providing genuinely            realistic Formula 1 racing.                         Monaco is unlike the majority of arcade-style racers that frequent            the shelves of your local games shop, although it does feature an            ~Arcade~ mode. You can't simply keep your finger on the accelerator            and swing into every corner at 200mph. This isn't just Ridge Racer            style liberal use of the brake either, you have to really            anticipate the turns and learn the circuits to succeed. But realism            isn't everything, how does it bear up across the board?                    The teary-eyed opening scene depicts a driver sitting in his            cockpit, remembering his childhood dreams of becoming an F1 driver.            I suppose this is an indication of the depth within. The good thing            is that if you're not that much of a racing buff you can start off            with the Arcade mode, which while still very hard to master,            doesn't require all the engine tweaking and forethought about            corners. Slamming the brakes on and gently accelerating out of the            corners generally does the trick. Once you've got the hang of the            Arcade mode, the best thing to do is jump right in at the deep end            with the larger Simulation mode.                         The simulation mode offers you the chance to pick one team and            fight through anything from a couple of races to a whole Grand Prix            season to even further, thanks to the advent of the Career mode,            with everything from practice sessions and qualifying to engine            tweaking and parts selection. The interface for these areas is            fairly simple to navigate and the two key navigation buttons are            labelled clearly in the bottom right of the screen at all times in            the menus.             The in-game racing is tough and                 affected significantly by your choices and tweaks in the                 garage section prior to the race. Once in there, the computer                 AI provides enough of a challenge on its own with the                 inexperienced driver finding himself well behind the bulk of                 the pack after only a few laps. As far as AI goes in racing                 games, Monaco's is surprisingly consistent. It's tough to                 beat, but if you fall behind there's still every chance that                 you'll manage to catch up, if you've got the skill.                         The final mode of play is called Retro and allows you to pick a            1950s Formula 1 car and race it through several lovely countryside            race tracks. It's a nice touch and one of the only light-hearted            parts of the game. If you've ever played Grand Prix Legends, you'll            know what to expect; tinny cars and tricky cornering. But it does            provide some much welcomed variety to the game and lots of scope            for replay.                    You won't find too many differences between the PC version of            Monaco and this Dreamcast incarnation, aside from the            aforementioned Dreamcast-specific button labels found in the menus.            As with the PC version, the Dreamcast's is predominantly single            player based, but features a two-player split screen mode into the            bargain.                         Although there is no official FIA license involved, the game still            manages the 17 main world-wide circuits (from Silverstone to Monaco            et al) and 11 made-up teams sporting 22 made-up drivers. Bizarrely,            the French developers did manage to get sponsorship from the likes            of Castrol and Bridgestone, and of course the Monaco Grand Prix            circuit, but despite their best efforts, the lack of an official            tag does thwart the fun somewhat. It's amazing, the ability to ram            Michael Schumacher up the backside with your nose-cone makes such a            difference when playing games like F1 World Grand Prix on the N64;            the official names and colours are sorely missed.                    For a game that relies on taking corners with precision, it's quite            surprising that thanks to slightly grainy graphics in the distance,            corners come up on you too quickly and as such, a very carefully            driven race can be ruined in a couple of seconds. I suppose that's            pretty realistic for a Formula 1 race, but it frustrates and its            one problem that you'd think the Dreamcast's superior graphical            power could overcome.                         The one criticism you can probably consistently level at Monaco            Grand Prix is that it is such a blind conversion from the PC.            There's nothing really new here at all and certainly nothing to            persuade owners of the PC version to purchase it as well. Problems            with graphics in the distance and the lack of official names and            numbers lessen the experience considerably, after all, how can a            game that trades off its own realism afford to lack the official            names?                    A mixed bag. As an arcade racer, Monaco's heart really isn't in it            and as a Simulation, it lacks the official names and numbers.            However, the Retro mode adds some light relief, the Simulation mode            is very deep and takes a lot of effort to beat, in spite of the            fictitious nature of the game's occupants and problems with            cornering at times. If you are waiting for a chance to race around            Monza at 200MPH as Damon Hill, you're not going to get any            satisfaction here, but if the lack of an official license doesn't            bother you and the authenticity of the experience is what you're            after, look no further.                        - Out Now"}
