Fortunately I am of the latter category, so can review                 this game with an enthusiasm for the sport itself.                    It's only recently that I have become locked into the big soap            opera that wrestling is. It's addictive, good fun and provides            great amusement. Yes, of course it's all acted out. Hell, the            scripts are written three or four months in advance for most shows.            It is all so well choreographed though. There are times you wonder            how the hell they haven't actually broken several important bones!                    There's something that draws you in. It makes you want to find out            just how The Rock is going to get revenge on Triple H            and his cronies, for the latest totally unfair beating. Or maybe            witness the day that Steve Blackman smiles!                    There's a fair few WWF PlayStation titles already on the market.            Some have been fair attempts at reproducing the WWF atmosphere, but            others have been decidedly poor.                    Can WWF Smackdown rise above the rest?         After the intro video from the actual Smackdown TV show                 itself, you are dropped at the main menu. From here you can                 choose to go straight into an Exhibition match, create your                 own wrestler or tournament, see the current belt holders and                 even kick start a complete season of wrestle events.                    Choosing Exhibition will bring up another menu chock full of game            variants for you to set up. These range from a simple 1 on 1 fight,            to a tag-team tournament. The sheer range of wrestling match types            is very impressive.                    Each option will allow you to choose which wrestler you want, and            his or her opponents. You can even change the style of arena if you            so wish, along with the canvas pattern. Other options include            whether or not other wrestlers interfere, rope breaks on/off and            match length.                    To practice those special moves and to get used to the speed of the            game, I recommend you just go for the Single Match option. Once you            have a feel for the game, you can then start picking up baseball            bats and microphones to hit your opponents with in a Hard Core            match-up!          The main                 single player experience is in the Season option. This is                 where you take control of one wrestler over the course of a                 complete Wrestling season.                    You have a total of 36 wrestlers to choose from at the beginning.            As you progress through Season mode you will unlock a few more,            including Prince Albert. Unfortunately these don't appear on your            Wrestler list, but merely appear as additional body and head            sections in the Create a Superstar section.                    Season mode never ends, merely going on through various            recognisable events; Raw is War and Smackdown itself being just            two. At certain times you will be asked whether you want to change            the wrestlers on show. This means you can get rid of less            interesting characters like Tori, in favour of someone a little            more kick ass.                    Season mode works really well, with the additional cut scenes            before fights setting the scene. For example, a wrestler can be            shown getting ambushed and beaten up in a corridor backstage. This            has a knock-on effect to that wrestler's heart rating, and thus            begins the match already weakened.                    Like the real thing, belts will change hands on a frequent basis.            You will also have wrestlers interrupting a fight, either on your            side, or coming to help your opponent out. This can spoil your            plans drastically, and makes for some classic encounters.         All                 these options and features are fine, but what's the game like                 visually? This is where WWF Smackdown excels itself.                 Graphically, the arena's and Wrestlers are extremely accurate                 in representation.                    Pain staking attention to detail is evident. Before each fight,            each wrestler gets his or her own introductory video and music,            with a close up of them walking to the ring. Just from this alone            you can see the amount of detail there is in the body and facial            movements.                    The Rock's trademark raised eyebrow, and smug look is there. Al            Snow looks as psychopathic as ever, Big Show looks mean and Kane            looks huge! Nothing has been skimped on.                    This also applies to the moves each wrestler can perform. The            Rock's ~People's Elbow~ is superbly rendered, and Triple H's            ~Pedigree~ drop looks as painful as it does on TV! The            diversity in moves from one wrestler to the next is superb, meaning            that once you're tired of kicking butt with one, you can learn all            the new moves of another. Each wrestler has his/her own finishing            move, which is guaranteed to KO your opponent.                    The game boasts some of the best graphics I've seen on the            PlayStation. The pleasing thing is that all of this eye candy sits            on top of an excellent engine, meaning everything happens at a            blistering pace. There is very little slow down.         Visually                 amazing, but not so cool in the sound department. The intro                 tunes for each wrestler are all accurate and get you revved up                 for the fight ahead. Sadly, this is where the audio department                 jumped ship it seems.                    All fights are played out to a variety of heavy rock tracks. The            only other sound going on is the slapping of opponents, and the odd            thud as you crash to the canvas. The crowd cheers along merrily            too. All of these are nice enough. So what's wrong? No commentary            and no wrestler banter.                    This is made even worse in Season Mode when you see the cut-scenes.            The wrestlers are all mouthing words, but there's no speech. The            only way of telling what the scene is supposed to mean is by the            pop up text boxes.                    With all the other near obsessive detail, I just cannot fathom why            such an important area has been so neglected. I mean how cool would            it be for Stone Cold to shout ~Hell Yeah~ during a fight, or to            hear Big Show's roar! It's also hugely disappointing not to hear            the familiar tones of Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross (the commentators),            for me the backbone of WWF.                         WWF Smackdown looks and plays absolutely brilliantly, giving                 hours upon hours of frenetic two-player fun, not to mention                 the cool single player aspect. The AI of the computer                 controlled wrestlers is pretty much spot on. Only occasionally                 do they stand still, trying to calculate what to do next. This                 occurs quite frequently in Cage matches for some reason, which                 can make for some really easy escapes!                    The Create a Wrestler feature is a little lacking. You can only use            the heads, bodies and legs from all the existing wrestlers. It            would've been nice to have been able to add/remove different            hairstyles, eyes, mouths etc..etc.. That said, it's still quite fun            to play around with, just very limited.                    The total lack of commentary and wrestler banter is a massive            disappointment. With all the other ingredients there, it's kind of            expected for both to feature. Not only that, but the game sounds so            empty without it.                    Less vital, but puzzling nonetheless, is the omission of certain            superstars. Wrestlers like Rikishi, Kurt Angle, Crash Holly, and            Tazz, are all missing. The non-inclusion of inactive stars like Ken            Shamrock could easily have made way for them.                    Overall though, an extremely polished product, that oozes quality.            The sheer speed of it all will be enough to impress alone.            Thoroughly recommended and not just to wrestling freaks like me!                    If you smell what DNM is cookin'!             - Out Now"}
