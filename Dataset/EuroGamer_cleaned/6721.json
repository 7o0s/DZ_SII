You've            already been caught up in the hype, you've already played it and            you've already been hooked by it. I grudgingly had to take some            time out from playing the thing in order to pick it apart for your            pleasure. I hope you're satisfied.        In case you haven't                 been paying attention since Battlefield 1942 first surfaced,                 then let me introduce the two of you. At first, the idea of a                 multiplayer focused first-person shooter set in World War II                 isn't all that exciting, and not at all surprising given the                 recent proliferation of such games. At first glance, the game                 appears to be a pretty ordinary affair, similar to the Day of                 Defeat Half-Life mod but looking a bit prettier. However, add                 about thirty five entirely controllable vehicles into the mix,                 including enormous aircraft carriers, submarines, battleships,                 bombers, fighters and tanks right down to the nippy little                 jeeps, and we have something rather intriguing.                    With the release of the single and, most recently, multiplayer            demos, the game has taken the online gaming community by storm.            This is thanks in no small part to the depth with which the player            can get involved in the battle - the aforementioned vehicles add an            enormous amount of character to an otherwise fairly ordinary            team-based shooter, so much so that the possibility for each game            to be completely different comes into play. The random run-and-gun            approach of similar titles pales in comparison to BF1942's theatres            of war.        The feeling of being embroiled in                 fierce battle can only be fully replicated when you manage to                 locate a server of about 31 like-minded individuals who are                 entirely willing to play as a team. Actually finding 31 gamers                 on a random public server who want to play the game properly                 is another challenge in itself though, as most people seem to                 be interested in flying the planes in circles, into trees,                 into the sea and into team mates [chortle! -Ed]. It's not                 funny... I've actually witnessed players queuing on an                 airfield waiting for planes to spawn - why they don't just                 play with themselves offline is beyond me.                    But once you have a decent amount of likeminded players together,            the game ventures further into multiplayer nirvana than much else            has managed. The basic idea on each map is for your team to capture            and hold spawn points, which lowers the opposing team's number of            ~tickets~, which will decrease faster the less spawns they own.            While simplistic in theory, the reality is a lot more complicated.            Players can either be spawning from the skies, or out to sea on            battleship and aircraft carriers, or on the land itself, and            keeping track of where the invading forces might be coming from can            be tricky. Strategising about how to sieze towns and islands is            crucial to the success of you team, and your enjoyment of the game.                    Aiding your ability to communicate with your team is a simple            command menu controlled with F1 through 7. A press of one will            expand it down to a few more options, which could be anything from            confirming or denying a command and reporting where reinforcements            are needed to reporting enemy ship sightings and requesting a            pickup when you're stuck on foot.        Battlefield 1942 looks almost as good as it plays, too.                 Digital Illusions crafted their own engine especially for the                 game, and it's surprising just how much it can sling around,                 from troops battling it out on foot and reinforcements pouring                 out of boats onto the shores, to their comrades dogfighting in                 the skies and lumbering tanks firing flaming shells of death                 at each other across sand dunes. Despite the frenzied                 approach, everything still looks perfectly decent.                    The vehicles all handle effortlessly as well, with only a slight            learning curve to piloting even a lumbering B-17 bomber, and this            compliments the game's admirable level of accessibility. You can            expect to jump onto a server for the first time and have picked up            the fundamentals of the game within about fifteen minutes.                    Of course, the superb engine doesn't come without its costs, and            there's a hefty price tag in the shape of system requirements; the            recommended specifications will barely cut it, and in fact our            Athlon XP 1.5GHz, GeForce 4 Ti4200-powered test system had a bit of            a hard time with the game on only medium detail settings. Also,            don't even think about trying to play on a server with more than            four players if you're stuck on a dial-up modem connection, as it            really is sheer hell. The netcode works very solidly over a            broadband connection, however, only faltering when the servers            themselves are a bit dodgy.        For those of you who are, for one reason or                 another, stuck on a 56k connection (you poor things),                 Battlefield 1942 does include a single player option, but DICE                 have pulled this part of the game off with a mixed amount of                 success. You can either opt to take part in a series of maps                 as Allied or Axis forces in a Campaign mode, or you can set up                 a quick multiplayer game with some AI bots.                    However, both of these modes are unfortunately marred by the            frankly abysmal behaviour of the computer controlled opponents and            team-mates. It becomes extremely difficult to play the game            properly when you're forced to run around the map capturing points            by yourself, simply because the bots don't know how to. When they            do capture something, it's usually because they stumbled across it            whilst aimlessly driving a tank back and forth. They'll climb into            vehicles, drive six feet, and get out again so one of the other            bots can have a go; they'll get out of a tank so you can drive when            all you want to do is man the machine gun on the roof; and they'll            sometimes fly in circles in the sky forever until somebody shoots            them down. And you can be damn sure nobody on your team is going to            do it.                    Somewhat perversely, to counter-balance the sheer stupidity of the            AI, the bots are also ridiculously accurate. They can drop a bomb            on your head with pinpoint accuracy, snipe you from machine gun            nests without fail and utilise the rocket launcher for one-on-one            combat with impossible efficiency. As well as the shoddy AI, there            are the odd bugs here and there; one of the more amusing glitches I            saw came about when I was on a bombing run high above the island,            only to see a tank spawn in the sky and come whistling past my            cockpit window.                    While it has its faults, Battlefield 1942 is currently peerless for            sheer absorbing multiplayer action. Even though its leanings are            more towards action than realism, it still manages to play far more            tactically than old crusties like Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat,            as long as you've got the right players with you. If you've got the            system and connection to handle it, there is no reason why you            should be without this game."}
