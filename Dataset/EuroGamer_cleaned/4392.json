It's not all Association            Football, Rugger and Cricket around these parts, you know.            Sometimes we like to slip on a baseball cap, quite literally the            wrong way around, hop into a Tommy Hilfiger jumper and cruise to            the ~US of Stateside~, and see what our American cousins are            whooping and hollering to in their ~World~ of ~Sport~. This week,            we knocked on the doors of Sega Enterprises, and with a cheery,            cheeky, but professional grin, asked these ~Sonic Boom Boys~ to wow            us with their latest sporting trio; NHL, NFL and NBA - or to us            clueless limeys, Ice Hockey, American Football, and Basketball, eh            Banal?        Banal: You're not wrong there, Barry; us limeys can be            flaming well clueless at times! But the thing to remember is that            American Football, Ice Hockey and Basketball are all based on            British sports. Rugby. Hockey. Netball. Two of those are basically            for girls, Barry. Two of them.        Barry: Ha ha, well you would say that, Banal, but after 25            years as a pro (two of them in a coma, remember) and 14            championship medals, who would argue with you?        Banal: My daughter's boyfriend tries it on occasionally, the            earring-toting goth-wannabe scallywag. Shove him in the forces, I            say! Then he can earn his jewellery instead of buying it from a            market vendor with a staple gun.        Barry: Anyway. On with the show: barely able to contain            our excitement earlier on today, we popped in NFL; a sport - we            have to confess - we don't know the first thing about. I mean,            isn't it just Rugby for wimps? We'd like to see how these so-called            hard men would get on against our world-beating Rugby boys without            their armour on.        Banal: Unfortunately they'd have to figure out where England            is to do that. They don't have rugby pitches over there. It's all            skyscrapers, running tracks and hyperturf.        Barry: And what about the game, Banal? I have to say,            looking at it from the perspective of someone who knows precisely            sod all about Gridiron; it just feels like the kind of game you            need to go on a three week course to be able to understand. Without            even the most basic knowledge, you'll be drowning in a sea of flow            charts, and more tactics than your average Army briefing. Most of            the time you have almost no control over your players, and            overzealous CPU AI intervenes more often than seems fair.        Banal: I'd have to flaming well agree with you there, Barry.            You were run ragged by my proficiency with the lemon there, failing            to grasp even the most basic of mechanics, and there was no obvious            way to work out what the screens and screens of ~playbook~            offerings and kick goal whomp thwacking tiddlywinks were in aid of.        Barry: You've lost me there, Banal.        Banal: You also had trouble actually throwing the ball            whatsoever, I noticed. I was just pressing X or Y or B or L or some            other button whenever one of my fellows scampered into space,            carefully manoeuvring my little throw-man around the onrushing CPU            opposition in the meantime, but you just got clobbered without            recourse. 22-0? Bit of a walkover for me, Barry, but I had more fun            at my sister-in-law's divorce party holding my Grandmother's            colostomy bag whilst watching family friend Nora Batty do I Will            Survive on the karaoke machine.        Barry: Right, so that was possibly one of the most painful,            unenjoyable gaming experiences we've ever had the misfortune of            getting involved with. Let's hope the next one's better eh, Banal?        Banal: Flaming well better be.        Barry: Surely Sega can't 'puck' up an Ice Hockey game,            can it Banal? Even the complete Anglophile sport fan can pick up            the game and be scoring goals in a matter of seconds. I mean, how            complicated could it be?        Banal: You'd think so, Barry. Everyone played hockey at            school, and knows how easy it is for that speeding blob of white            concrete to outwit the slower eyes of the heavily-padded            goal-minding fat kid. It's a sport in itself just picking him up            afterwards.        Barry: Well quite Banal, but this is Ice Hockey.        Banal: It's still much the same thing I feel, Barry. You            pass the puck a bit, and hit first-time shots like you're Darius            Vassell and the Turkish goalie's showing too much of his top-left            corner.        Barry: Well, I know I'm bad at games, Banal, but I have to            ask, what was that all about? A whole hour before scoring a goal?            What the hell's going on? And what's that colour scheme all about?            Who turned the lights out? Give us EA or Midway's versions any day            over this. This was gaming pain; a stodgy, unplayable mess with a            mere fraction of the playability, verve or fun factor of its            rivals. You could say, Banal, that Sega's had a shocker            today\u2026        Banal: They flaming well have, Barry. That wasn't the            high-scoring, low-maintenance NHL I remember. I only managed two            goals and it was you in goal. Surely that's an AI bug there            Barry.        Barry: Well Banal, I'm not actually artificial!        Banal: What was the score, Barry? I almost forget. The thing            is, this NHL game is coming at the subject from a simulator's point            of view, with fewer goals, very easy tackles - unlike either EA or            Midway's slaughter-oriented offerings - and less of the fighting.            We didn't even manage a punch-up that time, did we?        Barry: Not even one.        Barry: Battling gamely on, we were convinced that the            mighty Sega couldn't possibly fail to pull a top-drawer Basketball            game out of the hat. We'd heard that Sega's sport range had            underperformed in its native territory last Christmas, but in our            naivety we believed that couldn't have had anything to do with the            games. After all, didn't Sega have a pretty mighty reputation for            sporting greatness?        Banal: I think you made that up actually Barry.        Barry: Woo hoo! Drink my Whup Ass, Banal! 62-54\u2026dunk            my slams. Well at least we managed to score some points in that            one. But, um, it wasn't actually terribly good was it? What was            going on with the graphics for a start? The green arc of piss that            emanates from your player during penalty taking is just too funny            for words. And watch those crowd members pop up like a box of            frisky Pop Tarts in a nervous toaster factory. Permission to barf            up my lunch over your lap\u2026this spinny camera nonsense makes            us feel ill.        Banal: The demented stick insect approach to character            animation was a bit of a let down too Barry, and it was almost            impossible to pull off interesting shots, or net anything from            outside the semi-circle. And you're flaming well right about the            green arc of piss - having to move your pressure-sensitive triggers            down in unison ever-so-gently to concentrate the two arcs on the            ring is a clever idea, but the flow of arrows is too comedic for            words. I also felt that the replays which shifted between embossed            and inverted visuals looked like some sort of crazed graphical bug.            As did the aforementioned Pop Tart spectators - wouldn't it be nice            if Sega took the time to get things on the court right before            bothering with the background?        Barry: And so ends a somewhat disappointing Sega Sports Day,            in which the American arm of the Japanese giants were sorely            exposed for having let its sporting arms slip alarmingly close to            its arse. Some might say we're ill-equipped to review sports games            not meant for us, and they'd probably be right. Certainly in the            case of NFL, we've got more chance of performing accurate,            life-saving brain surgery with a Phillips screwdriver than            understanding the reams of tactical nonsense thrown at the player.            But we take issue with this; no sports game, apart from anal            management simulations should demand quite so much prior knowledge.            We're sure there is a specific niche that understands all this, but            for what it's worth, we think that alienating a large chunk of your            potential audience from the word go is commercial suicide.        Banal: I'd certainly agree with that, Barry. Although I'm            not familiar with your anal management simulations, I do think that            a detailed training, 'strap your balls to the basics' mode would            add all sorts to that game. As it is, we clicked through virtually            anything and the on-screen help menus were like the bloody            paperclip on acid.        Barry: But as for NHL and NBA, these are two of the most            straightforward sports in the world, and making a good looking,            slick, intuitive and playable game out of each of them should be            par for the course for a company with the depth of experience and            talent of Sega. NHL is just plain dull; if you've never played an            Ice Hockey game before, you'll probably never want to again, it's            such a chore to be able to string together any coherent and deadly            attacking or defensive manoeuvres. We didn't have the same abject            failure to score in NBA, but there was just something so ~will this            do?~ about it. When at least three companies churn out annual            updates of their various sports titles, you just expect so much            more than half-baked inferiority. Piling an Everest high mountain            of stats and options onto your sports games does not hide the ugly            truth of the mediocrity of the game's graphics or playability. EA            Sports has never looked so unassailable, which is a worrying state            of affairs. Any parting words, Banal?        Banal: No I flaming well haven't. Netball, for goodness            sake!        Barry: See you next time.
