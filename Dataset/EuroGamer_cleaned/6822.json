The            N64 had Super Mario 64. Traditionally Mario sells the console and            then Nintendo drip-feeds gamers with offerings from its other major            franchises, but this time Mario's late to the party. So late in            fact, he hasn't even turned up in Japan yet. Nintendo's diminutive            console needs something to sell it, and the closest thing to a            Mario game we have for now is Luigi's Mansion, brainchild of            legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Is it enough?                         The premise is extremely simple. By way of a peculiar stroke of            luck, Luigi has won a mansion in a competition he never even            entered, and agrees to meet his brother Mario there for a            celebration. Unfortunately, after wandering aimlessly through a            spooky forest, our hero discovers that his mansion prize is little            more than an elaborate trap, and headstrong Mario has already            fallen victim. Teaming up with local oddball Professor E. Gadd,            Luigi vows to rid the mansion of its ghostly inhabitants and rescue            his brother.                         The game is a bold departure from previous Mario Brothers titles.            Unlike his bouncy brother, Luigi doesn't jump, bop people on the            head or throw fireballs. He doesn't fly, and he doesn't collect            stars. Well, only once. Luigi's spooky adversaries are almost            infallible, susceptible to nothing but the quirky Prof's modified            vacuum cleaner, the Poltergust 3000. Using the pressure-sensitive            left and right shoulder buttons to blow and suck at the desired            rate, Luigi can gobble up ghosties and bag the Boos, before            returning to the Prof's lab to turn them into portraits for the            gallery.                    The mansion itself is huge and sumptuously detailed, revealed piece            by piece as Luigi feels his way around with a torch. The pseudo 3D            world created for the game is a terrific achievement, viewed from            the front instead of a roving camera, rich with consistently            delicate design and minutiae, real-time lighting and shadows, and            with almost total interaction permitted. Luigi can suck cloths from            tables, rattle desks and uncover untold treasures by experimenting            on different things with his Poltergust. A steady stream of dust            pours off worthless items, and coins, gold bars, jewels and even            the odd bit of paper money empty from many of the others.                         The mansion is laid out across several floors, and Luigi moves            between these as he finds keys, keeping track of the rooms he's            cleared and which doors he has keys for using his GameBoy Horror,            another of E. Gadd's devices. Rooms house either a collection of            smaller ghosts or one of the larger spectres to be bound in the            Professor's gallery, and each has a weakness which allows you to            see their heart. The Poltergust can latch onto hearts, but ghosts            aren't eager to give them up. Watching a ghost's behaviour allows            you to unravel the puzzle of how to capture them, and this can mean            anything from distracting them from their meal to dazzling them            with melody. The props, clues and series in-jokes are easy to find            and fun to play with.                         Luigi himself is wonderfully detailed. He can tiptoe, trot and            scamper quickly, and as he stands in the dark you can see him            breathing nervously, his eyes darting this way and that and his            little hands trembling. Aw. Apart from sucking the not-so-living            daylights out of the furniture and his surroundings, the petrified            plumber can also do a bit of damage with his nozzle. Several            elemental tokens are spread throughout the game, and upon finding            these Luigi can start spitting water, fire and even ice from his            Poltergust, with a steady supply of each available from taps,            candles, ice buckets and other logical sources. Some ghosts need            softening up with an element before vacuuming, which is a nice            touch.                    Shortly after embarking on his quest, Luigi comes across an odd            room with a secret lever, and before he knows what he's doing the            game's true bad guys, the Boos, have woken from their slumber and            raced off to terrorize the house. Apart from vacuuming up the            resident nasties of each area, Luigi also has to use his GameBoy            Horror's Boo Radar to locate the wily tricksters, who aren't so            susceptible to the Poltergust's confinement beam, and dart between            rooms to make the player's life even more difficult.                         The game is split into several rough areas, each culminating in a            boss encounter, but as these are spread all over the house the            structure is largely academic. These boss encounters are suitably            memorable, from the irate baby a few minutes in to King Boo            himself, if he's still man enough to face you. After defeating a            boss ghost the Poltergust needs emptying, so Luigi heads back to E.            Gadd's lab to turn the bad guys into portraits using the Ghost            Portrificationizer, before heading back into the mansion and            finding some more spectres.                         Luigi's activities take him all over the place and keep the player            thinking. The puzzles are never too hard, nor too easy, and utilize            all areas of the control system. Along the way, Luigi catches            fleeting glimpses of a greater adversary and his endangered            sibling, both literally, through a secret tunnel in a murky place,            and metaphysically, through the helpful psychic Madame Clairvoya,            who will analyse a handful of things stripped from Mario during his            passage to imprisonment if Luigi can find them. The mansion and            tasks form an extremely congruous adventure, however            all-over-the-place the game may feel, and little diversions and            submissions - like the collection of dropped pearls to make better            picture frames - add classic Nintendo diversity to the already            unique atmosphere.                    Speaking of atmosphere, one of the game's finest assets is its            soundtrack. Although the haunted mansion theme is typically good,            and whistled nervously by the game's star as he trundles down            hallways avoiding phantom bats and rats, the little side pieces            make all the difference. The game is eerie and uncomfortable,            augmented superbly by the composers, and yet the end product still            manages to look and sound like a Mario adventure. And although            devoid of traditional voice acting, all of the characters -            including the ghosts - have their own eerie mutterings, and if you            hammer the action button without facing an object Luigi yells for            Mario. Poor feller.                         That said, many of the game's locations have a tendency to look            flat, and the first person view through Luigi's GameBoy Horror -            useful for analysing weaknesses and spotting lesser ghosts - is            somewhat disorientating. The engine doesn't lend itself            particularly well to first person exploring, presumably why our            hero cannot move in this view, and the perspective is definitely            wrong. Despite these setbacks though, the game is generally            pleasant to look at, with reflective surfaces and intricate detail            all over the shop. Even minor characters like Toad, who shows up            around the house now and then to save your progress, receive a            generous amount of attention, and the game's bad guys are all            unmistakably semi-transparent floating spectres.                         Sadly Luigi's Mansion is neither terribly challenging nor            particularly long. Although I had a bit more trouble with the PAL            release of the game than I did with the Japanese version which I            played in September, there really is no point in the game where            reasonably seasoned players will struggle, and the many vases and            chests around the house are loaded with health-replenishing hearts            and so forth, which respawn if Luigi is running on empty. Although            this is something of a compliment to the intuitive control system,            finishing the game takes roughly five hours if you take it at a            leisurely pace, and although coin-collectors are rewarded and            Miyamoto has added a few extra bits and bobs to uncover since the            Japanese and American releases, this isn't going to last you more            than a weekend. Furthermore, despite the PAL60 support in the            European Cube hardware, the game runs at a borderless 50Hz. It            looks nice, but it's not as smooth as the NTSC versions, even if            load times are unheard of and slowdown is something of a rarity.                    Luigi's Mansion is a delightful little game, instantly appealing to            anybody with more than a passing interest in its heritage, but it            isn't the GameCube equivalent of those platform classics I            name-checked at the start of the review. A competent, atmospheric            adventure and truly a new direction for the characters, but at this            length it simply isn't worth the \u00a335, let alone the cost of            the console. If Miyamoto's vision of shorter games more often is to            become reality, then the pricing structure will need serious            adjustment..."}
