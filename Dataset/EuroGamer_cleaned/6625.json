Well, that's            just plain bollocks, isn't it? Xbox Live has been kicking around            since the end of November, the PS2 has had online games to some            degree for ages (like Tony Hawk), and wasn't the Dreamcast            supposedly next-gen anyway? Let's not get bogged down by semantics,            you might well say, but hey, we're not the ones who wrote the silly            press release.                    So what is special about Phantasy Star Online: Episode I            & II, apart from the crap name, the distinction of being the            first online Cube game, and a dynasty of old-school            turn-based RPGs?        You'd think Nintendo would want something mainstream and            accessible for its first online game. Tellingly, PSO is exactly the            opposite. Fortunately, it makes up for it by being bizarrely            addictive when played by more than a lone player, and it gets this            aspect of the game right most of the time. However, it also makes            plenty of mistakes. Cripes - three paragraphs in and we're            already bouncing back and forth like war propaganda. We knew            this would happen.                    The game is, at its simplest, a hackandslashy science fiction RPG            played by one-to-four players, in which the protagonists -            colonials looking for a new home in the stars - are seeking to find            out why the planet Ragol and an early settlement has been ripped to            shreds by a big explosion, and where all the people have gone. The            game is played out on and below the surface of the planet as a band            of adventurers fight wave after wave of plodding enemies in            pseudo-real-time, collecting money and upgrades in their wake and            from crates scattered by the explosion.                    The original Dreamcast game (including the version 2 upgrade) is            there in full, and the ~Episode II~ element (you can see how it            gets confusing) adds a raft of new content in the same game engine.            It can be played offline by one player, by two-to-four in            split-screen mode, or online by a single player co-operating with            up to three others in a party. Sadly, you can't have people on your            end make up the numbers in split-screen - an annoying restriction,            but with a very tightly controlled serial/key/password system            governing the online element, and a monthly subscription            fee, you can sort of understand why.        Instead of splitting the game up into single and multiplayer            chunks, you simply play through the same levels and have more            enemies to face depending on the numbers. In each case, you have to            set up a character to start with, choosing from one of three            classes and four sub-classes each, which all differ in their            abilities. To quickly run through each one; Hunters are proficient            with bladed weapons; Rangers specialise in projectile weaponry; and            Forces are sort of wizardlike, with various spells which make up            for their physical weakness. However in PSO, these are called            ~Techniques~, and use TP instead of MP. Semantics again.                    The Episode I element comprises four main areas: the Forest (with            slashy humanoid ~Booma~ enemies, wolves and little yellow            penguin-looking bastards), the Caves (with sharks and Nova            dragons), the Mines and the Ruins. We lost interest in the latter            stage enemies long ago and can't remember their names. Of the four            sections, the Forest is easily our favourite, with its reasonable            learning curve, increasingly cool battles (big, gorilla look-alikes            turn up eventually at four times the size of a Booma) and one of            the best bosses in the game - a big red dragon. However, none of            them varies much from the hackandslash principles, and ultimately            the gameplay is mainly about collecting items and doing whatever's            needed to open the next door (almost universally by one of two            activities; killing all the enemies in one area or just finding a            switch nearby). Any variation in gameplay can be found in the            enemies you face and the kit you acquire. OK, you can download            quests from Pioneer 2 (and the Sega servers), which flesh out the            story a little more, but they all take place in the same levels.                    The act of walking around and clobbering people is admittedly quite            fun. The lightsaber-wielding Hunters get the best of it, and the            combat is based around a measured three-tap system (tap - downward            stroke - tap - horizontal stroke - tap - uppercut). As you go on,            you gradually accumulate better weapons from the crates you find            and shops you visit back on your mothership, the Pioneer 2, and            Techniques from special disks which are strewn around the same            locations. Weapons, techniques and items can all be bound to the            various face buttons on the controller through a complicated menu            system, and eventually your little Mag - a sort of shoulder-mounted            Tamagotchi who must be fed items regularly - will learn how to pull            off massively powerful techniques which are best employed against            bosses.        But playing the game on your own can be pretty tedious. It            takes a long time and a lot of battles to level up your character            to boss-beating status, and as you start out you'll often find            yourself dying regularly or running out of Monomate (cough, health            potion) and retreating to Pioneer 2 to tool up again. And of course            this style of hack, slash, die, rinse, repeat only really appeals            to a particular brand of gamer, and I'm not really one of them.            Shove in a social context though and I'll happily play Diablo II            until the early hours, and that's where PSO really excels - in that            close-knit, team co-op guise. Get a few friends together and play            online and it's amazing. You share experience by contributing to            the death of the same enemy; thus you can help build up lesser            players by having them dart in and smack an enemy once before you            finish it off. You can fight over the loot. You can work through a            level in a couple of little groups. You can even chat away happily            - with the appropriate keyboard peripheral. And to a certain            extent, the game is also fun in split-screen mode. To a certain            extent.                    Beyond that extent, we have the communal map overlay, which            obscures a lot of the playing area despite some vague attempt at            translucency, the absolutely ridiculous pop-up even in two-player            (we used the term ~Daytona-level pop-up~ recently, but we're going            to switch to ~PSO GC-level pop-up~), and a camera which at times            just does not want to show you the game. It's OK in single player            with a big screen to peer at, but in little split-screen boxes            you'll find that getting backed up by monsters often means you're            left with screen clutter and big, fat, indecipherable graphics            pulsating against the camera like a bloody ultrasound scan.            ~Where's the enemy? I don't see it.~ It's even worse in boss            battles, particularly with dragons, because it only wants to look            at their heads, meaning you get stomped because you can't see            where you are. Honestly, Sega, did you even test this?        Eek, we almost commenced the                 downward spiral towards the verdict you've already glanced at.                 But before we do, let's stick with what we do like about PSO,                 because for all its flaws (and it's taking a lot of typing to                 fit them all in), it does have some serious merit. To                 reiterate what's gone before, it's very addictive in                 multiplayer over the Internet, and for some, as a whole. The                 reward structure is great, with irregular level-ups interwoven                 with new weapons, new armour, new Mag levels and new enemies.                 However, the graphics have lost some of their sheen, so it's                 no longer a visual reward, but more of that later.                    Still on the friendly tack though, the online setup and network            attached seem to be in pretty good nick. We've tried the game using            both broadband and modem adapters (although Nintendo's PR company            was only allocated ten of the former for the entire UK press so we            had to buy one), and set up is logical, albeit occasionally a bit            confusing. Anybody with a smattering of network skills will be able            to set either up. For broadband, we had to set a manual IP address            because PSO refused to talk to our DHCP server, but that's about            it.                    As for lag, we didn't spot any, except a reasonable amount via            modem, and the download pod in the City area came furnished with            the promised NiGHTS GBA port. Handy, and a good reason to invest in            the GBA-to-GC connector, although you'll have to finish the            mini-game specific quests first.        That said, you can't be expected to invest in every Cube                 peripheral under the sun, and that's what PSO seems to want                 you to do. You'll need a broadband or modem adapter to play it                 with other people at all, and that's \u00a335, and then                 there's the keyboard peripheral from Datel or whoever, which                 is another \u00a320. These are almost obligatory in order to                 gain much from the title - using the on-screen keyboard is                 horrible, and the Cube will only talk to the Internet using a                 standard, 'Nintendo-made-this' peripheral. Sorry. So that's                 \u00a355 on top of the cost of the game.                    To take advantage of the downloadable GBA games, that's another            \u00a37 or so for the cable, and since the game uses 28 blocks of            your memory card, you're probably going to need another one of            those (no reasonably longstanding Cube owner is going to have 28            blocks free on their main memory card, however poor the software            situation has been). So you're looking at a big, big investment for            a game which will only probably return it - and has rather            insultingly been available on another system for several years. The            only reason you can't play it on those any more (with all the            peripherals you bought then) is that Sega turned the servers            off - oh, and now they want \u00a35.99 / \u20ac8.99 a month after            a 30-day preview period for you to continue doing so.                    What are they offering to justify this besides an ageing RPG? A            smattering of new content (a few levels, bosses, weapons and so            on), broadband support and a split-screen option - all things which            should have been in ~version 2~. And they're still peddling those            ~you must walk to this specific two-metre-squared area to spawn            baddies which, when dispatched, will unlock the doors you can't            figure out~ situations. Bad Sega, bad!        Aaaand we've been waiting to go on about the graphics, so            indulge us; characters look like paper chain men with textures            pasted onto them, and don't really do anything other than run like            podgy charity workers dressed up as bears during the 24th mile of            the marathon, occasionally halting to swing their swords or            whathaveyou, animals move slowly and without much variation, and            sometimes get caught jerking against the scenery, the collision            detection is awful, and the environmental effects consist of little            jets of water sprinkling out of octagonal pipes (which, without the            water, we wouldn't be able to identify) and bubbling lava. The            environments are even starting to look shabby now, with the            exception of the new Beach area in Episode II, which looks rather            splendid as you can see in the screenshots.                    Phantasy Star Online has been kicking around for a long time            now, and with each successive ~update~, Sega seems keen to endorse            the snappy new slogan we dreamt up for it: Yesterday's Technology            Tomorrow. This one is admittedly better value for money than the            rather uninspired ~version 2~ Dreamcast release, but for a game            which has seen as much development as this to suffer from            fundamental flaws and dodgy design decisions in so many areas is            bizarre.                    Sega fans should rush out and buy it for the new content, ignoring            every single word we say as the blinkers slowly unwind to obscure            life outside Ragol, and die-hard fans of the genre will probably go            for it - and more power to them, but they will want one of those            keyboard pads too, unless they plan to stick with four stock            phrases and a few smileys for the rest of eternity. Meanwhile, PSO            virgins will find the package unwieldy and confusing to start with,            and the online element a bit inaccessible. It's worth persevering            with if you've got a regular group to play with online, but            otherwise it just plain is not. Not any more. Too complicated for            most humans, and it's going to be a lot more cost-effective on Xbox            anyway, hence the score.
