As you may have guessed from the title, Agent Under Fire is not            based on any of the existing Bond movies, but instead sports an            original plot dreamt up by a group of caffeine-addled programmers            somewhere in the depths of EA's Californian bunker complex. Sadly            at times this story reads more like something out of the X-Files            than a James Bond movie, involving secret cloning experiments and            an attempt to replace world leaders, while Bond himself is a            generic secret agent spliced together from junk DNA left behind by            Pierce Brosnan, but lacking his charisma and dry wit. You'll also            be harrassed via radio throughout the missions by a not-Judi-Dench            female M and a not-John-Cleese Q-department boffin. Voice acting is            quite good by videogame standards, and the script does have a few            classic Bond moments, but obviously it's a pale shadow of the            genuine article.                        Sadly the same could be said for much of the in-game action. Most            of the time Agent Under Fire feels like an archetypal run and gun            shooter, with nothing but the vaguely World Is Not Enough-ish            soundtrack and occasional blasts of the 007 theme to remind you            that you are in fact Bond, James Bond. Thanks to a lack of            licensing expenditure even your trademark Walter PPK is replaced by            the imaginary Wolfram P2K. On the bright side, you have an array of            Q gadgets at your disposal, and in true Bond fashion your mobile            phone doubles as a laser to burn through locks and a wireless            transmitter to gain access to computer systems. These gadgets can            only be used in a few clearly marked areas in each map though. For            example, the Q-laser can only be used on one particular kind of big            chunky padlock, computers and machinery which can be accessed by            the Q-remote or Q-decrypter are highlighted by obtrusive flashing            green lights, and the Q-claw grappling hook relies on architects            conveniently leaving special gratings lying around for it to latch            on to.                    Rather more interesting are the driving missions which are            interspersed amongst the first person shooter levels. These vary            from a (literally) on-rails mission which takes you for a            spectacular rollercoaster ride through a network of submarine            tunnels to driving your BMW (complete with optional machineguns and            rocket launcher) around the streets of Bucharest.                        To add some replay value, your progress through the game is            assessed at the end of each mission by a scorecard, and reaching            target scores will earn you medals that unlock extra features such            as a golden gun option for the game's multiplayer modes. Once            you've completed a mission you can go back to play it again at any            time, either to notch up a better score or (if you already have a            gold medal for that mission) to gather special 007 tokens to unlock            even more hidden extras. There's plenty here to keep you busy, and            although you can blast your way through the game in under ten            hours, earning a clean sweep of gold medals and uncovering all the            special ~bond move~ bonuses on each map will take somewhat longer.                        Rounding out the package is four player split-screen support, with            a choice of deathmatch, bomb defusing, hot potato and tag modes,            along with a one-off VIP escort map. Settings vary from a cramped            little castle ruin for fast-and-furious fragging to sprawling bases            which bear more than a passing resemblance to Unreal Tournament.            While this is certainly entertaining, the sight of secret agents            and curvaceous Bond girls hopping around a Quake-style medieval            arena blasting each other with rocket launchers makes it feel a bit            out of place. Bots are included for those of you with no friends,            but disappointingly they're only available for the vanilla            deathmatch mode. Surely coding them to pick up a flag wouldn't have            been that difficult?                    As a first person shooter Agent Under Fire is fairly entertaining,            if a little bland. As an Xbox title it's competent, but there's            precious little to seperate it from the (cheaper) PS2 original. And            as a Bond game it's something of a failure, with only the driving            missions and a handful of the cutscenes really feeling like they            belong to the world of 007.                        If you can get past the rather generic feel of the game you might            find some enjoyment in Agent Under Fire, but it's not a patch on            the likes of Frontline and Halo."}
