And although the game            was originally released in the USA as part of the Test Drive            franchise, we'll try not to hold that against it - Wide Open might            not be perfect, but it's a far cry from the horrors of TD            overdrive.                        The centerpiece of the game is the career mode, where you make your            way through several seasons worth of championships to earn prize            money which can then be spent on buying new cars for your            collection and (once you've progressed far enough to unlock them)            upgraded versions of your existing vehicles. Everything from            over-the-top American trucks and souped-up humvees to flimsy            looking jeeps are available, but when push comes to shove (as it            often will) it doesn't seem to matter how big your chosen vehicle            is - a jeep can spin you around just as easily as a monster truck            if you clash too heavily, and the resulting swerve can leave you at            the back of the field, or over the edge of a cliff and completely            out of contention. This can prove frustrating, but luckily the game            is entertaining enough to keep you coming back most of the time.            What's more, vehicles occasionally seem to defy gravity, with            insane jumps that stretch credibility to breaking point, your car            drifting through the air for what seems like an eternity before            landing without a dent a hundred feet below. You can even adjust            the orientation of your vehicle in mid-air with some deft            manipulation of the right analogue stick, ensuring you land with            all four wheels pointing in the same direction.                        Courses are (as the title suggests) big and open, including some            ~scramble races~, where you're given ten checkpoints to tag in any            order you please. Even the linear and circuit tracks often give you            multiple routes and shortcuts, and you're basically free to go            where you want; if you're driving a good climber, for example, you            might be able to scramble up the side of a hill faster than you can            drive around it. You'll need to take every advantage you can find,            as competition is fierce, and although the AI does seem to slow            down slightly if you fall too far behind, it's nowhere near as            blatant as in TD overdrive and merely acts to maximise the close            quarters racing rather than turning the chace into a series of            pointless stop-start spurts. You'll still have to work for your            points, and some events can be almost impossibly difficult - the            first time I raced on one track, nobody reached the finish            line before the time limit was reached, leaving us all going away            empty-handed.                    Wide Open might not be the most innovative racing game ever made,            or the best looking, but it is fairly amusing for the most part.            The career mode gets a bit tough after the first couple of seasons,            and you may find yourself racing the same tracks several times            before getting the championship win you need to progress, but if            you get tired of this grind you can always take a break in the Free            Roam mode, where you can drive around the game's various settings            and explore courses to your heart's content without any time            limits, checkpoints or rival drivers to worry about. There are even            a few stadium circuits to give you a change of scenery, although            these are less satisfying. The result is a fairly comprehensive            package which might not win any awards for originality - certainly            not when compared to Angel Studios' regular output - but does make            a nice change from the Xbox's plethora of circuit and street racing            games.
