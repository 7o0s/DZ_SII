It's hard to tell what, if anything, has been            changed since the last version of the engine, but fortunately the            visuals are still quite attractive, if not as spectacular as they            seemed back in 2000.                                    There have been some changes on the gameplay front though, with the            focus in the main single player campaigns switching to tactical            combat rather than base building and resource gathering. You're            provided with a group of units at the beginning of each mission,            with further forces often arriving as reinforcements on completion            of each objective. You will also be able to call on support from            heavy artillery, bombers and air recon units in some missions, and            unleashing these at the right time and the right place can often            change the course of a battle. As a result the emphasis is on using            your limited forces as best you can, rather than churning out            dozens of tanks and obliterating your enemy through force of            numbers, which makes for a more realistic experience.                                    Frontline Attack is still very much a real-time strategy game at            heart though, and a far cry from the likes of Combat Mission and            the Close Combat series. There's no unit moral or fatigue to worry            about and vehicles have unlimited fuel, only requiring occasional            ammunition resupplies. You can even use a repair truck to rapidly            patch up damaged tanks mid-mission. The game also gets back to its            roots in the multiplayer and skirmish modes, where you occupy            factories and mines to earn money which can then be spent on new            buildings and units in true RTS fashion. It's almost like having            two games in one, and the skirmish mode came as quite a culture            shock after few days exploring the campaigns.                    The game includes several campaigns split amongst Russian, German            and (primarily American) Allied forces, with each side having their            own selection of historical units, ranging from tanks and armoured            cars to various types of infantry and support vehicles. Some maps            also feature bunkers, anti-aircraft positions and anti-tank and            machinegun nests which can be occupied by your infantry, while in            skirmish mode and multiplayer matches you can build your own            defensive positions.                                    Commanding these troops is fairly straightforward, although they're            not always tremendously responsive and tend to get easily            distracted. It doesn't help that the game uses a primitive grid            system for collision detection. Because of this units can end up            dancing around each other in narrow streets and valleys as they try            to get into position, and a lone tree will prove an insurmountable            object even for an infantry unit.                                    Game balance also feels a little contrived at times, most            noticeably in the way that vehicles and infantry interact. Tanks            cause virtually no damage to infantry, which is odd, because we            were under the impression that most World War II tanks came fitted            with machineguns as well as their main cannon. You can drive over            infantry units, but this only happens if you give a direct order to            run down a specific unit, and the enemy AI will do its best to            avoid becoming roadkill. In return, only special anti-tank and            grenadier infantry can cause any real damage to tanks, as normal            foot soldiers apparently don't carry grenades. This means that you            can end up with a tedious stalemate if you run out of infantry to            support your tanks and come up against some enemy soldiers, while            missions can become virtually impossible to complete if you only            have infantry left. While it's nice that you have to learn to use            different types of unit together, the way the developers have gone            about achieving this is heavy-handed. This is only made worse by            the fact that your units will quite happily fire away at an enemy            they stand virtually no chance of destroying, even when a more            appropriate target becomes available, resulting in a lot of frantic            clicking as you try to convince your units to shoot at the right            targets.                    Frontline Attack does have potential, but the build we played had a            lot of rough edges. If these can be smoothed out in the few weeks            remaining before the game appears on the shelves then this could be            a nice change from painfully realistic World War II strategy games            like Sudden Strike and Close Combat. In the meantime we'd suggest            waiting for our review of the final release version before deciding            whether to take the plunge."}
