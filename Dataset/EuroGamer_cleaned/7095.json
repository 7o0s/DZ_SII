The answer is ~Heavy            Metal : FAKK2~, a straight-to-video animated movie. The good news            is that the game of the same name has little in common with the            rather disappointing movie, apart from its bizarre imagery and the            amply imbued heroine Julie.                        FAKK2 the game takes place thirty years after the movie, but            luckily for us the planet Eden, on which Julie has settled with the            other survivors of the film, is home to the fountain of eternal            youth. After all, a third person action game in which your            character is a saggy middle-aged woman would be something of a let            down... Being a woman of action though, Julie finds all this            sitting around drinking mineral water and staying forever youthful            rather dull. Unluckily for her (but luckily for us) Eden's peaceful            existence is about to be rudely interrupted by an evil demi-god by            the name of Gith.                        The first part of the game consists of exploring Julie's settlement            on Eden, and chatting with all the people you will see getting            brutally slaughtered a few hours later. You will also find your way            to the training area, where you will be guided through a fairly            comprehensive tutorial which shows you how to select and use your            various weapons and equipment, and how to control Julie. As in any            good third person game your character has a plentiful supply of            moves, with Julie climbing up, down and along ropes, dangling from            monkey bars, edging her way along narrow ledges, and ducking and            crawling her way under low obstructions, a move which seems to            exist purely as an excuse for the developers to give you an extreme            close-up of Julie's butt.                        The controls are very easy to get to grips with, and the moves are            achieved using a simple combination of the various movement keys.            Walking up to a low ledge and holding down the forwards key will            make Julie clamber up on to it, while climbing along a horizontal            rope or pipe is simply a case of jumping up to grab hold of it and            then moving backwards or forwards, using the jump key a second time            to lift your legs up over the rope, or the duck key to let go and            drop to the ground. This is about as simple and responsive as third            person gaming gets.                    Which is lucky, because sadly large chunks of the game are given            over to Mario-style jumping puzzles. You would have thought that            after the horrible alien levels at the end of Half-Life PC            developers would have learnt their lesson, but apparently not.                        During the course of the game you will find yourself leaping around            bits of gigantic rotating machinery, bouncing your way through a            lethal swamp, and running through a disintegrating surrealist            landscape. Pixel perfect jumps and races against the clock abound,            and some of the puzzles are frustratingly difficult, with the            slightest mis-timing leading to instant death. Achieving all of            this whilst being attacked by monsters is something of a challenge,            and it's all too easy to be hurled to your death through no fault            of your own, simply because the blast from a nearby explosion            knocked you over the edge of a platform or ledge into a bottomless            pit. One day somebody will realise that 3D platform games are            not fun, but until then we'll just have to grin and bear            it...                        Luckily the rest of the game makes up for the occasional lapse into            console territory, with the focus very much on all-out action.            Julie can carry a weapon in each hand and use them both            independently, allowing you to target two different enemies at            once. There is a wide range of weapons on offer, from swords and            slings to rocket launchers and flamethrowers, and each of them is            useful in its own way. Combination moves using the various swords            are impressive and deadly, with Julie spinning and stabbing her way            through the gibs as your opponents are reduced to their constituent            parts, blood spurting tastefully from severed limbs.                        The range of monsters on offer is also impressive, although the            mosquitos are a little annoying at times. Little tubby creatures            wearing happy masks bounce along in swarms, getting more and more            agitated as you kill their friends. Giger-esque fusions of weaponry            and organic material spout napalm, fire chainguns and slash at you            with blades. Birds dive bomb you from the air, while the harmless            looking furry animals from the start of the game turn into evil            faeces-throwing monsters when you drop them in water. Very            Gremlins.                    Where the game really scores though is in its atmosphere - from the            opening cinematics which introduce you to Julie's settlement you            can tell that a lot of effort has gone into creating a coherent and            visually impressive world for you to explore.                        You are gently lulled into the story as you explore the town and            talk to its inhabitants, finding out about the meteors that have            been striking the shield surrounding the planet, and gradually            realising that something is not quite right, leading up to the            first boss encounter, after which all hell breaks loose. Coming            back to the settlement later in the game to find it in ruins, with            half its population enthralled by hypnotic ~recruiters~ (Gith's            answer to TV envangelists) and the rest dead or vanished gives you            a real reason to hate the enemy, making it more personal.                        All of this is supported by the incredible graphics, which really            push the Quake 3 engine far beyond anything which id Software have            accomplished with it. The scenery is far more interactive, the            textures beautifully detailed, the levels vast and immersive, the            special effects violently over the top, and the monsters            imaginative and full of character. The in-game cinematics are            excellent, with big swooping camera movements and fine attention to            detail, although they fade somewhat later in the game. Voice acting            in the cinematics is fairly good throughout though, and the            context-sensitive music is suitably rousing during combat and            set-pieces.                    The only real gripe I have with FAKK2 is that it's all over far too            quickly, and the last section is something of a disappointment. It            took me just three afternoons (about ten hours of play) to finish            the game, and I was taking my time exploring the levels.                        After the beautiful town levels, the impressive underground            machinery of the second section of the game, and the misty            swampland of the third, the finale seems somewhat contrived and out            of character as you fight your way through a series of nightmarish            tests to prove your worthiness. The architecture of the levels is            imaginative and looks like it has escaped from an HR Giger painting            at times, but the actual gameplay is just a series of linear            platform hopping and monster blasting exercises for the most part.                        The worst is saved for last though. Killing the final boss is very            difficult, not just because it's technically challenging, but            because working out how to kill it is nigh on impossible.            After wasting half an hour blasting away at it to no avail I            resorted to checking a walkthrough of the game, only to discover            that you have to use a combination of weapons in the right order,            with the finishing blow struck from a particular direction. Not the            most obvious of solutions then...                    FAKK2 is a beautiful but flawed game, with easy controls and            imaginative design marred by a surplus of platform hopping puzzles            and a disappointing finale. It's also rather short, although Ritual            are about to release a free deathmatch add-on for the game, along            with source code and tools for mod makers, which should give it            some much needed longevity.                        It's an entertaining enough diversion for a weekend though, with            that Heavy Metal feel of scantily clad heroines, devestating            weapons, bizarre monsters and lavish settings. Good clean fun for            all the family then...                        -        Ritual                    interviewRitual                    interview"}
