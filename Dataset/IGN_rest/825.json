It constantly oscillates between thrilling action scenes, hilarious back-and-forth banter, and some poignant character moments. Each member of your core group is fleshed out, new characters (like Handsome Jack himself) are introduced and provide some fantastic new dynamics, and the episode ends on one of the best cliffhangers in recent Telltale memory. The 90 minutes of Atlas Mugged take the same Cowboy Bebop-esque caper vibe of the original episode and run with it. From the opening scene, in which youre forced to go to grotesque lengths to get past a retinal scanner, characters are constantly thrown into insane situations where they just cant seem to catch a break. I loved getting so close to my goal multiple times over the course of the episode, only to have it snatched away from me at the last second. I couldnt predict where the next scene would lead me, but by the end of Atlas Mugged, I had full faith that it was somewhere entertaining. The episode is rife with memorable interactions and hilarious moments, a lot of which center around the holographic ghost of Handsome Jack. The way you choose to have Rhys deal with him, whether it be through raw fear or wide-eyed admiration, leads to some of the funniest banter Telltales ever delivered. But the jokes arent just there to make you laugh  with each hilarious line, layers of Rhys personality are peeled back, the bond between Rhys and Vaughn transforms, and the links between Telltales series and the three main Borderlands games are strengthened. While Rhys side of the tale delivers a series of comedic blows, Fionas half is a quieter, more emotional story. How you choose to have Fiona and Sasha deal with the fallout of Episode 1s conclusion really lets you mold what kind of characters they are. Being empowered to dictate whether Fiona takes a higher road, or remains hellbent on revenge led to some really tough decisions: Do you fuel Sashas anger and feelings of betrayal, or try to calm her down at the risk of causing a rift between the two of you? Its a testament to Telltales storytelling that these two tonally different sides of the adventure are woven together without ever coming across as jarring. Seeing the same event from both sides, ping-ponging across Pandora to see how ones decision impacts the other, and constantly trying to figure out how theyre going to get from their present situations to the future scenes that pepper the story give Atlas Mugged a great sense of forward momentum. Episode 2 also succeeds at adding even more interesting characters to the already fantastic cast. Particularly interesting is Scooter, a mechanic who just might be the dumbest person on Pandora, but also the most loveable and surprisingly loyal. Aside from the fantastic writing, Telltales hit a creative stride with humor that draws from the gameplay mechanics as well as fourth-wall-breaking moments. Just when I grew tired of pointing my targeting reticle to catch something falling through the air, Tales from the Borderlands delivered a joke that astutely turned this mundanity into a punchline. Likewise, having characters pose and stare at the screen when theyre introduced, completely confusing those around them as to what theyre looking at, just adds to the dense layers of jokes throughout Atlas Mugged. While all of this is great, Im still not entirely sold on Tales inventory and currency systems. Throughout Episode 2, I packed my pockets with random grenades, shields, and doo-dads that I found throughout Pandora, but still havent really found a use for any of them. Maybe the payoff is somewhere down the road, but were almost halfway through the season and the whole system still feels half-baked. Same goes for the money Ive gathered  aside from a single aesthetic purchase in each of the two episodes, Im not sure why Im even bothering with rummaging through the world search of cash. Pros HilariousGreat characterizationUnexpected momentsHandsome Jack Cons Inventory system Tales from the Borderlands Episode 2: Atlas Mugged makes the most out of its short length by packing every scene with hilarious dialogue, emotional reveals, and legitimately tough decisions. Old characters gain additional layers, new characters steal the scenes theyre in, and the final scene propels the core mystery forward in a great way. After the first two acts of Rhys and Fionas adventure, I consider myself completely on board for Telltales wild ride.", "date": "March 18, 2015"}
