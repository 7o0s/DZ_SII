On the one hand, the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is fantastic. Every second of the short rounds matter, walls and floors wont protect you, and sound tactics win matches. But, like other 2015 multiplayer-focused shooters such as Evolve and Star Wars Battlefront, theres not a lot of there there. My time with Siege leaves me feeling like this Rainbow Six revival is a skeleton with not a lot of meat on its bones. The Walls Have Ears Siege reboots the long-running Rainbow Six series as a five-on-five, attack-and-defend competitive shooter thats as much about blowing holes in the world around you as in your opponents. Destruction is no gimmick; shooting through walls, blasting through floors and ceilings, and keeping as much of your corporeal Special Forces husk behind fragile cover during firefights is key to extending your life in each of the respawn-free modes. Using a gadget to detect the presence of an enemy and fragging them through what would, in most other first-person shooters, be an indestructible hunk of drywall isnt just satisfying; its thrilling. And while Siege isnt the best-looking shooter out there in terms of environmental detail or character models, it includes memorable touches like the arterial blood spray that coats the wall behind your target when you off them. It looks like something truly terrible happened in that spot. Playing defense (in applicable game modes) is a strategic rush because you know the attackers could burst through a wall at any moment. When defending an objective, youll have 30 seconds or so at the start of a round to fortify key areas with barbed wire on the floor, barricades, reinforced doors and windows, and more, to limit the enemys ability to approach their target from certain angles. I havent liked fortification in a shooter this much since Gears of War 3s Horde mode. Rainbow Sixs audio deserves special mention here, too, because the only soundtrack to each map is the sounds each player makes. Sure, theres the obvious stuff like gunshots, but its the little noises like the suction of a breach charge being placed on a wall or floor, or the metallic rustle of an enemy wading through a barbed wire trap that, if you listen closely, can clue you in on what the other guys are about to do. Then, when things get loud, delightful chaos ensues. That offense-vs.-defense is reflected in Sieges Operators  20 characters (10 attackers and 10 defenders) each team can choose from, each with unique skills. Im rather partial to Sledge, who can instantly pound holes through walls and floors; Thermite, who can laser-cut his way through reinforced doors or windows; and Pulse, who can detect nearby heartbeats through any surface (though defender Mute can block any nearby gadget as a counter). On the other side of that spectrum, I couldnt find a use for the Stimpack gun-toting Doc, as very few firefights ended with wounded teammates  guns tend to be so lethal youre either alive or dead, with nothing in between. Variety is the Spice Im also happy with most of the 11 included maps. Bank is an early favorite, as theres a basic cops-and-robbers fantasy fulfillment in trying to rescue a hostage from a bank vault while the other team is leveling walls to try and get to you. While the maps have enough variety between them, the adversarial game modes feel very similar. Hostage, Bomb, and Secure Area are all variations of, Try to get into a place the other team is keeping you out of. The CTF-like Hostage carries the most potential, since it ostensibly has the added goal of grabbing a human-shaped flag and carrying it out of danger, but in my experience no one ever even got to the hostage, let alone rescued him/her. Instead, an overwhelming majority of rounds ended with one team getting wiped out. As for the returning Horde-like Rainbow Six favorite, Terrorist Hunt, where you and your team hold out against waves of AI enemies? Normal mode is a bit of a misnomer. On that skill, the CPU-controlled creeps have fairly lousy aim and wont take advantage of many of Sieges new mechanics outside of shooting through walls. Crank it up to at least Hard and youll have a better, more realistic, human-simulating challenge with your friends. Finally, there are Situations: 10 single-player training missions (on the same 10 maps) that spotlight half of the 20 included Operators. They serve as decent tutorials for multiplayer proper, but because you dont have AI teammates at your side, they teach you little about the tactics and choices youll have at your disposal when other people get involved. After that, the bonus Situation 11 that unlocks after you complete the other 10 actually backfires as a pleasant surprise. Not because its bad  quite the opposite! Its a five-player bespoke Terrorist Hunt scenario, complete with an intro cutscene, a unique gameplay hook I wont spoil, and a post-mission cutscene that basically announces, Rainbow Six is back! And well totally hook you up with a proper co-op campaign next time, promise! Its effectively the developers saying, Heres everything you wanted in a narrative-driven campaign that we totally couldve given you! Its a tease. Under Lock and Key The least interesting part of Rainbow Six Siege is its progression system. Literally everything is locked when you first fire up the game, including ranked multiplayer matches, which dont become available until you reach character level 20  easily 10+ hours. Siege more or less forces you to play the Situations in order to earn Renown, the currency used to unlock the 20 Operators and their weapon attachments. Completing all 10 and achieving 90% of the secondary objectives along the way allowed me to unlock half of the Operator roster. After that, however, its a slow grind, as the second 10 require much more Renown to unlock, and completing Terrorist Hunt or PvP matches doesnt earn you much. Especially if you lose. And that doesnt even take into account the additional Renown youll need in order to unlock vital attachments like scopes and recoil suppressors. Its almost as if the game wants you to spend real-world cash on Renown point bundles in order to speed up the process. Rainbow Six Sieges focus on teamwork and strategy over just aiming prowess sets it apart in exciting ways, and the constant stream of new maps and operators have made it a wonderfully varied FPS. All that new content has made it harder for new players to catch up, and I wish more work had been done to address this, but smart play and good communication will still win you more games than having the newest operator. Its got some growing pains to sort out, but the future continues to look bright for Siege.", "date": "Nov. 30, 2015,"}
