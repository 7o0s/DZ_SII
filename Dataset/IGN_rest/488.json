With rudimentary platforming and one box-building mechanic, youll feel like a master only six levels in. Six worlds in, youll be scratching your head in a room full of lasers, pits, and spiked conveyor belts wondering how youll possibly make it through alive. Its a pleasant surprise of a platformer that succeeds on a clear mechanic, clever obstacles, a satisfying difficulty curve, and a dash of charm to hold the edges together. You are a cute, two-legged box named Qbby, and Qbby has the power to sprout new boxes from his body. The boxes must share a surface, not just an edge (no diagonals), and each level limits the number of boxes you can connect in one shape. Once you hit your quota, you can detach the shape from your body and move it around, keep it attached like primitive armor, or pull yourself to the location of the last box you placed. These rules are fun, absolute, and easy to grasp, and youll soon master simple applications like building a staircase to reach higher ground or a bridge to cross a pit. However, these are only the building blocks of whats in store. BoxBoxBoy!s variety of obstacles and the outside-the-box kind of thinking they encourage (all with a minimal tool kit) are without a doubt its greatest strength. Most of the 11 worlds have unique challenges to overcome, from waterfalls that move your dropped blocks to another part of the level to lasers that can fry you if youre unprotected. In one of the more challenging levels, a specific enemy needs to walk into an activator switch in order for you to progress. Its not immune to the levels spikes and pits though, so youll need to create shapes and rearrange the level on the fly to see it to its destination, all while making sure it doesnt kill you. Once you master all these nuances, BoxBoxBoy! folds them all together in the later levels for a true, satisfying test of your skills. BoxBoxBoy! also makes smart use of its collectibles. Rather than just floating around waiting for you to find them, they will disappear for good once youve used a certain number of boxes. Though you may be able to complete one puzzle with eight blocks, youll know for sure theres a way to do it with only six. The rewards you can earn, including short comics, songs, and alternate costumes, arent alone worth the trouble, but I enjoyed the mechanics and the level design so much that I felt compelled to trim the fat from my solutions and finish each puzzle with blocks to spare. Thanks to generous checkpoints and a fast do-over option, the trial-and-error loop always felt satisfying, not frustrating. There is a clarity to BoxBoxBoy!s mechanics that makes them easy to learn and experiment with. Everything feels deliberate and clean, and I rarely had to wonder whether I could do something. You cant run, and your jump is set to a fixed, shallow height, so when you move you almost never need to worry about momentum or positioning -- only your blocks and your strategy. For example, if you need to get higher, you can use your blocks to create a grappling hook of sorts. There are a handful of puzzles that require more classic platforming dexterity, but because your standard run and jump movements are so rigid, they are among the worst in the game. Pros Clear mechanicsLevel varietyFair difficulty curveSmart collectibles Cons Weak platforming Like its flat, plain protagonist Qbby, BoxBoxBoy! is deceptively capable. With one simple yet flexible mechanic, it uses crafty level design to constantly push the boundaries of what seems possible with just one tool. There are a few times when this puzzle-platformer leans too heavily into classic run-and-jump territory its not suited for, but when it stays the course, BoxBoxBoy! is a great example of how to do a lot with only a little.", "date": "July 7, 2016,"}
