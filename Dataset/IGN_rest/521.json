At face value its a simple side-scrolling action game, and it would be easy to write off its exorbitant amounts of gore as a smokescreen designed to hide a lack of depth. But amidst all the blood and severed body parts is a uniquely told story, delightfully rhythmic combat, and an ominously alien ambience that honors the legacy of the Amiga classic its based upon. My expectations of a showy, artless brawler evaporated within a few steps through the plains of Karamoon, where Shadow of the Beast begins. Elegant stone arches and gnarled trees dot a landscape that stretches far into the multi-layered background, lending an air of spaciousness and freedom despite our interaction with it being limited to walking left and right. This picturesque, indescribably alien backdrop isnt just window dressing either. A dynamic camera pans out and around it frequently as you continue forward, lingering on its sweeping landscapes and establishing a true sense of scale. Even once the arboreal beauty gives way to darker, more gothic tones, the art and camera work made me feel like an inhabitant of a world rather than a murderer just passing through. Blood Simple But to be clear, you are exactly that when all is said and done. For the protagonist, Aarbron, killing is seemingly as effortless as breathing. In most cases a single press of the attack button immediately launches him into a slickly animated killing blow that changes depending on the type of enemy in front of him, the timing of the button press, and the distance to target. Watching Aarbron seamlessly transition from one kill to the next is an elegant bit of savagery, with many different context-sensitive animations blended into a continuous, satisfying dance of death.Watching Aarbron seamlessly transition from one kill to the next is an elegant bit of savagery. Platforming, the thankfully few times you must do it, isnt quite so well-implemented. Without a full running start, jumping feels vague and clunky, as does climbing up and sliding down walls. Its largely kept to a minimum, but there are a few sections that rely on these and other light adventure elements more heavily than Id like. One level in particular, Hydraths Castle, brings the pace to a screeching halt with an abundance of platforming, not to mention switch puzzles and copious backtracking through some visually boring areas. Oddly, its here, where Shadow of the Beast is most like its 1989 predecessor in terms of structure, that it fails. Initially, I was also concerned about whether combat would be too simplistic to stay interesting, considering that encounters are all stringently structured: two portals appear to block you into a small area and summon a set number of enemies who march predictably straight to you from both sides, like lemmings walking off a cliff to their inevitable doom. Further layers quickly reveal themselves though, not only saving the action from monotony, but lending it a surprising level nuance. At a base level, just the number of different tools youre handed is impressive given how confined the fights are. Aside from being able to block, dodge, or parry just about any attack, you can stun enemies where they stand (essentially staunching the flow of attackers from one direction for a time) or grapple and pummel them into submission before flinging their lifeless corpse away, preferably into one of their still-living buddies to stagger them for a moment. Its all managed with simple, one-button inputs, so everything is intuitive to pull off, but the challenge is in deciding when to do what, and timing it properly so as not to take a hit. Before long, combat takes on a pleasing, steady meter, not unlike a beat/rhythm game  albeit with (a few) more flying limbs and camera-staining blood splatters. Nuanced Savagery Things become even more interesting when you start to consider the variety of special attacks and the resources you need to actively juggle. Health, Blood, and Wrath are all used to power Aarbrons most devastating techniques, and knowing how to generate them and when to spend them is a key second layer to the mechanically simple fighting system. For instance, you need Wrath to use your screen-clearing Wrath of Aarbron ability, and that resource can earned by successfully landing another special attack  which costs Blood. Blood can be generated simply by successfully stringing hits together, or more quickly by executing an attack that reduces your own health whenever you use it. Of course, if you just hold onto your blood until its maxed out, you can unleash it all at once in a cinematic killing frenzy that can go on for as long as you can keep up with the button prompts. No one piece of the combat puzzle is difficult to understand or apply, but taken together it provides plenty of interesting, split-second decisions to make. When you choose wisely, Aarbron looks and feels like a godless killing machine. (Thats totally a compliment.) When you choose wisely, Aarbron looks and feels like a godless killing machine. Whats even more interesting, though, is that the story succeeds from a very early point in casting doubt upon Aarbrons motivations. It would have been easy to participate in what seems like a murderous power fantasy, and certainly the original Shadow of the Beast comes from an era in games where everyone who wasnt you was as good as dead for no particular reason. But without getting into spoilers, this reboot toys with that notion in an interesting way, and the genius of it is that you could partially miss that based on how you play a key encounter in the first level. Much like games of old, the story here is sparse and mostly stays out of the way, aside from brief, skippable cutscenes here and there. All the dialogue is spoken in a variety of alien tongues which can only be translated if you spend earned points on understanding them. If, like me, you choose to spend points on combat upgrades instead, you can get through the five-hour story without knowing much of anything about Aarbron or the scores of aliens you help him vivisect. This keeps the story in the background if you want to just have an arcade-style action experience while also maintaining an effective air of mystery. Whether or not you dig deeper though, the story adds just a bit of weight to the proceedings without bogging down the pace. As such, youll probably tear through Shadow of the Beast in just a couple of sittings, which would be more disappointing if there werent so many secrets to find in your next playthrough. Most of the background lore is tucked away in unlockable videos, and intrepid explorers will find hidden equipable items that further add to Aarbrons arsenal of abilities. Theres even a small, but worthwhile cache of archival extras, including the original Amiga version of Shadow of the Beast, as well as its excellent soundtrack, and even a retrospective on the development of the entire trilogy. Its a small touch, but its still nice to see a reboot that makes an effort to expose and preserve its source material. Perhaps the best reason to continue playing though, is the rich, arcade-style score-ranking system and leaderboards. Taking all the moving parts of the combat system, and then applying them differently to not just survive, but put up big numbers became a bit of a fixation for me. Its just another example of how Shadow of the Beast speaks successfully to a different time in game design without feeling old and dated. Pros Intuitive, savage combatUnderstated, interesting storyEvocative art directionVery replayable Cons Clunky platforming From the way it relies on setting and music to tell the bulk of its story, to its use of simple mechanics on the way to score-based mastery, Shadow of the Beast takes old things and makes them feel decidedly less old. Walking to the right and killing everything that gets in your way may sound dull and straightforward, but here its elevated through thoughtful presentation, and combat that has more depth to it than initially meets the eye. Long after its many blood-soaked dismemberments fade from my memory, Ill remember just how alien and otherworldly it felt between the fits of violence.", "date": "May 17, 2016,"}
