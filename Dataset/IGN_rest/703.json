The original trilogy of films  released between 2002 and 2008  heavily relied on his unique brand of charisma, deadpan delivery, and no-nonsense fighting style. The character of lethal courier-for-hire Frank Martin became synonymous with The Stath so much so that it just looked wrong when he was replaced by Chris Vance for the TV show. But now the franchise is getting a shiny new reboot, with Ed Skrein  the original Daario Naharis in Game of Thrones and soon to be seen as Ajax in Deadpool  taking on the role. And while Skrein isnt quite the celluloid force of nature that Statham is, hes nevertheless a likeable presence that brings a few new dimensions to the character. Following a brief prologue in which the Russian villain of the piece takes control of prostitution on the French Riviera in a flurry of bullets, were re-introduced to Frank Martin, a man of few words, whose transportation business has three simple rules: No names. Never change the deal. Never open the package. The big change this time around is that we also meet his Dad Frank Sr. (Ray Stevenson), who claims to be a sales rep for Evian, but who is clearly a spy easing himself into retirement. The interplay between the two makes for some of the movies most entertaining scenes, and even if the frequent Junior jokes were done much better in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Skrein and Stevenson nevertheless have undeniable chemistry and make a winning double act. It also means that the stakes are raised, as once the plot kicks into gear and Dad gets kidnapped, Frank Jr is no longer simply just delivering a package for money, but rather endeavouring to save his fathers life. That plot is masterminded by the mysterious and manipulative Anna (Loan Chabanol) and inspired  somewhat tenuously  by The Three Musketeers. Carried out by her beautiful cohorts, it's filled with twists and turns, and builds to a far-fetched but surprisingly satisfying conclusion. But The Transporter is less about plot and plausibility and more about cars and action, and director Camille Delamarre - who previously helmed Brick Mansions and edited Taken 2 and The Transporter 3 - delivers on both fronts. Franks beloved Audi gets several spectacular run-outs, the best of which takes place in an airport terminal. And the fights are first-class, with Frank Jr preferring to let his fists rather than firearms do the talking, and Skrein rising to the challenge. Theres one particularly impressive sequence that finds Frank taking out a gang of hoods in an enclosed space using only a piece of rope, while the way in which he defeats yet more henchmen using a bunch of drawers  yes drawers  is Jackie Chan-good and has to be seen to be believed. Its not all positive however. Theres some clunky dialogue, a few holes in the plot and the odd bad performance - most notably from a couple of the female Musketeers.' Characters also rarely behave in a believable manner, with a bad-guy getting a lap-dance mid-crisis, and one of the female leads indulging in a threesome mere moments after a bullet has been removed from her belly. Also, based on the amount of times he gets kidnapped in the film, Franks Sr must have been a really bad spy. But its a fun-ride, with Skrein effortlessly slipping into Martins immaculately tailored suits and proving that theres most definitely life-after-Statham in The Transporter universe. Pros Fun plotLikeable central pairingFight scene with drawers Cons Dodgy dialogueDodgy performances Producer Luc Besson is hoping that this reboot will be the first entry in a new trilogy, and he might just get his way. The new movie fills in some blanks about the character, builds on the mythology, and gives Frank a likeable partner-in-crime in the shape of his wise-cracking Dad. The result is a film thats as good as its predecessors, and suggests that Refueled isnt the last that well see of this particular incarnation of the Transporter.", "date": "Sept. 2, 2015,"}
