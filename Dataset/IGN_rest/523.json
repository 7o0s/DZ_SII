Thats the pedigree that Vampire: The Masquerade  Swansong tries to live up to, but it struggles to piece its own identity as a detective RPG together until the very end. Its rich with decisions that should feel meaningful in theory, but its emotional moments exist in service to a broader story with no clue what to do with them. Meanwhile, its many obtuse puzzles are often too clumsily explained. With all of that working against it, youd be mortally forgiven for walking out of Swansongs dark, hazy alcove before its final embrace.Things kick off as you step into a fancy pair of vampire shoes and head on down to the Camarilla, an upscale vampire court seated in the heart of Boston. Its always a treat when you get to play the clear villain of a story... but that sadly isnt the case here. Instead, Swansong quickly positions you as the downtrodden, misunderstood hero of its grimdark underworld. Its villains are a generic group of heavily armed religious fanatics in police uniforms that unironically label themselves the Second Inquisition. And if that wasnt enough to make your eyes roll, its headed by Stanford, a guy whose monologues are so predictable and one-sided that he fails to be seen as anything other than a cheesy cartoon villain. In virtually every scene he shows up in, he spouts some euphemism about ending the vampire reign forever, and then he begins speaking Latin until he gets dramatically ferried off-screen. Hold on, I thought the whole titular Masquerade was about hiding the existence of vampires from the public for this exact reason? If he were a better villain, hed tweet about them.If you dont already have an emotional investment in Vampire: The Masquerades world, Swansong does very little to pull you in. From the first scene, youre barraged with jargon-rich dialogue spoken between characters who already know whats going on  and who already have a history with one another  but dont know you. None of the three playable characters  Leysha, Emem, or Galeb  really felt like an in for me, though I did enjoy Galebs general badassery. Hes the Camarillas point man (if youre familiar with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt, Galeb is the equivalent to that games Ventrue Enforcer class). Still, he isnt all that relatable, and for a good chunk of time, most of the conversations feel like walking into a party where everyone talks to each other but no one talks to you. All three characters have their own unique backstory related to where they sit on the Camarillas hierarchy, and at least theyre each decently voice-acted, but its still jarring to be dropped directly into each of their stories at full speed ahead without establishing the stakes of the vampire world that are so quickly threatened by the Second Inquisition.Swansong does very little to pull you in.As a result, any emotional connection to be had with the cast of vampires only begins to form in the last quarter of Swansongs 20-hour story  well after youve already made most of the decisions that would determine each characters fate. Worldbuilding is certainly helped along by the lore-rich codex, if you take the time to read it, but even after spending significant time gaining an understanding of the vampire underworld the first few legs of the story are still rather uninspired and uninteresting until youve had sufficient time to shape it around your choices.Theres no shortage of supernatural violence in Vampire: The Masquerade  Swansong, but not in the way youd normally expect for an RPG. Theres no combat here whatsoever, just cutscenes where combat takes place in scripted displays of vampiric fighting prowess. This isnt a death knell by any means, since the best RPGs can get by without the need for constant action. Unfortunately, this is far from the best. Despite the lack of fighting, you still need to sate your characters bestial thirst  more specifically, you need to maintain their Discipline bar, which is like a mana bar that powers vampire abilities. To do this you have to periodically sneak one of several designated humans into private spaces and suck as much blood as you can without killing them, which is yawn-inducingly simple to do. If you do end up killing a mortal by deliberately drinking from them two times, the Suspicion gauge shared by each of your three characters goes up, which can gradually incur skill penalties until you bring it back down again by collecting loose pieces of intel that your NPC vampire comrades seem to have a knack for leaving around everywhere. You must suck as much blood as you can without killing a victim, which is yawn-inducingly simple to do.Its almost always worth feeding on each human at least once to replenish your Discipline, since thats what grants the ability to dominate tense conversations, reveal hidden objects, or even teleport to distant hidden locations, depending on who youre playing as. Likewise, as your Discipline pool goes down, your Hunger goes up, gradually making you less capable during tense encounters.Aside from the times you do get to use your vampire powers, most of your time in Swansong is spent doing the same mundane things that any regular human couldve done. You begin each mission with a limited pool of Willpower points to spend hacking computers, picking locks, and displaying your flair for rhetoric while discussing the finer points of human blood. This would be fine enough if the skill point system were less punishing, but an unbalanced and unclear skill check system dominates dialogue and confrontations. For instance, in certain cases a critical conversation can still result in failure even after youve spent enough precious Willpower points that they display as having 100% chance of success in the menu. Thats not what 100% means!Swansong can easily slow to a halt if you fail enough interactions.Fail states dont boot you to a game over screen, but they can cost you experience points that you would have been able to allocate in the following mission. They also tend to change the direction of the overarching story, supposedly making later encounters more challenging. And because Willpower-restoring items are so few and far between, Swansong can easily slow to a halt if you fail enough interactions, which can happen if you choose to allocate your experience points to the wrong skills before each level. Thats a big problem, since you cant change or re-specialize your skills once you find yourself stuck in front of a locked skill check unless youre willing to restart the level from scratch. Making matters worse, Swansongs maps are so inconsistently designed that its functionally impossible to know which skills will or wont be useful before you start. Its a crap shoot.Its good that theres always at least one solution to move the story forward thats available to all characters on each map, but the most basic possible solution usually involves solving a puzzle, which might be more trouble than its worth. Despite charming my feet off for the first several levels, especially in the Jefferson Library and in Jason Moores apartment, the puzzle-solving detective work that seemed so appealing at first glance quickly lost its luster once I realized that the story itself wasnt ultimately interesting enough to compel me forward. Many of these riddles, which required several layers of deductive reasoning to solve, didnt fit in that well with the themes of the story itself and thus felt like padding rather than interesting contextual challenges. That meant that when a puzzle had especially inconspicuous clues, unrelated to anything the characters had been talking about, the solutions could feel out of left field even if they werent entirely illogical. Many of them give you little to work from and often forced me to run around in circles before I finally managed to piece them together. Theyre not inherently bad, but it simply doesnt gel with the pace of the storytelling.Puzzle solutions could feel out of left field even if they weren't entirely illogical.At least each of these reasonably spacious albeit contained environments look exceptionally good when played on Max settings. Lighting and fog effects look especially sleek and the art direction is generally punchy, giving a distinct identity to each location. The Camarilla itself is especially cool to explore, layered with contrasting black marble and sharp red hues that evoke a sense of being in an otherworldly but classy space.You might get too used to staring at some of Swansongs decorations for a longer time than youd have hoped, though. As I said earlier, its puzzles require a high level of deductive reasoning, which is just fine, but a few of them do get a little too esoteric for their own good. For instance, one puzzle requires you to pay very close attention to the direction a certain mythical king is pointing his arms, but you wont know that without doing some serious guesswork  especially since the same clues are placed immediately next to a completely different puzzle. One of the later puzzles requires you to trace your characters missing daughter through a military complex, but youll need to translate a single piece of well-hidden information through several layers of logical deduction  finding a code on a printed sheet, figuring out what thats supposed to open, finding another code, and so forth  before you can find the final solution and move forward once and for all. This type of puzzle solving can work in the right circumstances, but here its in conflict with the already dreadfully slow pacing set by Swansongs slow-burn story. I love to compare its style of storytelling to Disco Elysium, which arguably worked so well because you got to explore the protagonists inner monologue as he himself stumbled through the problem-solving process. However, such a level of self-awareness just doesnt exist in Vampire: The Masquerade  Swansong. Likewise, it often assumes youre paying close attention to its long stretches of mind-numbingly dull dialogue. This is where Swansong often hides clues in plain sight, but since I generally didnt know what to look for until I was already in front of a given puzzle, these long dialogue scenes (which were unskippable) ended up feeling more like a ploy to pad out Swansongs length than anything else. Vampire: The Masquerade  Swansong constantly threatens to be a competent detective RPG, and it mightve succeeded if not for the fact that it tirelessly gets in its own way. Its premise is interesting, but its heroes and villains are bland, and as a result the lukewarm story takes far too long to rev up to its maximum potential. By the time you finally become decently invested in its three playable characters and their individual quests for survival in the politically-charged vampire underworld, Swansong has already reached its finale. It might fare better on a second playthrough, since even its most brutally obtuse puzzles are only difficult to bypass once and youll have some idea of which skills you should specialize in on a given level; then its all about getting to see those alternative paths that you couldve taken the first time around. But it takes such a level of patience to get there in the first place that it might just be too much to ask from any mere mortal.", "date": "May 18, 2022,"}
