Episode 3 succeeds in adding more context and meaning to Michonne and her emotions, but its slow beginning and heavy-handed approach to its themes left me feeling distant from her and disengaged with her story. Michonnes best moments are with her companion Sams two younger brothers, James and Alex. I watched her solemnly teach the older one how to load a gun and tell him it was okay to be scared, while I had her avoid telling the youngest about a devastating death. In both of her short talks with them, the same dialogue option pops up: Ill protect you. Its clear that the boys are stand-ins for her lost daughters  the children she can protect this time  and her scenes with them were poignant without feeling forced or overdone. Unfortunately, those scenes are bookended by slow, overly dialogue-heavy exposition. As is the case with all of The Walking Dead: Michonne, Episode 3 still gives me no reason to care about any of the other characters. Sure, the situation isnt ideal, and lots of people keep dying in vain, but watching a funeral unfold is just not that effective at inspiring sadness when I didnt feel I knew the person who died or their loved ones. Likewise, a woman I know almost nothing about telling Michonne that theyre a lot alike means very little, which renders the first half of the episode mostly moot. Once the action unfolds, its definitely exciting; without spoiling anything, theres heavy tension and ridiculous carnage, complete with an important and emotional reveal. However, its main fight lacks the excellent fight choreography that made the first two episodes especially engaging. Instead, one of the most intense scenes echoes the first episodes opening, but its almost a little too direct. It feels like the episode is working incredibly hard to drive the series themes home, when a lot of it would probably have been better left unsaid. Pros Emotional revealTension Cons Heavy-handedBland fight choreographyBoring exposition After two episodes, The Walking Dead: Michonne successfully developed its main character at the expense of the rest of its cast. In Episode 3, the trade-off doesnt feel quite worth it  its so concerned with drawing explicit connections and tying every thread together that it isnt that satisfying as an ending. A critical reveal redeems it somewhat, but once the episode begins to over explain that, too, the impact sadly fades.", "date": "April 27, 2016"}
