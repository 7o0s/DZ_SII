Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War attempts to create a Civilization-like 4X game against that backdrop, but cant seem to get away from the fact that war is really all there is to do in the 40K universe. Luckily, it does war pretty well. Gladius puts you in command of one of four distinct factions: the elite Space Marines, the savage Orks, the creepy Necrons, and the dutiful troopers Im told Im supposed to call the Astra Militarum now, even though to me theyll always be the Imperial Guard. Each has a unique and expansive unit roster that covers a lot of the bases from the tabletop, with everything from Space Marine Dreadnoughts to Necron Doomsday Arks. Almost every unit has a clear, straightforward combat role that can be played off of others to create potent combos. Gladius really is a terrific wargame.Turn by turn, marching a column of Space Marines supported by deadly heroes and tough-as-nails tanks feels great. Its a shining refinement of the one-unit-per-tile combat introduced to the two most recent Civ games, and it fits 40K really well. Deciding how to prioritize targets, flex my line to keep wounded units out of the line of fire, and set up vicious artillery barrages and flanking maneuvers almost always satisfied my appetite for precisely-orchestrated obliteration. Gladius really is a terrific wargame. EXTERMINATE, EXTERMINATE, EXTERMINATE, & EXTERMINATE The caveat here is that its not necessarily a terrific 4X. As your armies march out to claim victory youll also be claiming tiles for your cities, filling them with resource- and unit-generating buildings, and researching technologies from a semi-linear list to unlock bonuses and new units. Its all competent and functional, but I usually found that it boiled down to seeing which resource I was running low on, claiming a tile with a bonus to that resource, and building a production building there so I wouldnt have to worry about it for a while. Its very reactive, as opposed to encouraging long-term planning. Each faction also has a variety of unique mechanics that sometimes felt thematic and fun, but other times fell a little bit flat. Space Marines, for instance, can only ever build one city and must secure strategic resources around the map by placing smaller, less defensible outposts that cant produce units or other structures. The Necrons can only found cities on buried Necron Tombs scattered sparsely across Gladius Prime and use ore instead of food as their upkeep resource. Some work better than others, though. The Orks WAAAGH, for instance, gives up to a 25% damage bonus when your Influence resource is high. But since Orks generate Influence every time they do damage and dont have much to spend it on, I found that I pretty much kept it maxed out with no challenge or difficult decision-making from the midgame onward. Units look great, though I couldn't customize the color scheme of my Space Marines.The units look great, though I was a bit disappointed I couldnt fully customize the color scheme of my Space Marines to match a specific chapter. Its also very satisfying to see a gothic imperial fortress or sprawling Ork scrapyard sprawl across the map as you acquire new tiles and fill them with structures to fuel the war machine. The terrain isnt as fun to look at, though. Even though a new sector of Gladius Prime is generated for each campaign, they all seemed a bit samey in terms of their color palette and general topography. Its also hard to tell sometimes, even if you zoom way in, where high ground areas start and end, which can be frustrating when a movement order ends up sending a unit on a long detour to skirt a cliff, or a ranged attacker cant get line of sight to the target and its not entirely clear why. LESS TALKA, MORE DAKKA Theres also no diplomacy to speak of  which, again, is kind of a given with the theme. You can set specific factions to locked teams in custom games if you want to fight a united front of Imperial Guard and Space Marines, but there is no trade or negotiation of any kind once you hit Go. Ultimately, I didnt find that this bothered me much. The constant state of conflict between all factions actually led to some of my favorite, most intense encounters, like when I spotted a Space Marine army coming from the north and pulled my Orks back so the oncoming force would smash into the Necron front Id been chipping away at, letting my enemies do my work for me. Glorious three- or four-way bloodbaths the likes of which youd rarely see in other 4X games arent uncommon. When the shells arent flying, you can pursue victory through a quest system that gives each faction a unique storyline to pursue on Gladius Prime. For the most part, theyre well-written and held my attention with the promise of answers to the mysteries surrounding the harsh world. Actually completing the quests often boiled down to sending a specific hero to stand on a certain tile or defeating an event-spawned neutral army, which wasnt always terribly interesting. But the final battles that cap off each questline were some of the most fun I had as I was forced to defend against many waves of powerful attackers with my by then grizzled, veteran army. While it didnt wow me as a competitor to Endless Legend or Civ 6 in the 4X race, theres a lot of action-saturated, tactically-driven fun to be had when you look at Gladius - Relics of war for what it truly is: a really well-done, turn-based 40K wargame. Its one of the best turn-based 40K games Ive played through that lens. All the other mechanics exist purely as adequate supports for throwing another wave of Boyz into the meat grinder for the glory of Gork and/or Mork. Maybe thats thematically appropriate in the grim darkness of the far future, but if Gladius wants to call itself 4X and not just cut straight to the chase, it could have made those elements more interesting to justify the label.", "date": "July 9, 2018,"}
