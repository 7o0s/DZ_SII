New developer Sumo Digital created an enormous puzzle-platformer with equally enormous scope for creation and an enjoyable single-player experience; however, it is undermined by unimaginative co-op and a number of game-breaking bugs. First things first: for anybody worried that the absence of original LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule might mean an absence of the series signature charm, fear not. From its title sequence - narrated by the reliably delightful Stephen Fry - onward, LittleBigPlanet 3s style is a wonderful brew of humor and effervescence, and its central message of play, create, share is thankfully continued, in both tone and structure. There is more emphasis on story this time around, though. All the supporting characters in LittleBigPlanet 3 are now voiced, and cutscenes tell of an animated attack on the magnificent moon of wonder planet called Bunkam that has sucked away its inhabitants creativity. While I was initially wary that more traditional video game storytelling might feel out of place in a world that has always delighted in the surreal, I found LittleBigPlanets simple narrative unobtrusive and fun, and its characters idiosyncratically weird. Individual story levels in LittleBigPlanets seven- to eight-hour Adventure mode are beautifully designed. Where LittleBigPlanet 2s aesthetic is all neon and electricity, the look this time around has been modeled after the stage and screen. Levels take place in abstract renditions of 50s monster movie sets and ballet performances, marionette theaters and workshops, all with that familiar LittleBigPlanet overlay of an artsy design magazine and a killer soundtrack. The three new story-mode hubs  explorable, sprawling worlds in their own right  are just as gorgeous; the Eastern European-Christmas-themed Ziggurat Hub is one of the more romantic places Ive ever visited in a video game. Although LittleBigPlanet 3 still occasionally suffers from the same floaty controls bucking up against some level designs that demand very precise platforming, these story levels  and optional ,hallenge levels  are imaginative enough that I could (mostly) forgive the issue. Its thanks to a handful of great new additions that gameplay is more frenetic than in the past two games; the Portal-esque Velociporter, for example, can send Sackboy from the background to the foreground in a blink; while new powerups such as Boost Boots and the teleporting Blink Ball gun open up new ways to bounce across the screen. LittleBigPlanet 3s cuddly new characters add a unique dynamic to gameplay, although its disappointing - and surprising, considering the pre-launch marketing - how little they are actually used. While Swoop (who can fly and grab), Oddsock (who can run fast and bounce off walls) and Toggle (who can switch between being heavy and light) each get to headline a level upon introduction, they are only intermittently used elsewhere in Adventure mode. Seeing how much fun playing as these characters is, this feels like a missed opportunity. Limited use of the broader cast extends to cooperative play, as LittleBigPlanet 3 curiously insists you and your co-op partner(s) have to play as the the same character in individual levels. I found only one instance where this was not that case, and that particular level was so cleverly orchestrated, utilizing all skillsets in a frantic race against the clock, I am dumbfounded there werent more like it. Even more confusing is why that standout level would be hidden away, where many people might miss it altogether. But the most damning aspect of Adventure mode, and LittleBigPlanet 3 as a whole, is the number of bugs I encountered while playing it. Across two PlayStation 4 systems, my (already patched) game encountered frequent frame rate stuttering, crashed multiple times and glitched out so I couldnt respawn after dying. I fell through levels into floaty purgatory twice, and some of the plentiful loading screens became stuck. Twice during a boss chase, my co-op partner and I were left stranded after spawning mid-way through the level, because the level hadnt reset itself. Again, this is with the zero-day patch installed. Fortunately, perhaps because it operates at a much slower pace, I had no such issues with LittleBigPlanet 3s Creation Mode. Here, Sumo Digital has stood on the shoulders of giants, leaving Media Molecules (relatively) accessible, yet hefty LittleBigPlanet 2 toolkit intact, and adding a handful of significant upgrades that promises greater sophistication in level-building. You can now create in 16 layers. Weaned on LittleBigPlanet 2s comparably simple three layers, I found this initially daunting and awkward, but after a few hours of playing in level creator I got the gist  if not the hang of  the new depth of field. Its telling that despite hours worth of mortifyingly terrible attempts at creating a decent-looking level with proper depth, I want to go back and play with it some more. Elsewhere, the Blaster Handle, which allows you to imagine your own power ups, has enormous potential, as does the quietly revelatory Popit Powerup. This tool is responsible for LittleBigPlanet 3s Popit Academy: 12 platforming levels designed to teach you Creation Mode basics. These levels essentially blur the line between ,reate and play by tasking you to solve puzzles using your creation toolkit. They are fun and cleverly designed  in fact, I enjoyed a handful of them more than some of the Adventure mode levels  and suggest a paradigm shift for how we could play user-generated levels moving forward. Such additions promise to open up LittleBigPlanets world significantly, and as we know from the nine million-plus user-generated levels included from previous games on the disc (thats an impressive amount of DLC), there will be no shortage of people to take advantage of them. Its exciting to watch as a new LittleBigPlanet game is let loose into the wild, and wonder how it might be pulled apart, put back together, and blown up in the future. Pros Gorgeous, imaginative worldsBeefed up creation toolkitGreat new power ups Cons Curiously limited co-opGame-breaking bugs LittleBigPlanet 3 is an enormous - and, at times, unruly - game. Its Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but its let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4. While a little daunting for newcomers, its supersized creation tookit has enormous potential for creating deep and diverse play, and its here where LittleBigPlanet 3 justifies its existence. [Editor's note - a Day One patch for LittleBigPlanet 3 may resolve some of the bug issues, but we have gone over the upcoming list of fixes and there weren't enough pertinent to our experience to justify changing the score].", "date": "Nov. 18, 2014,"}
