Doom Eternal offers that power fantasy in spades but is always ready to check your first-person-shooting ego around the next corner with a bigger, faster, nastier demon from Hell. This evolved followup takes everything good about the fast and punchy 2016 reboot and proves it wasnt a fluke. In fact, its largely ruined the first game for me in retrospect because the addition of Eternals mid-air dashes make the last thrillride of a game feel like wading through waist-high molasses by comparison. Even multiplayers been innovated on, with 2016s forgettable vanilla DeathMatch replaced by Eternals inventive 2v1, Demons-vs.-Slayer Battlemode. The full package is expertly crafted from both a design and technical perspective. So far Ive done in-depth reviews of both the single-player and multiplayer modes. First, heres what I said about the campaign: Doom Eternal Single-Player Campaign Review Simply put, Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooter campaigns Ive played in years. As the second game of its kind its lost some of its novelty but none of the joy of its intense and furious combat style. This excellent refinement of the already outstanding 2016 reboot makes you an unspoken deal: if you can keep up with it, it will keep up with you. It continually teaches you how to play faster, smarter, and more efficiently, with lots of options at every step of the way to tailor fights to your prefered slaying style, and its an absolute blast along the way. And heres my Verdict on multiplayer: Doom Eternal Battlemode Multiplayer Review A quick Battlemode walkthrough intro and bare-bones tutorials for each playable demon give you a quick look at what each bad guy can do in your hands, but the fun of Battlemode is getting out there and figuring out how to best put each Demons abilities to work. Doom Eternal is a game that demands and respects player skill, and while Battlemode doesnt allow you to put yours to the ultimate test on a traditional level playing field, it is nevertheless a clever mode thats a lot of fun if youre willing to give it a try and get to know its nuances. Simply put, Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooter campaigns Ive played in years. As the second game of its kind its lost some of its novelty but none of the joy of its intense and furious combat style. This excellent refinement of the already outstanding 2016 reboot makes you an unspoken deal: if you can keep up with it, it will keep up with you.
