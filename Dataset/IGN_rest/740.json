The whole of Batgirl: A Matter of Family is spent roaming one of Gotham Citys seemingly dozens of creepy abandoned amusement parks on another dark and stormy night that happened back when The Joker was still alive and Barbara Gordon still wore a cape and mask. Its hard not to be disappointed that this is all thats here, because while Batgirls debut is reasonably well done, its so self-contained and limited that if you blink youll miss it. As with all the other playable characters in the Arkham games, Batgirl fights very much like her mentor, except with fewer gadgets at her disposal. Shes Batman-lite, effectively. She has unique combat animations which are every bit as cool as the other Arkham characters, and her remote-hacking tool can work from further away than Batmans (to represent Barbara Gordons superhacker skills), and is frequently used to activate distractions and traps before diving into combat. Otherwise combat is business as usual. The first moments are tightly linear, as Batgirl and Robin (Tim Drake, not Jason Todd - a missed opportunity for a pre-Arkham Asylum prequel to show him in his sidekick days) punch thugs in a handful of sidekick fights and make awkward small talk that hints at their future romance. Theyre not awkwardly charming, just awkward: I want to tell you something oh, nevermind. Then the map opens up to a small open-world hub similar to the Ace Chemicals section of Arkham Knight, with multiple hostages you can rescue in any order. That freedom isnt exactly meaningful, but it does allow Batgirl to spread her wings and glide a bit. A Matter of Family puts a few decent spins on traditional Arkham tasks, such as bombs with ticking timers and the ability to knock out the lights to blind armed goons. Theres a heavy emphasis on Batgirls hacking tool, which makes her predator fights feel at least slightly distinct  she cant initiate a Fear Takedown without first scaring thugs with an activated trap or trick. There are some notably great-looking scenes, such as rescuing hostages from a fast-moving ferris wheel in a moderately tough Predator mode battle, and the sea-monster-themed areas of the park are distinctive. Plus, we get to see The Joker in the flesh, and Harley Quinn in her original Batman: Animated Series costume. Jokers motivations for going after Batmans sidekicks makes demented sense, which at least gives this story some interesting context. On the other hand, the final fight is a simple brawl with Joker, Harley, and their gang with a QTE finisher, which doesnt feel appropriate for the Clown Prince of Crimes MO or anything special gameplay-wise. Whats really disappointing is that were given virtually no means of enjoying Batgirl after the short campaign is completed. There are things that appear to be collectables scattered around the amusement park, like balloons you can pop with Batarangs and Joker-themed Jack-in-the-boxes, but its a small area, so finding them isnt much of a challenge even if youre into collectathons. Worse, theres no new AR challenge map where you can play as Batgirl, which means her great-looking character model is trapped in this single piece of story content. Considering Arkham Knight is fairly stingy in the challenge map department, thats another big missed opportunity. Pros Decent Joker storyTheme park settingVariations on fights Cons Super shortNo replay value Batgirl: A Matter of Family has a decent story, an impressive setting, and some respectable brawls and Predator fights, but its all so disappointingly brief and self-contained. Theres nothing meaningful to do after this roughly one-hour story chunk is complete except to roam the small area beating on respawning thugs for no reason. Theres just not enough here to get excited about.", "date": "July 15, 2015,"}
