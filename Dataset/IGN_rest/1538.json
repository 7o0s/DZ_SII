When I race fast cars around tracks, I like to do so sideways and with pumping Japanese techno screaming into my ears. Ridge Racer 3D was a highlight of an otherwise very uninspiring launch line-up for the 3DS, and following series tradition, Ridge Racer on Vita should have been a shiny show-pony for the new console's technical abilities. What it is, though, is a cut-price rush-job that struggles to offer the content and value of a demo. The fundamentals of Ridge Racer are there  the drift-heavy handling model, looping courses designed for speed and spectacle, the cool soundtrack and slick presentation  but there's barely any game in here, just a framework. Ridge Racer Vita is essentially the online mode of a racing game, but without any of the single-player content, tracks or cars to populate it. For the first hour I was convinced that I must have failed to notice a menu somewhere hiding all the stuff that's missing, but it turns out that the game really is as bare-bones as it looks. There are three tracks, and five cars that are identical in all but appearance and can be gradually upgraded over time. There are three more tracks and five more cars downloadable as DLC by redeeming the code found inside the box, but why they aren't on the cart in the first place is a complete mystery. Even with these additions, the selection is paltry. Ridge Racer Vita Trailer There is precious little structure to Ridge Racer Vita  all of the challenges, career modes, rewards and extras that turn a series of races into a player experience are absent. When you start the game, you choose one of four racing teams, and from then on your progress is tied to that team forever. Your racing achievements contribute to the team's overall worldwide standing, and you can browse long lists of player rankings in slickly-presented menus. It's not a terrible idea in itself, this social racing framework, but there's nothing that feeds into it. There aren't any rewards for dominant teams, and the factions are so big and impersonal that there's no sense of attachment or loyalty. There's no story, background or description attached to any of them, nor anything to foster a rivalry. Each day you can receive a ~team vision~ that gives you a goal for the day  earn lots of credits, focus on beating members of a specific other team, that kind of thing  but there doesn't seem to be any point in following them. Your choices, if you want to have a race rather than just looking at screens of team and player rankings that mean pretty much nothing, come down to an online race against others or an offline race by yourself or against some ghost data. There are no tournament options anywhere, no leagues, no unlock structure  just three tracks, some cars, and a sparse community of people to race against. On those same three tracks. Over and over and over again, for no discernible purpose. One of the weirdest aspects of Ridge Racer Vita's online racing is that you level up as you go, which ups your car's max speed  so you have no chance of winning against anyone who's a higher level than you. This makes racing online a very dispiriting experience. There is an upgrade system that lets you spend your credits on extra nitrous slots and other improvements for your vehicle, but this only serves to widen the gap between players  earning enough credits to unlock significant upgrades takes a minimum of four or five races. With so few tracks, that's a LOT of repetition. Ridge Racer Vita Off-Screen Gameplay There is one thing I rather like about Ridge Racer on Vita: during saved replays, you can use the touchpad on the back of the Vita to warp the music, soundtracking huge jumps or looping skids with dramatic bass drops. This is quite easily my favourite thing about the game, which probably tells you all you need to know. The core Ridge Racer gameplay is present and correct here  it's not ugly or technically broken. But a racing game is more than just a driving model: it needs a variety of tracks, it needs a reward structure that pushes you on through hour after hour of races, it needs progression and customisation and personality. Ridge Racer on Vita has none of these things. It's racing in a vacuum, barely more than a tech demo, wrapped up in an online-reliant social framework that's fundamentally flawed on several levels. CLOSING COMMENTS Ridge Racer on Vita is a baffling proposition: a racing game with barely any content. It might be cheap, but its inexcusably lazy. You run out of things to do within an hour or two, and after any longer, the prospect of racing any of the three tracks on the cart ever again is enough to make you feel slightly sick. Its social online structure is misguided and shallow, meaning that racing against others is neither easy nor fun, and theres a total absence of a single-player mode. This is a rare black mark against the Ridge Racer name.
