Its by no means a game to get if you want to show off your new hardware, but despite its last-gen looks Powerstar Golfs RPG-like progression system and asynchronous multiplayer present an addictive and mostly fun way to spoil a good virtual walk. Pixar Perfect While its swing timer-based gameplay has clearly been borrowed from the Everybodys Golf (AKA Hot Shots Golf) series, Powerstar Golf forgoes the super-deformed anime art style of Sonys franchise in favour of a more Pixar-like aesthetic. Ex-astronaut Frank even resembles a reskinned Mr. Incredible, which is fitting because all of the characters possess their own unique super power. These powers are limited and must be replenished via the in-game store (using either in-game credits or real-world currency), and range from temporary boosts to your shot distance or slowing down the swing timer, to more creative perks such as Henry the illusionists magic ball that splits into five balls after youve hit it. These powers never feel essential to your progress, but theyre fun to use and can be handy when attempting a risky approach. Unfortunately the course design doesnt really match the over-the-top nature of Powerstars player roster. While each of the four courses are aesthetically pleasing enough - one is set in and around Japanese castles and cherry blossom trees, another appears to be based off the Rocky Mountains - the actual holes themselves are for the most part fairly standard. They still present plenty of challenge with varying topography and typical traps like water hazards and bunkers, but perhaps introducing some more fantastical elements in the vein of Nintendos Mario Golf series would have made each set of 18 holes a bit more memorable. I also found that the ambient visual effects would occasionally interfere with my shot and cause frustration, specifically when a dust particle or the shadow of a moving monorail would pass across the screen behind the swing timer and distract my eyes while I was trying to time my three button presses. Again, its rare that this happens, but annoying all the same. Role-Playing Golf What really prevents Powerstar Golf from being a forgettable golf experience is the smartly implemented experience and upgrade system that hooked me like a crooked 3-iron. XP is earned from almost every action you perform on the course, and youre constantly bombarded with on-the-spot challenges to unlock chunky XP bonuses, such achieving par or better on three consecutive holes or landing an approach shot within a short distance to the pin. As you level up and earn more prize money, you can buy booster perks for you and your caddie, with each of them applying modifiers such as hook and slice reduction or the ability to skim a ball across a surface of water. You can also buy gear packs in order to gain new clubs, clothes and balls, although its a little strange that the content of each gear pack is randomised so you dont really know what youre going to get until after youve already paid for it (admittedly a system that will be familiar for fans of Pokemon and the like). Every stroke you play on each hole is measured against record-holders from around the world, and in a nice touch the Xbox One will automatically record video of your shot should you set a new record yourself. But where the Xbox Live user data really comes into play is via the Rivals mode, an asynchronous multiplayer mode that lets you play rounds of golf against the recordings of other players best outings on each hole. Instead of playing Everybodys Golf, youre essentially playing against everybody elses golf. Rivals mode is kind of like a substantially less dynamic version of Forza 5s Driveatar tech - essentially the golfing equivalent of Mario Kart ghost racing - but nonetheless presents what will potentially be a much stiffer challenge as real-world players keep leveling up and learning each hole, and particularly since the AI opponents are prone to dubious shot selection at times. As a side bonus, if your golfer ghosts beats another player, you can essentially earn XP even when youre not actually playing. Powerstar Golf manages to successfully marry an old-school arcade golf experience with some decidedly new-school ideas. The lack of proper online multiplayer is a bit of a blow, but the Rivals mode has the potential to provide an ongoing challenge after youve scooped up all of the career medals. Its not a complete hole in (Xbox) One for golf fans, but its a good deal of fun if you desperately want to hit the links on your new machine.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2013,"}
