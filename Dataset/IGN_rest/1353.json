These 2701 A.D. humans think keys were fashion accessories called smurgs that young people wore in their hair. Playing as the Time Traveler character, I visited the dinosaur exhibit, where I voluntarily got sprayed with dinosaur scent. Now you smell like a stinky old dinosaur! the speaker box claimed. I then hopped back in the time machine and warped to the prehistoric past, stinking like awho knows what and approached a carnivorous dinosaur, who instantly wanted to mate. Fortunately, he (she?) couldnt quite get to me because of the tight cave area he was in, so he just stood there, licking his chops, with a large ledge looming above. Next, I switched to the Hillbilly, another of my partys three adventurers, and teleported to the past to join the Time Traveler. (Stick with me here. This is worth it, I promise.) I brought the Hillbilly to the ledge above the smitten dinosaur, where caveman Thog was busy trying to invent the wheel. All he had so far, though, was a square rock. I pushed the block off the ledge and onto the dinosaurs head, killing it. Then, back in the present day, my third avatar, The Twins, went to the spot of the dinos demise, bucket in hand, and scooped up some of the oil that the ancient carnivores corpse had turned into. What's a desert island doing in the middle of a cave? Why the heck did I do all this? Because I needed the oil to fuel the museums working combustion engine that was powering the elevator  which I rode up to grab a wheel that I had to send back through time in order to distract Thog  the cave man ancestor of the Time Travelers archenemy in the future. Dropping another square wheel on his head killed him and thus eliminated his entire family line, completing future-dwelling Time Travelers jealousy-fueled quest to become the museums Greatest Employee of All Time. Got all that? In The Caves twisted, dark, and often hilarious logic, puzzles take strange turns. Its hardly a surprise given that Ron Gilbert  revered designer of such adventure classics as Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion  is behind this new puzzler. Nods to both are present (Monkey Island fans: look for the New Grog machine early in the game and see if The Hermit on the island reminds you of Herman Toothrot), but The Cave approaches its brain-benders not from a point-and-click interface but rather a side-scrolling platforming one. Like Gilberts past works, puzzles manage to finely walk the line between challenging and frustrating such that I felt smart when I solved them  a laudable design feat thats no doubt much harder than it sounds. Sure, youre likely to get stumped on occasion, but in my experience, taking a break and returning with a fresh mind later led to the solution in short order. The Monk is one of seven characters in The Cave. You'll need to play the game three times to see everyone's story. Meanwhile, the side-scrolling platform gameplay mechanics fit the setting. The mysteries of The Cave  a sentient character that serves as the storys narrator in this depth-plumbing tale of seven peoples dark sides  allow it to take you to such bizarre locations as a London mansion, a desert island, a carnival, and more. But as you switch back and forth between your characters to solve conundrums, youll have to do an endless amount of jumping to navigate the game world, and unfortunately the jumping controls are a bit wonky. It feels floaty on purpose, and the sensitivity is off enough that youll often fall or cling to a ledge and have to sit through a two-second animation every single time you miss making a clean jump. Furthermore, the framerate suffers frequent, noticeable choppiness throughout the entire campaign  usually when the camera pans to a new area and has to load it in for the first time. Its rather unexpected for a slow-paced adventure game, and while its not so bad that it will ruin your experience, it is a distraction. Intriguingly, The Cave offers seven playable characters, each with their own backstories and unique puzzle areas. And because you must lock-in three of them for each play-through, replayability is both built-in and encouraged. How many times youll want to do so, though, depends on how well you tolerate the games aforementioned annoyances. Up to three players -- one per character -- can play cooperatively on the same screen, but it's not of much use considering you're all bound to the same screen. No Toe Jam & Earl-style split-screen view pops up when you venture far enough apart from each other. THE VERDICT Delightfully, The Cave is, in fact, a pure, puzzle-solving adventure game rife with funny lines and chuckle-inducing non sequiturs despite trying to disguise itself as a side-scrolling platformer. It doesnt stay with you the way Gilberts classics did, however. You experience it, you enjoy it, but youre not likely to catch yourself daydreaming about unforgettable sequences in The Cave the way you fondly recall Monkey 1s insult sword-fighting or Monkey 2s endlessly debatable ending. Maybe thats because the story is mostly told through scattered comic-book-style panels or because the only real dialogue comes from The Cave itself and not the seven characters. But being a Ron Gilbert-built adventure game in the modern era, its wholly unique in the market and your game library will be a better place with it included.", "date": "Jan. 22, 2013,"}
