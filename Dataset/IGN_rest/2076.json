Thats not the start of a joke, its an actual level in Murder by Numbers, a charming visual novel/mystery-puzzler thats chock-full of charismatic characters and colorful locations. It may land just shy of reaching the admittedly high bars set by its inspirations, but I still had a great time solving this series of 90s-style whodunnits. Screenshots from Murder by Numbers: Murder by Numbers premise can be quickly summed up as Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney mixed with Picross, and if youre the kind of person who read that and immediately let out a thirsty Ooo, then chances are you can probably just stop reading now and buy this game. It accomplishes that simple brief with flying colors, to the point where I can easily recommend it for either of its parts, let alone the sum of them together. Rise Like a Phoenix You play as Honor, a TV actress unexpectedly thrust into life as a detective, accompanied by an adorable, scan-happy robot named SCOUT. Honor is an excellent protagonist: smart as a whip but a touch too overzealous for her own good. Watching her grow into a more confident person and adapt to an unexpected new profession as she helps solve a series of murders is genuinely rewarding. Meanwhile, the way in which SCOUTs strange story unfurls is a little more hamfisted (it is a robot nonchalantly flying around Hollywood, after all), but their peppy and endearingly naive demeanor brings vital levity to some otherwise heavy scenarios. All of Murder by Numbers is set during the 90s, and developer Mediatonic has done a fantastic job of capturing and then intentionally exaggerating the iconic look and feel of that decade. Neon colors and wild geometric patterns brighten every area you visit, even defining the style of its UI and menus. Be it a TV set, a fancy award show, or just Honors messy apartment, every location backdrop feels distinct and lively  despite actually being conspicuously devoid of any characters who arent taking part in the foreground conversation. Characters are beaming with personality, and most are dressed like they could be walking down a Fashion Week runway that same day. Thankfully, the characters you interact with are also beaming with personality. Most of them  and there are quite a few  are dressed like they could be walking down a Fashion Week runway that same day, and I dont think I saw a single character I didnt love the look of. The character designs, both visually and how the roles they play are weaved into the story of each case to guide you along or throw you off the scent, are top notch. That said, Murder by Numbers does make the somewhat tiring decision to have a majority of the people you interact with be strangely agitating. I know youre investigating a murder, but so many of your conversations will either be angry, impatient, or flippant, often making SCOUTs charming jokes an oasis of optimism in a dessert of negativity. There are certainly pleasant and empowering moments, but like in life, you gotta go through the lows before you make it to the highs. Overcoming lifes lows is a running theme of the overall plot, a story thats more mature than the generally lighthearted Phoenix Wright games. We join Honor at what is essentially the darkest point of her life and watch as she struggles to find her footing again  dealing with a shitty ex-husband, gaining confidence in a new job, and unpacking lots of well-traveled baggage. The smaller stories that make up each of Murder by Numbers four cases follow similar themes, intertwining with Honors journey while being independently entertaining (if somewhat predictable) mysteries to guess at as you interview suspects and gather evidence. While the Phoenix Wright DNA is undeniably clear here, theres certainly a lot less of its actual active crime-solving. The story is more on rails in Murder by Numbers, and your job is mostly to find evidence and show it to the right person to move that train along. Its still fun, but you wont be given those high-stakes opportunities to yell OBJECTION! in the same satisfying way, making most of the big revelations feel like the scripts instead of your own. Grid Lock Instead of cleverly connecting evidence, youll be doing some quite literal puzzle-solving in the form of Picross challenges. SCOUT will occasionally be given the option to scan for clues, which is a fairly uninteresting task that puts an ugly green filter over a locations otherwise lovely backdrop and has you hunt for an arbitrary spot where your cross hair turns red. Its a boring but mercifully short process, and finding something launches you into a Picross puzzle where the real fun begins. Full disclosure: I flippin love Picross, and this is some good Picross. If youre unaware, Picross is a visual puzzle in the same realm as Sudoku  you are given a grid with numbers on each line and have to use those numbers to fill in the grid and reveal an image  in this case, a piece of evidence SCOUT is scanning. That scanning flavor is really just an excuse to shoehorn in these puzzles, but its a cute excuse all the same. Anyone who unironically loved the Sugar Rush theme song from Wreck-It Ralph will likely be obsessed with this soundtrack. While Murder by Numbers is missing a couple of the desirable features Ive come to rely on from developer Jupiters best-in-class Picross S series (small things, like a timer or a way to easily count squares), its the closest competitor that Ive played in terms of polish. It does a decent job of teaching newcomers as well, with plenty of helpful hint systems if youre more interested in the story and want to breeze past the puzzles. However, one area it absolutely surpasses Jupiter is music. The songs here are fantastic and varied enough to keep me listening for a long time  by contrast, I rarely play Jupiters Picross games without unplugging my headphones and listening to Spotify instead. The best way I can describe Murder by Numbers bubbly soundtrack is that anyone who unironically loved the Sugar Rush theme song from Wreck-It Ralph will likely be obsessed. I certainly am. Youll be listening to these songs a lot too, as there are dozens and dozens of puzzles to solve spread across the four cases and beyond  it took me about 15 hours to beat the story, though a few of those were spent doing optional puzzles as well. After an easier introduction, their difficulty stays in roughly the same neighborhood throughout too. Its 10x10 to 15x15 grid size range is the perfect sweet spot for providing puzzles that were big enough to make me think without ever threatening to stop me dead in my tracks when I was eager to continue the story. On the flip side, if I just wanted to solve some Picross puzzles, progressing through the cases unlocks loads of optional ones in the main menu. Id often dip into these when I needed a break from the dialogue, which made for a welcome retreat. However, unlocking them is strangely tied to a score for each case puzzle, which is basically determined by whether or not you use hints. I wish I could revisit specific case puzzles after finishing that case, or see any I may have missed within it, because otherwise unlocking the last of the optional puzzles means annoyingly replaying the entirety of that case. Murder by Numbers successfully blends a Phoenix Wright-style visual novel with a Picross-style puzzle game by making each aspect great in its own right. It may not be the game to dethrone Jupiter from its Picross pedestal, and its somewhat overly linear detective story doesnt quite reach as high as its Ace Attorney inspiration, but that doesnt mean its not a mystery worth solving. Honor and SCOUT are a wonderful duo to watch grow, and their detective adventures are a heartwarming and undoubtedly fun time.", "date": "March 12, 2020"}
