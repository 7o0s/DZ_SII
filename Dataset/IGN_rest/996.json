For me, the fun and satisfaction in those games lay in sessioning a single location and attempting tricks over and over again until I nailed them. It was the tactility of the controls, the physicality of the world, and the incredible gameplay depth that I found most appealing. Skater attempts a very similar trick on iOS (well, iPhone and iPod Touch) and  in a core gameplay sense  very much succeeds. Skaters controls feel like theyre built from the ground up for touch, and are gratifyingly elegant. Youre basically looking down at the board, a pair of shoes perched atop. You push by swiping alongside the board and steer by sliding left or right from the centre of the board. Hold and release  or tap  the tail to ollie. Same for the front to nollie. Do either and swipe left or right in the air for kickflips and heelflips, then tap the board in mid-air to catch it. Hold the tail and swipe to either side for shuvits. Slide your finger down the board to the tail for a manual. Draw left or right in the air above the board to determine body movement frontside or backside. Theyre the building blocks, and from there you can do everything from big spins to laser flips, with a wide variety of grinds and slides on top, largely based on positioning. That backside heelflip beside a ledge, for instance, can result in a nose slide, a rail slide or a grind depending on timing and rotation. Skater has a good selection of tricks given the touch controls. The trick selection isnt comprehensive, of course. There are no grabs whatsoever, which makes sense given you dont have hands and Skater is focused exclusively on street, while other tricks have presumably been left out so as not to clutter the controls. That means no dark slides, no pressure flips and no counter rotations mid-trick. Theres plenty here to play with, and while the controls are still inferior to analogue sticks for these kinds of mechanics, theyre pretty damn good, and the ability to drop a pin and instantly return to a point to re-attempt a run makes the occasional control flubs more than bearable. I can easily pass the time in Skater simply running at a bench or a rail over and over again, trying to hit a particular trick just so. Each location is an authentic recreation of a real-life spot or park too. At the time of review Skater has three parks available to play: Stoner Park in L.A., The Berrics in L.A., and The Woodward Plaza in Pennsylvania. It also has two iconic stair sets  the Carlsbad Gap in California and the stairs at Hollywood High. These last two inclusions really speak to Skaters goal of verisimilitude; theyre tiny areas (bounded by invisible walls), there purely for us to session a legendary spot. Personally Id prefer two more parks, but its not a deal breaker. The way new locations are unlocked, however, almost is. On the plus side, its anchored by a smart system that lets you save runs that are then uploaded to Skaters servers and distributed out as challenges to other players. I love the idea of being able to see what others are doing in the same play space. The problem, however, is that replicating other peoples runs is the only way to unlock additional settings beyond the first park. The actual system isnt too bad - youre given a set of runs to browse through, and can choose which ones to attempt. Want new runs? Refresh the set. Where it falls down is in the number of runs that must be beaten, as they increase exponentially for each location. Oh, you want to unlock The Berrics? You need to beat 50 runs at the Hollywood High stairs. Fifty! On a single set of stairs! It basically sucks all the fun out of skating, and if youre anything like me, youll just do simple trick after simple trick to try and push through it. Even the unlocks that require far fewer runs are a chore, simply because its an artificial impediment to enjoying what Skater does best: freeform technical skating. Unlocking the final park is a pain, but totally worthwhile. A social element is a great idea, it just shouldnt be mandatory. It feels like the developer has panicked at the idea that Skater is too freeform and tried to wedge some structure in there to make it more gamey. I think its unnecessary  especially for a low(ish)-cost mobile game. Let us skate! Let us post our runs if we want to. Let us attempt to beat other players tricks if we want to. Any structure to the gameplay needs to add to the experience, not be a roadblock. Its also worth mentioning that at the time of review, there was a fair bit of repetition in the runs on offer, but that should change as more players hop into the game and start saving tricks. The idea is that theyll be tailored to each players skill level, too. Pros Core mechanicsSkate parksReplayability Cons Unlock system Skater is a great attempt to bring the nuance and skill of technical street skating to iOS. The controls are good, the mechanics and real-life skate spots boast a huge amount of replayability, and the core concept of sharing runs  and hence, your individuality  with the world is a sound one. Its just a shame the social side is implemented with such heavy-handedness.", "date": "Oct. 19, 2014,"}
