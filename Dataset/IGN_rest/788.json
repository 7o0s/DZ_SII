Infinite Crisis is a beautiful, cartoony MOBA that handles the DC Comics characters with care. Unfortunately, despite its great looks, it fails to provide solid game balance, and its just too difficult to access many of its game modes. Infinite Crisis distraught world has beautiful comic book aesthetics. Lore videos, hero introductions, and strong voice acting come together to create a great story. Due to a tear in the multiverse, six universes blend together, which is how there can be multiple Batmans in the pool of available Champions. Each of the Batmans, Wonder Womans, Green Lanterns, and other characters have their own personality, so its fun seeing what they have to say to friends and enemies during in-game banter. As most MOBAs go, theres a standard three-lane map, called Gotham Divided, but what I really like is that Infinite Crisis instead places its focus on Coast City, a two-lane map with a massive jungle. The Champion classes reflect this focus too. There are more jungle-centric Champions that can fight for control of not only their neutral creep camps, but also for the three vitally important Power Relays that give teams bonuses when captured. Its refreshing to see a PC MOBA focus on something other than the three-lane map while maintaining a nice balance between objectives and lane control. While Coast City is fun, there's a lot to be desired from the other four modes. Right now Infinite Crisis is still in its infancy, so it's understandable that the player count is low. To make queue times faster, Coast City is the only open queue, and that's a problem. Sure, queue times are faster, but the other modes can only be played in a custom game which generally requires you to invite a few other players. If you're playing Infinite Crisis alone or don't have many friends on, then you're essentially unable to play the other modes. The solution for these types of issues is usually filling the empty player slots with bots, but that's unfortunately not an option. There are only two bot modes; a 1v1 that isnt the same game type as its online counterpart  which is incredibly annoying  and Coast City. Aside from solving the queue problem, bots are incredibly important for learning the maps, new tactics with a few friends, exploring abilities and combos with new heroes, and then of course for people who just dont want to play online. This may not be an issue one day, but it feels incredibly punishing to early adopters. One thing early adopters wont miss out on is a nice roster. Theres a diverse pool of characters to try with 41 Champions. Infinite Crisis has a weekly rotation of free Champions, and I found it easy to earn credits to buy Champions. The first Champion I bought was Poison Ivy, a character that showed just how Infinite Crisis tries to redefine character roles in MOBAs. Instead of being a straight support with low attack and heavy healing abilities, Ivy is able to hold her own ground  something I found to be true with other characters that'd be typically classified as a support, or a controller in Infinite Crisis. I greatly disliked playing against the assassin role. True to the standard characteristics of the class, assassins are stealthy and deal heavy hits. However, in a game that doesnt have a cheap move speed item, the crazy assassin blinks and movement abilities feel like a big problem. Chasing after opponents in Infinite Crisis typically feels like a waste of time unless youve purchased the expensive blink item or have the Super Speed power chosen. However, for assassins like Nightmare Robin and Atomic Wonder Woman, they can easily catch up to their prey and do tons of damage then easily disengage. Even worse, assassins usually get very tanky in the late game. Imbalance in a MOBA is bound to happen, but it feels bad knowing its a problem across an entire class. Thankfully Super Speed, one of Infinite Crisis 53 Stolen Powers did help me get away from assassins from time to time. Each Champion can pick two of these before a game begins. Theyre like Summoner Abilities in League of Legends, but way cooler. Most notable of these extra powers are Super Strength and Consume. With these two, you can pick up cars or rocks then throw them at enemies with the former, or use them to regain health with the latter. Those environmental objects can also block paths, so having these powers can totally change the flow of a match as you head into the mid and late game. Its incredibly useful, and adds another dynamic to keep in mind when building a team. Pros Coast CityGreat loreStolen Powers Cons Limited modesBalance issues I like Infinite Crisis, especially Coast City, but I just wish there were an easier way to play more of it. Having tools to learn new Champions and strategies is important in MOBAs, so its confusing that more bot modes arent available, especially when all but one queue is closed. Still, Infinite Crisis is a fun experience and does interesting things with the standard MOBA roles, though the assassin class feels like it has too much an advantage over the others. Stolen Powers help balance this a little bit, and theyre fun to use in Infinite Crisis comic book-like environment.", "date": "April 30, 2015"}
