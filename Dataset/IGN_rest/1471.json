Realistically, youll more likely stop after the fifteenth loading screen appears only to trigger another dryly executed piece of this messy 30 hour long RPG. Thats a shame as the tale told about Mors Westford and Alester Sarwyck has twists and turns that would utterly entertain and surprise were it not surrounded by such mediocrity on all sides. Game of Thrones: Video Review It should be noted that you dont need to follow the television series or have read the books to follow along. Sure it would help immensely, but sometimes character models look so different that I found myself having to Google my favorites just to make sure it was the same person from the series on HBO. Thats where this game really falls apart. Its as though someone just didnt care about presentation and rushed it out the door. There can be a moment or two when one of the pivotal plot points come across with some semblance of believability, but for the most part I found myself bored until the final five chapters when things actually pick up. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that what the writers did with the two main characters near the end of the game is a truly unique and interesting set of moments. Most will probably not get this far as youll spend the bulk of your time with Game of Thrones staring at what looks like a last generation title. Some character models, specifically Mors dog, look absolutely awful and animations can range from stiff to ridiculous. Occasionally youll cue a violent cinematic kill when you defeat the last of a group of opponents, but if you never switch weapon types throughout your experience youll always see the one animation. Speaking of repetitiveness, a surprising amount of the character models looked extremely similar, and during some scenes youll witness three of four clones of the exact same model doing something. This is more forgivable if its in a large group of background characters, but when its seen during one of the in-game cut scenes and the triplets are front and center, its just laziness on the developers part. Game of Thrones: The Story And this isnt the only idle oversight. At times the music will cut out and simply loop back to the beginning of a song instead of flowing together, and footsteps will suddenly stop and start up again for no reason. Its all these little nagging issues that really drain the fun from the game. Occasionally it will shine, but only during a few pivotal moments when you need to make a major choice. Combat features a surprisingly robust amount of options that you can seemingly use to build your character with, but in execution youll rely on little more than a handful of repetitive tactics to ensure victory. Most battles begin with hitting the L1 or R1 button to slow down the action. During these moments enemies will still slowly move keeping the intensity of the moment alive and allow you to strategically plan your attack. You do this by switching between characters and setting them to use a specific set of attacks before exiting the slow-down mode and returning to normal speed while you wait for your energy to recharge. Victories against a large group can make you feel like a master tactician until you realize that youre only using about 3 or 4 attacks over and over again. Knock someone down, make them bleed, stab the wound, or knock someone down, make them bleed, set them on fire. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Also, you cannot load a save during battle, so if youve made a mistake or lost a character during an escort mission youll need to wait until youre killed to restart. Remember the guy with the cut up shield? Neither do we. These collected issues are emblematic of the real problem with Game of Thrones. Every piece of the product has potential, but at each step something cripples the experience. Be it the compelling story delivered with the emphasis of a seventh grader reading in front of the class, or the constant problems like muddy environmental textures, reused character models, and doors that open and clip through your body. Theres just too much that seems like it was left unfinished or quickly thrown together for the good intentions to succeed in any way. CLOSING COMMENTS Its a shame that most will not have the wherewithal to endure the 20 or so hours of bad game to get to the really juicy story moments. The twists that are thrown are guaranteed to surprise. Unfortunately youll need to wade through an often ugly, buggy, and poorly delivered mess to get to them. The good parts of the game just make the ugly ones stand out even more and though the plot is there, you have to trudge through a lot of mud to get any enjoyment out of it. IGN RATINGS FOR GAME OF THRONES (XBOX 360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.5 Presentation The story is the one thing that stands out in the game, but its surrounded by lazy voice acting, and poorly textured environments. 3.5 Graphics The main characters have some impressive armor, but others look like little to no effort was put forth in their creation. Even characters from the television show are barely recognizable. 4.0 Sound Aside from the music track used in the HBO series, theres little else to remember here. Dialogue is delivered with little conviction at times and sounds will occasionally cut out. 6.0 Gameplay At moments it feels incredibly repetitive, but the combat keeps the intensity up by using slow-down to keep you on edge. There are also dialogue moments in the game that have you make major decisions that impact your outcome. 4.0 Lasting Appeal Aside from going back to an earlier save to see an alternate ending, there is little reason to return to the game. The only reason it will sit with you is if you finish all 15 chapters to see the surprising conclusion. 4.0 OVERALL Bad (out of 10) Pros Mance Rayder's endDany and her (raging) dragonsTyrion and Varys scenesCersei flashback Cons Not as powerful as past season openers Game of Thrones is off to a good start in Season 5 with this solid, though not stunning, premiere. While it's part of the show's harrowing design to constantly thin the herd, we do reach a point where we run low on characters to <em>really</em> care about/connect with/invest in. Not that you absolutely <em>need</em> folks to root for, but it helps. Right now, with Tyrion and Dany in flux (seemingly on a collision coarse) that person might be Jon Snow. As odd as that sounds since he, and The Wall, have sometimes been accused of being a rather monotonous portion of the series. As far as the books go, I won't mention all that much about the page-to-screen changes made this season. Other than to say that there will be more alterations than ever. Entire characters and arcs are being dropped from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons (which might <em>both</em> get almost entirely covered this season!). And if a storyline isn't axed, one of the already set characters on the show will most likely absorb it and make it their own. [poilib element=~accentDivider~] <em>Matt Fowler is a writer for IGN.
