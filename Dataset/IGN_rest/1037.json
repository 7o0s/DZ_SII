At the start, its an amiable action-adventure with a cute gimmick. Instead of a sword, you have well, its still a sword, but a sword with a USB connector that lets you hit monsters, blocks, and a few other things and play around with their variables. How far a block moves when pushed. Whether an NPC is friendly or not. Setting a guard to do negative damage so that he furiously heals you with every hit. Coupled with its funny script and charming retro aesthetic, all the pieces are in place for a clever little pastiche of adventuring that does for coding what Gunpoint did for security-system rewiring. Its a comedy game, but when it comes to weaponizing variables and debug code, its dead, dead serious. Just for starters, its probably the first game ever made to boast about how easily you can crash it, whether its by setting a generator to spill out turtles until your computer melts, or tweaking a script to the point that its universe collapses. Where most action RPGs give you tools to use against your enemies, Hack NSlash gives you increasingly more powerful ones to use against itself and full permission to do so - including a handy time-rewinder resetting any damage, though not always flawlessly. More than once a room took a couple of resets or a full game restart to clear the scripts. While to some extent the toys you get to play with are best kept as surprises, its scope can safely be explained like this: In the first Act, you twiddle with variables and play with a couple of jokey devices, such as an orb that undoes the variable that makes a friendly character remember shes already given you something. In the third, the puzzles involve working directly with Lua code, albeit via menus instead of by typing. Despite the name, Hack NSlash offers very little slashing, and its not the RPG it looks like either. Its really a puzzle game, where the puzzles demand your hacking abilities rather than the hacking being a way to cleverly subvert them. The villain can do the same stuff that you can, and the toys that let you do it are all made for that purpose by his enemies - a magic loupe, for instance, allowing you to physically step into game code. It is however every bit as smart as it looks, and as charming, with developer Double Fine mixing up a cocktail of geekery devices, Adventure Time-style banter, and amusing characters like big-bad Christof and his habit of gratuitously teleporting like Ganon in the old Legend of Zelda cartoon. Somewhat frustrating, though, is that for all the very smart, ambitious, and never-before-tried stuff that Hack NSlash does so well, it has a tendency to drop the ball on the easy stuff. Its maps are a nuisance to get around, with slippery controls, and little thought seems to have gone into the fact that no player knows a game as well as its designer. It can be a question of not knowing about an item that you dont have yet, or that youre now meant to backtrack despite the fact that a particular chest remains shut, or that a particular puzzle isnt ready to be solved yet. A map called The Infinite Woods, for instance, is introduced almost immediately, but its not for another chapter that you have the item you need to navigate it. Solving puzzles is fun, but splashing around trying to figure out whats next and whats just a dead end really, really isnt. More annoyingly though, it can often make solving them far more time-consuming than it needs to be, even if the basic concept is relatively simple. One early on simply involves adjusting the offset on four rotating circular barriers to clear a path for a boomerang. The four ports, though, each involve a trip on a floating platform from which the barriers are half off-screen, require a trip on a floating platform to reach, and are a real pain to synchronise. Its added annoyance, not added difficulty, especially with your hackers tendency to fall off the platform for no reason - one of many minor but irritating map issues, from the perspective making it harder than it should be to navigate, to how cluttered the screen quickly gets. For the most part, the actual puzzles are satisfying to solve; the smartness of Hack N Slash meaning that you feel extra smart for having solved them, even if it was a relatively simple gate to unlock or swapping an operand to reverse somethings function. When it comes to the programming ones specifically though, things are hampered by not using simple text, but visual abstractions of programming code that involve things like coloured gemstones shooting coloured dots at terminals (theres no apparent colour blindness mode, by the way) wired up to produce a result. In an early example, one generates a bridge, but only four blocks of it. The solution (slight spoiler, obviously) is to go in, change the value that controls the number of blocks to 10 or so, and then activate its switch. Easy. The complexity soon ramps up though, including code rooms having functions that force you into other sub-rooms to make further changes, running around to manually hit blocks and swap out operands and values and piece together functions, and generally make the whole thing more time consuming and less intuitive than just working with the damn code directly would be. If you know programming, its frustrating to deal with all this. If you dont, this is not a good teacher; for many players, Act 4 will be less a challenge than a brick wall coated in titanium. It doesnt help that what explanations there are quickly get buried in jokes, that theres nothing to do except sit in empty caves until you finally get it, and Hack N Slash offers little but quips and sympathy if youre stuck. Provided that you dont mind the lack of hints, though, its an interesting experience helped by the fact that the main character isnt a programmer. He too is trying to work through the problem by experimenting and poking and prodding rather than simply giving up early. It does feel like it could either have used a little more or a little less abstraction in the name of clarity. Either would be fine, but the current balance isnt right. Pros Genius conceptIncreasingly satisfyingGood sense of humor Cons Short yet frustratingNot all glitches intended Hack NSlash is both a perfect pun and an amazingly clever game; one that does have a tendency to get so wrapped up in being clever that the gameplay suffers for it, unless you and its creators are on the exact same wavelength, but which does at least let you feel smart as well. Its brave enough to blow itself open and let everyone both see and play around with its innards, and funny enough that its not just programmers wholl have a good time. Too many glitches do spoil the party though, which is more serious here when you dont know if theyre intentional.", "date": "Sept. 23, 2014"}
