Developer Cryteks Roman tale looks magnificent, and its typical revenge story setup is handled with great care, but the combat doesnt always keep up with the high bar Ryse sets for itself in all other departments. Ryses story is delivered out of chronological order. Rome is crumbling under a barbarian assault, and Marius, a proud and decorated Centurion, is escorting Emperor Nero through his palace. One moment later, Marius is a fresh-faced greenhorn of the Roman army. As I progressed, I enjoyed learning more about how the circumstances became so dire. And despite the abnormal structure, the story was never difficult to follow even when it took a few unanticipated turns. If you want to show off the capabilities of your shiny new Xbox One to your friends, Ryse is more than capable of lending a hand. Environments dont just look terrific technically; they have great variety. Theres plenty of Roman architecture, but Ryse also takes you to beaches dotted with shipwrecks, trap-filled swamps, and Cryteks signature lush forests. Characters animations look fluid and natural, even during hectic fights with dozens of fighters going at it. It sounds great as well, with special mention going to the excellent voice acting. Strangely enough, Emperor Neros sons sound a lot like Bane and the Joker from Nolans Batman films. If its supposed to be an homage, those voice actors nailed their roles. Ryse, Rynse, and Rypeat Ryses biggest issue is that not even halfway through its modest six-hour campaign, youll have seen and experienced a vast majority of your offensive options. Combat consists of basic hits, bashes, blocks, and heavy attacks. In most battles, you can chain these actions together in nearly any order and still be successful, which remains fun until the flashy animations start to lose their luster. There is a system in place to land perfect attacks, but those too are easy to execute once you understand them. Whats there isnt at all bad, it just feels like a foundation for something far greater and more nuanced that never comes. Enemy variety does a bit of work to liven things up. Some foes are unblockable, some charge you, and some assault you with a flurry of dual-sword attacks. Dealing with them requires you to care about your blocks, attacks, and movements, which is fun until you figure out their repetitive patterns. Stuck in the Past Many games of this style rely on upgrades in the form of unlockable combos and items to add mechanical depth. But most of Ryses are boring passive bonuses that dont change the way you fight. Your health bar can be extended, as can your slow motion power-up. Executions, which are gory displays of dismemberment that Ryse revels in, are the other thing youll spend experience points on, but theyre focused more on the showy outcome than the work it took to make them happen. When an enemy is weakened, you can initiate a brutal execution with one button tap. From there, you simply match your button presses to they color the enemy glows  either blue or yellow. Youre given ample time to hit the buttons, and even if you miss the execution still goes through. Hitting the prompt in time just earns you a higher rating for the kill and rewards you with more health, experience, or whatever else you have selected as an execution reward. Upgraded executions give you larger bonuses for completing them, but the input hardly changes. So whats the point? This one mechanical decision managed to extract most of the danger from a game about burly, cruel men who savagely kill each other. The standard hack-and-slash combat is occasionally broken up by special gameplay sections that, at the very least, give you a break from the norm. Sometimes its as simple as manning a crossbow turret with unlimited ammo and mowing down barbarians. Other times you arrange your warriors into a phalanx and march them forward into fortified territory, blocking arrows and chucking spears. Like your normal actions, none of the activities ask much of you. Theyre about the spectacle, which, to be fair, is pretty impressive. New Boss, Same as the Old Boss Boss battles arent common, but when they do rear their heads, they can be frustrating. On one hand, bosses often attack faster or have heavy attacks that cant be blocked, which is a nice change from the rhythm of combat youll have grown accustomed to by then. On the other, Ryse likes to lean on the old regenerating-boss-health trick to extend the fights, but doesnt bother to change up their behavior when their bar refills. You dont fight the same boss in a markedly different way now that hes really mad  you just fight him again. The co-op multiplayer modes let you dismember enemies with one friend in the famed Roman Colosseum. Before each fight, you pick a god to serve, each with different bonuses. One player might allow both to recover health with executions, while the other might allow both to earn focus. Having to defend another guy, and thus preserve your own bonuses, is an extra layer of strategy that isnt present in the single-player mode, and its badly needed. However, aside from ensuring the right player lands an execution at the proper time, the combat remains held back by the same passiveness of the campaign. The environment does shift constantly, with new blades, towers, and pits springing up every few minutes as the objectives change. Its a cool way to keep the combat dynamic within one round. THE VERDICT Ryse has an entertaining story and sky-high production values. The gameplay thats there isnt bad  it just stops in its tracks before it gets anywhere near close to demanding. The multiplayer mode has some neat ideas, like a deadly, shifting Colosseum, but its hamstrung by the same combat issues that affect the main campaign. But if spectacle is what you want, Ryse: Son of Rome will keep you entertained.
