Where the original is all about bullets and confrontation - albeit with a blundering lug of a character - The Assignment is more about staying in the shadows, avoiding enemies, and keeping a cool head in the face of terrifying monsters. Its the sleek black cat to The Evil Withins big shaggy dog, and a great addition to Game Director Shinji Mikami and Tango Gameworks new survival horror universe. The Assignments three-and-a-half-hour story runs concurrently with the main games, filling us in on what Juli Kidman  a detective, or perhaps an agent for a sinister agency?  was up to during her mysterious absences. Throughout, youll see original protagonist Sebastian and his partner Joseph in familiar situations, which adds to a sense of a much bigger and wonderfully ominous picture. This story is still as high-concept as it ever was, but it helps that Kidman is a more knowledgeable character than Sebastian from the get-go, and more likable, too. Voiced with confidence by Dexters Jennifer Carpenter, shes a more reactive, and therefore believably realistic, character. Carpenter even sells Kidmans somewhat cliched backstory, told through audio tapes, with a performance that avoids theatrics. Physically, Kidman is less powerful than Sebastian. Roughly 95% of the time she is unarmed, and there is no upgrade system in The Assignment. Instead, her skillset focuses on stealth. Kidman can lure enemies by calling out while taking cover against walls or other objects, throw bottles to distract them, move without running out of puff, and auto-heal rather than use syringes. These abilities work well  for the most part. The Evil Withins old-school controls dont always lend themselves to fluid movements, and occasionally I got stuck to a surface or unintentionally popped out of crouch when trying to turn a corner. The stealth attack, introduced later into the episode, also feels a bit haphazardly implemented  that became an issue for me when a boss fight relied on it. But considering how thrilling it was to play a survival horror game with nothing at my disposal but a torch, I didnt mind much. I spent a lot of the time running blindly with my heart thumping, hoping a distracted enemy wasnt now in pursuit, or yelling in triumph after locking one in a room. Without a weapon, the tension builds quickly. Adrenaline is encouraged by The Assignment's sinister environments. Tango has once again done some wonderful things with lighting, with many of its twisted corporate interiors drenched in sickly, flickering fluorescence, and others in dirty, wet shadow. I frequently found myself crouched behind flimsy cover in the dark, terrified to turn on my torch, as footsteps ever so slowly made their way towards me. Although their A.I. isnt as sophisticated as, say, Alien: Isolations, enemies in The Assignment will pursue and kill you quickly, so youll want to avoid confrontation at all cost. While I would have liked a little more variation in enemy design, and perhaps more threatening enemies overall (l died considerably less here than in the main game) there is a particularly vicious recurring enemy in The Assignment that I loved. To describe it at all would spoil, but its up there with The Evil Withins keepers and Resident Evil 4s regenerators; in other words, a Mikami Special. Pros Great stealthy gameplayCreepy environmentsNew protagonist Cons Occasionally sticky controls The Assignment offers up a thrilling three-and-a-half hours in The Evil Withins grimy universe. Its stealthy gameplay, beautifully designed environments, and refreshingly grounded protagonist make it stand out from the main game, and a cliffhanger ending suggests theres much more good stuff to come in part two: The Consequence.", "date": "March 12, 2015"}
