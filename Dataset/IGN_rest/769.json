Now you just have to figure out what to do with it. Yes, disembodied voice of sociopathic scientist putting me through a series of sadistic test chambers, that pretty much sums up Magnetic: Cage Closed. If youve played Portal, you know exactly what this routine is about, and these puzzles and their simple push-and-pull mechanics will likely feel mundane in comparison to those built around the mind-bending Portal Gun. (If you havent played Portal, play Portal.) Magnetic apes Valves puzzle game without apology, to the point of starring a mute female protagonist whos immune to fall damage. Worse, its without a novel idea to make it stand out as more than a shadow of a great game. That doesnt mean its puzzles arent tough at times, because some of them definitely had me stumped and scratching my head for a few minutes. Especially the puzzles that involve using the Magnet Gun to repulse yourself into the air to hover your way over spikes, or pull yourself toward a distant metal object with a magnet-powered super-jump over a poison-gas floor  those can be tricky business. Jumping puzzles aside, its challenge is all very much about moving boxes onto buttons, so its unlikely to blow your mind at any point in its series of drab-looking industrial test chambers. The look of the levels does briefly change in the second act, when the story takes the same exact twist as (guess who!) Portal, but it remains nothing special to see. The Magnet Gun is a neat-looking tool, apparently cobbled together from spare parts (including a power supply that looks like its been ripped out of an old PC). Its fairly simple to use and understand: theres a push setting and a pull setting, and eventually three different power levels - which is odd, because I never found a reason to use anything less than the most potent power setting available. Maybe low power is useful for precise control in the time trials, or for pulling just one box toward yourself instead of all of them at once, but launching myself or objects at maximum velocity definitely got the job done through all of Magnetics levels. The biggest frustration I had was the magnetic pull sometimes not working through certain obstacles, such as glass or bars, when it seemed like it should. Every so often therell be a lull in the physics-puzzle action when Magnetic will stop borrowing from Portal and start borrowing from The Stanley Parable instead by posing abstract ethical questions that affect off-screen people. Step on the button to the right, and the voices say some unknown person will die; step on the button to the left, and youre threatened with vague consequences. As far as I can tell, these buttons do nothing at all other than change the voices dialogue, but theyre at least generally well-acted lines. The two unseen characters  a man and a woman  both have some personality to them, though nothing approaching the memorable AI they stand in for. On the other hand, the most annoying part of Magnetic is how frequently it makes you stand around and wait for it to finish a maniacal monologue about all the previous prisoners whove died in the test chamber, or take a few moments for it to do nothing at all. The worst is the rides in the shipping containers, where youre sealed into a small box thats apparently being moved around the facility for the better part of a minute before letting you move on, without any dialogue at all to distract you from the corrugated metal walls. Id suspect this was covering a loading screen, but it didnt get any shorter when I moved Magnetic to an SSD. Nor do the all-too-frequent crawls through robotic doggy doors that separate puzzle chambers (like Portals force-field protected elevator lifts). Sometimes Magnetic seems to make you crawl through one of these just so you can crawl through another one a few seconds later. Sometimes youll need to deposit your Magnet Gun on a pedestal, only to walk a short distance, crawl through a doggy door, and pick it up again. Magnetic does this kind of thing a lot. Pros Some tough puzzlesVoice actingMagnets are cool Cons Painfully unoriginalLots of waiting Magnetic: Cage Closed is a competent but completely uninspired physics puzzle game that owes much to its predecessors but never really builds on the concept with ideas of its own. Figuring out how to get the right box on the right buttons to navigate through its magnet-based test chambers can certainly be tough at times, and its pair of voice-only characters give it some personality, but its lack of original ideas or a concept that makes you think outside the box makes it a quickly forgettable challenge.", "date": "May 28, 2015,"}
