You play as adorable caricatures of real-life drivers  the likenesses are strong, and they look as if theyve been carved from colourful vinyl. The presentation is impossibly cute too. Drivers nod and wink to each other on the starting grid, and summon their misplaced helmets in a variety of mischievous ways before the race begins. Similarly, levels are lovely to look at, but they're not nearly as much fun to race through. Like the F1 season, tracks are set across the globe, from Japan to Italy, Brazil to the USA. Each one is a charming condensation of that countrys most iconic landmarks and symbols. In Japan, youll weave in and out of warring Sumo wrestlers, dodge bowing geishas serving noodles, and jockey for position on top of Shinkansen. Meanwhile, in Abu Dhabi, youll scale gigantic hotels which open up like roller coasters, navigate building sites, before ending up in the desert. Its all rendered in a quaint and quirky style, like everything has been constructed using pastels and plastic. The F1 licence differentiates Race Stars from other kart racers in some important ways. The first thing youll notice is the lack of a drifting mechanic. After all, this is Formula 1, and youll have to learn how to take a corner by using your brakes, slipstreaming, and finding the perfect racing line, not by sliding around it. It feels odd to brake so frequently in a kart racer, and even on the highest speed-class (3000cc) races still feel a tad pedestrian, with cars lacking decent acceleration. This is where the KERS (kinetic energy recovery system) fitted to each car comes into play. Periodically, youll drive over section of track that allow you to fill up the KERS by repeatedly squeezing the right trigger. Do it three times, and your tank will be brimming with energy, allowing you to zoom off with a satisfying F1 screech. But it never really confers that much of an advantage, since most racers will be max out their tank. It requires less skill than artfully drifting around the corner while avoiding obstacles. It quickly becomes something of a chore, as does another one of the games F1-inspired features  the pit stop. Cars sustain damage after being hit by power-ups. And after three or four incidents, cars start to look rickety, with broken fenders and sparks pouring out of the back, and need to be serviced. Most tracks have at least two pit stops that you can pull into and emerge with your car in pristine condition. When they're battered, cars slow down slightly and it can be annoying if youre far away from the next pit stop. When it comes to power-ups, you get the feeling that F1 licence proved to be something of a restriction. The power-ups are bland, comprising mainly of primary-coloured boosts and bubbles. Youll be able to boost three times in a row. Youll be able to fire red bubbles which act like homing missiles, while yellow bubbles fly in a straight line before ricocheting endlessly. Sound familiar? Blue bubbles sit on the track like banana skins. Although they might function like familiar Mario Kart weapons, theyre just so insipid to look at and use. You can also leave balloons around the tracks, which will fog up your opponents screen with ticker tape. It just all feels a little bit sensible and staid. The differences between the F1 teams themselves are reflected by drivers having unique abilities. Ferraris Fernando Alonso and his teammate Felipe Massa, for instance, can fire a red bubble backwards, which is quite handy. McLarens Jensen Button and Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, can swap their power-up. But apart from these minor abilities, most drivers and teams feel the same. The cutesy exterior belies F1 Race Stars frustrating gameplay. Of course, like any decent kart racer, there should always be an element of levelling chance. Blessed with the right power-up and enough skill, coming back from last place with one lap to go should be well within your reach. But in F1 Race Stars its hard to turn things around. If you slip to the back of the pack, you can rarely claw your way back to the front. This wouldnt be so frustrating if races didnt drag on so much. Tracks are long, and a single race might take in excess of five or six minutes. In multiplayer, this frustration is diluted somewhat  you feel more in the mix but ultimately, the same problems persist  insipid power-ups and staid gameplay. The game isnt helped by the way its organised either. It feels a little empty; the career mode consists of tracks combined in a multitude of cynical ways  European tracks, Oceanian tracks. There are some themed Championships, such as Refuel Racket in which you constantly need to top up your fuel tank by collecting gas, but ultimately its token variety. It feels like padding, and youll quickly feels like youre playing the same tracks, over and over. And though theyre vibrant and nicely designed, it just starts to drag. THE VERDICT For a caricature to succeed it must capture the likeness of the original but exaggerate it in a way that raises a smile. But F1 Race Stars rarely achieves this. Its a failed caricature  its cute and charming appearance totally undermined by its frustrating and frequently bland gameplay. Sometimes nice games finish in last place.", "date": "Nov. 14, 2012,"}
