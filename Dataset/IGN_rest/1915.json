Dropping you back in the shoes of Dani Rojas, Lost Between Worlds is all about an alien entity called Fai that crash-lands in Yara, creating a multitude of time rifts and portals to alternate dimensions. What ensues is a web of interconnected semi-roguelite levels that youre free to playthrough in any order you want. Its a genuinely fun way to bring an end to Danis story that I found myself happily plowing through all six hours of in a single day, even if it did essentially feel like a watered down version of the main game. Far Cry 6 (PS5) . . 98.00 Buy Now  Similar to how Far Cry 3 brought us the neon-dripped Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4 gave us a fantastical valley of Yetis, and Far Cry 5 dropped us off on Mars, Lost Between Worlds isnt afraid to cap off Far Cry 6 by getting a bit weird. Fais arrival scattered five shards into alternate dimensions, and it needs your help to find those shards and reassemble its ship to get off the planet. Thankfully, the mere process of shard collecting should save the world from ending as well  convenient, right? The best way I found to have fun with Lost Between Worlds was to just immediately give into a suspension of disbelief. There is no real explanation for an alien craft crashing onto Yara and the sooner I realized that didnt matter, the sooner I was having fun blasting away at the DLCs colorful, crystalline enemies. What We Said About Far Cry 6 Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun Ive had with this series in nearly a decade. Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story, even if its also a fairly predictable one that doesnt always land the bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices, its creative weaponry means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a ride with a buddy has never felt better. - Jon Ryan, October 6, 2021 Score: 8 Read the full Far Cry 6 review Collecting shards means venturing through portals into destabilized twists on the real world called rifts. Each rift looks like a cool, bizarro-world version of Yara and is essentially a self-contained level with a unique quality that poses a new challenge. For example, one rift suffers from periodic lightning strikes, another features a slowly descending spiral of doom from the clouds, and another is totally pitch black other than the pink glow of the precious shard. While venturing through rifts you can also collect sparkling Glint fragments. When you die, you can spend Glint to revive at the start of that rift if you have enough  otherwise death means youll have to restart your entire run back at the beginning of the rift web with Fai. Thats a welcome failsafe for anybody not as into a more traditional roguelike formula, but I didnt actually die very often throughout Lost Between Worlds, and rolled credits with a whopping 1,000 Glint saved up. The smart progression structure dramatically reduces repetition. Once you reach the end of a rift, you must pick between two portals (red or blue, naturally) to advance further. The portals are simply gateways to your choice of two other random rifts, and which ones they lead to stay the same for the whole run. That provides a fun sense of variety to mix things up the first time you go through a new portal, but also means youll know where it connects if you have to backtrack through a rift later on. Your map even shows you which portal connects to which rift once its unlocked, so you dont have to guess once youve visited each rift at least once. After every shard you collect, Fai grants you a new piece of gear to speed your rift travel along. For example, after you bring back the first shard, she will give you a C4-style bomb that can be used to open up shortcuts on subsequent rift visits. Other gadgets include a grappling hook for scaling walls to skip sections and a key for opening previously locked doors that usually contain loot. This is a great progression structure because it dramatically reduces repetition if youre not required to play through entire rifts all over again every time you visit. Outside of that handful of permanent gear upgrades, any weapons and gadgets youve collected along the way will be lost whenever you collect a shard or die trying. Since there are only a handful of weapons to find, I like this feature because it forces you to adapt to whatever is available rather than picking a favorite gun and never switching. In turn, that helps each rift remain entertaining even when you visit it for a second or third time. Since all of the rifts criss-cross and interconnect in various ways, you dont even have to visit the same rift more than once or twice if you dont want to. For example, I absolutely hated the rift that requires you to swim around underwater, making you float from bubble to bubble while trying not to drown. It was plain annoying and tedious, like most water levels. So, I just avoided it on all of my other shard collection journeys. I vastly prefer this style of pre-meditated variety over the procedural generation or random rift selection that Ubisoft could have opted for here, letting me play each scenario in the order I preferred. The new color-coded enemies don't really add much to combat. The other major twist Lost Between Worlds introduces is chromatic combat. All of the enemies in this DLC are crystallized humanoid creatures that are either purely blue or purely red  in order to damage one, you must shoot them with their matching color by changing your own bullet color on the fly. (Although, for some odd reason, the default keybinding on PC for switching colors is L, which was obnoxiously inconvenient until I swapped it to my mouses thumb button.) Unfortunately, this color-changing idea doesnt really add much since enemies seem to always spawn in the same places each time you visit a rift and swapping is as simple as a button press. Other than amplifying the other-worldly visuals on display, its mostly pointless. Thats especially true since there are only a handful of actual enemy types between your standard assault rifle users, snipers, melee rushers, and shielded machine gunners. Id have preferred better encounter design or more creative enemy AI over adding a superfluous color-changing layer to combat. Lost Between Worlds web of interweaving levels may be more restrictive than Far Cry 6s usual open world, but this wild new structure totally works. What Ubisoft lost in vast level design they made up for with a creative alternate dimension concept that encourages replaying levels, unlocking new paths, and mixing up your approach. There isnt much to the story this time around and the addition of color-coded enemies doesnt do much to shake up its otherwise untouched combat, but the interesting premise and engaging gameplay loop at least help this add-on outrank the previous villain-focused DLCs.", "date": "Dec. 7, 2022,"}
