Spike Lees Oldboy is set to debut this Wednesday, November 27, with very little fanfare. Rather than the normal marketing build towards release, the distributors seem to have turned down the volume on the buzz building press opportunities and promotion. Adapted from Park Chan-wooks 2003 film based on the Japanese manga of the same name, Oldboy may have received a muted mainstream advertising campaign, but its also one of the most talked about releases among critics and cinema enthusiasts. Devotees of Chan-wooks original railed against Lees production well before cameras rolled. Whether in early interviews or Comic-Con panels, the repeated demand from the fanbase was, Why? Why remake this already superbly crafted story? Sadly, the finished product fails to provide an adequate answer. Full disclosure: I count myself a fan of the second in Chan-wooks Vengeance Trilogy. However, as rare as they are, weve seen successful remakes of beloved films. It seemed possible that Lee, with his distinctive voice, could bring something fresh to this dark and operatic tale of retribution and I went in to the screening hopeful. For those who are unfamiliar, Oldboy follows the story of Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin), an alcoholic advertising executive who wakes up in a dingy hotel room after a nasty bender, only to discover that hes become a prisoner of some unknown force. Held for 20 years in solitary confinement with no explanation and a television as his only companion, Doucett volleys between insanity and a grim determination to become a better man. When he is abruptly released, he sets out on a violent path of revenge and a search to discover who destroyed his life and why. He quickly finds out that the madman who imprisoned him was just getting started when he let him go. The successful portions of the film are primarily due to Brolins performance, which isnt enough to overcome the uninspired repeat of the 2003 films most iconic moments, nor the truly abysmal third act in which the script makes the most distinct departure from the source. This Oldboy handles Doucetts decline into madness and the grueling passage of time adeptly, but not as gut-wrenchingly as the original. Doucett watches the world change before him on TV -- his one and only friend -- but it starts to feel more about the evolution of technology and less about a man coming undone, though that's there as well. In fact, a central issue with the film is that Brolins Doucett is made better by his trials in a very pat, disappointingly Tinseltown take on life manner. Brolin has a formidable presence and doesnt just sink his teeth into this character, but rips the meat off the bone. However, Doucett is so crass, such a filthy beast at the outset, that he already reads as a ruthless brute. So the sense of consequence is lost a but. This film takes a non-neutral character, and attempts to redeem him versus the original which took a buffoonish, but mostly neutral everyman and pushed him to an extreme. The 2003 Oldboys Oh Dae-su is a man forged in the crucible of 15 years of solitude. He is no simple hero or badass  though he is undoubtedly, brutally badass. He is a monster created by circumstance, barely human by the time he sets on his path of retribution, and yet, more capable of empathy and depth of feeling than prior to his captivity.The character transformation has more layers in the Korean film. Perhaps more to the point, part of what made the original so effective was that it was not entirely clear that Oh Dae-su had done wrong. In Lees version, the punishment is still far too extreme, but one feels far more like Doucett had it coming. A key line of dialogue in the 2003 film is, Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock, in water they both sink alike. Meaning small choices can and do have as significant an impact as grand gestures. That idea is almost entirely lost in this new Oldboy. Both Doucett and Oh Dae-su are faced with an impossible choice by the climax of the story. Oh takes a path that gives new meaning to the terms bittersweet and poetic justice. Mark Prostovich's script strips away the subtlety in the 2013 version, particularly in Doucett's manufactured final -- and completely unbelievable -- redemptive act. All Ill say is this: Its unlikely that the character would make the decision he does, but even if he did, it wouldnt work out for him. On a positive note, Elizabeth Olsen turns in a fine portrayal of a damaged, but well-intentioned young woman determined to assist Doucett with his search for his long-lost daughter. Id go so far as to say that I far prefer her performance to the female lead in the 2003 film. Sam Jackson delivers on being a big, Sam Jackson, speechifying baddie. There are some beautifully vivid and painterly shots and sequences, including the one-man and a hammer against the world fight, but they are often all too familiar. Lees signatures are there, including his favored free-floating dolly shots, but the bulk of the striking images are lifted directly from Chan-wooks original but with some slight tweaks. Generally things are more colorful, which kind of mirrors the exaggerated nature of the script. Its all bigger, brighter, more in-your-face, and far less stimulating. Sharlto Copley, who plays the villainous Adrian Pryce, is ordinarily a fascinating actor to watch. Here he reads as distractedly mannered, odd and often just plain hammy. He is not so much a mustache twirler as a carnival freak, which is equally problematic. Copleys accent is a particular issue, in that it undercuts a major plot point. Doucett is narrowing down a list of those he had wronged, and may have sought to hurt him, by the process of elimination. The moment Pryce, with his distinctive voice calls him, Doucett would be able to cross pretty much any human that wasn't this one off his list. Chan-wooks antagonist was a polished businessman, who would be much harder to place, and made him all the more insidious. Lee's version undermines the power of that character and the perfectly calculated nature of his vengeance, which should have been designed to force Doucett to experience exactly what he had. What is meant to be an unsettling backstory becomes almost laughable in this depiction. If you are familiar with the source material, you can never take that initial maddening journey with the protagonist again. Theres something to be said for that. So, if you are new to the story, then you may find yourself momentarily taken by this hellish fable. By the time of the films conclusion, though, if Copleys theatrical villain hasnt lost you, then the increasingly implausible and downright ludicrous motivations, backstory, and resolution will. Pros Brolin's performance.Some nice visuals. Cons All subtlety lost.The changes detract from the story.A pointless remake. Ultimately, Oldboy isnt an entirely worthless film; it is an unnecessary one. Brolin, Jackson, and Olsens portrayals are compelling and more than worthy. Unfortunately, Copley, who is often a standout, feels like hes delivering performance art here, rather than a performance. There are some haunting visual motifs and the plot twists are as depraved as one would imagine and may desire. Overall, the changes that are made detract from, rather than enhance the story. The end is where the film truly falls apart, though. The small and large shifts rob the tale of its nuance. Park Chan-wooks complex meditation on violence, responsibility, revenge, and poetic justice is bastardized and morphed into a cartoonish and contrived version. There is very little in this new Oldboy that the original didnt do better. Youre best off to save your money at the theater and rewatch or discover Chan-wooks far more intricately woven and harrowing saga.", "date": "Nov. 28, 2013,"}
