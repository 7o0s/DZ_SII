You know youll get recent pop hits, a few disco classics, and a smattering of novelty tunes, accompanied by color-saturated videos displaying simple dance moves for you to imitate. And youll earn some points, whether youre trying your best or napping on the couch. But with impressive video production, more precise player tracking (thanks to the Xbox Ones Kinect, which is all but required to play), and a fully realized social component, Just Dance 2015 is a welcome, surprising reinvigoration of the series. The 45 songs included in Just Dance 2015 are mostly of the pop variety, including recent earworms such as Pharrells Happy, Let it Go from Disneys Frozen, and Katy Perrys Birthday, but there are several curveballs as well. Classics like Aint No Mountain High Enough from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell sit alongside Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler and Xmas Tree by Bollywood Santa. Want to dance to the Tetris theme? Its in there as well, along with Frankie Bostellos Mahna Mahna (which you probably know from The Muppets). You truly see your moves registering on the Kinect, and the sense of accomplishment from nailing a move is that much more gratifying because of it. However, while Just Dance 2015 is better at rewarding good dancing than past versions, its points-for-all scoring system means anyone whos detected by the Kinect will end up with a score, regardless of whether they were moving at all.. That forgiving nature will always be its Achilles heel, and reduces the sense that a high score was well earned. Dance Central this isnt. Im not much of a dancer, and I wasnt any better after playing, but thats just fine with Just Dance. Its more about having fun while moving to the beat. Im guessing professional dancers look at Just Dance the way professional drivers might look at the Burnout series. These arent moves youll pull off in real life, but theyre certainly fun in a video game. The Kinect controls are responsive, but my family and I often found ourselves reaching for the controller to navigate the menus. Its just faster and easier, but even then, the menu and navigational systems continue to be as confusing and frustrating as ever. The new glossy look and fun graphical touches cant hide some of the mind-boggling decisions made as to how this whole thing operates. For instance, you cant just hit B to go back. Whether you picked the wrong song, or youre looking for a different menu, you have to wait for a back button to appear at the top right, move the cursor up there, and then click. And the badges icon on the home screen that tells you how many youve earned -- thats not a button. To actually look at your rewards, thats a different button top right. Considering all the other upgrades Just Dance has received, its time the menus and navigation received the TLC they deserve. The one thing it does very right, though, is the voice-activated Just Dance! command that gets you right into the action once youve selected your song. That never got old. Up to six people can dance at once locally, and players can jump in and out of a song as they please, making it ideal for parties or ending fights between children. And while Im 64 and my youngest is three feet tall, we were both seen and scored appropriately (I won!). Then my wife and my seven-year-old joined in, and Just Dance 2015 adjusted without a hitch (my wife won). Where youll really see Ubisofts effort is in the music videos for the dance numbers. While Just Dance has always been a celebration of color saturation, this years videos are, for the most part, much more creative and unique. For instance, this version of Katy Perrys Dark Horse is inspired by the original, Egyptian-themed music video. A lead dancer, initially dressed as Cleopatra, morphs throughout the song into a variety of elaborate costumes. A chorus of digitally added dancers backs her up across a variety of dissolving Egyptian backgrounds, and its all impressively choreographed and lit. Its truly entertaining, even if youre a wallflower. Meanwhile, the evolution of Just Dance into a multiplayer game has made huge strides this year. The series has flirted with social interaction in the past, but Just Dance 2015 is a full-fledged virtual dance party. Hopping onto the World Dance Floor takes you to a lobby where you can choose to dance against another player one on one, or jump right into a dance party with up to eight players competing for the high score. It all worked seamlessly, free of hiccups or lag. Another social addition to Just Dance 2015 is the ability to take on a ghost dancer challenger, which reenacts another players high-scoring performance on screen and reveals how it was done as you compete against it. Similar features have long been a motivating part of racing games, and its nice to see this integrated so well here. Watching videos uploaded by other dancers around the world is strangely compelling, and its fun to see how your videos have been received by the community. The Video Gallery is also proof that there are a lot of good dancers out there, and that Just Dance players are quite the diverse bunch. If you dont have a Kinect, you can play Just Dance 2015 by downloading the Just Dance Motion Controller app to your smartphone, using the motion of your phone to track your moves -- like a hi-tech maraca. It absolutely dilutes the experience, but it is an option. Pros Improved accuracyPolished videosCommunity integration Cons Not much newFrustrating menus It would be easy to dismiss Just Dance 2015 as the same-old-same-old, but that would overlook this finely tuned party games special-effects-laden dance numbers, complete with chorus lines and elaborate sets and costumes, and the social integration that holds the world-wide Just Dance community together. Though its overeagerness to hand out points and make everyone feel like a winner robs it of some competitive value, Just Dance 2015 just works as a fun, get-up-and-move game, with a wink and smile along the way.", "date": "Dec. 10, 2014,"}
