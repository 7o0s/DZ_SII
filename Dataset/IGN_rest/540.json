To survive, you need to excel at patient, calculated combat with major consequences littered between multi-faceted, Zelda-style puzzles. And while it could comfortably exist without VR, theres nothing quite like a front-row seat to a giant cyclops fight, and that new perspective gives Chronos another edge. Its not a unique formula  kill the guards, then kill the boss  but there are hours of wonderment in getting lost in the sprawling dungeons that all present their own intricate maze of locked doors, curious runes, and even inter-dimensional travel. Each of the uniquely designed labyrinths requires careful memorizing and retracing, and things that make no sense initially all end up being satisfying pieces of one giant puzzle. Chronos carefully pieces together its different dimensions, requiring items from one to be brought into the next, which provides a constant alluring mystery: in what bizarre dimension will I need to use that small bag with the nonsensical description? And for what purpose? Where the clever puzzle-based dungeons are very Zelda-inspired, the combat has the sword-and-shield charm of Dark Souls. I approached almost every enemy encounter by watching and waiting for my time to strike, as enemy attack patterns are a worthwhile timing-based puzzle of their own. Dodging incoming attacks in a very precise window grants you an arcane damage boost that youll absolutely need, since even the most basic enemies can kill you in a few hits if youre reckless. It gives the combat a rhythm thats like a kind of addictive dance, and I couldnt wait to improve at it. Older and Wiser And you have to improve at it, because if you dont there are major consequences. Its punishing in conventional ways, with infrequent spawn points and enemies that dont stay dead, but the effects carry over into your next life. Each time you die in Chronos your character visibly ages by one year, which slowly alters your stats from a brute-force teen to an arcane-dependent adult. That adds an interesting forced evolution to the combat as you progress: youre able to unlock a new skill every 10 years, so while dying and leaving the comfort of the stats youve intentionally built with every level-up is daunting, your capabilities increase to compensate in other ways. Most of the RPG elements are unfortunately slim, though. The only loot enemies drop is one of two components you need to level up your weapons, and the process is the same for every weapon. Theres a very small amount of those, too  the handful of weapons and shields youll stumble across do vary in speed and damage, but, for what might be the first time ever in an RPG, I ended the story with the exact same Iron Sword that I started with. The leveling system is equally lackluster, with separate XP-based level-ups allowing you to assign points to one of four attributes that never really seemed to make a difference. My stat-leveling choices were usually a shot in the dark, yet they always ended in success, which leads me to believe these decisions were never that important. The Walls Have Eyes A separate issue is the way you view the action. Your face is the camera, so you have great control over how you look around, but because your viewpoint is fixed for each room you enter (like in old-school Resident Evil) rather than the usual over-the-shoulder perspective, it can present some uncomfortable neck-craning as you try to focus on the object or enemy that demands your attention. For the most part, though, Chronos uses the fixed camera creatively, rather than as a limitation. One of the most intense moments of dread Ive felt playing any game was encountering statues that only move when theyre out of frame, and will kill you in one hit if they get too close. Through the Oculus Rifts directional audio, you can hear the scraping of stone that signals their approach, but unless you physically look to the left or right to find them, theres absolutely nothing you can do to stop that terrifying oncoming threat. Outside of those mechanics, Chronos is benefitted by the inflated sense of scale of VR. I caught myself stopping to stare at the uniquely designed, awe-inspiring sights each different dimension offers  whether it was the impossibly large, Egyptian-looking statues or skyscraper-sized redwood trees that loom above your head. Chronos environmental variety and consistent art style would still be impressive outside of VR, but wearing the Oculus Rift really helps to make everything feel absolutely enormous compared to your tiny character (and the fixed cameras probably help here, too). Sometimes youll fight an enemy particularly close to the fixed point, and that never stops feeling unsettling in VR - its like youre only an arm's length away from a murderous demon. On the topic of murderous demons, Chronos story isnt its strongest part, but its certainly not bad either. Theres a solid plot twist at the end that left me with some lingering questions, but its more of a respectable attempt that narrowly avoids taking itself too seriously without having the depth to back it up. Pros Challenging puzzlesAddictive combatAwe-inspiring environments Cons Shallow RPG elementsAwkward VR angles For many PC enthusiasts, building your PC is sacrosanct. But there are good enough reasons to buy a pre-built, including exceptional build quality and access to premium components like the RTX 3080. The Origin Chronos gets you the best of the best if youre willing to spend. Best of all, it does so in a case thats attractive enough for most settings. If youre willing to take a hit on FPS, the Origin Chronos proves 4K gaming is here, and in a size that would make towers jealous.", "date": "April 15, 2016"}
