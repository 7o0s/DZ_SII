In the next few weeks, the title from developer Telltale Games will likely win many Game of the Year awards. Moving into 2013, people will reference the series over and over as the benchmark for story-telling in games. And historically, it will stand as the game that reinvented or at least repopularized adventure games. The first four episodes of The Walking Dead put that reputation and legacy in motion, and The Walking Dead: The Game  Episode 5: No Time Left cements it. The season finale of Lee Everetts story is emotional, tense, exciting, terrifying and something everyone should experience if he or she wants to be part of the current gaming conversation from here on out. Spoilers follow for Episodes 1 through 4, but are avoided for Episode 5. Episode 5 picks up from and repeats the final moments of Episode 4: Around Every Corner. Clementine has been taken, Lee has been bitten, and the zombie horde is bearing down on Savannah. From there, Lees sole purpose is finding this girl, regardless of the cost. Whereas I complained that Episode 4 spun its wheels and never pushed the narrative forward, Episode 5 has no choice but to hurtle us through what seems to be Lees final hours, and we make more snap decisions than ever before. In previous installments, weve made one or two major decisions an episode, but Episode 5 has us making them left and right  deciding where the group should head, who to tell off, and so on. Truthfully, there are only a couple choices that drastically affect the flow of your story (one thats super-early and super-gruesome), but Telltale does such a wonderful job of crafting its characters and story that telling the group who should do what feels epic and important even if the end result turns out the same no matter what. Thats why Episode 5 works so well; we know this is the end one way or another, and so does Lee. Theres no time to hem and haw about what to do  Lees on borrowed time and Clem is with a creepy dude. Make your decisions and go; Lee is more direct than ever, and you never know when one decision will be the last youll ever make for a character. The truly unexpected lies around every corner, and Telltale does an excellent job of playing with our pre-conceived notions as Walking Dead fans  teasing results we know but the character dont. When the pace does slow down, Telltale uses it as a chance to reflect on everything thats happened thus far and allows us to paint the picture as we see it. Explaining who Larry was to Omid and Krista can go a number of ways based on how you played Episode Two as well as how you feel about what happened. Conversing with Kenny about Duck and Kat plays out differently based on who you tried to save in Episode 1. A lot of the He or she will remember that snippets from Episode 1 through 4 come roaring back in Episode 5, and they make conversations interesting and definitely worth playing through again. The differences still get you to the same milestone moments, but it feels like a personal journey as the game references your specific actions. Gameplay-wise, this episode is what youve come to expect from the season. There arent difficult puzzles, and while theres more action, theres a healthy premium on talking. The framerate dropping in certain areas or the game stuttering before a scene change remain the only blemishes on a presentation front that includes fantastic voiceover work from the cast and some beautiful graphic novel-like art. I hear you knocking, but you can't come in. And then theres the largest zombie fight to date, an epic standoff, two great moments where the music swells, and a pair of one-on-one conversations you wont forget and I refuse to spoil here. The Walking Dead: The Game  Episode 5: No Time Left is a perfectly paced finale to a story weve all been invested in from the get go. I cried in the final minutes, sat silently through the credits, and was speechless after the epilogue, but the true impact of the episode came the morning after I beat it. Walking on the sun-bathed streets of San Francisco, I found that I couldnt get Clementine off my mind and a great melancholy off of my heart. I was sad to end up where I did, but happy to have taken this journey. THE VERDICT The Walking Dead: The Game  Episode 5: No Time Left has the same technical hiccups that have plagued the Telltale series, but theyre blown out of the water by the events experienced here. Lees final hours are some of this seasons best, and Episode 5 is the emotional finale fans deserve. The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 2: Starved for Help wasn't what I was expecting. Rather than focus on more walkers and more headshots, the game turns everything around and made me focus on the possible threat of other survivors. It made me focus on who Lee would actually be in this world -- the guy with morals or the guy doing what it takes to get by. I dug that; it's definitely a different experience than the first episode (including its additional technical issues), but that's what I want out of episodic content.", "date": "Nov. 20, 2012,"}
