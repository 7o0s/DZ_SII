Ending something isnt easy, but this is a storytelling team thats proved it knows how to stick the landing. Yet -- like The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Deads first season -- Episode 4 is an odd lull in a story thats built phenomenal momentum until now. Amid the Ruins, like many of The Walking Deads point-and-click adventure game episodes, focuses on the calmer, quieter side of surviving the zombie apocalypse. Its bursts of unexpected violence force main character Clementine to make difficult decisions that leave her, a young orphan, responsible for the safety of the people she cares about. In Amid the Ruins, that ever-growing number of characters starts to dwindle. It does not happen gracefully. People in Clementines life seem to exist solely so their departure can hurt her. Often, this makes for meaningful moments that define her as a character -- specifically the version of her that you create by responding to terrible situations and potentially worse people. Loss, specifically how Clementine processes and proceeds with it, remains the focus of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Amid the Ruins features plenty of loss, and some of the heavy decisions connected to them wield the same gut-punching power Telltale Games has become known for. Much of Amid the Ruins, however, felt like loss with little meaning, as though characters are being cut because the cast is too big, or they dont fit where the finale is going. Characters vanish so rapidly and unexpectedly that it robs The Walking Dead of certain emotional value. Some exits are cheap, while others are unjustified, feel forced, or are forgotten as quickly as they happened. Worse, some of those unsatisfyingly departed characters are replaced by new villains -- introduced out of nowhere, with no clear motivation -- who feel out of place, inappropriate, and somewhat cartoonish. In playing Amid the Ruins, I enjoyed discovering more about people weve spent little time getting to know. This episode spends a lot of time with Jane, the woman who helped Clem and her friends in Episode 3, as our young heroine learns about her past and takes lessons in killing zombies. Youll also see new conflicts arise between old friends and new. Resolving these problems is tense and satisfying as it always is, but most of it appears to be inconsequential by the end. Characters disregard unforgivable and unforgettable past events to focus on new problems, which lessened the impact of previous decisions Id made. One fantastic scene in particular shows a grieving, despondent character clearly contemplating suicide. The performance is genuine, and it creates a heavy air that made me as uncomfortable as the concerned friends around him. In the scenes that follow a new tension snaps them out of it, but this person never revisits their own trauma, and never resolves the serious personal problem with Clementine that I created previously. For the first time in this season, I dont believe in what certain people are doing fits with their character and their history. Meanwhile, although The Walking Dead: Season 2 has been building to something bigger for Clementine, it fizzles here by the end of Episode 4, the complex political drama thats been brewing between feuding sides all but evaporates. Bickering elders dont seem to weigh on Clementine as much as the grim things she has to do on her own. Shes starting to feel small, despite the big things shes doing. I dont know if thats a good or bad thing yet. Maybe thats the point. Perhaps the desperation and hopelessness of The Walking Deads bleak world is starting to overwhelm Clementines story -- one where a little girl begins to break, to give in, and give up on what little she has left. This could be where The Walking Dead is headed. Where its at, like the first episode of Season 2, is in an interesting place for one person, and spinning its wheels for most everyone else. Pros Clementines developmentMoving scenesCharacter exploration Cons Cheap deathsUnconvincing motivations As ever, Im confident in Telltale Games ability to tell a strong story and end it with panache, but Episode 4: Amid the Ruins is the weakest episode of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Despite its major changes -- both regarding Clementine as a character and the roles of those around her -- there are too many out-of-left-field events to build tension convincingly. Im excited for the conclusion -- but Im not in love with the way we got there.", "date": "July 23, 2014,"}
