At 6,500 frames per second with 130 inches per second tracking speed and a maximum polling rate of 1000Hz and a max of 5000 counts per inch, this mouse boasts formidable specs for any gamer. Design Straight out of the box, the non-textured satin black and grey finish makes the Strix Claw look like anything than a typical gaming mouse, until you plug it in and tweak it. On the front left side of the mouse theres the three DPI LED indicators which look like claw marks and glow orange when lit up. Youll find three programmable buttons, easily accessible with the thumb, the larger of them being a DPI clutch button. At the centre theres the clickable scroll-wheel and underneath that instant DPI switches, which offer quick access to shift the mouses sensitivity levels. The right side of the mouse features small grooves that act like a finger rest so you can avoid having part of your hand on the mouse mat when using the mouse. The Strix logo, which glows orange when plugged in is further under the central DPI switches at the center. The Strix Claw also features an angled braided-fibre cable that ends with the Strix signature distinctly styled gold-plated USB plug. Performance If youre a Mac user, this is probably not the right mouse for you as ASUS doesnt offer any software for Mac just yet; however as a PC gamer, theres a lot you can do with the Asus Strix Claw. Equally, if youre a leftie, you're going to be disappointed by the Claw as its ergonomically made for right handed users. Otherwise the mouse is nice to use, even if your grip varies depending on use. Weve had two weeks to take the mouse through its paces in a variety of environments including work and gaming. The one thing that can be annoying with cabled mice is the cable can get tangled up during use, but this isnt the case with the Strix Claw, most likely due to its cable being slightly angled up at point of connection. The cable pretty much stayed out of the way during use under most conditions. Its impressive that such a small tweak in design can be the end of tangled cables. Much like the Strix Tactic Pro, the Strix Claw offers two functioning modes to operate the mouse in. The driver-free mode enables users to store their favourite profiles within the mouse itself and thus use the mouse on any computer. The software mode allows for more adjustments to fine tune all aspects of the mouse, guaranteed to satisfy any gamer out there. The Strix software is where you can really tweak your mouse to your everyday needs. The software is easy to use and offers three main things to play with. The Customise menu offers easy set up for profiles as well as button-mapping (you can chose from several options in the drop down menu: mouse function, a Windows shortcut, multimedia command, a macro or you can just disable it completely). Here you can also time the DPI clutch, toggle it or set it as on/off, which is extremely handy for any games requiring sniping skills. In performance mode theres four DPI stages from 50 to 5000 that are adjustable in increments of 50. You can also change the X/Y sensitivity, change the Lift off Distance to suit your needs as well as choose the response time from either 125Hz, 500 or 1000Hz. Lighting mode is pretty simple - here you can turn the scroll wheel and the logo LEDs on or off, but sadly there isnt an option to change the colour scheme in any way. The software also allows users to calibrate the mouse for both ASUS mouse pads - Strix Glide Control and Strix Glide Speed, however the calibration works fine with non-ASUS pads as well. Obviously for best results it may be better to use ASUS own mousepads. Pros Impressive DPI ClutchErgonomic & comfortable design, suitable for long-time useAccurate sensorAngled-up cable prevents tangling Cons More lighting effects would be niceSurface is too smooth, which can get slippery with prolonged useMac OS software would be useful All in all, the Strix Claw mouse is an adequate entry into the gaming arena, and coupled with the Strix Tactic Pro, should make for a killer combo, especially if youre a fan of FPS games as the DPI clutch comes in handy. On the other hand, the surface and the edges of the mouse lacks rubberised parts that will prevent slippage during prolonged gaming periods. Still, the ASUS Strix is one great gaming mouse, and will certainly make any gamer happy.", "date": "Feb. 24, 2015,"}
