We take pride in agile bullet dodging, find satisfaction in heavy artillery, and delight in the hulking monstrosities that aim to kill us. Developer Cave is top gun of the genre, having delivered classics like Donpachi, Deathsmiles, and Espgaluda over the past two decades. We expect greatness from these guys, which is why their latest effort, Akai Katana, disappoints despite being enjoyable. Nearly 20 years after Donpachi, Akai Katana doesn't give us much new to do or admire. Think Gradius or R-type but with a lot more stuff on your screen, and you've got the basic idea of what Akai Katana is. Your task is to survive seven stages, end the boss at the conclusion of each, and -- if you're a real shooter player -- secure that high score. Anyone can eventually see the credits roll if they just continue enough times, but only the lonely can do it while minimizing their loss of life and maximizing their leaderboard position. I've played a bunch of Akai Katana, and I enjoy it, but I'm still not exactly sure how it all works. The game struggles to explain its intricate mechanics to the player, even with a tutorial video (Pro Tip: Hit ~B~ at the title screen). What I've gleaned is that there are two modes of fire that draw two different types of resources from enemies. One type can be spent to summon a phantom to fight for you, and when you deactivate the phantom the other type is spent to send giant swords -- the titular Blood Katanas -- flying across the screen causing massive damage and earning massive point bonuses for you. So there is a rhythm, a cadence to the gameplay. Fill one meter, switch to the other fire mode, fill another meter, summon phantom, unleash hell, repeat. Oh, and you have to dodge bullets all the while. It's an amusing affair that grows on you the more you play. But it's not quite enough to land Akai Katana in the upper echelon of 2D shooters.Ikaruga is cleverer. Sine Mora is more beautiful. The chunky vehicles remind me of Donpachi, but Akai Katana doesn't have a strong visual identity of its own. Enemy designs lack personality and too many opportunities for dazzling eye candy are missed. Just the Facts Three game modes: Original arcade mode, Slash Mode (optimized for Xbox 360), and super hard Climax Mode Online leaderboards and replays Local two-player co-op $40 That $40 price tag is Akai Katana's real handicap. Sine Mora is the better, more exciting, more interesting shooter in every way, and it's a $15 Xbox Live Arcade game. These cheap thrills might be more enticing if gamers could download them for cheap, but right now Akai Katana costs the same as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. CLOSING COMMENTS Akai Katana is a perfectly fun arcade shooter that unfortunately took a wrong turn on the way to your Xbox 360. What could have been an inexpensive downloadable game is a $40 retail product. Still, it's an enjoyable effort, if not an amazing one. Akai Katana has its own rhythm that, if followed, unleashes giant blood swords that crawl through every enemy in sight. So that's pretty cool.
