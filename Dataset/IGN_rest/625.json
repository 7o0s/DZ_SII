At a certain point, though, developer Fireproof Games splinters things in a major way, focusing not just on solving mysterious mechanisms, but on the way they work and how that affects the bigger-picture puzzle that is this series bizarre, but not totally lucid world. The Room 3 expands on the complexity of its previous puzzle design in novel ways. As ever, centerpiece puzzles come in the form of elaborate boxes that can be unlocked and unpacked using keys, cracked codes, and sound logic. The act of physically interacting with a touch-screen to manipulate the world adds a great, tangible sensation to solving these puzzles. The eyepiece gimmick from previous Room games  which allows you to see and manipulate things unseen  has been both downplayed and modified, and it works great all around. By emphasizing eyepiece puzzles less, The Room 3 focuses more on what-you-see-is-what-you-get sorts of solutions, encouraging you to physically engage with a brain-teaser rather than rely on super-powered solutions. That said, the upgraded eyepiece in The Room 3 adds a new super-powered solution I really enjoyed. Certain objects require that you get a deeper look inside them, and this eyepiece mod allows you to enter a small space and see it in a large way. I loved rotating a locking mechanism or series of spinning dials from the inside to affect something outside. Despite the otherworldly tone of The Room 3s atmosphere and its supernatural subtleties, these puzzles always make sense. Pieces shift and twist and come apart believably as you push and pull your way to the center of puzzles that are, at all times, tempting you to the next step in the solution. The tactile feedback of latches, levers, dials, and maps on a touch device goes a long way toward creating a convincing piece of equipment, too. Whats most fascinating about The Room 3 compared to its predecessors is its focus on larger, more involved solutions. Exploration plays a surprising and significant role in this, no longer alienating a puzzle to a single room (or floor of a building). A trinket discovered inside one box may permit access to another, which holds its own secrets. The Room 3 is a game all about these secrets, so much so that it rarely explains what, precisely, it is youre after. Im still uncertain, having finished The Room 3 in just under six hours that my pursuit of the Craftsman -- the unknown creator of these puzzles -- amounted to much. Then again, I received one of multiple endings, which Im eager to resolve as I enter this weird world again. In revisiting major areas in The Room 3, I realize how many Id left unfinished. Many pieces of set-dressing turn out to be fresh puzzles inessential to reaching The Room 3s end. Even when it was over, The Room 3 lured me back in with more brilliant mysteries. Regrettably its only the allure of the systems that hold my attention here, rather than the larger universe, with its unsettling atmosphere and uncertain story. The Room 2 hinted at something potentially fascinating, but never found its footing, and The Room 3 is equally adamant about remaining vague. Its almost intriguing to learn about why certain things are the way they are, but I remember next to nothing of the Craftsmans poetic notes. More than anything, Id like to earn a better finale so I gain context for the baffling, empty ending I earned in the first place. While playing The Room 3, I turned off the too-aggressive hint system, relying on it only when I found myself profoundly lost with where to take a new item, or what was hiding in plain sight. As I play more after the ending, at which point The Room 3 deactivates hints, I miss it dearly  only because Im constantly learning, and that struggle is among Fireproof Games greatest successes. Pros Marvelous puzzlesHuge scaleMultiple endingsGreat atmopshere Cons Hollow story The Room 3 is Fireproof Games most ambitious puzzle game yet. Solving puzzles across enormous spaces is incredibly satisfying, and theres so many varied things to think about, tools to tinker with, and systems to explore that Im still finding them after the ending. That ending contributed little to a potentially interesting universe that hopefully fleshes itself out in the post-game puzzles I cant wait to keep discovering.", "date": "Dec. 16, 2015,"}
