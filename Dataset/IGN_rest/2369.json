The company, now under the Logitech family, has been producing premium, high-quality headset for a long time, and it wouldnt be wrong to say that the Astro A40 headset had a huge hand in cementing their place at the top. With its attractive looks, great overall ergonomics (despite its chunky exterior), and finely tuned audio drivers, the A40s immediately caught attention and appreciation from fans looking for a solid audio device to fuel their long gaming sessions. The Astro A40 celebrated its 10th anniversary last year, and to commemorate the occasion, the company has released a special Astro A40 TR-X Edition that comes with the same old price tag of $150, but with a bold new red-navy blue color combination. While the headset still retains its old charms, I do wish the package was a little more attractive, or different, to ring in its glorious history. Design Much like the rest of the package, Astro plays it safe with A40 TR-X Editions design, which is pretty much identical to the Astro A40 TR I reviewed over two years ago. The most notable difference is, of course, the new color scheme. Its a bold choice, I must admit, as the color red is incredibly difficult to do it right and can easily cheapen the look and feel of the device. Astro does manage to pull it off, however, and tapers the loudness of the color with a combination of black and dark-navy blue to give it a somewhat muted, yet sleek and sophisticated presence. The A40 TR-X weigh in around 370g, which is definitely on the heavier side, but that doesnt translate into poor comfort. They do have a snug fit but the soft cloth-covered padding on the earcups eases the tension greatly and gives an extremely comfortable wear. I once had a 6hr long session of Red Dead Redemption 2 with the headset on and I barely noticed them on my head  they sort of blend away as you start to engage with your entertainment. Like the Astro A40 TR, the new TR-X Edition can also be customized with the $60 Mod Kits which comes with noise isolating leather ear cushions and voice isolating microphone. These mods are meant for those that play in pro-tournaments, or share their living room with others (because the A40s leaks sound...a lot). You can also swap the speaker tags with ones available on Astros website that represent other gaming brands, but the TR-X Edition looks cool enough on its own, so you probably wouldnt want to tinker around with its overall aesthetic all that much. The headset comes with two cables  a PC splitter extension, and a single 3.5mm cable that allows you to use the headset with the PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, a laptop, or any device with a headphone jack on it. Features-wise, thats about it which is quite disappointing. For its price, and especially as an anniversary edition, I expected Astro to include extra goodies to differentiate it from its other releases, and take this as an opportunity break the mold on its old design. Yet Astro sticks with the if it aint broken... mantra, and leaves the device with no extra features like surround sound (which many lower priced headsets now offer), EQ presets, or even a mic that auto-mutes itself when pulled away (this is still relegated to an in-line control). The TR-X Edition does not even come a MixAmp with its own special colorway, or a bundle at a special price, instead users can opt to buy the MixAmp separately, which ironically costs more than buying the Astro A40 TR + MixAmp Pro TR bundle. Performance There is little doubt about Astros audio prowess, and the A40 TR-X Edition delivers the same fantastic audio experience as the previous headsets in the series. Astros audio drivers are definitely geared towards gaming with a punchy bass extension and sharp highs, but they are also well-balanced for all kinds of music, and for movie watching experience, as well. The wholesome bass helps ring in the explosions and beats with equal heft, while the edgy highs renders gun fire and foot steps with pristine clarity. All of this doesnt hamper the mids at all, which comes across clear and forward. The semi open-back nature of the headset also gives the TR-X Edition some room to create a bigger soundstage than most closed-back headphones. This results in better sound positioning, giving players a helping hand in figuring out which direction, and at what distance, the enemies are approaching from in multiplayer games like Overwatch and Fortnite. The advantage did not make me a better player, of course, but it certainly helps with quicker response time to eminent danger. The microphone on the A40 also performs reasonably well. As you can hear from the sample below, there is a bit of compression in the voice and some tearing on the Ps and Bs but its largely clear and has good noise cancellation (despite not being a noise isolating mic) as it managed to mostly suppress my loud mechanical keyboard chipping away in the background. The mic is not the best I have heard but it is competent enough for online chat. Astro continues its tradition of releasing quality headphones with the Astro A40 TR-X Edition, which features familiar traits of the previous entries, like great comfort, excellent sound quality and wide compatibility. However, I was hoping for extra features that differentiated it not only from its previous entries, but also give it an edge over lower priced competitors that offer equally impressive audio experience with more features. A40 TR-X Editions hefty price tag of $150, with its current feature set, is no longer all that attractive when compared to competing brands.", "date": "Jan. 7, 2019,"}
