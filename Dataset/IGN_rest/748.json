When I first heard the premise of Night Light Interactives 2D puzzle-adventure game, I was intrigued. As I progressed through the surprisingly short story that is Whispering Willows, however, I realized that aside from some excellent audio work and cool art direction, there was little to hold my interest. The best idea of Whispering Willows is that our heroine Elena is able to astral-project herself into the spirit realm. This allows her to speak to other ghosts, possess and manipulate objects, and reach areas that she cant get to in her corporeal form. It makes me wonder why that promising mechanic is so underutilized. The whole point of astral projection is to place yourself outside of your body and view the world from a new perspective, but Whispering Willows doesnt seem to fully take advantage of that. While this idea is definitely present in many of the puzzles that require Elena to leave her body, more often than not my time was spent simply walking from one area to another and looking for an item that would unlock a new door, diminishing the importance of the out-of-body mechanic. The longest puzzle is a hedge maze, and the challenge is less about opening the right door and finding the right item than it is just trying to remember how the hell you got here in the first place. Its just not terribly inventive. Where Whispering Willows excels is in its aesthetic. The sound design for each area of the estate is decidedly creepy, from Elenas soft footfalls echoing off a creaking staircase to the rustling of leaves in the wind. Coupled with the somber tones of the score, it does far more to put us on edge than the cartoonish visages of the various ghosts do. The environments also give off a haunting feeling of foreboding, with candles and gas lamps casting eerie shadows across the derelict backgrounds. The character designs are interesting, and work well in the hand-drawn style - though the artwork loses its charm in the stiff motion-graphic-style cutscenes. Elenas story isnt exactly breaking new ground, either. Searching for her missing father was decent enough motivation for me to start guiding Elena on her journey through Wortham Willows crumbling mansion and the surrounding estate, but the lack of twists, turns, or interesting characters to encounter failed to keep me invested for even the three or four hours it took to complete Whispering Willows. There are a number of notes and journal entries to collect that expand on the story of the victimization of Elenas Native American ancestors at the hands of Willows and his band of settlers - some of which even posed some interesting ideas about whether or not its possible for someone to be genuinely good or evil. Unfortunately, these notes dont seem to tie back into gameplay in any way, and simply provide additional reading material. While finding them definitely helps pad out under-developed characters, they didnt leave any lasting impression on me. Pros Astral projectionArt & sound Cons Short, without substanceEmpty storyEasy puzzles Whispering Willows is not without its strengths - it sounds great, is (for the most part) visually interesting, and there are a lot of good story ideas and potentially interesting puzzle concepts in play. However, thanks largely to a woefully short campaign and a lack of truly challenging puzzles, it ultimately doesnt manage to create a particularly fulfilling experience.", "date": "July 5, 2015,"}
