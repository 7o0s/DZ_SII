Bursting at the seams with veiny biceps and draped in American flags, Broforce is a love letter to action cinema carved into lead, fired into the corpse of the nearest copy of Contra, and then brought to life via dark magic. Its so obvious, really; a squad of Earths greatest heroes (and heroines)  most of whom are only a typo away from a thick wad of cease-and-desist letters  against the worst that international terrorism, the galaxy, and the underworld itself can throw at humanity. Frankly, its bloody fantastic (and spectacularly bloody). Unforgiving but (mostly) fair, frantic yet tactical, and oozing with 16-bit 2D charm, if Broforce had been released two decades ago I expect it probably wouldve been the greatest thing to happen to me since puberty. In 2015 the effect is a little less life-altering, but Broforce remains an incredibly confident, refined, unique, and content-rich run n gun shooter for up to four co-op players. The objective of most levels is simple; you just need to blast and/or dart your way through several different locations and very literally get to the chopper. Some of the later levels change this up somewhat as the enemies segue from enemy soldiers to aliens, and later again to supernatural nasties, but thats the general gist. I love how hilariously dim-witted the regular enemy mooks are but, as just one shot will kill you, you still need to play with precision. The difficulty spikes a few times across the final campaign stages, but its certainly in step with the sorts of games that have clearly inspired it. My only major criticism is that I noted some odd slowdown during a couple of periods where a great many alien enemies had pinned themselves in a small area on screen. Welcome to the Party, Pal Broforces nearly completely destructible environments put a creativity-enabling twist on proceedings. Blast through walls to access buildings and get the drop on the baddies inside, or fire through the ground itself to tunnel beneath potential engagements. I found that particularly useful against the large, fire-spitting, worm-like bosses; you can create tunnels to get right up against the still-buried parts of their bodies and use the intact terrain above to temporarily protect you from their ranged attacks. The sheer amount of explosive objects on screen means destruction gets pretty wild with other players involved so Ive actually found myself preferring to play it solo, where you control the pace yourself. Theres also a dedicated deathmatch mode for those of you whod rather work against one another than together; its perhaps a little too chaotic for my tastes, but its a laugh in short bursts. Beyond that theres even an intimidating level editor, but if youre too daunted to try that out you can simply browse through and quickly and easily load community-made levels. The large team of varied bros themselves are the big stars, and there are plenty of them. Rambro, Brommando, B.A. Broracus, Double Bro Seven, The Brofessional; by now youre probably picking up on the theme. The bros are quick and nimble and theres a good level of nuance in the controls; bros can grab walls and climb indefinitely, and automatically execute a handy flip when youre trying to jump up and around a ledge above. Theyre little more than small blobs of pixels, but the way in which each has been lovingly imagined and crafted is evident in the art that splashes on screen each time you unlock a new bro and the quaint little animated profile pics. Hasta la Vista, Baby Whats particularly great about Broforce is that every time you die youre forcibly swapped to a random new bro, and each of them has distinctly different weapons and abilities and require a different approach. Some are melee-focused, some have powerful, short-range weapons, some can fire longer distances, and at least one seems completely useless (yes, Im speaking about you, Brocketeer). Some are better at using their speed to scamper past clumps of enemies, and some have the firepower to duke it out with the baddest of bad guys. Some are faster at chewing through the destructible scenery to create new paths and avoid conflicts and traps, and some have incredibly potent secondary abilities that beg to be exploited at every opportunity. Several of my favourite bros are amongst the latter; Time Bro can slow down time to a crawl (extremely handy against bosses), Brominator has an endoskeleton form that makes him temporarily invulnerable, and Bro Hearts Freedom battle cry sends enemies running (perfect if youre being swarmed). I often wished I could swap to my preferred bro at will, especially prior to some of the tougher bosses, but I do concede that making do with the abilities of your given bro is part of the fun. It certainly takes the edge off of repeated failures, knowing that every time youll spawn as a new bro who might be better suited to the challenge ahead. The fact that rescuing hostages gains you an extra life but changes your on-screen bro (and is the way you unlock new bros) also creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic; do I trade Time Bro for the extra life and a random new character, or do I stick it out? I gleaned a great deal of joy discovering the more subtle characteristics of the bros, too. The way the Brodators spears stay lodged in the environment for you to jump on, or the way his body explodes if hes defeated in battle. The way the death of one of the Boondock Bros (who come as a pair, or a trio alongside their father if you activate him) enrages the surviving brother and causes him to flash red and fire his pistols far more rapidly. The fact that the Chuck Norris-inspired Brodell Walkers melee attack is a roundhouse kick, or that Time Bros is a classic JCVD split kick. Broforce is a parody done with a lot of reverence. Ash Brolliams even drops into later levels alongside an exploding Oldsmobile. I also really love Broforces attention to the smaller details of its presentation, from the way the profile pics of each bro bounce as they run and are lit up with muzzle flashes as they fire their weapons, to the enemy kill count at the end of each level (which is usually a conga line of exploding bodies, like nuking a large group of tightly-packed Lemmings). I highly rate the sound, in particular the pitch-perfect glam rock guitar score and hilarious enemy squeals and death gurgles and its constantly screaming narrator. Pros Tight and variedPacked with fan-serviceEndless user levelsAwesome soundtrack Beneath Broforces hyperbolic chest-thumping action movie-inspired silliness lies an extremely polished run n gun platformer. Simple and reliable but nuanced and ever-changing (thanks to the constantly rotating characters) Broforce is testosterrific. It you could watch Commando on a SNES, this is what it would look like.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2015,"}
