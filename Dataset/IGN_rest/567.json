Episode 1 of the new game, which will be released throughout the year and is simply called Hitman, contains a classic-style imaginative sandbox for lethal shenanigans, and the smoother movement controls of 2012s Hitman: Absolution. Theres definitely the beginnings of something that may well emerge as a worthy successor to cult favourite Hitman: Blood Money here, although the AI is certainly still a few sandwiches short of a picnic and the PS4 version has displayed a mild smattering of technical snags so far. Hitman certainly doesnt waste time getting to it; the very brief opening cutscene during the prologue quickly gives way to a duo of straightforward training missions that provide your first taste of the revamped disguise system. The flawed disguise mechanic from Absolution has been mercilessly double-tapped and plonked in a dumpster; in Hitman the right disguise will fool most of those around you indefinitely, and is not tied to an in-game ability resource. For instance, in the second training level an aircraft mechanics duds will permit 47 to stroll directly into the COs office, collect a VIP, and assassinate him during a phony safety check that culminates in a deadly ejector seat, er, accident. In the Paris level, disguising yourself as a revered male model with an uncanny resemblance to 47 (make up and all) will allow you to access virtually every area of the building without being searched and secure a private meeting with one of the marks. The ability to truly hide in plain sight is a considerable part of what makes this new game feel like a classic Hitman game again, even if a lot of the fun still relies on the nave AI being easy to exploit. I appreciated some of the small tweaks to NPC AI  for instance, in the Paris level guards will first escort you from restricted areas rather than display the more binary shoot-to-kill attitude of, say, Blood Money  and Hitman so far does a fine job of making its levels feel bustling and alive with people who have places to be and duties to perform. However, it is still the sort of experience that will let you lure a steady stream of nearby people, one by one, into a quiet bathroom with the sound of a repeatedly tossed crowbar (and its hard to argue their reactions to the growing pile of unconscious men in their underwear they each find inside are especially convincing). Suit Up While Hitman encourages multiple attempts at missions to discover all the different possibilities they offer I didnt find myself particularly compelled to return to the training levels. I think it may be because the levels themselves are presented as somewhat hastily constructed and partially unpainted sets (and all the NPCs are ostensibly actors). I didnt really connect with these fake levels. Episode 1s Paris level, however, is a different story. Paris is the main meal of Episode 1. Huge, dense, and absolutely brimming with devious ways to get the job done, Paris is like an enormous onion of assassination potential; each layer stripped reveals another. There are two targets, each with a whole host of ways to die. Over many, many playthroughs Ive poisoned, choked, shot, sniped, drowned, and crushed my victims  once with an overhead lighting rig and once by pushing one target over a balcony to crush the other below  and Ive still got untried methods to attempt. You can either explore, experiment, and eventually stumble across them in the environment, or get some killer pro-tips from the menu that details all the bonus points to be gleaned from snuffing out your targets in these varied ways. The new Opportunities menu will also help you track down the steps to pull off some of the zanier hits. I found myself using a combination of both improvisation and getting inspiration from the game, though purists should note you can turn off in-game advice if you want to discover everything for yourself. I was initially concerned about just how much gameplay wed be able to milk from one level but its quite admirable the mileage Io Interactive squeezes out of a single environment. I certainly feel like Ive mastered this Paris level more than all but my most-favourite classic Hitman series missions, and thats perhaps the point. Every time you complete the hits youre rewarded with new gear and new mission starting locations, which adds greatly to replayability. You need to replay the mission a lot to work through all the fatal outcomes so it helps that you can choose to begin undercover in various places around the building rather than walking through the front door dozens of times. It especially important because again, besides the small training levels, this is the only map you get right now. We'll Always Have Paris The customisable Contracts Mode also returns from Absolution and it feels like a better fit here than it was in the smaller, linear levels of the previous game. Its quite simple to create and share your own hits by playing through the levels and marking NPCs as targets, and theres already a small stream of user-created missions available. After playing the Paris level so many times I did, however, find myself a little lukewarm on the idea of going back into it looking for new targets. Perhaps a few months down the track, when the game has more available maps, Contracts Mode will be a more appealing way to revisit these levels. Easily my biggest gripe on PS4 is the absolutely murderous loading times (over 60 seconds on occasions) and the general sluggishness of the menu screens (during my play sessions theyve also developed an odd inability to actually load the required thumbnail images on-screen). When it comes to the Paris level the loading times are lengthy in all contexts, whether youre loading it for the first time or simply starting from a recent save after being killed or messing up. You can save at will but it becomes deeply frustrating the more you attempt to prod the games simulation and experiment with outcomes, knowing messing up will trigger another long loading screen. Im also confused by the fact saves made playing Hitman in its connected, online state arent compatible in the games offline environment. If youre booted offline during play youll be yanked from your mission, wherever you are. Id also recommend opting for the locked framerate in the options. The Paris map in particular is crammed with authentic detail, especially the backstage area packed with strutting models, busy stylists, cluttered make-up tables, and mirrors everywhere. The lightning is terrific too, and the runway at the centre of the show itself is a fantastic showcase for it, but overall I found I preferred the stability and smoothness of a locked frame rate over, say, the slight fluttering that would sometimes occur when panning across large crowds. Pros Dense and detailedCreativity is well rewardedExtremely replayable Cons Dreadful loading timesAI is easily exploited One things for sure: The more I've played Hitmans debut episode the more I've enjoyed it. Despite the often boneheaded AI and dire loading times, Hitman has definitely combined the best of both worlds. Theres scope for it to improve in some areas as the levels are released throughout the year but this is a fun, confident start.", "date": "March 10, 2016"}
