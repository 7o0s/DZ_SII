It's a product of its time, an era where game design relied on a simple joy we enjoyed 25 cents at a time. Difficulty led to death, which made players pump more quarters into the cabinet, and then they continued walking, gut-punching, and turkey-eating on their merry way. Brawlers tended to not last very long, whether out of creative laziness, memory capacity, or the thirst for those delicious coins. As a result, the vivid memory of bashing bad dudes would last years and eventually foster nostalgia. Fable Heroes, like so many others this generation, aims to recapture yesteryear's idea of entertainment. And, like so many others this generation, it fails to do so because it lacks the ambition to do anything with a genre that's remained mostly unchanged for decades. On one hand, Heroes brings plenty of delightfully Fable things to the table. It's exemplary of developer Lionhead's love for its irreverent franchise, and how much fun it's willing to have with the world of Albion. On the other hand, Heroes disappoints in the same way only Fable can. Watch the whimsy. Fable Heroes is archaic and sterile in numerous ways. Its combat requires nothing more than mindless mashing of a couple buttons, and its linear 3D world leaves little room for exciting variables. Players walk, kill enemies, and take one of two paths to the end of a level. It's a dull means of progression, though the choice at the end is a cute nod to Fable. That said, and true to form, there are consequences to picking either the high or low road. One route leads to the level's final big bad, which always consists of a big, freaky monstrosity. Troll, spider, robot, whatever. These fights unfold almost identically each time. The beast leaps, smashes, and summons minions for five straight minutes as your team pummels it. Five minutes is hardly a long time, but when each boss battle takes as long as the stage preceding it, that's a problem. These guys are annoying as they have far too much health. Our co-op group walked into Fable Heroes thrilled to have it in our hands, and we completed the first level exhausted and ready to throw in the towel. Everything about this looks amazing. It's...fine. All right. OK. This is before we discovered the results of each alternate route: abhorrent mini-games you played in Mario Party more than a decade ago. Whether you go left or right at the end of a cave, mountain, or village setting, you're rolling the dice and walking into an unenjoyable boss fight or a pointless mine cart race. The most important issue at hand is that the moment to moment goings-on of Fable Heroes simply doesn't feel good. Characters have a sluggish, floaty feel to their actions, as if they're navigating and attacking while underwater. This is worsened by a handful of power-ups that either slow time or your movement speed, too -- and those are the good abiliities, never mind the negative pick-ups that sap your earned coins. Really? That currency contributes to an RPG upgrade system, of course. Players roll dice to move spaces on the upgrade board, which determines the kind of enhancement they're able to purchase. Given the basic nature of Fable Heroes' combat, it's surprising to see such an elaborate upgrade system. Damage enhancements include general percentage boosts, as well as improvements dedicated to specific enemies or levels. Characters unlock here as well, and each has a style to call their own. What's more, players willing to pour the extra hours into discovering everything Heroes has to offer can add more spaces to the board game system, which further adds to its depth. The effect of these upgrades isn't apparent until after you've completed the game, which means they're pretty much pointless in the short-term. Maxed-out fighters don't feel markedly different even into the final level (which doesn't do anything to glorify your adventure, but rather ends with yet another whimper). If you've found yourself enjoying Fable Heroes by the time the Dark mode unlocks after the credits, however, you're in for a treat. The upgrade board takes forever if everyone has multiple dice. The already impressive art in Fable Heroes, with its rich colors, thick lines, and fine cartoon detail, goes above and beyond in Dark Albion, a more difficult version of the original campaign. The aesthetic changes completely, and the once cheery fields of Albion adopt a gloomy but gorgeous look. The green sky, purple haze, ash mist, and glum caverns show an even more exciting side to an already excellent rendition of Albion. For the most part, form follows function in Fable Heroes. It is what it is, and it's competent enough to achieve its goal as a simple little beat-'em-up set in a stylized interpretation of Albion. That's where Heroes starts and stops, though, and everything in between serves to undermine its mediocrity. Not in a strong enough way to make it unplayable, just enough to reinforce your fears that it won't take strides to do anything interesting. It's a great little Fable thing with a lot of great stuff for fans to find and enjoy -- it's just buried beneath the grind of an uninspired action game. CLOSING COMMENTS Fable Heroes has a big-deal developer taking a chance on something that should be a sure-fire hit. By putting more Fable heart than good-game soul into its work, however, Lionhead compromised its experiment. The playful visuals hardly compensate for old ideas and mundane action. Hardcore Fable nerds may find something of interest by drudging through the brief campaign. Its an amusing but empty distraction.
