A freeway-scale jumble of giant orange raceways, jumps, and loops across which you spill the contents of a dozen of the worlds greatest car museums. Actually youve definitely heard it before, because Playground Games did the same thing not all that long ago, in 2017s much-loved Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels expansion. Sadly, thats been delisted for some time now, so were all fortunate that Playground is putting the pedal to the Mattel all over again for its first expansion for Forza Horizon 5. Granted, driving supersized toy cars isnt as surprising and novel as it was the first time around, but with the power of Forza Horizon 5 behind it and a progression system that pushes you to play with every toy in the box, its better than ever.While Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels is similar to Forza Horizon 3s version on the surface, there are a few key differences that quickly become apparent. The big one is that progression is gated in a new way, first restricting us to cars from B-class or below. The higher classes arent unlocked until you progress through each phase of competition in the Hot Wheels Academy. This does stop us from taking out our fastest cars immediately but its a system I like because of how it encourages me to think more about the cars I have in the lower performance class and reengage with them, dusting off old favorites. So even though there doesnt seem to be quite the same amount of things to do as there are in Forza Horizon 4s LEGO expansion, rather than having people immediately gravitate to the fastest handful of cars in the enormous vehicle roster, Horizon 5 Hot Wheels accomplishes the opposite. The expansion gives us the hulking new Hot Wheels-inspired Baja Bone Shaker straight off the bat, but were not restricted to it; any B-class car from your own garage will be sufficient initially.The nine other cars this expansion adds are a real grab bag of models, though there are only three more overtly Hot Wheels-themed ones: the angular and aggressive Bad to the Blade, the fan-favourite Deora II, and a Hot Wheels-branded COPO Camaro. The remainder are pretty random and, while I am a true fan of the Brabham BT62, there admittedly doesnt appear to be any tangible Hot Wheels synergy with them. It does feel a bit like six cars that were simply going to be ready come the arrival of the pack rather than six cars that feel like theyre necessarily designed to be here.What We Said About Forza Horizon 5Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. Its also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads  no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. Its an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexicos world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. Its a long haul, MMO-inspired racer thats exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map  and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you dont want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game Ive ever played.  Luke Reilly, November 4, 2021Score: 8Read the full Forza Horizon 5 reviewOrange you glad?The real star of the show here is the mega map itself, which is both larger than the Forza Horizon 3 version, and also higher; its a floating quartet of themed islands miles above Mexico, meaning the vista is a spectacular blanket of fluffy, white clouds. Combining that brilliant backdrop with the fabulous level of detail in the scuffed and translucent orange tracks arcing and weaving through the map makes for an unsurprisingly gorgeous-looking racing game. Its certainly capable of some genuinely stunning moments, particularly careening into the active volcano for the first time and racing across a bubbling, lava-filled lake.It's certainly capable of some genuinely stunning moments, particularly careening into the active volcano for the first time and racing across a bubbling, lava-filled lake.Hot Wheels for Horizon 5 also adds several track types that werent present in the Horizon 3 version, including ice tracks, magnet tracks, wild water flumes, and long straights slung out under enormous fans that will help propel your cars to speeds Ive never hit in a Forza game before. The added track types inject some pleasing variety, and the magnet tracks in particular seem well-positioned to create some incredible, stomach-churning drops without cars losing contact with the road and crashing at the base. Playground has also chucked in a decent pile of new Hot Wheels track pieces into its Event Lab creation tools, meaning we can actually build fresh stretches of legitimate Hot Wheels track from one of several deliberately unfinished stubs on the map. The pieces snap together automatically when near enough to each other in an intuitive fashion, but Ive found theres a fair bit of trial and error involved in selecting the right pieces, which are twisted and bent in subtly different ways. Its finicky, but I think theres a lot of potential here (particularly for patient and talented creators whove previously built very imaginative stunt tracks in Forza Horizon 5 itself with more limited construction pieces) although it definitely doesnt boast the same granular level of control to stretch, shrink, and warp track as the frankly incredible track builder in Hot Wheels Unleashed does. Returning to a well the Playground team previously tapped with the killer Hot Wheels expansion for Forza Horizon 3 means Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels isnt able to arrive with the same infectiously unique splash, but its clear why the decision was made to return to this idea: Forzas high-speed brand of life-sized, toy-themed stunt racing is still a riotous good time. Were certainly in a golden era for Hot Wheels-themed racing games right now, with Milestones surprisingly brilliant Hot Wheels Unleashed successfully carving up its own patch of orange plastic as well, but Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels is an essential expansion for new and returning Forza fans.", "date": "July 22, 2022,"}
