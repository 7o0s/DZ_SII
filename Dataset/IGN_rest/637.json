It wouldnt be a Game of Thrones story if there werent bloodshed, tragedy, and well-intentioned people meeting terrible ends despite heroic efforts. But now that Episode 6: The Ice Dragon is over, and with it the first season of Telltales Game of Thrones series, I dont think this type of no-win scenario works as well for a game built around our choices as it does for a set-in-stone book or TV show. Especially when so much is left unresolved in the service of the possibility of an unannounced second season; its just unsatisfying. [Note: A Telltale representative points us to their 2013 press release announcing a ~multi-year, multi-title~ deal with HBO, but would not confirm a second Game of Thrones season.] The best thing about The Ice Dragon is how the split between Asher and Rodrik Forrester that happened at the end of episode 5 is handled. Both have entire major scenes the other doesnt see, including some emotional moments of restrained mourning. Though the final outcome is very similar, its worth replaying this relatively lengthy two-hour episode to see how each brother handles the action-heavy final confrontation with the Whitehills. Those fights are elaborate and gory, but mechanically no different from the usual Telltale style quick-time events weve been doing since the beginning. Meanwhile, Garreds quest to find the mysterious North Grove reaches its conclusion, but the story still fails to explain why this place is supposedly so important beyond vague promises that It has great power. We do get a stomach-churning uncomfortable choice to make here, but its robbed of its significance when the season ends before anything significant comes of it one way or another. The new characters introduced here reveal an interesting secret, at least. Watch the season finale trailer above. The biggest disappointment comes from Mira Forresters story, which has been a highlight of the season up until this point. Her efforts in Kings Landing to marshal assistance for the Forresters back at Ironrath through political maneuvering and navigating verbal minefields laid out by the Lannisters and Margaery Tyrrel made me eager to see how it would tie back into the Forresters plight. So I was very disappointed when it didnt - at all. Seemingly important decisions, such as whether to keep the knife or throw it away, ended up being completely irrelevant. The twist reveal of the villain whos been plotting against her is a high point, and the choices shes presented with are weighty, but again, the season ends in an unsatisfying place. Pros Asher and Rodrik's pathsGut-wrenching decisions Cons Too little resolutionMira's story fizzlesNorth Grove unexplained We knew this wasnt going to end in happiness for the Forresters - if it had, Id be crying foul that it didnt feel like Game of Thrones at all. The problem is that sense of inevitability mixes with the lack of resolution for major parts of the plot in an unappealing way. Most of what this uneven season finale has to offer is found in a few strong moments and continued hope for answers to questions in a hypothetical season 2.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2015,"}
