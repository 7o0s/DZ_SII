The leisurely plot involving a kidnapped archaeologist, however, is a drag that answers few questions. It pits the core teen superhero team against members of The Light, the shows shadowy cabal of supervillains, in a bland, unsurprising action RPG that has little to do with the series continuity or mythology. ~Did we time-travel back to a game with 2003's graphics?~ Legacy plays like a stripped-down version of X-Men Legends or Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, but with fewer characters to choose from and dull, repetitive level design. Before tackling each of the 15 levels, you select a group of three heroes from Young Justices paltry roster of teen sidekicks that includes Nightwing (formerly Robin), Kid Flash, Superboy, Miss Martian, Aqualad, and Artemis. These six characters are available from the start with another four unlocking as you play the story. Want to play as Beast Boy or Rocket? Youll have to beat Legacy on its two difficulty settings first, which is a shame since theyre also two of the most fun characters to play as. (Four extra characters from Season 2 can also be bought as DLC, but given the relatively small roster, they shouldve been unlockables.) The idea of making Young Justice as a squad-based RPG is a good one, and Legacy starts to shine during combat. Each character has three different super-powered attacks based on their unique abilities and a fourth buff that gives them a temporary advantage, such as Miss Martians invisibility or Nightwings enhanced critical strikes. Unleashing the kids powers on groups of henchmen is the best part of playing, like using Kid Flashs whirlwind to inflict damage on multiple enemies or knocking back enemies with Superboys ground bash. The controls can be unresponsive at times, though, and you may find yourself wondering why you cant do something during the heat of battle, such as charging up a heavy punch. It's also just plain dumb that non-powered characters like Artemis and Robin can lift barrels and toss crates just as easily as Superboy. On Earth-16, the crate and barrel industry is a front for supervillains. If youre looking for a game with group combos... keep looking. Except for a charged group power attack (that consists of the three on-screen heroes taking a stance of intense constipation together that acts like a smart bomb), the characters powers dont play off of each other. There arent even the obvious nods to DC continuity; partnering Nightwing with Legacys two other members of the Bat-family, Batgirl and Tim Drakes Robin, for levels set inside Halys Circus - you know, the place where Nightwings parents were murdered - elicits no references to his acrobat past or team bonus for getting the Bat-brats together in Gotham City. Legacy can be played solo or with up to two other players locally or online, which tends to be more fun and makes it easier to coordinate attacks and get heals from characters like Miss Martian and the magician Zatanna. Six ancillary challenge missions unlock as you play the story campaign that task your group with surviving waves of enemies, but otherwise adds nothing new or interesting to the experience besides competing in online leaderboards. Artemis and her dad, Sportsmaster, have the most awkward family reunions. Aside from the powers, though, the rest of the gameplay sucks the life out of Legacy. The formulaic levels usually follow a single path periodically sprinkled with groups of bad guys. Sometimes there are fake walls to bust down to uncover secret areas, but for the most part the journey is just one long, monotonous trek through hallways, jungle paths, desert paths, rocky paths, ice-laden paths oh, and Gotham City docks with paths. With few exceptions, like perhaps the closing missions set in the fictional country of Bialya, the environments, enemies, and objects are reused so often that the levels are barely distinguishable from each other except for their settings. The levels are the filler before you can get to Legacys uneven boss battles. Some, like the showdown with The Riddler where you merely have to smash colored boxes on his lethal roulette wheel, are quite easy, while others, like the battle with the assassin Cheshire are more difficult and require true teamwork. Tangling with The Lights villains are highlights in Legacy, but mostly because they liven up an otherwise dull experience. Poor Beast Boy only gets out to play when you've beaten Young Justice: Legacy's story on Normal difficulty. Even though its release was delayed a few times, Young Justice: Legacy also seems unfinished. For example, levels contain treasure chests that dont appear to give you anything when opened. Perhaps they contain the credits you earn to purchase WayneTech gear between missions for buffing your abilities, but theres no visual or audio cue that youve picked up anything. Bugs are plentiful, such as characters getting locked behind doors or stuck in the scenery, and I was able to beat at least one boss because he just got stuck in a run animation and didnt bother fighting back anymore. And then there are the visuals. Oh, my sweet Jim Lee...the pixilated graphics are previous-gen at best, and I wouldve thought I was playing this on the first Xbox or the PlayStation 2 if I didnt know better. Especially egregious are some of the cinematics that are so stiff and amateurish that they look like pre-vis prototypes, and a long way off from matching the animated quality of the TV series. Even with the resolution cranked out to its max on the PC, this game can be so ugly at times that a friend actually gasped in revulsion when he saw what was on my screen. At least Legacy has some quality voice acting, provided by the cast of the Young Justice series. That and the rousing music score might nearly make Legacy worth playing for diehard fans of the show, but this lost chapter comes too late and in too shoddy a condition to be worth the effort. Pros Cool power effectsGreat voice acting Cons Tedious level designDull storyUgly graphics Crushing disappointment is a feeling superhero fans know well. You get your hopes up that a game will capture the action and flavor of your favorite comic book, movie, or (in this case) animated TV series, only to play something that doesnt quite come close to resembling the brilliance of the source material. Thats the case with Young Justice: Legacy, a listless, unattractive squad-based action RPG that squanders its heroic potential.", "date": "Dec. 12, 2013,"}
