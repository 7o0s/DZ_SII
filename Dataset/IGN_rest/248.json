I had a bunch of theories around what Playground Games follow-up to the excellent Blizzard Mountain was going to be, and they were all wrong. What we got instead is a high-octane fever dream of life-sized toys and upside-down racing, and a surprisingly drastic departure from Forza Horizons established norms. Preposterous, incongruous, and completely and utterly outrageous. And I love it. The Hot Wheels expansion apes Blizzard Mountains progression system, which awards stars specific to levels of success in events. Simply complete a race and youll receive a single star. You can net two stars by actually winning it, and three stars by winning it and fulfilling one extra condition. I actually reached the Hot Wheels finale event largely on the back of completing all the available Bucket List challenges, drift zones, speed traps, and jumps (most of which seemed quite forgiving) and few actual races, but there is no shortage of the latter. As in the main game and Blizzard Mountain they can be completed as bespoke events or as part of longer championships. Getting to the final Goliath race wont take returning players long, but completing every race will take a lot longer. The Blueprint system that allows us to customise our own races still exists in Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels, but its been reimagined as Stunt Swap and allows us to trade out pieces of predetermined track for various stunt segments, like loops, dips, crossovers, and such. The effect of swapping these sections isnt especially drastic, though; were not talking about Trackmania levels of custom tracks, here. It's actually really, really hard to see out of. The 11 cars added in Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels are crackers. The Hot Wheels Bone Shaker and custom 2005 Mustang are returning rides (they first arrived as DLC for Forza Motorsport 6), as is the 2010 Pagani Zonda R (although it hasnt been seen since Forza Motorsport 4/Forza Horizon on Xbox 360). Whats left is a typically eclectic bunch of vehicles that youd be hard-pressed to find in any other racing game, from the special Hilux former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May drove to the North Pole, to the record-setting and relatively unknown Valiant Charger E49. There are also two more unique Hot Wheels models  the Twin Mill and the Rip Rod. If youre a little precious about fantasy cars cluttering up your Forza experience, dont be; like the Bone Shaker and 2005 Mustang, these are also Hot Wheels models that have made the jump from die cast cars to real-life (the real-life, fully-functioning Twin Mill debuted at the 2001 SEMA show and is powered by a pair of 502 Big Block for an estimated 1,400 total horsepower). Theres a barn find here, too, which I wont spoil  but hot rodders should love the customisation options. Back in 2011, pro racer, stunt driver, and X-Games gold medallist Tanner Foust successfully launched his Team Hot Wheels trophy truck further than any other four-wheeled vehicle in history. He did it from a giant jump assembled at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, built to appear like a life-sized length of bright orange Hot Wheels track. Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels is Fousts enormous toy ramp surrounded by a city-sized network of equally insane stunt tracks: a bedroom floor on an unlimited budget. Whats not to love? A delightful, daring, and different expansion that reinforces Forza Horizon 3s reputation as one of the best racing games ever made.", "date": "May 14, 2017,"}
