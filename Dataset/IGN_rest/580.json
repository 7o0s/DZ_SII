Heres what we said then: Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesnt need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just one more match, even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds. Six months after its initial release, developer Psyonixs feel-good, easy-to-pick-up, impossible-to-put-down, breakout success has finally arrived on Xbox One. This new port of Rocket League packages the same fast-paced action along with new Xbox-exclusive themed cosmetic items, and three of the previously-released downloadable content packs, making it the best value for first-time buyers who want to go all in on Rocket League and its extra content. The special formula that makes Rocket League so good has made the jump to Microsofts console completely intact. Hitting pitch to tumble through the air to make impossibly angled shots, and pull off clutch saves is as exhilarating as ever, and the constant stream of unlockable cosmetics and vehicles  including the Halo and Gears-of-War-themed machines  mean even in a loss I still felt like progress was made. That being said, Rocket League on Xbox One probably isnt worth revisiting for veteran players whove already spent hours ripping across its neon-coated arenas. Its the same great gameplay to be sure, without the cross-platform matchmaking that PS4 and PC players enjoy, so its hard to call this the definitive version. And though connection instability causes noticeable rubberbanding from time to time, which can really screw up a shot at the worst possible time, the server-side issues are no worse than the original release and usually resolve when jumping into a new match. Pros Feel-good controlsFast, frenzied matchesSurprising strategyCosmetic unlockables Cons Server Hiccups Rocket League on Xbox One brings the same excitement to a whole new audience. Though its missing cross-platform play here, its totally deserved success to-date ensures that matchmaking lobbies are still filled with players. With its already budget price, and bonus DLC content thrown in, theres never been a better time to pick up Rocket League.", "date": "Feb. 24, 2016,"}
