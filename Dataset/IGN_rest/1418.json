Swimming around feels like something you should have been doing your entire life, and its just plain wonderful. Cold Stream, Left 4 Dead 2s new community-created map turned official DLC, is much less like its frigid namesake and much more like a soothing warm-water swim. It feels just about right. You know Left 4 Dead 2. You know how great it is. You still shoot hundreds of zombies, co-op style, on your way through a series of maps to get to a safe point where you can rest and reload. Special zombies like the Spitter and the Hunter are still around to screw with your plans, Tanks will still ambush you at the worst possible moments, and setting off car alarms still draws the horde to the location of your oh-so-tasty brains. So, youll likely still have a great time with Cold Stream. Its a competently put together new campaign, and definitely scratches that new Left 4 Dead itch. But, theres just something missing. It lacks the usual magic that Valve games tend to attain. Ive been struggling to put my finger on exactly what it is, but its honestly fairly difficult to say. Perhaps its the lack of new voice work for the campaign. The maps creators very cleverly put together old dialogue to estimate more or less what it would sound like, but its just not the same. Perhaps its the slightly uneven difficulty. In Valve-designed maps, you constantly feel one step ahead of death. The zombies bear down on you, and you barely survive each encounter. Those moments exist in Cold Stream, but theyre definitely not common. And when they come, they come with fury. Theres a moment early in the campaign where youre forced to fight your way down a raging deluge of water, all the while fighting off zombies. It sounds thrilling, but instead its far too chaotic and far too difficult. Perhaps, even, its notable lack of witches. It seems like a not-so-huge deal at first glance, but I really missed the moments of turning a corner and finding myself face-to-face with one of the terrifying she-devils. The air seems lacking in tension without her cries echoing in the distance. None of this is to say that Cold Stream isnt very good. In fact, quite the opposite. Its still Left 4 Dead 2, and shooting, chopping, and chainsawing your way through is still just as much fun as ever. The new four-map set is varied, well-designed, and definitely gets the job done. Its just not up to the level of the games other campaigns. For the Left 4 Dead veterans, however, the true value of the DLC lies in the re-release of four campaigns from the original game. Crash Course, Death Toll, Dead Air, and Blood Harvest are back, along with Zoey, Louis, Bill, and Francis. I know right? I missed those guys too. Plus, you get to play with the new toys that Left 4 Dead 2 introduced, like melee weapons and the ever-useless defibrillator, all in an attempt to survive the new Special Infected that seem to have invaded the old areas. Fresh! CLOSING COMMENTS While Cold Stream lacks that special Valve sheen, its certainly not a badly designed Left 4 Dead 2 campaign. Plus, the addition of the original four Left 4 Dead campaigns is something that youd be silly to pass up on. At $7, its hard to dispute the value here, especially if youve been missing on some zombie slaying since L4D2s last DLC, The Passing, was released in October 2010.
