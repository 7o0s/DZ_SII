However, after seven months of pounding the orange plastic high above the clouds, the team has taken us right back down to the desert and dust for some new rally-themed racing across a fresh slab of Mexican countryside. It admittedly isnt quite as eye-catching  and its regressed from some key tweaks to the progression system introduced in Hot Wheels  but competing against the clock with a co-driver is a great new way to race in Horizon, and the excellent map is packed with far more technical routes than found in the main game.This map, which Playground has dubbed Sierra Nueva, is really the highlight of Rally Adventure  and perhaps deceptively so, considering its not as immediately distinct from the main game itself as, say, the snowy Blizzard Mountain DLC was from the core Forza Horizon 3 map. There are six different environments blended together in Sierra Nueva, and on closer inspection it does effectively look and feel like a separate part of Mexico than what weve been driving around since late 2021. Theres new vegetation, and zones like the quarry are unlike anything already in Horizon 5.Sierra Nueva's real strength, however, is its road network.Sierra Nuevas real strength, however, is its road network. Dont be fooled by the early pop-up that indicates youve only got 32 roads to drive down before youve seen them all  many of these roads are long and technical, like the guitar solo in Free Bird. The best among them are characterised by tighter corners and more hairpins than youll find on a typical Forza Horizon 5 road, plus more bumps and jumps, as well as longer stretches between junctions. Sierra Nuevas new dust effects are also a standout, and it hangs in the air above the dirt and gravel for far longer than before.What We Said About Forza Horizon 5Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. Its also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads  no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. Its an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexicos world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. Its a long haul, MMO-inspired racer thats exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map  and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you dont want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game Ive ever played.  Luke Reilly, November 4, 2021Score: 10Read the full Forza Horizon 5 reviewAfter a strong opening drive, where the route into the festival is clogged with campers on the way into the main hub, Rally Adventure breaks the racing up into three threads  each with a slightly different take on rallying. In a somewhat unfortunate step back, things have reverted to a bit of a free-for-all rather than the gated class system that gave the Hot Wheels expansion a nicer sense of progression. Of course, you can still use any car you want to enter events and the AI will adjust class accordingly. This is how I played, changing cars for each of the nearly 30 events to keep things varied. I dont think theres anything to be gained by blazing through everything in your fastest hypercar, unless youre only here for a short time rather than a good time.Each event can be played two ways  either as a single car rallying against the clock or a standard race against a pack of opponents  but the proper rallying is the highlight. Its not a particularly demanding simulation (and its straightforward pace notes crib plenty from the pick-up-and-play pleasure of genre granddaddy Sega Rally) but its absorbing, arcade-inspired fun. Having your co-driver soaring over the stage above you in a helicopter is a cool touch, too. It doesnt just look slick, either  its also a smart solution to explain why youre still receiving co-driver audio in single-seater vehicles.Dust Til DawnAs with Hot Wheels, Rally Adventure adds 10 new vehicles to the garage  and its worth noting the selection here is a way more natural fit in this rally-themed expansion than it was last time around. Now dont get me wrong, because there are some wicked cars that come with Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels  especially if youre into supercars named after Australian 24 Hours of Le Mans winners, which peculiarly accounts for 20 percent of them. However, its hard to say theres much inherently Hot Wheels about cars Mattel has never made diecast versions of. I'm an enormous fan of the iconic 2001 WRC Ford Focus RS of Colin McRae and Nicky Grist, and it's a perfect fit as essentially the hero car of this expansion.In Rally Adventure, the curation leans entirely into rallying and off-roading. Im an enormous fan of the iconic 2001 WRC Ford Focus RS of Colin McRae and Nicky Grist, and its a perfect fit as essentially the hero car of this expansion. I also love the Hoonigan Beetle, affectionately nicknamed the Scumbug. Its not quick, but lower-powered cars are regularly a lot of fun to use as its all about pushing them up to their absolute limit and keeping them there on the brink of losing control in order to maintain your momentum. Its especially serendipitous here considering the Scumbug was literally built by the Hoonigan team to rally in Mexico.BAJA UPDATE!Theres an argument that the 10 new cars are too heavy with trophy trucks and buggies over traditional rally cars, but keep in mind the latest update to the main game just added a host of new rally parts for pretty much every traditional rally car already in the existing garage. On top of that, the incredibly talented community has whipped up excellent replica liveries for all of them over the past few years. The lack of a license for Lancia in Forza Horizon 5 hurts, and it definitely leaves a hole in an experience so overtly inspired by the likes of Sega Rally, but there are plenty of other rally legends that can be built to tackle this new map. For long-time fans, Forza Horizon 5 Rally Adventure is a bit of a full-circle moment for this class-leading racing franchise. After all, the first DLC for the original Forza Horizon was a dedicated rally-themed add-on back in 2012. This new iteration on that idea may be a lot more conventional than last years outlandish Hot Wheels expansion, but fusing the open-world foundations of Forza Horizon with the arcade accessibility of offroad racing icon Sega Rally is still a winning combination.", "date": "March 31, 2023"}
