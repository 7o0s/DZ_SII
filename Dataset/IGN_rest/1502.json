Now, Anomaly Warzone Earth is finally available on Xbox LIVE Arcade, bringing its unique take on tower offense to a brand new console audience. For the most part, the game delivers on the action and original gameplay of the PC and iOS versions of the game, offering nicely balanced action, and unique real-time mechanics. For the uninitiated, Anomaly Warzone Earth posits itself as an almost opposite take on the tower defense genre. You begin each mission by navigating your units through the city streets, being mindful of the enemy towers and units that have been placed at key points throughout the map. Anomaly Warzone Earth in Action. While you may be mostly taking on stationary units, the action in Anomaly Warzone Earth is pretty intense. You'll constantly be juggling various power-ups like health, smoke screens, decoys, and even area-leveling bombs while switching up your path on the fly to avoid attacks and bottlenecks. At the end of each mission, you're ranked on how well you did, earning gold medals for completing goals quickly and efficiently. In Anomaly, you don't have direct control of your units, save one. The commander is the one unit that you can navigate through the map and his role is one of support for your other units than to attack your enemy buildings. You have no means of attacking when using the commander, but can be used to gather power-ups strewn throughout the map and draw fire from enemy towers. One of the biggest obstacles that strategy games face when being ported to a console is the control scheme. Most strategy games aren't created with controllers in mind, and feel quite unwieldy as a result. Fortunately, Anomaly Warzone Earth's gameplay bucks this trend and feels quite comfortable. Anomaly boasts a surprising amount of action and intensity for a strategy game. The game's mechanics, which require you to map out your path and adjust it on the fly all while controlling your own commander avatar to gather power-ups and perform decoy tasks, feel immediately comfortable on the Xbox 360's controller, and never overwhelming. That's not to say that the game isn't challenging, as you'll often find yourself in some pretty intense situations that require quick thinking, rerouting, and item use, as well as some more long-term focuses like unit upgrades. Anomaly Warzone Earth takes place in the future, when the world has been invaded by alien forces, bubbling off pieces of major cities and taking the area over for their own purposes. Commanding the 14th Platoon, you make your way through the war-torn streets of Baghdad, using a variety of units, including heavily armored (but slow) APCs, powerful but poorly defended missile launchers, shield generators, and more. As you earn currency, you'll be able to purchase new units and upgrade the ones that you have with better stats. The game's story isn't great, doing little to separate itself from other alien invasion type stories. The voice acting sounds like a bad Jason Statham movie, and the score tends to get pretty repetitive, making for a pretty lackluster sound presentation. In addition to the 14 mission campaign, there are some extra modes, unlockable once you complete the game. Tokyo Raid and Baghdad Mayhem feel mostly like survival modes, where you navigate the streets taking on enemy emplacements and earning power-ups while trying to last as long as you can, while Tactical Trials is the main new feature, giving you six different VR-style missions set in the game's universe. These feature a new GUI, sporting a wireframe look as opposed to the demolished streets and wrecked buildings in the campaign. The new missions are goal oriented and can be pretty fun, but don't really offer a lot of depth. Mostly, they work as a nice side bit from the main campaign. Enemy heavy paths will result in you rerouting your units on the fly. Graphically, Anomaly Warzone Earth might not be the best looking game on Xbox LIVE Arcade, but sports a decent amount of bells and whistles to keep it from being a uniformly monochromatic experience. Desolate yellow sands and destroyed buildings are broken up by some good looking explosion effects and bright primary colors that help determine enemies and units in the background. Even though the game's story leaves something to be desired, Anomaly Warzone Earth succeeds on several fronts. Even though the game has been adapted from several platforms, it still feels immediately comfortable on an Xbox 360 controller. Additionally, the game's refreshing take on tower defense and strategy as a whole makes for a pretty unique experience. If you got your fill from the other versions of the game, the Tactical Trials mode might not be enough to pull you back in. That said, if this is your first time in Anomaly, you'll find an engaging and unique strategy game with plenty of action.
