And what a launch its been! With its tight 4v4 matches and more chaotic 12v12 Big Team Battle on expertly designed maps, Infinite revives and reinvigorates the glorious sci-fi action that once made Halo king among multiplayer FPS games. Riding high on that thrill, Halo Infinites multiplayer has dash-slid into the first-person shooter scene and meleed the competition off the map.While Halo Infinite's multiplayer is technically still in beta until the single-player campaign comes out on December 8, developer 343 Industries has declared that were officially in Season 1, and Infinite comes complete with purchasable cosmetics and a battlepass. In other words, it is for all intents and purposes fully launched.Halo Infinite looks absolutely gorgeous. The environments within each map are so detailed and pretty that Im now looking forward to the campaign even more. The lighting, settings, and overall look of Infinite bring the futuristic world of Halo to modern-day glory. On PC, it can run at 144Hz easily (and theres a 120Hz mode on Xbox Series X), and the most severe technical issue Ive seen has been some server desync and stutters every so often. It wasnt enough to really mess things up but it was noticeable and made some fights slightly harder than they should have been. Ive only experienced one crash in my 20 hours of playtime, so my experience has been pretty steady. Ahead of the beta test flights in September, one of my biggest concerns was how Halo Infinite would be able to court new players in addition to pleasing Halo veterans who have a lot of set-in-stone ideas of how Halo should play. But to my surprise, Infinite does a stand-up job of bringing novices up to speed with its Academy mode, in which you can try out different weapon drills or jump into a Training session against bots with customizable match settings. Training mode allows you to try out different power items (such as active camouflage and the grappling hook) that you may not have been able to get hold of much in PvP matches, and it also helps you learn the maps as you explore at your own pace. You can also join matches against bots if you want to test your skills before facing other players  and these are some of the most human-like bots Ive ever seen.While the modes aren't revolutionary, they are undoubtedly fun and infinitely replayable.When I did go up against real opponents, the intimate 4v4 Arena playlists fast-paced matches gripped me immediately and had me queuing again and again, for hours on end. The only complaint I have about the playlists is not being able to choose which mode you want to play  you cant just check a box to pick Slayer or Strongholds, you have to queue for all five game modes: One Flag Capture The Flag, Capture The Flag, Strongholds, Oddball, and Slayer. While they arent revolutionary, they are undoubtedly fun and infinitely replayable, and have formed the basis of some of the most enjoyable multiplayer arena shooters of all time. As they say: if it aint broke, dont fix it. Slayer is the traditional team deathmatch, Strongholds has teams fighting to control three capture points on the map, and in Oddball youre battling over control of a skull. But among the 4v4 modes, my favorite remains plain-old Capture the Flag, which stays fun and competitive no matter how many times Ive played it. Coordinating with my team and making mad dashes for the enemys flag while also chasing down the jerk who stole ours fuels my spirit, and scoring a capture is incredibly rewarding. Playing either defensively around my flag or offensively in trying to steal the enemys feels good, and due to the small team sizes no one is unimportant in a match. The only unconventional mode in that list, One Flag CTF, sounded a little odd to me at first because each round has one team defending a flag and the other team has to capture that flag. But its actually a lot of fun  theres only one map for it, Launch Site, but it has vehicle spawns and easily makes for chaotic and fun gameplay with vehicular Spartan-slaughter as one team attempts to raid the others base. All of these game modes are excellent  and much more so when youre communicating with your teammates. Making mad dashes for the enemy's flag while also chasing down the jerk who stole ours fuels my spirit.I do have a few gripes, of course. For one, barely being able to hear a seven-foot-tall, heavily armored Spartan run up behind you for a one-hit melee kill is incredibly frustrating. Its an odd misstep (see what I did there?) given that the weapons and effects all sound great. I dont want heavy footstep sounds like in CS:GO, where you can tell where people are from pretty much all the way across the map, but the number of times Ive been run up on  not even crouch stealthed  and killed is kind of ridiculous. Also, cloaked enemies being silent makes sense since the Active Camo powerup requires you to walk or crouch to stay invisible. A big part of the reason Infinites matches work so well is that each of the seven maps for arena matches are incredibly well designed to allow for you and your team to fluidly rotate through them, grabbing key weapons and items as they spawn and sweeping out enemies. My favorite map from that playlist has to be Streets, thanks to its flashy neon signs, dynamic lighting, and freshly rained-upon pavement. Its a perfect example of readability being key when it comes to map design, favoring bold, angular architecture instead of over-detailed environments that come at the cost of instantly spotting enemies and objective markers. It's Strongholds mode that really shows off Infinites superior map designs, however, since in this capture-point mode you really need to be able to rotate from point to point with a specific flow to keep an eye on the locations you already control. While the maps in Infinite are smaller than those in most FPS games, the distance between points is just enough that you can easily get from one spot to another. At the same time, you can also get caught out by yourself and eliminated, which encourages you to move as a team. This is where the flow of maps really comes into play.It's Strongholds mode that really shows off Infinite's superior map designs.In general, you can run from one side of a map to the other quickly enough that they dont feel all that large for 4v4 matches, but theyre big enough that you dont get there too fast or feel like theyre too cramped of a space, either. There are lots of platforms and objects stacked on top of each other that you can use to perfect your rotations, so you arent restricted to going down one hallway just to get to a specific area  we actually have a lot of options in these spaces thanks to the ability to vault up to ledges and the absence of fall damage. Im impressed with how the map designs take all of this into consideration, especially on this smaller scale. Even with Big Team Battle, the three maps are evenly balanced for 12v12 matches. BTB showcases expansive arenas with enough space for close-range mayhem, long-range sniper plays, rumbling Scorpion tanks, and flying Banshee fighters. I like how, unlike Call of Dutys breakneck-paced 12v12 matches, BTB allows for you to catch a few moments of breathing time before you engage in a heated fight. The weapon spawns are spaced out enough to give everyone a chance to run for them and the vehicle spawns are mirrored on each teams side, making for awesome vehicle runs. Power weapons and items are always a risk to play for since theyre placed in the middle of maps, and that makes balancing feel just right.Big Team Battle has space for close-range mayhem, long-range sniper plays, rumbling Scorpion tanks, and flying Banshee fighters.All three BTB maps feature multiple terrain types that give their layouts variety in height and sightlines. In Behemoth, there are a lot of platforms that let you get higher positioning at the risk of getting sniped from across the way, since the higher levels are more exposed. However, if youre lower on the ground you may not spot the enemies above your head. The flow in BTB maps feels great  it never takes too long to get into a fight but theres also enough space that Ive had no trouble with spawn camping at all. After yet another year of Call of Dutys notoriously bad spawn system, thats been a breath of fresh air. You can play all of that casually, but Infinite also includes a Ranked playlist, available off the drop, which is a great competitive mode for those who want to surround themselves with equally skilled players. You knock out 10 placement matches before youre given your initial rank, then you can grind out some matches in that Ranked playlist to move up. The tiers are reasonable (going from Bronze to Onyx with six levels within each tier) but the one thing Id want more clarification on is how youre graded on performance to move up or down tiers. Right now thats a bit mysterious. In terms of gunplay, the weapons feel decently balanced, with some distinctive quirks to them. The Time to Kill (TTK) is certainly longer than in most other games and took me a bit of time to adjust to, maybe a few matches at most, before I was no longer surprised that a target was still standing after Id unloaded most of an assault rifles magazine into them. It probably takes a couple of shots more than Id like to down an enemy, and that does make it a little harder to win 1v2s here than in faster games like Apex Legends or Call of Duty. But Halo is very much a game about team play, so if youre smart you wont be trying to take on multiple adversaries too often since that usually means youre overextending by yourself. I have to say, its very weird that the MK50 Sidekick pistol is stronger than the MA40 Assault Rifle. While I understand that Halo games have had this balance as the meta going all the way back to the original and the AR is the strongest its been in any game in the series, it just seems weird to have a pistol outgun a big, chunky AR. Meanwhile, a few of the weapons you pick up out of dispensers on the walls feel a bit weak in their damage per second (DPS), especially with guns like the VK Commando which sounds and looks like a beefy gun that should knock a target flat but actually takes quite a few extra shots to kill an enemy, even with headshots. It's a little harder to win 1v2s here than in faster games like Apex Legends or CoD.That said, the weapon variety is pretty generous, allowing you to pick your choice of pistols, burst rifles, and shotguns. The Mangler, a precision-based revolver, is one of my favorite pistols to use since it rewards you for careful shots and can be used at close or long range (once you learn to compensate for the projectile drop). The CQS48 Bulldog is my favorite shotgun (much better than the fancier-sounding Heatwave) because of its tight spread that can take down a target quickly with accurate body shots. Also, the fan-favorite Needler feels especially rewarding when youre able to stick a full stack of heat-seeking needles into an enemy and watch them explode after a short delay. Overall, the weapons feel satisfying to use and nothing is wildly overpowered  not including Power Weapons, of course. However, there are a few weapons that I find myself avoiding, like the Plasma Pistol and the Pulse Carbine  I just dont like the rate of fire of either of them and they dont output the amount of DPS needed in a close-range fight. The Power Weapons, such as the M41 SPNKR rocket launcher and the Gravity Hammer, are limited to a few shots to keep things from getting out of control when you snag one. However, the Energy Sword definitely seems to have three to four charges too many  that could be toned down a bit, since right now the only thing keeping it in check is the fact that you have to close in to melee range to score a kill with it. While the weapons feel as great and handle as weve come to expect from Halo, one thing that feels disappointingly inconsistent is the melee. Standard Spartan melees are a two-hit kill, which feels fine, but the range and damage rarely seems to work the way I expect. It doesnt help that Infinite uses soft collision, meaning you can pass through another player, instead of hard collision, where you bounce off of each other. While soft collision keeps people from griefing each other by blocking doorways, a side effect is that the way people can phase through each other means melee strikes dont feel right. Sometimes youre able to get a backsmack instant kill while facing your opponent and other times you completely miss by phasing through their body and they get the opportunity to kill you. Also, Ive seen what appear to be direct melee hits to the face do no damage, even when the enemy is a sneezes worth of health away from dying. In Halo, grenades are an art form.Something you can always count on, though, is the classic Halo grenade plays. Calculating the timing on a grenade throw and counting the bounces before it goes off and kills an enemy is one of the most rewarding experiences in Infinites multiplayer. Being able to throw a nade behind enemy cover and then push them backwards into the explosion is so satisfying, and sticking someone with a plasma grenade is always a hilarious way to earn a kill. In this game, grenades are an art form. Infinite also makes smart use of its gadgetry. The Grappleshot is my favorite, and I use it to reposition myself around enemies in active fights. Its also great for a quick disengage from close-range fights to heal up before grappling back in to finish the fight. I also really enjoy the fact that you can grapple enemies and catch them off guard, and even throw in an elbow punch to the back of their heads when you get right up to them. Ive even come to love the Thruster  it took a while to grow on me, but now Ive found ways to get creative and dash past enemies, then turn and backslap them during heated fights where they were trying to keep their distance.Microsoft couldn't have chosen a better moment for Master Chief's comeback.The Drop Wall still isnt my favorite equipment item, but thats purely based off of my aggressive playstyle  hunkering down behind a deployable shield just makes me feel like grenade bait. Active Camo is much more my style, since its invisibility allows me to get multiple stealth kills in a row literally before they know what hit them. I also love the Repulsor, which reflects projectiles back at enemies while also pushing them back from you. Using it to throw enemies off the map was probably not what it was intended for, but its a ton of fun to mess around with equipment and weapon combos like that. Having that creative freedom is important, and Infinite does a great job of allowing you to have fun while slaying. And all of that comes at just the right time. In fact, Microsoft couldnt have chosen a better moment for Master Chiefs comeback, with Call of Duty: Vanguard's multiplayer feeling like more of the same and Battlefield 2042s main modes leaving much to be desired. Infinites long-absent style of team-based multiplayer is the shot in the arm the shooter community needed right now. Microtransaction ReactionHalo Infinites store is open for business and the bundles and options for its purely cosmetic wares are varied. The pricing feels fair and evenly set relative to other free-to-play games, with daily Rare bundles costing $5 (500 credits) and weekly Legendary bundles going for $20 (2,000 credits). The Season 1 Battlepass costs 1,000 credits, so about $10, and the Premium Pass Bundle costs 2,800 credits, around $28. Since Infinites multiplayer is free to play it makes sense that itd have a battlepass, but whats awkward is that the rewards within it are pretty lackluster. Outside of a couple of neat fire effects that can be applied to your character, all you get are things like plain armor coatings and uninspired helmet attachments. Nothing in it has interested me more than what you can earn without paying. Also, the challenge system doesn't provide much XP, so the free cosmetic options take a long time to unlock. With the inability to choose the game modes you want to play, completing some of these challenges are difficult because you might just get half an hour of Slayer on two rotating maps and be unable to complete a challenge that requires a specific vehicle that spawns on a different map. Daily and weekly challenges should be engaging and make you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing one, but these are just small drops in a very large bucket. Its too much of a grind to feel worth spending money on the battlepass for some meager customization unlocks as the progression rewards. Even after an update that doles out a flat 50 XP after every match and tweaks to the challenge deck it still feels like a slog, and I dont feel rewarded for a good performance. However, I do love that 343 Industries is showing esports teams some love with armored skin sets themed after partnered Halo Championship Series esports organizations, such as Cloud9 and Faze, so you can show support for your favorite teams. Its so nice when a game actually lives up to sky-high expectations! Halo Infinite has been one of the most anticipated games out there since it was first announced three years ago, and for its multiplayer component to so fully deliver on the series classic feel while also keeping up with the modern-day competition in the FPS genre is a huge achievement. With some fantastic map design, a collection of straightforward but highly engaging modes for both large and small groups, excellent weapons and gear options, and those delightfully bouncy and sticky grenades, Halo Infinites multiplayer modes put it in the top tier of competitive shooters. Impressively, it manages to give nostalgic veterans the best of what they remember Halo multiplayer feeling like while also smoothly introducing new players to the joys of Spartan combat.", "date": "Nov. 25, 2021,"}
