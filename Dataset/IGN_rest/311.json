The assortment of 28 diverse mini-games seems to exist to show off the fidelity of the sensors on the Joy-Con controllers, and they do, but the remarkably unique games lack any real depth. The weirdness starts at the very beginning. Each individual game is introduced with a fairly well-produced live-action trailer-slash-tutorial that gives you an idea of the overall tone and mechanics. Theyre color coordinated and neatly cut, but seem to be advertisements for the individual game modes more than helpful tutorials. Some are really bad at communicating what youre supposed to do, and as a result a lot of your first play sessions will probably involve a whole lot of people saying wait, what am I supposed to do here? Even when you do have an understanding of how different games work, some, like the baseball mini-game, are confusing. You know one of you has to bat and one of you has to pitch, but it doesnt tell you what sounds to listen for to swing and hit the virtual ball at the right time, plus you can actually get caught out, which seems like it might happen at random. When youre the batter, a virtual player on a non-existent field can ,atch the ball you hit, and I was never able to tell the physical difference between a successful swing and a losing one. It never communicated that with me. Baby is one of the most off-putting mini-games I've ever played. Other games like Gorilla, Baby, and Zen serve very little appeal beyond the novelty of how odd they are. Gorilla has you pound your chest to a simple beat - something you could do without a Joy-Con if you really wanted  but you probably dont. Baby has you take the console out of the dock and hold it like a baby, rocking it slowly until it stops crying, and then setting it down without waking it up. And it does seem to genuinely be the audio of a baby crying, which automatically makes it one of the most off-putting mini-games I think Ive ever played. Zen has you sit perfectly still or hold a particular pose, or just put the Joy-Con down - the Switch largely cant tell the difference. Theres a big issue with audio-based games in a party setting, too: they become unplayable if theres too much background noise. One of my favorite games has you move the controller up, down, left, and right if the in-built female voice commands it, but you have to do the opposite if the male voice says it. That game is, in the right setting, competitive and fun, but its odd to have a party game you cant play at an actual party where people are talking or listening to music. And yet, the things that do work make people laugh much more than most. Even after four hours experiencing all of 1-2-Switchs absurdities with a small group I didnt feel bored of the selection of games, and I easily couldve added a few more hours of playing the simple reflex contest of Quick Draw on top of that. It offers an oddly personal competitive experience. Even if its laughter at the expense of someone chomping on absolutely nothing just for the Joy-Con to pick up how many virtual sandwiches theyve eaten, 1-2-Switch offers an oddly personal competitive experience thats tailored to your own social setting. At some point during our Switch party, we figured out that making a B sound while opening and closing your mouth seems to help you move faster, which resulted in a room full of people trying it out and trying to beat the previous persons score, all the while making totally ridiculous bababababa sounds. We laughed so, so hard at Milk - the game where you milk a virtual cow - and the unnatural, frankly overtly sexual motions it forces you into, all the while encouraging increasingly awkward eye contact between the two players. Beyond humor, theres also a degree of wonderment in discovering exactly how the hardware works. Ball Count still seems like magic to me, in that it has you count the amount of small virtual balls that are present in the Joy-Con based on simulation through precise vibration and sound. Its an interesting demonstration of the Switchs high-definition haptics technology and its worth trying once or twice, but I dont think a whole lot of people will repeatedly come back to it. Its more gimmicky than anything, because when you think about it its literally just simulating marbles in a box. There are a few different modes, too, including a shuffle mode that plays different games at random and a virtual board game that increases the usual number of players by encouraging you to split up into teams and pass the controllers around. In that, its inclusive and adaptable, and I think even people whove never played a game before could become wholly comfortable with 1-2-Switch in a matter of hours. That said, I think this is a game you show to people once, when youre trying to introduce them to the Switch, and then probably never again. Its fun, and Ive repeatedly seen it entertain a room full of people who might not even be playing, but the novelty quickly wears off. 1-2-Switch is the Switchs version of Wii Sports, in that it acts as an overall mission statement for the console itself. The quirky, bizarre nature of the unique mini-games make it a funny, memorable experience, but some games are hard to play at first due to unclear tutorials and dialogue cues. Despite its oddities and flaws, I have had so, so much fun playing and watching 1-2-Switch with a small group of friends that I can recommend it in that specific situation, but I dont have much desire to go back.", "date": "March 2, 2017,"}
