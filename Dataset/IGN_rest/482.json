It meshes fast and frenzied swordplay with colorful, bullet-hell-inspired twin-stick shooting to create fighting experiences not unlike the most over-the-top anime battles. Furis action stands out thanks to the level of patience and restraint the resulting combat demands. Hit-and-miss boss design, occasionally janky mechanics, and a reliance on scripted attack sequences break the flow a bit too often, but a flashy look and killer music at least keep it looking and sounding great the whole way through. Furi centers entirely around boss fights: 10 main battles plus an 11th bonus fight that I wont spoil, each lasting anywhere between 10 minutes and half an hour in a roughly four-hour campaign. Its a risky framework that ends up working well thanks to a tight, precision-based combat system that bounces between a top-down arena mode and a close-up, fighting game-style battle. ...some battles are notably weaker and more repetitive than others. With no leveling, items, or unlockable skills at all, youre forced to become intimately familiar with just four basic actions: shoot, slash, dodge, and parry. You can charge each move with the exception of parry to execute a more powerful variation  a worthy reward for the risk that comes with its slow buildup. Each boss in Furis strange and colorful interstellar prison required full use of all those abilities to take down, but not always in the same fashion. This kept the challenge mounting in new and interesting ways. The Strap  a berserk, scythe-wielding prisoner who speeds around her electrified jail on wheels, blasting you with energy beams and torrents of bullets from afar  is a much different fight than close-quarters battles against more traditionally melee-oriented bosses like a knightly sword-and-board-wielding father called The Hand, or The Edge, a stylish samurai-inspired warrior much like your own character, but theyre all equally fun and surprising. With boss design by Afro Samurai creator Takashi Okazaki, each character has a distinct look and colorful personality that pairs well with their moveset. Some bosses even subvert the power and application of your moveset in unexpected ways  moments that often stood out as the highlight of a battle for better or worse. The fight against The Line, a deceptively meek-looking old man with time-controlling abilities, is a particularly strong example of this. As I fired away at the three layers of rotating shields he hid inside, dodging the swarms of my own ricocheting projectiles bouncing all around the arena, I realized I could reduce the number of obstacles by simply changing my strategy. Thats your own violence turned against you, The Line says, Youre fighting yourself, cant you see? It wasnt until I switched to my charge shot instead, patiently chiseling away at one part of each barrier as they continued to circle around The Line, that I could break through and trigger his next phase without creating a flurry of projectiles around me. Patience, rather than brute force, was the key to this fight. ...rarely is there a moment of downtime between the furious dashing and slashing. This is what Furi is all about. Taking a boss down is never a matter of simply dealing the most damage before the enemy can react  instead, its all about predicting the opponents next move, evading danger, and punishing openings as you would in a fighting game, then learning when to back off. Multi-stage bosses that change up their moveset with each new phase and two combat modes mean theres a lot of opportunity for Furi to make the most of its limited moves within this framework, and for the most part it does. But when it doesnt, Furi can devolve into a mess of both rigidly predictable attack sequences that lead to a tedious grind of attack-and-respond, and frustratingly chaotic challenges where the outcome sometimes feels more about luck than skill. It strikes a balance, but some of the battles are notably weaker and more repetitive than the highlights. Most fights begin with an overhead view of the arena. Here youll be dodging enemy projectiles, which take on diverse forms including energy balls, homing neon bullets, beams of light, rings of non-parryable orbs, electric arcs, and more. But youll also be doing plenty of hacking and slashing, if the boss lets you get close enough, and parrying their own attacks when they do. Furi definitely lives up to its name in this regard: rarely is there a moment of downtime between the furious dashing and slashing. A pumping electronic soundtrack composed by artists like Carpenter Brut and Lorn paired well with the flashy neon action on screen. I took joy in each perfect parry, dodge, and well-timed slash... Once you grind down your opponents health bar during this initial arena-based stage, an orange circle appears around them signaling your chance to deliver a finishing blow of sorts. Doing so shifts the fight into the most exciting part of each boss fight: a melee-only duel mode. During these duels, your gun is effectively off limits and the camera moves in close, leaving no room to hide as you attempt to whittle down your enemys regenerated HP bar using only close-quarters melee combat more akin to a traditional fighting game than an arena shooter. These moments were Furis high points: I took joy in each perfect parry, each last-second dodge, and each well-timed charge slash that would send my foe flying into their next stage, which reverts back into the overhead arena view so the shooting can begin again. At its best, Furi feels like a hyper-challenging rhythm game, a dance of precise button presses set to the beat of each boss routine. This is a welcome change of pace from most other action games, and nailing the timing of each move is fun and rewarding on a technical level. But dealing with some of Furis most ridiculous obstacles (Ill be happy to never do The Scales grid-based dodging sequence again) can bring its action down from a fun, fair challenge to a repetitive, frustrating grind. Losing three lives during a single phase of each fight restarts the whole thing, which means trudging through three or four phases just to return to the part you were having trouble with, with no opportunity to really practice until you get back to that point. Furi can go from fun to frustrating pretty quickly. During these do-overs  which force you to repeat linear sequences that, on the second or third try, feel routine rather than rewarding  I often felt like I was just going through the motions of a boss fight as opposed to defending and reacting against a dynamic opponent. Add to this the fact that the parry mechanic feels functionally inconsistent in arena mode, where trying to block and run at the same time sometimes works and sometimes doesnt, and Furi can go from fun to frustrating pretty quickly. Theres definitely fun to be had in Furis fast and frenzied battles against a colorful cast of quirky boss characters. While it finds its strongest moments in its rewardingly rhythmic, precision-based one-on-one duels, an unwelcome level of tedium and occasionally cheap sequences  made even more frustrating by janky mechanics  keep the action from being as consistently strong as it is visually stylish.", "date": "July 14, 2016,"}
