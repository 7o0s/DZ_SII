Delightfully brutal, infinitely quotable and littered with pop culture mainstays, the series has long enjoyed an ardent and vocal fan base. With the franchise set to soon release its latest spine-splitting incarnation, Mortal Kombat X, NetherRealm Studios and DC Comics seek to sate the salivating masses with a prequel comic series of the same name. The books first volume offers bloodshed and bluster aplenty, but when it comes down to overall investment, this fight feels unfinished. Writer Shawn Kittelsen dives right into his new playground, showing an immediate grasp of the series characters and mythologies. This same knowledge proves detrimental at times, as new characters and plot points are introduced with little to no guiding hand. Though initially jarring, theres enough concrete story to be found to allow for new readers to learn on the fly. That same story feels right at home within the Kombat universe, largely revolving around a collection of cursed daggers that once united could lead to the end of all realms, Out and Earth alike. This singular focus leads a number of familiar characters to join the fray, in turn creating cause for a seemingly endless parade of bare knuckle beat downs. Kittelsen gets as much mileage out of these interactions as he can, utilizing a number of famed verbal cues and giddy one liners to further drive his heightened tone. While the books action is appropriately violent and over the top, its character development proves a kombo that never completely gets off the ground. This in itself is unfortunate, as Kittleson does a nice job laying the groundwork for some intriguing pairings. Scorpions tutelage of Takeda is initially engaging, but soon the narrative wheels overrun the duo. Likewise, the addition of Cassie Cage and Jacqui Briggs opens the door for some great family drama, but any semblance of such is quickly bypassed in lieu of interdimensional fisticuffs and lurching plot jumps. Given the books expansive cast such quick pacing cant be helped, but in focusing so much on including everyone, no one character really stands out. It also doesnt help that the books freewheeling motivations prove tough to pin down, the many overarching factions difficult to track. Characters fade in and out of the main storyline at random, with detailed origins and ill-timed sidebars often blocking forward progression. Its not the histories themselves that prove problematic (Scorpions is solid, if not a bit rushed), but more so the ones we get. Kotal Khan gets an entire out-of-nowhere chapter devoted to his violent back-story, yet so far his role in the overall proceedings appears negligible at best. Said involvement could change the further into the story we go, but a more concise focus would have been beneficial at the start. Of course, its the Kombat weve come to see, and in that regard the book's art team, lead by Dexter Soy, delivers. Volume 1 is packed with action, from demonic ninja battles to gritty cage fights, each melee as brutal and aggressive as its signature flagship. Soy straddles a fine line between video game concept art and comic style, his characters hyper animated and distinct. The artist shows a clear understanding of the book's overall tone, using dramatic close ups and x-ray snapshots to highlight the ever present devastation. Bones splinter and snap, tendons go the way of loose spaghetti and all the while blood splatters like a Jackson Pollack painting. Colorist Veronica Gandini completes the overall energetic feel, dotting her mostly muted hues with blazing splashes of vibrance. There are some wonky panel layouts to be had and a few overly static pages, but when Soy and Gandini are on, the book really is Kombat personified. As a stepping stone for virtual battles to come, Mortal Kombat X does its job. It sets the stage, gets the players in motion, and offers a heaping helping of cold cut karnage. Longtime fans will likely enjoy the book's wide reach and expanded focus, but readers new to the mythos may end up wishing for something tighter. It's not a flawless victory, but it is a lot of fun. Pros Game-esque storyKiller KombatDexter Soy's art Cons Uneven character workToo many cooks The first volume of Mortal Kombat X is a solid one. The creative team shows a clear appreciation and knowledge of the property in both content and tone, with plenty to enjoy on visceral level. Long time fans will likely get good mileage out of the sprawling read, but the book's sporadic focus may make it difficult for new readers to invest. As a prequel to the upcoming game it does enough to increase interest, but as a standalone title in the vein of Injustice: Gods Among Us, it doesn't fully stand on its likely fractured feet.", "date": "April 9, 2015,"}
