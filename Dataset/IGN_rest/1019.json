It adds even more variety to an already massively diverse platformer RPG. Even better, Trap Team reclaims some of the series better features, like Skystones and tilting lock puzzles, which were disappointingly absent from last years Swap Force. While the basic mechanics of this action platformer are solid, the characters have always been the best part of the Skylanders series, and Trap Team introduces some of the best heroes and villains yet. From a baby T-Rex with a helicopter backpack, to a candy-barfing Pinata and an Eastern-themed wind-master armed with a giant boomerang, Trap Team is full of inventiveness. The concept, design, and overall performance of the characters is a highpoint for the series. There are even new baby versions of series favorites like Spyro and Trigger Happy  sure, its a way to sell you more toys, but who doesnt want one of these guys? Unfortunately, character progression suffers from an abundance of loot. Even playing as six entirely new characters, I had maxed out most of their upgrades a little over halfway through Trap Teams 10-hour story, which meant I spend the second half with practically no use for tens of thousands of pieces of treasure. This would be less of a problem if there were new upgrade options for your existing Skylanders, but that Stealth Elf youve had for three years still wont have any new ninja powers to spend her treasure on. Players in co-op share treasure now, so theres no reason to compete over it. Its a small change, but it makes the two-player experience far less competitive and allows players of different skill levels to progress at the same pace with regard to upgrades. Unfortunately, the upgrade system still forces you to exit the upgrade interface after each individual purchase. That minor inconvenience adds up over time, and theres a similar fussiness with swapping villains in and out of the traps. That said, playing as the villains is massively fun. Trap Team lets you play as over 40 villains, from a chef with a hot pepper for a head to a treasure chest with teeth. Its particularly cool that some of the villains have abilities that are designed to be used in co-op. Broccoli Guy can drop healing glyphs, for instance, while Chill Bill can immobilize enemies with his freeze gun. Even in single-player, its easy enough to swap back and forth between these villains and use their support abilities. While the villains dont get the same sort of upgrade options as the Skylanders themselves, each villain has his or her (or its) own redemption mission somewhere in the campaign. Its a fun story moment to lead the villain through a specific challenge that brings them around to the side of the heroes, but none of the missions are co-op, which can be a bit of a snag if youre playing with a friend. Even worse, some of the missions boil down to basically saying hello to another character. It feels like kind of a cheat. As great as this rogues gallery is, the abundance of awesome villains contributes to some story problems. The Doom Raiders come at you one at a time, which gives the missions a sort of villain-of-the-week feel. You jump from bad guy to bad guy so quickly that the story never really seems to focus the way that it did around Kaos in the previous games. I was also a little annoyed that some of the villains are part of a new mystery element that Eon keeps saying hell explain but never does. My guess is that the mystery will be solved at retail soon enough. The villain missions are just one of the many diversions in Trap Team, but the bigger story here is the return of Skystones. The collectible card game is one of the best parts of 2012s Skylanders Giants, but is annoying absent in Swap Force. Now its back in a more satisfying head-to-head design that plays more like Magic: The Gathering than Tic-Tac-Toe. There are far more, and far more interesting, tactical decisions to be made during a Trap Team match than there were in Giants as you match attack and defense values and special abilities against their opponents cards. Trap Teams new lock puzzles are also much improved over those in Giants. Instead of the straight switches and paths, these puzzles return to the board-twisting mechanics from before. This time around, there are bumpers, breakable blocks, fire and water tiles, one-way doors, and other challenging elements that make the puzzles so much more satisfying and interesting. Sadly, not all the diversions are quite as successful. The platforming sequences are very shallow but their bigger fault is that many of the jump pads just arent built for co-op. The jump pads send characters flying off, but unless they hit the pad together, the game will try to teleport one character to the other. The problem is that it often does it in the middle of the jump, which creates even further separation between the characters and creates a sort of teleporting, jumping loop that it can take a few seconds to break. And the less said about the rap battles, the better. Pros Great charactersSkystones SmashLots of content Cons Weak storyOld characters left out In most ways, Skylanders Trap Team is the best game in the series. The abundance of inventive and genuinely fun characters, and the inclusion of playable villains, means theres always some amazing new trick to try. The new versions of Skystones and tilting lock puzzles are fun enough that Id play them by themselves. On the downside, theres nothing new here for your existing Skylanders, and the overall story just fails to come together. Still, where else are you going to see a Broccoli wizard to fight a heavy-metal werewolf?", "date": "Oct. 2, 2014,"}
