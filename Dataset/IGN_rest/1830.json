Thats smart, considering the combat has pretty much fully run out of gas by this point. The second and final one, Murder on Eridanos, is a more intimate and local whodunnit that has you following a trail of clues around a series of colorful floating islands to interview weird suspects and hold up a high-tech magnifying glass to highlight clues. Its not a grand sendoff for this upstart RPG, but its another good chunk of time spent in its universe. After a brief setup in which the star of an in-universe TV show is murdered, youre handed a badge and sent off to be an impartial investigator. I only wish wed gotten to see or at least hear more of these noir-ish Halcyon Helen serials, since the small taste we do see is tons of fun and right up the alley of The Outer Worlds dark humor. The crime boss, the jilted lover, the weird self-help guru, the arrogant co-star, and more are on the list of people of interest, and most of them are in fact interesting people to talk to. Its a bona fide murder mystery, and theres a lot of dialogue here since so much of the sleuthing is climbing every branch of their conversation trees, and between that and reading emails on terminals, going through every detail for evidence it can take a while. Depending on how thorough you are, that can be over 10 hours  which is not bad at all for an expansion to a 25-hour RPG. It feels great to make a call and then find out if you're right or wrong about it.As far as I can tell there isnt a significant effect on the story based on your roleplaying dialogue choices, but there are a couple of big decisions to make once you close in on a suspect: for one, you get to actually guess at who killed the actor, which is a refreshing breath of fresh air when so many detective games are on rails. Sure, no matter who you accuse, the final confrontation is effectively the same, but it feels great to be given the chance to make a call and then find out if youre right or wrong about it, which is a lot more than Peril on Gorgon did. And of course, then you have to decide what to do when you discover what really happened and the secret Halcyon Helen was killed to protect, and youre given some justification to go either way. What We Said About The Outer Worlds With The Outer Worlds, Obsidian has found its own path in the space between Bethesda and BioWare, and its a great one. And considering that new RPGs from either of those influential developers are still years away, this game couldnt have been timed any better. Its not as explorable as one big open world but it still packs in a large portion of flexible quests and conflicts within its series of smaller ones. And the combat, character, and companion systems have enough new spins on existing ideas to make it feel like an homage with its own personality rather than a copy. - Dan Stapleton, October 22, 2019 Read the full The Outer Worlds review You never actually leave Eridanos as part of the main quest, or even need to return to your ship  youre given a temporary base of operations where your whole team hangs out and a billboard is automatically filled out with photos of suspects and crazy-person string connecting them so you can visualize everything without taking too many of your own notes. That makes Murder on Eridanos feel more self-contained than any other adventure; almost like its own game. But since you never leave, its a good thing that the map is impressively diverse, with each of the connected floating islands containing one or two distinctive areas. Theres the scene of the crime at an upscale hotel, the distillery Helen was there to promote, a crime bosss lair, vast fields of purple flowers, weird caves, and more  this doesnt have the feeling of a map thats cobbled together from existing parts. The only obnoxious thing about it is the long bridges that connect the islands where you do nothing but walk straight ahead for about 15 seconds at a time, and how eagerly the main quest sends you back and forth across them. This kind of thing is exactly what fast travel was invented for. This kind of thing is exactly what fast travel was invented for.I didnt feel bad about taking that shortcut in part because by the time youre at the required level 30, The Outer Worlds combat doesnt hold up and feels obligatory, even on hard difficulty, so skipping it felt inconsequential. Even the handful of new weapons on Eridanos dont spruce fights up much at all, and the enemies are very much more of the same but with more splash damage. The final expansion to Obsidians original sci-fi RPG is a low-key but intriguing finale. The Outer Worlds: Murder on Eridanos puts us into a traditionally structured murder mystery with a few good turns to investigate across one of its weirdest planets yet. It doesnt revive the stale combat but it does give us a good reason to come back to the crew of the Unreliable to solve one last case.", "date": "March 18, 2021"}
