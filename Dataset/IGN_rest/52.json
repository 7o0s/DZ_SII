One moment its a generic third-person shooter, the next it dives into psychological horror but forgets to build the stakes first. At one point youre sneaking through a decent stealth mission and then, abruptly, youre dipping into some simplistic puzzles and riddles. Its ambitious in that it wants to include different genres and a variety of different playstyles, but it never develops them to the point where any of them becomes interesting. The story immediately piqued my interest by giving the impression that there is a lot to learn about the character you play as, Ian, and the world that surrounds him. Whats up with those creepy nightmare sequences? Why and how are you able to slow down time? Who is this woman who keeps showing up in the mysterious dream world? All interesting questions, but they ultimately amount to nothing as the plot only gets messier as you continue on. A good mystery allows your burning questions to fester and evolve, building anticipation to some kind explanation. But by the end of Past Cure, five or six hours later, I was mostly trying to pinpoint where the story had lost me. Mysteries are introduced and quickly rushed out, as are characters and their motivations. That made it nearly impossible to care about any of it. Based on the flat, emotionless voice acting, Ian doesn't care much either.Based on the flat, emotionless voice acting, Ian doesnt care much either. It doesnt matter if he is calmly speaking on the phone, getting choked out, or running for his life  almost every line is delivered in the same tone. And its not even as if there are other good performances to make him look bad by comparison  everyone in the cast is fairly monotone  but the protagonist is by far the guiltiest. In a game that clearly wants to present itself as cinematic (the distracting black bars at the top and bottom of the screen make that obvious) such poor acting is pretty damning. Level design is just as disjointed and uneven as the story. In one chapter youre escaping a great-looking nightmare world and its waves of ceramic humanoids; the next youre running, guns blazing, through a brightly lit and repetitious parking garage. Minigames like a sliding block puzzle offer an enjoyable challenge but are oddly introduced and then promptly abandoned, all within the stealthy nightmare level in one of the later chapters. Quite a few ideas are introduced and then never brought back.For that matter, quite a few ideas are introduced and then never brought back again. Early on theres a moment where Ian begins to see those creepy porcelain humanoids in his home and must pop sanity pills to make them vanish  but then never needs to do it again. What could have been an interesting mechanic that mightve layered some complexity on top of everything else that followed and bridged together the dramatically different chapters with an element of horror ended up a one-time trick. Consistency can be found in the combat, which works well enough but lacks variety. A small selection of four weapons makes sure that each gunfight is essentially the same each time. The enemy AI does its job in a workmanlike way, but dont expect any behaviors other than the enemies that shoot from afar and those that charge in for hand-to-hand combat. Ians powers give Past Cures story an extra sci-fi element, but they are criminally underused. The lengthy tutorial section shows how you can use limited slow-motion and astral projection (your spirit leaving your body to invisibly observe and affect the world) can be used in creative and interesting puzzles  but that never happens. Once the tutorial ends, its disappointing that you rarely use them for anything more than sneaking past enemies and disabling camera systems. That said, I did find the stealth chapter worthwhile. Using astral projection to scope out a hallway added a nice twist on the standard corner-peeking, and slow motion helped me get out of tight situations. The tension here was, at times, stronger than some of the horror-focused levels. Again, its simple in design, but it works. Of course, this applies only to the forced stealth missions. Anytime youre given a choice on how you wanted to approach a problem, the all-out gunfight was always the quicker and easier option, and there are no better rewards to entice you to play more methodically. Past Cure never does anything special. Every time it tries to do something interesting, it immediately forgets about it and does something else. Dont get me wrong: its not a bad thing to include a number of genres within one game. In fact, it can help keep it fresh if they serve as a breather from a strong central idea. The problem is that Past Cure has no strong central idea to take a break from or return to. Whether its the initially compelling yet convoluted supernatural story or the interesting gimmicks that never leave the tech demo phase, its a disorganized bundle of ideas that are never given a chance to develop into something out of the ordinary.", "date": "March 2, 2018,"}
