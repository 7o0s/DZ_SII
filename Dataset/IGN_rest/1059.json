Enter The Golf Club, a no-nonsense take on the walk-spoiling sport that makes up for its lack of licensed players and courses by applying a more realistic feel to its stroke play and featuring a robust course designer. Yet despite these strengths, its stiff challenge and bare-bones presentation make it a difficult approach for anyone other than diehard fans of the sport. Little effort has been put into the creation of Golf Clubs golfers themselves. Not only can you not play as any PGA pros, you cant even play as yourself unless by remote chance you already look like one of the half a dozen non-editable players available. You can make slight alterations to the colour of each item of their clothing, but thats it. Anyone used to the dizzying amount of customisation options and myriad of real-world club and clothing manufacturers featured in the Tiger Woods games will likely be disappointed with the dearth of player-tailoring options on offer here. A similarly stripped-back level of design has been applied to the presentation out on the holes themselves. Commentary is sparse, theres no gallery there to cheer you on, and youll certainly never see a ball explode off the tee with a smoke trail behind it or have your ego stroked by a multi-angle replay each time you nail a chip-in from off the green. Yet The Golf Club is more about appropriating the feel of the sport rather than dressing it up with good looks or flashy gimmicks. Each shot you take is bereft of the assists typical to modern golf games - theres no swing timer to help you nail the right amount of power in your stroke, nor is there a virtual caddy to suggest which iron to use for your approach, nor aftertouch spin controls to correct a misplaced shot. All youre given is the basic information for each hole - wind direction, distance to the pin and the elevation of the cup. Its down to you to read the green and rely on instinct to choose the right club and shot type, and apply the right amount of power to your swing with the right thumbstick. Putting is hard to judge at first. Consequently, The Golf Club was really quite challenging for my first few hours with it, particularly due to the absence of any kind of tutorial mode. The slightest of deviations in each forward flick of the thumbstick caused balls to shank sideways into the brush, and it was tough to judge the length of my shots with the fully analogue putting. It seemed particularly hard to get to grips with after spending the past 10 years of my virtual golf career nestled within the Tiger Woods series more patronising embrace. But things improved with patience and experience, and over time my scores came down as I grew more proficient in reading greens and adjusting for the lie of the ball. It felt organic and rewarding, not unlike the real thing, as opposed to compensating for my own deficiencies by lazily beefing out a set of stat points in order to artificially power up my player. Having said that, The Golf Club does feel somewhat lacking as far as progression is concerned. One area in which the Tiger Woods games have excelled in recent years is keeping me engaged - I like the way it bombards us with spot-challenges and new gear to unlock at every turn. Without carrots like these to dangle in front of us in The Golf Club, theres little incentive to keep playing beyond the enjoyment and challenge of playing itself. Not that theres anything inherently wrong with that, but I would have appreciated some additional goals to strive for aside from merely trying to lower my handicap. The course creator is excellent. What did keep me returning to The Golf Club, however, was the sheer number of courses available. How many? A potentially infinite number, essentially - thanks to the powerful course creator and an active online community whose creations already number in the thousands. Granted, theyre not all gems, but you can sort the wheat from the chaff via the user ratings, and the more talented creators in the community have already been able to subvert The Golf Clubs lack of licensing by building convincing recreations of famous courses such as Pebble Beach and Augusta. Creating a course yourself is a straightforward process. You first select from a basic set of variables - terrain type, foliage density and the like, and then a course is procedurally generated for you to use as the base for your design. From there you can do as much or as little as you want to it - widen fairways, reshape putting greens, add and remove hazards and more, and you can even dive down at any point from your god-view into the shoes of your player to put your tweaks to the test. Its an excellent feature entirely unprecedented for the genre - previously, the only additional courses we got our hands on in the Tiger Woods games came via paid-for DLC (or mods, on the PC side). My only gripe with the sharing of created courses in The Golf Club is that theyre read-only - I would have liked the option to take another users course as a starting off point and then have the ability to edit it more to my tastes. It should also be said that course generation and editing is substantially slower on the Xbox One than it is in the PC version, making the creation process feel a lot more sluggish. (At the time of writing the development team claim that a patch to address that is on the way.) Out on the course the frame rate is also noticeably choppier on the Xbox One. Pros Powerful course designerChallenging and rewardingNo goofy special effects Cons No progressionBland presentation Your mileage may vary with The Golf Club, depending on exactly what you expect out of a golf simulation. If you want a fast track to playing like a pro, then you might be put off by a lack of handholding when it comes to hitting the links. If, however, youre a proper golf enthusiast, then The Golf Clubs more realistic brand of stroke play and potentially limitless number of courses could keep you hooked for months ahead. With a bit more polish applied to its presentation and the addition of a career mode to keep us hooked, this could well have been a package to seriously threaten EAs dominance in the world of golf games. As it stands, its still a strong foundation for the team at HB Studios to build upon for the future.", "date": "Aug. 27, 2014,"}
