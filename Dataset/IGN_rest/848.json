It only grazed the corner, and for a moment I was disappointed. Seconds later a car went up in flames, causing hidden explosives to detonate and demolish not one, but three buildings, which crumbled spectacularly. In Screamride, I flung, flipped, and exploded ride testers in the name of science, built roller coasters of doom, and defied gravity while speeding through twisting coaster tracks  and I had a ton of fun doing it. Screamride doesn't have a prominent story in its career mode, beyond some background radio chatter that explain tidbits about its world. This is a testing facility, so you'll jump straight into the action of riding, destroying, and building roller coasters with none of the park management of something like Rollercoaster Tycoon. Each job  ScreamRider, Demolition Expert, and Engineer  has a distinct tone and atmosphere, and each can be played as much or as little as you please. If, for instance, I want to get my adrenaline pumping and test my reaction skills, I'd boot up a ScreamRider level. Combining time trials and obstacles, such as tracks where one rail drops out so you have to control your speed and tilt your car to keep your passengers from falling to their doom, this mode is a challenging and fun action roller coaster simulation. Often times gravity won, but that was no problem as my cart was equipped with explosives or a rocket booster, so when I inevitably knocked the cart off the rails, Id do my best to launch my riders into one of the surrounding buildings for some fun destruction  I might not get a high score, but Ill take that consolation prize. While getting back on the track or restarting the entire level was just a button press away, I noticed this transition has some frame rate issues in the larger levels, or when there was a massive amount of destruction. It wasnt terrible, but it did pull me out of my adrenaline rush. Those performance woes are odd, because Demolition Expert mode doesnt share them, and its much more about breaking things for entertainment. Using small coaster cars and two-person cabins, I flung ride testers into explosives, magnets, and other objects to help me do the most damage possible. The quality of the physics of each building tumbling down or exploding is impressive  instead of disappearing into the nether, a structures rubble piles up beautifully and can even pose as another obstacle. Explosions are especially satisfying to watch, as they usually cause a massive chain reaction. It was fun to just chuck the cars at buildings randomly, but Demolition Expert was even better when I finally figured out the cadence of each level. Trampolines scattered in the water taunted me to hit them in a perfect order. Then Id see flashing red explosives in a building not too far off that I could hit with the long-distance car. Theres an unexpected amount of strategy required to get the biggest explosions  and thus the highest scores  and it was incredibly satisfying when I finally set off a chain reaction. Screamride allows for some flexibility, though, so you could fling cars without planning and still be able to pass the level. With Engineer mode, I was given all the right tools to create my own awesome rides and death traps alike. Engineer is very similar to the Sandbox mode, but here there are restrictions in place that challenge your ability to manage resources. Some levels require you to connect several track pieces together while maintaining a high speed. Others would fail you lose any riders  yeah, if your G-Force is too intense, riders will fly out of their cart. I like how it doesnt make you guess where you mess up, giving helpful hints by marking your trouble spots and where you hit achievements like high speeds. Constructing roller coasters in Engineer mode is a nice break from the chaos of the other two jobs; the music is relaxing, and the controls are simple yet complex enough to build intricate coasters. There are quite a few special loops, twists, reverse turns, jumps, and other special pieces that award extra points when used. For example, theres an ejection piece that launches a few riders out of their seats which is useful if youre trying to damage buildings or hit explosives. Regrettably, this mode has some wonky camera angles. In one level I ended up staring at a pillar surrounded by water while I heard buildings crumbling. Whether I wanted to prevent future disasters or observe the results of my intentional one, thats annoying. My frustrations didnt stop there. Out of the six areas in Screamride, the last two had an annoying difficulty spike that didnt really flow with the rest, which had progressed wonderfully with steady and enjoyable challenges. Even so, I found myself replaying the challenging levels as the leaderboards inspired me to beat my previous score. All the tools and lessons learned throughout the career mode culminate in Sandbox mode. Some of the cool amusement rides and building blueprints are locked until you reach a certain level in career mode, but theres enough to play with if youre only interested in creating levels. There are tons of building pieces in all sorts of materials and colors, so youre not limited to just building roller coasters  you can design an entire island, its buildings, and attractions piece by piece, or you can use blueprints to speed up the process. Sandbox modes tools surpass Engineers, such as with the very handy copy-and-paste tool that makes creation fast and simple. While this mode mostly gives you free reign, there is a limit to how many total pieces you can use and the maps have size restrictions, but I never found these to be severe limitations. Its easy to jump between creating and testing, so I could constantly check whether or not my ride functioned, or exploded, properly. If I liked a specific ride or building, I could select the structure or a section of it and save it as a blueprint. Whats cooler is that I could then share that blueprint or the entire level by uploading it to the Level Center. Playing and downloading other players levels is just as simple. Pros Complex creation toolsHighly replayableFun jobs Cons Difficulty spikeTechnical issues Screamrides three jobs allow you to play and pass its thrillride levels in a variety of ways, but I reached the greatest satisfaction when I discovered the perfect way to traverse a track, build a coaster, or demolish a string of buildings in ScreamRider and Demolition Expert modes. Although career mode suffers from uneven difficulty and some situational camera issues, I happily replayed levels to improve my score sheet and climb the leaderboard, or just endlessly tinker with the Sandbox mode.", "date": "March 3, 2015,"}
