Terminator: Resistance stays true to that idea; it certainly has the convincing appearance of a modern day first-person shooter campaign, but beneath the shiny veneer its mechanics and AI are seemingly ripped straight from another period in time, as though its a game thats been sent forward from 2003 to hide in the plain sight of the present on a mission to terminate hours of your life. Much like the latest film, Terminator: Dark Fate, Terminator: Resistance wisely ignores the events of every film subsequent to Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Set in 2028 Los Angeles, Terminator: Resistance casts the player as Jacob Rivers, a soldier in John Connors army who must band together with other human resistance members to stave off the annihilation line of terminators systematically wiping out all life on the planet. Its plot chronicles the future-set events that lead up to Kyle Reese and the terminator Model 101s arrival in 1984, and could well have served as a satisfying, Rogue One-esque bit of back story for fans were it not for the truly terrible dialogue and stilted voice acting that delivers so much of it. Terminator: Resistance wisely ignores the events of every film subsequent to Terminator 2: Judgement Day.Terminator: Resistance takes the franchise's obsession with making your own fate to heart, offering a healthy amount of player choice along the way. Choices may be small, such as deciding between leaving a medikit for an NPC or selfishly taking it for yourself, or large, such as whether you want to help a young woman and her little brother abscond from the underground shelter that acts as a hub in between levels, or convince them to stay. But the sum total of these choices feels fairly inconsequential, determining which ending youll arrive at upon the storys completion (assembled into an unsatisfying sequence of static storyboard images), as well as which female NPC youll have hilariously awkward first-person sex with. I'll Be Bad Ultimately the only really meaningful choice youll ever have to make in Terminator: Resistance, is whether you want to keep brainlessly blasting your way through to its completion, or hop in your car, drive back to the store and try and exchange it for something better. I suggest you hold on to your receipt, because Terminator: Resistance starts out as an extremely unsatisfying shooter and never really improves over the course of its 10-hour long, single-player-only campaign. In fact, the actual terminators dont even show up to fight you until a couple of hours in; prior to their arrival youre just machine gunning robot spiders and sentry drones as you tread and retread the same burnt out sections of post-apocalyptic Pasadena. Then when the skeletal cyborgs do arrive, theyre shockingly inept and underpowered; these arent merciless murderers that will shrug off your attacks and relentlessly pursue you like Resident Evil 2s Mr. X, theyre just tin man terminators who haplessly march into the path of your plasma rifles rounds and meekly shudder into a scattered pile of spare parts. Ive made phone calls on smarter Androids. I've made phone calls on smarter Androids.Besides, the odds are just too heavily stacked in the players favour at all times. Where there are terminators, theres always an explosive plasma barrel for them to stand around  as though its a water cooler and theyre swapping gossip about Cyberdyne's secretaries  until you plug a round into their midst and annihilate them with one shot. Additionally, an enemy-highlighting thermal vision mode can be toggled on and off at any moment, allowing you to see through walls and eliminate any possibility of an enemy ambush. On the rare occasion the terminators do catch you unawares, theyre about as accurate with their shots as a shortsighted Stormtrooper. Indeed its the player who is by far the most coldly efficient killer in Terminator: Resistance, which seems like a pretty major design oversight. Terminator: Resistance also gives you noise-making gadgets to encourage a more stealth-based approach, stimulants to slow down time during shootouts, and crafting tables to manufacture your own pipe bombs and medikits. But most of this is unnecessary since the guns are so powerful, ammunition is plentiful, and the enemies are so incredibly insipid. In Terminator: Resistances second half you get to take on hulking mechs and the airborne Hunter-Killer drones, but despite the fact they each look appropriately imposing, both of them take a dive before you can mumble a half-hearted hasta la vista, baby. Terminator: Resistance isnt all bad, though. The hacking minigame thats used to bypass doors and turn automated turrets against your enemies, resembles a monochromatic version of Frogger. And I like Frogger. So at least theres that. The most disappointing thing about Terminator: Resistance isnt merely that its bad, its that its bad and yet its probably still the best Terminator game Ive ever played. If youre in the mood to mindlessly mow down waves of authentically modelled T-800s to the rhythm of Brad Fiedels iconic theme music, then Terminator: Resistance may well be adequate enough. But while there might already be a truly great Terminator game in some alternate universes timeline, in this one the wait continues.", "date": "Nov. 17, 2019,"}
