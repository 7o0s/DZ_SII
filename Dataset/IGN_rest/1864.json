Admittedly, its a hypothetical that The Messenger sort of already answered back in 2018... but look, sometimes questions like these can have multiple good answers, and Cyber Shadow is no better proof of that. This retro-styled action platformer developed by Mechanical Head Studios and published by Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Game is a truly great take on the 2D Ninja Gaiden formula  but more than that, its constantly evolving and brilliantly adds new gameplay and level design challenges with every new upgrade that it gives you. These upgrades continue to compound upon each other to the point that, by the time you reach the end of Cyber Shadows seven to eight-hour adventure, its morphed from a simple yet fun action platformer to an absolutely wild and occasionally brutally difficult one that surpasses its inspiration in every way. Cyber Shadow puts you into the pixelated ninja boots of the titular (cyber) Shadow, who awakens from an incubation pod to find a destroyed city thats been overrun by out-of-control machines. Its a serviceable story at best, told through both in-game dialogue boxes and nostalgic 8-bit cutscenes with large, detailed, but still very low-res sprites, much like the NES Ninja Gaiden games. Its big weakness is that theres just very little personality to any of it. Shadow himself is a mute protagonist, and with one notable exception (whos gone all too quickly) all of the characters he interacts with largely feel like they exist solely to be exposition dumps. Theres little reason to care about the evil Dr. Progen, your master, or the members of your clan he holds captive. Where Cyber Shadow does deliver, however, is in its gameplay. It really hits on all fronts: level design, enemy design, enemy variety, character progression, boss battles  its all top notch. Your set of tools begins very modestly: Shadow can jump and can slash his sword horizontally, and... thats it. This limited moveset is a large part of what drives the challenge in the early goings because enemies and obstacles approach from all angles but you can only hit things that are directly in front of you (much like in, you guessed it, Ninja Gaiden). Cyber Shadow's gameplay really hits on all fronts. But this is a modern take on old-school design, and it comes with modern assists to help smooth the hard edges a little: checkpoints not only give you a respawn point but also restore your health when you step on them. If thats not enough, you can spend a currency called essence to unlock permanent upgrades for that specific checkpoint that will either restore your magic or provide you with a powerup when you respawn from there. These powerups are especially cool because theyre almost always specifically designed to be especially useful in the upcoming section; for example, a shield that can block projectiles from the front right that becomes available before a particularly bullet-hellish encounter. My absolute favorite powerup, though, is the aptly named Swag Blade. This monster tethers a saw blade to your character that can be manipulated through your momentum. So if theres an enemy above you that you cant hit with your sword, you can simply jump in place until the Swag Blade gets enough momentum to bounce up and down and reach it. Or if theres an enemy straight ahead, you can also strike the blade with your sword to give it some instant forward momentum and take them out from a distance. Its a super fun and creative weapon to use, and I wish I was given more opportunity to do so than the one chapter its available in. Essence and Spirit Cyber Shadow really hits its stride just a little more than halfway through, once you gain the ability to sprint. Its at this point where it metamorphosizes from a Ninja Gaiden-esque larva state and becomes entirely its own beast. Sprinting gives you the ability to use a super-fast dash slice that can go right through enemies and obstacles, allowing you to use it both as a devastating attack and to reach new areas  sometimes even both at the same time. Some of the best moments came when I was able to dash my way across a level without ever touching the ground. All throughout Cyber Shadows campaign, it never feels like its running out of ideas, and I found myself uniquely challenged by each new chapter even as my abilities and strengths grew. A lot is thrown at you all at once, often while forcing you to deal with some other sort of environmental nightmare, like: orbital laser beams, a creeping mass of instant-kill spikes, a rising elevator that threatens to squish you below instant-kill spikes, or security lasers that, when tripped, will activate extra enemy robots and turrets that mercilessly hunt you down. Needless to say, Cyber Shadow becomes quite difficult, but it's a difficulty that always felt manageable once Id learned the various quirks and nuances of the many enemies that patrol each chapter. Most have multiple spots where they can be hit, and they change their behavior depending on what part of their body you break; others are seemingly impenetrable until youre able to use Shadows projectile parry to stop their bullets and send them flying right back towards them; and others still fly at you from awkward angles, forcing you to reposition before youre able to take them out. Theres just an incredible amount of variety in the enemy design, and it works hand in hand with both the level design and Shadows upgrades to ensure that Cyber Shadow is consistently fresh and challenging. There are definitely instances where the checkpoints are spaced a little bit too far apart.That being said, not all of the difficulty is what Id categorize as ~good difficulty.~ There are definitely instances where the checkpoints are spaced a little bit too far from one another, which can be the wrong kind of brutal. Naturally, any frustration I felt was eventually washed away by a much stronger feeling of triumph once I finally hit that next checkpoint, but there were definitely several moments in the latter half where I was shocked at how long I had been playing in a single life without hitting a checkpoint or the end of the level. After defeating the final boss I was surprised to find that theres no New Game+ or anything of the sort waiting in the post game, but there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades that can be found by revisiting earlier levels with abilities you obtain later, which provides some extra value for those who like to aim for 100% completion. Beyond that, theres also the signature Yacht Club list of feats that provide a set of unique challenges, like making it to the first boss without killing any enemies or defeating a certain boss without damaging it with your sword. Theres seemingly no reward for completing these, but theyre fun and interesting enough to make me want to try and accomplish as many as I can anyway; a task that will keep me busy for quite a while. Finally, its worth mentioning one other similarity between Cyber Shadow and The Messenger: their soundtracks are both absolute bangers. Every chapter has its own theme song, often with multiple arrangements that adjust the moods appropriately, and its all extremely catchy and well produced. Cyber Shadow is a wonderful merging of old-school aesthetic and modern design sensibilities, much like Shovel Knight was back in 2014. Sure, its story is forgettable and some of its checkpoint placements are far enough apart to make me hesitant to apply a tough but fair label without caveats, but the way it evolves and changes over the course of its seven to eight hour campaign thanks to excellent level, enemy, and progression design is exemplary. Combine that with whats an early contender for best soundtrack of 2021, and its easy to see Cyber Shadow as the start of something great for both Mechanical Head Studios and Yacht Club Games.", "date": "Jan. 25, 2021,"}
