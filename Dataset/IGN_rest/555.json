Its a Frankensteinian fantasy thats just as fun as it sounds, and it more than compensates for the flimsy story and characters that come along with it. The killer robots, whove been unleashed on the Commonwealth by a silly self-proclaimed supervillain called the Mechanist, are creatively designed and diverse enough to keep things interesting. Though the robots are limited to about a half-dozen primary hulls, theyre iterated upon with lots of custom designs: adorned with spikes, skulls, armor plate, and a huge variety of weaponry. Some lumber, some sprint, some fly, and almost all are truly threatening. One energetic variety (which I lovingly dubbed the stabbybot) attacks like a raging madman - leaping into the air, knocking me down, and perforating my body with repeated thrusts of their bladed hands. Automatron is quite challenging in places thanks to the heavy weaponry, speed, and durability of these new foes. Necessity is the Mother of Invention To counter these threats, Automatron provides the useful ability to redesign and upgrade robot companions. Allies like Curie and newcomer Ada can be delightfully transformed into veritable death machines. Each bots components can be mixed, matched, extensively customized, and individually armored. I was also thrilled to discover I could create my own robotic servants from scratch. Its extraordinary how much the extra control over my companions added to my enjoyment of Fallout 4. Im not sure Ill ever go back to my less-customizable companions again. I did find myself wishing Id dumped a few more points into the Robotics perk early in Fallout 4, as the ability is essential to unlocking some of the most interesting and powerful robot equipment. If you dont have an Intelligence-centric build headed into the game, youre definitely in for some grinding if you want to unlock everything. Even without a single level in Robotics, however, I was able to do some impressive customization on Ada. Speaking of Ada, shes kind of bland, a fault that extends to most of Automatrons characters. The snide and passive-aggressive AI Jezebel is poorly developed, and the potentially interesting story around the Mechanist is sadly underutilized. Automatrons threadbare story plays out in four quests which most people will probably compete in about three or four hours. A trail of electronic breadcrumbs winds through a short series of challenging combat encounters and linear dungeons leading up to a confrontation with The Mechanist. Shakespeare this aint, but thankfully the exciting action sequences, salvageable robot parts, and mission reward items are enough to keep me going forward. A Junkbot sprays lasers That final battle glitched out on me a couple of times, though. I had to reload and refight a portion of the sequence in order to progress. Ive learned to save often in Fallout games, but I would have been ticked if I hadnt been adequately prepared. Still, I really enjoyed bringing my robot companions into the rest of the Commonwealth outside the Automatron content. Having a new buddy with a brand new set of abilities to run interference reinvigorated my interest in traveling a world that Ive explored pretty thoroughly. I also really enjoyed testing my bots abilities and experimenting with different configurations to find optimal builds. I also appreciated the presence of radiant postgame robot quests that allowed me to salvage for parts, though I wish they could be triggered from my settlements instead of tiresomely traveling to the same distant NPC every time I wanted to hunt down more components. Pros Robots, robots, robotsCustomization optionsExciting action Cons Anemic storyBoring characters Automatron is a fun piece of DLC that expands Fallout 4 in some interesting ways, applying the sort of customization previously reserved for settlements to your traveling companions. The results are satisfying. The story mode is brief, the narrative is mundane, and sadly the all-too-familiar Fallout 4 bugs are still hanging around, but the overall experience is rewarding, imaginative, and a pleasure to play.", "date": "March 25, 2016"}
