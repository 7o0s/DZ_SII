You can find the individual reviews below for my in-depth thoughts on each piece. Crackdown 3  Campaign Review Crackdown 3  Wrecking Zone Multiplayer Review This final, full Verdict and score at the bottom covers the entirety of Crackdown 3, but is not an average of the two. Though the Wrecking Zone multiplayer is bad, it's such a tiny slice of the whole package that its presence doesn't weigh Crackdown 3 down too much. Crackdown 3 Campaign Review ~On paper, Crackdown 3s single-player campaign checks all the boxes that made the original an enjoyable game  but playing through it is about as exciting as running down a checklist and becomes downright repetitive after the first few hours. Its second-to-second combat is uninteresting outside of a couple of boss fights, and even though theres a compulsive satisfaction to be had in crossing off its many itemized activities, it's never any more than that.~ Crackdown 2 Multiplayer Review ~While the environmental destruction of Crackdown 3: Wrecking Zone is impressive, it misses every opportunity to use it in interesting ways to enhance the otherwise barebones and uninteresting multiplayer combat, where aiming is all but completely automated. You can see everything Wrecking Zone has to offer in about 30 minutes, minus the time youre going to spend matchmaking after every round. Unless a lot changes, Wrecking Zone just isnt worth the time it takes.~ While the environmental destruction of Crackdown 3: Wrecking Zone is impressive, it misses every opportunity to use it in interesting ways to enhance the otherwise barebones and uninteresting multiplayer combat, where aiming is all but completely automated.
