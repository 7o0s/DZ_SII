It's a bit more expensive than competing models but performed well in our benchmarking and hands-on testing. Before we jump in, let's take a look at the baseline specs, as supplied by the manufacturer: Design and Features The Asus VG248QE (See it on Amazon) is a 24-inch widescreen LED gaming monitor with a black chassis and a sturdy round base with handy cord-keeper attached. It comes with a dual-link DVI cable, audio cable, power cord, quick start guide, support CD, and warranty card that explains the details of its generous three years of coverage. While the monitor also has DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, you'll have to supply your own cables. Keep in mind that the maximum refresh rate is available only when using DisplayPort or DVI input and is also dependent on your computer's graphics card. There are also no USB ports so you'll have to tether your gaming mouse and keyboard to a computer or go wireless. As far as ergonomic adjustments go, the VG248QE offers options in every direction and is very easy to adjust. It can be swiveled by 45 degrees left and right, pivoted 90 degrees (landscape or portrait), and tilted forward 15 degrees and backward 5 degrees, and its height can also be adjusted by 4.3 inches. It has built-in 2-watt stereo speakers, but you'll probably want to upgrade to dedicated set because they are weak and better than nothing, but that's about it. You can access brightness, contrast, color saturation, skin, and color temperature using hotkeys on the bottom right of the bezel as well as enable customized viewing modes for theater, gaming, night view and others. It has some quirky features just for gaming too, including one named GamePlus that lets you choose between four different crosshair types depending on the game. It's good for honing your skills or if you're new to first-person shooters. You can also enable an onscreen timer if you want to limit gameplay time, which is a bizarre inclusion. The VG248QE also supports 3D gaming and movie watching, but glasses are not included. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate but lacks any type of adaptive refresh technology such as AMD's FreeSync or Nvidia's G-Sync, but the benefit is the high refresh rate will work with any GPU. Performance I tested overall and gaming performance using Lagom LCD monitor test pages for black and white levels, color gradient, and response time. The Asus VG248QE performed well with impressive black levels, only flagging at the darker end of the spectrum. It also excelled in white saturation, struggling only at the brighter end of the spectrum. Banding is an issue that can occur in gaming, in which color and brightness variations show lines and bands rather than smooth color. The Lagom test uses grayscale gradients, and a poor monitor will show not just bands, but color when it can't render the image properly. The Asus passed this test with flying colors. For response time, which measures how well a monitor reacts to changes on the screens, essential in fast-paced gaming, the Lagom test uses patterns with pixels that are switched on and off. When viewed from a distance, these flashing patterns are undetectable on the best monitors. The Lagom test features eight patterns, and when viewed on the Asus, the flashing was imperceptible or barely noticeable in half of the patterns and gradually became more apparent in the other four. Next, we used the Blur Busters ghosting test, set to a speed of 960 pixels per second, which tests for motion blur and the resulting artifacts that can manifest as trailing color from a moving object. In this test the Asus performed well with no obvious artifacts. The Asus VG248QE looked crisp and vivid when playing Marvel Heroes 2016 on a PC. The monitor displayed rich colors with no noticeable lag or artifacts. It also displayed crisp, smooth video when viewing fast action gaming demos. Although priced slightly too high to be a true contender for the ~entry level 144Hz~ crown, the Asus VG248QE is still a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade. The Asus VG248QE performed well in both subjective and objective benchmark-based tests, and can be adjusted to make your long gaming sessions comfortable too. Video and games look pretty awesome and it's available at a reasonable price.", "date": "Jan. 25, 2017,"}
