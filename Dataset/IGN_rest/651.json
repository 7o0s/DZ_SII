Heres what we had to say: ~Divinity: Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years. Its quests and combat compelled me to think hard about my actions and choices, which is more than I usually get to say about contemporary RPGs. Its depth, personality, and combat challenges easily allow it to hold its own against the likes of heavyweights like Dragon Age: Origins.~ It was difficult to imagine Original Sins old-school complexity working on consoles (read our full review for Divinity: Original Sin for complete details), but Enhanced Edition successfully makes it happen without any sacrifices. Though the same inventory criticisms apply, the highly interactive world of Rivellon and the finely detailed RPG systems therein are completely intact. Divinity in the Details Because of all of its complexity, there's an enormous amount of information to process in Original Sin, and Enhanced Edition does an excellent job of displaying it on a TV screen in a way thats easily readable from the couch, and mapping controls to the gamepad accordingly. Independently managing the inventories of every member of my party is still the pretty fiddly and cumbersome , but thanks to smart use of selection radials and intelligent button mapping, its not too much of an issue. Triangle or Y always gives detailed info about what youre looking at, and square or B always brings up a list of actions you can take on whatever youre targeting. This consistency kept all the options and information readily and intuitively available, so I could make informed roleplaying decisions. New Pages in the Spellbook In terms of new content, the biggest addition is the full voicing of pretty much every NPC, which adds a layer of immersion to a world that was already very well-realized. New areas and skills have been added too, and while theyre appreciated, Divinity is already so large and exhaustive these feel more like cherries on top as opposed to a whole new scoop. For instance, the addition of dual wielding as a combat style helps make off-hand weapons more viable, but it isn't exactly a reason to replay if you've already sunk 100 hours into the original. What might convince veterans to play again though, is the inclusion of split-screen local play, making the unique co-op potential of Original Sin easier to discover than with the online mode. Splitting your party up to explore separately and settling disputed quest choices with a virtual game of rock, paper, scissors adds a wonderful slice of actual pen-and-paper roleplaying to an experience that already feels like the genuine article. All of these features, including controller support and split screen co-op, are available on the free upgrade for the PC version. Pros Gamepad controls mappingUnmatched RPG depthSplit-screen co-opFully voiced NPCs Cons Lots of inventory management If you want the RPG with the most skills, the most stats to consider, and a world that constantly makes meaningful use of every line on your character sheet, theres nothing else quite like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition. You can find RPGs that are prettier, more accessible, or less busy, but very few are as dedicated to the true spirit of role-playing as this one is.", "date": "Oct. 27, 2015,"}
