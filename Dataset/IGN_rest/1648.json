This time around our auto-moving protectee is a living sphere named Q, a guy who just can't seem to keep himself from rolling straight toward open pits in the ground. It's up to you to fill in the gaps before he gets to them, and to do that you've got to break apart some properly-shaped blocks and quickly maneuver them into position. A grid of breakable bricks shows up down on the touch screen, and you use the stylus to tap away the ones you don't need -- so if you've got a pit approaching that's shaped like the letter T, you shave off the bottom left and right corners and then tap OK to launch your chiseled pit-filler up into the playing field. This is simple, slow-moving and admittedly boring stuff on the game's Easy setting -- but ratchet up the difficulty to Normal or Hard and it soon becomes frantic and interesting. The key to the design's appeal is that the pits that appear on harder difficulties demand multiple bricks to be filled properly -- and you're always forced to close the entire gap before Q can roll on safely. So you're fast-tapping your way to carving out a single little brick to zip down into the bottom, then carving a second piece to Tetris-slide over into the other side, then trying to match the rest of whatever odd shape is left as Q is creeping precipitously close to cascading over the open edge. CLOSING COMMENTS It's neat. Not the most revolutionary puzzler ever, and certainly not the prettiest -- but a fine little design for DSiWare, especially at its budget-friendly pricepoint of just two bucks.
