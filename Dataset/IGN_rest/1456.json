Dungeon Village is the latest simulation game from Kairosoft. The company's previous sims have covered malls, game development, soccer, cruise lines, hot springs, and plenty more. But Dungeon Village seems specifically designed to capture gamers' hearts -- it allows players to construct a fantasy RPG town and send heroes off to battle tiny, pixelated monsters. Through building and nurturing a city of varied offerings, the town attracts heroes. Once a hero moves in, you can recruit them for quests ranging from clearing dungeons and ruins to cleaning up monster outbreaks. Whatever those tiny heroes earn on the job goes back to improving the town. Between adventures, you also hold events to drum up popularity and get your town's name out there. As more heroes move in, acquire better equipment, and clear quests, your town's renown climbs toward the ultimate goal: a five star rating. Did we like it? Dungeon Village is one of the best Kairosoft titles available -- at least the first time around. The adorable pixel art of its varied monsters, mountains of loot, and the driving pursuit of both gold and popularity make it an extremely fun game. The tried and true Kairosoft formula applies well to this setting. Outfitting a bevy of heroes with fire axes, tinkering with magical recipes, and deciding the right number of heroes to send on a quest makes for a fun experience. Though once you hire the best possible heroes to join any open slots left in a party, quests become a little too easy. Additionally, the game's job system seems largely superfluous. Sure you can turn someone into an archer, but they can still handle some business with an axe in hand. After sixteen in-game years of looting and battling, you set a high score based on quests completed, buildings built, gold stacked, and a few other factors. But here a problem arises. Looking back over a full run-through, outside of a few details there's very little incentive to try and beat that high score. The variation in points and success feels minor. After you recruit some heroes, get them settled in town and outfitted with the best equipment available, there's very little challenge outside of waiting for resources to build up and upgrading the town. That said, the charm of the setting and multitude of loot drops really makes this an exciting little game -- even if it's only worth a single playthrough. Should you buy it? Do you like collecting loot? Do you enjoy watching heroes slay tiny pixelated monsters? Do you enjoy town simulation games from Kairsoft? Dungeon Village is a great little game. It's one of the best Kairosoft games out there mainly due to its setting and charm. Watching (temporarily) slain heroes get thrown from haunted houses, sphinx temples, and deep caverns remains entertaining throughout. The loot feels endless, and conquering a tough fight feels great. $4.99 is a little steep, but it's the price of entry for nearly every Kairosoft title. Gamers on the fence can try the ~lite~ version risk-free. CLOSING COMMENTS Dungeon Village is a little too easy, but its art, items, and charm are more than enough to warrant a download. This is truly a gamer's simulation and it's about time Kairosoft tackled RPGs.
