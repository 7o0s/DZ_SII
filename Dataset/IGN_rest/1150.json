Youre not quite close enough to disarm, too close to risk jumping over their head and impaling yourself on their readied blade. You take a few steps towards and away from each other, feinting, then suddenly your opponent strikes and you flick the sword out of their hand, stab them, and run past, gaining vital ground for a few seconds before you meet again. Nidhogg is all about that millisecond of success or failure, where strategy and instinct crystallise into a single decisive instant and either you or your opponent slumps in a pixellated puddle. In single-player Nidhogg is a great, tense, and energetic sword-fighting game, good for a few hours of fun, but in multiplayer it is essential. You fight across four brightly coloured worlds, with simple hazards like clouds that dissolve or moving conveyor belts to further enliven your one-on-one face-offs. The gaudy, pixellated art style makes Nidhogg unmistakable to look at. Showers of bright blood paint the levels as you move through them stabbing each other, memorialising each momentary struggle; if someone runs into your sword they stay impaled whilst you wiggle the sword up and down, entertainingly prolonging their humiliation and showering the level in red or orange pixels. The aim is to make it all the way to the left or right of the level. Whoever makes the first kill earns the right to run for five or 10 seconds before their opponent respawns, and another momentary struggle ensues. Matches can either be lightning-quick, as one player leaps and stabs and runs to the finish outwitting the other at every turn, or 20-minute battles of attrition where youre eking ground back and forth from each other. Either way it is tense, exciting, and always, always fun. The foundation of Nidhoggs brilliance is the excellent balance of its control system. Like in any great fighting game, every single move can be countered, so winning relies on your reflexes, the strength of your nerves and - crucially - on reading what your opponent might do next. Against the AI in single-player, that third element is least important, which is why Nidhoggs single-player struggles to sustain long-term appeal. Running through the 12 single-player opponents is entertaining, but really what its good for it sharpening your skills against human opponents. where anticipating your adversarys actions is central to every match. There are certain people I can beat every time, others who seem to be able to read my mind. It makes for an addictive, varied, and absurdly competitive multiplayer experience - sometimes youre on stunning form, other times you crumble totally under pressure. The sword can be held in high, mid, and low positions, you can jump and duck, and if youre desperate you can throw your sword after a fleeing opponent. From these basic fundamentals you can conjure rolls, running dives, dive kicks, and more, but every technique has its pitfalls. Dive kick at an opponent holding their sword aloft and youll impale yourself. Try to roll past, and you can stick yourself on a lowered sword. The simplicity of the control system makes Nidhogg something that anybody can pick up and play immediately, but it also supports nuanced tactics that make high-level play an electrifying battle of minds as well as reflexes. Theres a parry system that can see your sword go spinning away from you if you strike and your opponent changes stance at the right time, meaning you either have to scramble desperately to pick it up or make the ballsy decision to fight bare-handed (which almost never works out, but if you do manage to kill someone without a sword its a glorious moment). A thrown sword can either stick in a fleeing opponents back or clatter uselessly off an outstretched blade. Every single action in Nidhogg has a palpable, exciting element of risk, and no moment of triumph or defeat lasts longer than a second. Nidhogg leaves you to learn all the subtleties of the control system for yourself - the tutorial only outlines the basics (and ironically, it failed to load properly on my PC a few times, forcing restarts). Most of the skills Ive picked up have come from other people - people whove killed me with a rolling stab that I didnt know was possible or taught me just the right timing for throwing the sword. Nidhoggs online matchmaking and invite system arent totally reliable at the moment (it can take a while to find you a match and invites dont go through 100% of the time), which makes local multiplayer the best option if youve got it, but for as long as youve got someone to play with, Nidhogg will provide entertainment. Pros Excellent balanceVisually strikingExceptionally good multiplayerAccessible and nuanced Cons Short single-player Individual matches might last a nerve-shredding 15 minutes or barely more than 90 seconds, but Nidhoggs tense sword battles are something I am likely to play all year against different people. Despite the surreal abstraction of the art style this feels more realistic than any sword-fighting than anything else Ive ever played, where a single slip in concentration can mean your end. Its the most exhilarating competitive game Ive played in years.", "date": "Jan. 16, 2014,"}
