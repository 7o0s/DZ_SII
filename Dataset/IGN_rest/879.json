But this is the 21st century, and Western moviemakers are still trying to figure out how to cheaply tap into the Asian film market. Thus far, their formula is simple: go to a century where birthright ascension to ruling is still in place, pit family dishonor versus honor, and (a la 47 Ronin) drop at least one known white actor in there. Outcast drops two: Christensen, and the always willing Nicolas Cage. This Chinese-Canadian-French co-production bumbles from a beginning battle in the Middle East  which has the same quality of production value as a re-enactment that would air on The History Channel (except with more blood)  where we are introduced to Jacob and Gallain (Cage) slaughtering batches of holy warriors in oppositional garments. Jacob does go East, seemingly only because hes addicted to opium. Hes chasing the dragon, because us Westerners know that expression. First-time director Nick Powell (who, in another trend, was plucked from the stunt -choreography ranks a la first time directors of John Wick, Need For Speed, etc.) attempts to show us Jacobs hazy, wobbly pipe addiction through stumbling first-person camerawork. When his sword is taken at a tavern, the viewer feels like theyve entered a POV video game. But this visual trope is quickly scuttled when, somehow, Jacob regains enough wherewithal to fight and kill an entire army search squad and get his sword back. Since the searchers were out to locate a 10-year-old King-in-waiting (Bill Su Jiahang) and his older sister (Yifei Liu), so that they could hand him over to be murdered by their older, war-mongering brother (Andy On), Jacob now has a protection task: escort the two wee ones to safety. Jacob gets a shot at redemption, sobriety, and saving all of the Chinese empire by keeping the War Son away from the throne. Regardless of how ridiculous or shoddy the story is (hello! to every costume, set piece, hair styling, and line of dialogue  your 21st century prop house and thesaurus page flips are showing), the biggest flub that Powell makes is his characterization of the family dynasty strife. Su-Jiahang, Liu, and the former King (played by Shi Liang) are all wide-mouth, golden-hued, awestruck scions of innate goodness. And the brother is pure evil, willing to kill his entire family over his (all caps) BIRTHRIGHT. The only characters given any space for any type of flaw or backstory are the white saviors. Jacob is tempted by drugs and women, but remembers a time when a Holy warrior, Gallain, believed in him. Which brings us to Cage. After a few quick glimpses in the first hour we dont see Gallain until much later into Outcasts runtime. And Cage makes up for lost time. Every bit of his performance could be uploaded to another bonkers Nic Cage compilation video. He uses some geographically unknown accent thats physically located in the lower regions of his throat. He squints because hes blind in one eye, and since one half of his face is closed and expressionless, the other half is full engaged. He barks lines such as, Wheres my wine? in a way that only Nic Cage can. His Gallain is now a rouge outlaw. And again, the golden hope of China provides him a shot at redemption. In a more gently constructed actioner  that would actually take time and effort to build their Chinese characters Cages bonkers moments would be awfully distracting. In Outcast theyre the only moments with any verve. Cage is chasing the WTF-dragon, here. And I recommend that you just wait for that compilation to land on YouTube, rather than seek out Outcast. Western filmmakers should halt going East for their pillaging dollars until they can actually engage with the culture enough to give us something more than another Golden Child, opium addicts, and white saviors. Pros Nicolas Cage is blind in one eyeNICOLAS CAGE IS BLIND IN ONE EYE!

Outcast is so shoddy in storytelling and character building that Nic Cages odd acting choices are a welcome awareness of awfulness.", "date": "Feb. 8, 2015,"}
