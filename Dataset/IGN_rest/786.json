Like any good puzzle game, it tosses lots of variety on top of an easy-to-learn idea, in this case revolving around a plain-looking living box that turns into more boxes. But what makes it a great game is how well the collection of puzzles comes together for over 100 stages, and beyond. The core concept of BoxBoy couldnt be any simpler: You play as Qbby, a small white box with tiny arms and legs. He cant jump very far or high, but Qbby does have a surprisingly useful talent: he can replicate himself to create a string of boxes, an ability with clever applications like creating a bridge of boxes to safely cross over deadly pits, or building three-block staircases to reach higher platforms. The early stages contain lots of easy levels that painlessly introduce us to these ideas. But just two or three hours into the six-hour campaign, BoxBoy satisfied my need for a puzzling challenge. It continued to unfold and present even more interesting and progressively wackier mechanics along the way, never reusing any for too long, and each new implementation feels clever. You can use five boxes to shield Qbby from deadly lasers, or use a string of attached boxes as an anchor to pull yourself to a ledge  and thats just the start. Later levels offer a stiff challenge, but it never feels overbearing or cheap. Occasional tutorial videos play on loop in the background of some levels, but BoxBoy never outright reveals the solution (unless you use the buy a hint help system). Instead, it uses excellent level design to push you in the right direction. When I wasnt sure what to do, experimentation would show me the way forward. BoxBoy doesnt punish you for trying either  if you die, you respawn immediately at a nearby checkpoint, ready to try, try again. Some of the harder levels conveniently tuck checkpoints into the puzzles themselves, as a helpful way to understand that youre on the right track. BoxBoys simple black-and-white graphics wont light the world on fire with their personality or style, but its not a huge detractor either. The world can feel charming at times, but also very sterile  Ive seen actual scientific labs with more specks of personality than these monochrome rooms  but by efficiently clearing levels you unlock currency to spend on silly costumes, which provide just a dash of humor. Theres just something about clearing a level as a box dressed as a ninja, a rapper, or a wacky professor that gave it a little extra flavor. BoxBoy can create a string of boxes to protect himself or reach higher platforms. Pros Excellent puzzlesRamping challengeCustomizationLots of levels Cons Simple graphics It might not look like much, but BoxBoy is one of the cleverest puzzle platformers Ive ever played. The constant variety gave me dozens of uses for Qbbys simple-to-learn self-replicating abilities. Coupled with great pacing and level designs that encourage and reward experimentation, I just couldnt put it down until Id cleared the 18-world campaign and put some time into the delightful side challenges.", "date": "May 6, 2015, 1"}
