Thus its exciting that its BlackWidow X series of keyboards are designed to be the value lineup for the highly-acclaimed BlackWidow models, with the goal being to provide quality and style without cost-adding extras like USB and audio pass-through ports, a decorative top cover, and a wrist rest. The BlackWidow X Ultimate sells for under $100, which is pretty reasonable for a backlit, mechanical keyboard. There's also a RGB ~Chroma~ version too but it'll set you back an additional $30. It's also worth noting that Razer recently announced ~V2~ of the BlackWidow with a magnetic wrist rest and a new yellow switch that is silent as opposed to clicky. This review is specifically covering the tried-and-true original BlackWidow X Ultimate. Design and Features The BlackWidow X Ultimate is aggressively styled without crossing over into being over-styled. The base looks like a solid block of aluminum covered with keys and the absence of a top cover leaves the military grade Razer switches exposed. Everything about the BlackWidow X Ultimate says this keyboard is built to last. Heavy and sturdy are, however, at odds with portable as the keyboard weighs over 3lbs, and doesn't have a detachable USB cable either. The top of the keyboard contains a key layout that is exactly what youd expect, with the keys separated into tiers reminiscent of an old-school typewriter. There are 12 function keys across the top, and F1 through F8 double as multimedia controls (volume, play, pause, etc) which is much more difficult to deal with than dedicated media controls since you need both hands to adjust anything. F9 is for on-the-fly macro recording, F10 sets gaming mode (disables the Windows-specific keys and key combos), and F11 and F12 are used to adjust the backlight brightness. On the far right of the top row of keys is a key that toggles sleep mode on and off so you can easily put your rig to bed. The special function keys are set far enough away from the regular keys to avoid hitting them by mistake. The USB connector cable is braided to increase durability and prevent tangles, which is appreciated. Another nice touch is the bottom of the BlackWidow X Ultimate has channels going left, right and straight so you can route the USB cable in a certain direction to keep it out of the way. There are solid rubberized feet for the keyboard to rest on that prevent it from sliding around on the desk, and along with its weight combine to make the BlackWidow X Ultimate firmly planted at all times. The ~legs~ are sturdy and can be flipped down to elevate the top of the keyboard for a more natural typing position, but there isn't a wrist rest on this version of the BlackWidow. It uses Razer's patented Razer Green switches, which offer an industry-leading 80 million keystrokes. Software The Razer Synapse software is used to rebind controls, create and assign macros to keys, and customize the backlighting of the keys. Downloading it is a cinch since a notice appeared on-screen to do so when I first connected the keyboard to my Windows 10 PC. This software saves all its macros and lighting schemes to the cloud so I can take them with me on the road. On-the-fly macro recording can automate repetitive tasks in games and Razer makes this just about as easy as it can be. I just had to press FN and F9 to start recording, then press all the keys that I wanted to record, and finally press FN and F9 when I was done recording. A Macro Recording light would blink as a prompt to assign the macro key. There's also the option to use the Razer Synapse software to map and record macros. I find creating intricate light shows with my keyboard in the category of frivolous yet obviously a lot of gamers dig it, and those gamers will enjoy the features of the BlackWidow X Ultimate. The Razer Synapse software lets you customize the look of your keyboard by allowing you to choose from six different basic lighting effects or create your own using the Effect Configurator. You can create waves of color that sweep across the backlit keys, ripple patterns, and a reactive pattern that lights the keys when theyre pressed among others. One major annoyance I experienced with the keyboard lighting is on the F1-12 keys the number of the key is lit up, but not its sub-function, even though the indicator is just millimeters away. This makes figuring out which keys do what in low light way more difficult than it should be, and is one of my biggest issues with this keyboard. Gaming Simply put, I love the feel of typing and playing games using the BlackWidow X Ultimate. The clickety-clack of the mechanical switches is oddly satisfying as is the action of pressing each key. As a reasonably fast touch typist I found that it took about 15 minutes to adapt to the BlackWidow X Ultimates tiered key layout. After that I could type as fast on it as I can on any keyboard. It was a pleasure to play Overwatch with this snappy keyboard. Likewise, I enjoyed the more deliberate mechanics required to succeed in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Did the BlackWidow X Ultimate make me a better gamer? Absolutely not. My hands and wrists did feel comfortable as I typed all day and then played all night, which is high praise for a keyboard. It was also easy to record macros while gaming, although some gamers will miss dedicated macro buttons. Overall, I enjoyed the Blackwidow X Ultimate about as much as Ive ever enjoyed a keyboard. The Razer Blackwidow X Ultimate is a well-constructed mechanical gaming keyboard with snappy keys and a comfortable design. The heavy aluminum housing and stout key mechanisms feel like they could survive the nuclear holocaust, and the lighting is cool if you're into that sort of thing. The only real knock on the BlackWidow X Ultimate is its lack of dedicated media keys and the fact that none of the F-key sub-functions are illuminated, making navigating settings in the dark a bit tricky.", "date": "March 15, 2017"}
