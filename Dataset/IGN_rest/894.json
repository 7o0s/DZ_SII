We've seen it since on the large and excellent Galaxy Note 4, and if Samsung's own statements are any indication, we'll surely see it on the Galaxy S5's successor rather soon. But the Galaxy Alphaavailable exclusively in the States through AT&Tisn't just a proof of concept meant to propel Samsung onto bigger and better things: it's also a pretty sharp phone in its own right, albeit with a couple of frustrating concessions and a bloated price tag. As hinted above, the super sleek, metal-bound design is the most interesting thing about the Galaxy Alpha, giving it much more of a high-end aura than previous Galaxy models. Still, if you thought Samsung closely mimicked Apple's designs with earlier phones, just compare the Galaxy Alpha to the iPhone 5s. The chamfered metal edge effect is nearly identical at a glance, and it even has the little plastic gaps on the frame to help with reception, albeit in different spots than on the last-gen iPhone. But the Galaxy Alpha has its own attractive design elements that thankfully make it more than an iPhone knockoff. For one thing, the metal frame flares out just slightly at the top and bottom of the sides, creating attractive edges that look physically sharp but are smooth to the touch. It's also an amazingly thin device at 0.26 inches, and both the bezel around the 4.7-inch screen and the back cover are covered in hundreds of super tiny plus signs, resulting in a distinctive, uniform pattern. The removable backing remains a textured polycarbonate with something of a spongy surface. Some may find it slimy or odd, but I enjoy the added grip, and it fits snugly against the metal core. The overall result is a one-handed device that feels very comfortable in the hand, but looks like a million bucks compared to the company's earlier offerings. It's distinctive, stylish, and cool, and sure to be the blueprint for Samsung's next ~next big thing.~ But for a device pegged as a smaller flagship alternative, the screen quality disappoints. It's a 720p AMOLED display, which should be plenty sharp, especially with a pixel density (312 ppi) not far below the iPhone 6. But at that resolution, Samsung's diamond PenTile subpixel arrangement makes the individual pixels very easy to pick out, and there's a slight bluish tone to what you see. The screen is plenty bright and the colors absolutely pop; from a distance, it looks fantastic. But with regular, up-close use, it's just not as sharp as you'd expect from a device of this price and design. At least the core internal specs are in line with the S5, thanks to the identical 2.5Ghz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor with 2GB RAM. Everyday tasks are an absolute breeze for the handset, and glossy 3D games don't pose any kind of problem either. And AT&T's 4G LTE network offered no issues during testing, with clear calls and strong, reliable data use for browsing, downloads, and streaming. But elsewhere, the Galaxy Alpha feels a bit too trimmed down. Offering only a 32GB internal storage optionwith no ability to use microSD cardslimits its usefulness for those who want to store ample media on the device. And the 1860mAh battery is a definite step down from the Galaxy S5. True, it's not powering quite the same level of screen, and with only moderate use, you'll stretch a full day out of a single charge with no issue. But battery life seems to take a huge hit from high-performance games, and whatever you're using it for, the Galaxy Alpha will need to be charged every night with any level of regular daily use. The Galaxy Alpha maintains a couple of hardware perks first seen on the S5most notably the fingerprint sensor, which is still a very hit-or-miss offering (our Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4 reviewers had very different feelings on its effectiveness). For me, it was more trouble than it was worth, as the sensor on the front button failed to read a majority of downward swipes. And then on the back, below the camera, there's a tiny heart rate sensora surprise if you didn't know to expect it. That's an interesting and solidly effective component, although it hardly seems worth the added expense to the handset for the average user. Speaking of the main camera: it's another great one from Samsung. While less equipped than its recent Galaxy brethren at 12 megapixels, the back shooter still takes strong shots with a great level of detail and realistic coloring. The back camera also snags 4K-quality video at 30fps, if you have a display capable of viewing it, making the Galaxy Alpha a rather powerful capture device for such a small handset. The front camera, for its part, produces fair selfies at an average 2.1 megapixels. Since this is a Samsung phone, it also has the cluttered TouchWiz skin, which is layered over Android 4.4.2 KitKat. It's functional, and I didn't notice any speed issues on this hardware, but it's less attractive than Google's base OS and it's tougher to find what you need at a glance within the option-overloaded menus. Fingers crossed that the Galaxy Alpha receives the excellent Android 5.0 Lollipop updateand that Samsung takes it easy on the TouchWiz tweaks. Pros Excellent designGreat performanceStrong camera Cons Mediocre displayTouchWiz UIOnly 32GB storage The Galaxy Alpha feels like Samsung's trial run at making a high-end device, but with compromises that keep it from being a fully premium experience. Yes, the build is excellent and the design is a big step forward from the Galaxy S5, but the underwhelming screen and storage cap are disappointing concessions.<br><br> With a full retail price of $613roughly the same as many larger, better-equipped flagship phonesit also comes off as overpriced for what you get, as if you're paying Samsung extra for finally moving away from plastic. If you shop around for a deal, however, and want a smaller Android phone with impressive power and design, the good here mostly outweighs the so-so.", "date": "Jan. 28, 2015,"}
