I'm happy to report that Naughty Dog has successfully brought PlayStation 3's single best game -- The Last of Us -- to PlayStation 4 in the form of The Last of Us: Remastered. (You can read my full review of 2013s The Last of Us on PS3 here.) Its as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and its worth your undivided attention whether youve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time. Sure, we may not have really needed a port so quickly, but then again, The Last of Us isnt just any game. As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better. The biggest change Remastered brings is its framerate. The original version of The Last of Us pushed the PlayStation 3 to its absolute limits to pull off 30 frames per second at 720p resolution, but the PlayStation 4 runs Remastered at 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution. Its a jarring change at first, but one that I began to appreciate the more I played. If you dont agree, Naughty Dog has included the option to lock the framerate to the original 30, but it was flipping back and forth that made me really begin to see the contrast. Its hard to explain how much of a difference the 30-to-60 transition makes until you see it for yourself; the PS3 original frankly looks a bit choppy by comparison. Doubling the framerate doesnt only provide an obvious aesthetic boost; it enhances gameplay, too. The most hardcore competitive shooters on consoles  like the Call of Duty series  run at or near 60 frames because it makes the shooting that much more fluid, responsive, and accurate. Youll see similar effects in The Last of Us: Remastered during gun battles, even if they are (or should be) few and far between. (Remember: this is largely, though not entirely, a stealth game.) Just gorgeous. The PlayStation 4s extra horsepower also gives a boost to The Last of Us graphical fidelity. Now, I know thats not necessarily saying a whole lot, considering The Last of Us on PS3 is already the most beautiful game Ive seen on any console. But somehow, Remastered looks just a bit better. Textures are more detailed, the lighting is enhanced, and everything pops more. The changes arent mind altering  or even game changing  but you can absolutely see the difference. From the moment I started the campaign, I couldnt help but notice improvements everywhere. Some are far more minor than others, but theyre there, and they make The Last of Us burst with even more life. You can really soak the beauty in with Remastereds new Photo Mode, which allows you to take control of the camera, alter visual settings like focus and filters, and more to grab the most gorgeous shots possible. Its not uncommon to encounter stunning sights in The Last of Us  like when you first enter environments reclaimed by nature with Joel and Tess near the beginning of the game  and now, you can capture those moments for posterity, if youd like. Another notable change from PS3 to PS4 is, as you might expect, the controller. Naughty Dog knew the weaknesses of the DualShock 3s terrible triggers, which explains why aiming and shooting was unconventionally mapped to R1 and L1. DualShock 4s far superior triggers dont suffer from a similar problem, so you can map shooting to R2 and L2 if you want, or keep it as it originally was. Still scary. Your backpack menu can be brought up with the DualShock 4s meaty center button, too. And, like Killzone: Shadow Fall, the controllers speaker can be used to play audio diaries and sound effects like the on/off click of your flashlight, though you can turn this off if you find it too obnoxious. For as great as Remastereds little tweaks and additions are, the true value proposition comes in when you start to talk about DLC. A slew of DLC that had to be purchased separately on PlayStation 3 comes bundled-in on PlayStation 4. For instance, Left Behind  The Last of Us incredible single-player prequel DLC  is included (read the original review here), as are a ton of online maps and modes that youd otherwise have to acquire separately on PS3. And yes, playing The Last of Us: Remastered online is just as awesome as it was the first time around, again aided by a silky-smooth framerate. I suspect the surprising online addiction The Last of Us provided in 2013 will be renewed for some and discovered for the first time for others. Pros Upgraded graphicsRuns at 60 FPSEnhanced gunplayPhoto modeDLC bundled in In 2013, I called The Last of Us on PlayStation 3 a masterpiece. The same holds true of its PlayStation 4 ~Remastered~ sibling. You cant go wrong with either version, but with Remastered youll get a better framerate that smooths out gunplay, a prettier, sharper look, and a bunch of DLC content rolled into the package from the get-go (not to mention a whole fresh set of Trophies to earn again, if you have a whole lot of time on your hands). Whether youve already experienced it on PlayStation 3 or have no idea what youre missing, The Last of Us: Remastered is worth your time and attention. PlayStation 3s best game just became PlayStation 4s, too.", "date": "July 28, 2014,"}
