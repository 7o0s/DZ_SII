Much like its predecessor, Darksiders II provides some solid action, albeit nestled amid a somewhat flawed experience. Its also possibly the most derivative game ever made - borrowing adventure and puzzle elements from The Legend of Zelda, action from God of War, platforming from Prince of Persia, and tone from some hellfire version of Lord of the Rings. Thats not necessarily a bad thing - an amalgamation of such incredible franchises could have resulted in the game to end all games. The thing is, if youre going to so blatantly derive material from such well-known properties, you better nail it. While Darksiders II provides a lengthy and entertaining experience for action adventure fans to sink their teeth into, in the end it never comes close to reaching the heights of the various franchises it so freely borrows from. Darksiders II further fleshes out the story of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse introduced in the first title - this time with Wars brother, Death, at the helm. Death believes that War has been wrongfully convicted of destroying mankind, and seeks to restore humanity to clear his brothers name. The narrative is pretty entertaining, if not severely overdramatic. Though it should please anyone solely in the market for epic, it lacks any trace of subtlety and often comes off as sophomoric. Given that the end result of any plot advancement is inevitably that Death needs to gather three of something and thrash some skeletons, hearing the characters go on about the old ways and soul judgement just feels a bit silly. However, if a healthy dose of ridiculous doesnt faze you, the contrived reasons for Deaths various escapades through heaven, hell and everywhere in between do provide an amusing backdrop for his quest. The majority of the adventure comprises rather standard action fare - Death wields both a fast primary weapon and a slow but powerful secondary weapon, and you chain together moves to slash your way through the various enemies. There are also a few special abilities you gain along the way - like the ability to summon demon lords to do your bidding or to split your soul in two to solve dungeon puzzles. The action segments are enjoyable enough - inasmuch as its hard to make slicing up undead baddies unenjoyable. Still, its disappointing that most of the enemies require next to no strategy to overcome. When you do come across an enemy that requires strategy to best, the joy of slaying it is truly satisfying - but these occurences are few and far between. Most of the time, the answer is just to wait for the enemy to make their move, dodge, then attack. Its still fun, because dodging and attacking are fun things to do in an action game, but it does get irritatingly repetitive after several hours of the same old song and dance. One of the touted selling points of Darksiders II is that its far bigger than its predecessor - with a map thats more than twice as big and a campaign thats about three times longer than the original adventure. Unfortunately, in this case, bigger definitely isnt better. The freedom Darksiders II offers is something to behold - youre able to journey around huge areas as you please, slashing enemies and seeking out treasure and loot drops to your hearts content. But the bloated environments are simply too barren and often devoid of anything interesting to do or see. Since so little is done to vary up the gameplay, the pacing drags and the length of the adventure feels more like a chore than a bonus. The main problem is that the bulk of the adventure is repetitive. While its completely possible to reuse game mechanics throughout a campaign and still keep it feeling fresh, Darksiders II doesnt achieve this. Youll find yourself climbing wooden ledges and pegs, setting off bombs, and rolling balls over and over again in exactly same way,instilling a gnawing sense of deja vu. If these mechanics were employed in varied and clever ways, that would be one thing - but theyre not. I found myself rarely challenged by any puzzle I came across, and was often astonished that I was once again expected to repeat the same menial task I had just completed in the previous dungeon, or even in the previous room. This is no place for a horse. On the bright side, Darksiders II does offer up some truly epic boss fights to vary up the repetition, ones that will put your skills to the test and are truly exciting to overcome. Youll fight all kinds of epic demons - ones that can regenerate, ones that are about 100 times your size, and ones that are just plain brutal in their assault patterns. The bosses are one of the highlights of the experience, offering a glimpse of what Darksiders II could have been had the entire quest been as varied and balanced as these memorable battles. As for gamers who dont like fetch quests - this game is not for you. Seriously, the entire game is a fetch quest. All you do is run from area to area, fetching three of these, then three of these, then two of these, then three more of these with combat in between. As someone who honestly doesnt mind a healthy dose of fetching in her games, Darksiders II still pushed my limits. You end up fetching so much and for so long that the majority of the game feels pretty pointless by the end. Cant anyone in these various realms do their own errands, for crying out loud? In truth, the game would have benefitted from being a skosh smaller and a lot more focused. In this way, the original game beats its sequel, as a more linear adventure that keeps the action coming befits this franchises intense style of gameplay. After all, there is a limit to how long you can run through similar environments and solve similar puzzles in order to appease your bloodlust for smashing things with cool weapons. One of the games stronger elements is its art design and voice direction. Its incredible that you can grow so fond of a main character who literally never emotes, as hes wearing a skull mask for the entirety of the adventure. Deaths awesome voicework doesn't hurt either - hearing him growl at the Makers or deliver lines like, This is no place for a Horse, or You find something for a change, is inexplicably enjoyable. Even though hes pretty impossible to relate to - being the embodiment of death and all - his design and presentation still do a great job of making him someone you want to see to his journeys end. While too many of the environments in Darksiders II are shockingly similar, some of them are well thought out and epic to behold, as are many of the characters and enemies found within. Unfortunately, the graphics arent quite up to snuff with the current generation of hardware. Some of the textures are so pixilated they look like they belong on a Wii, such as the oft-used skull and bones pattern (which is alarmingly flat, and thereby entirely unconvincing). Its a shame, as the mediocre graphics underscore the games inspired art design. The animations are also quite choppy, as the game suffers from some fairly frequent framerate issues. Theres rarely enough happening onscreen to justify these MMO-like graphics. It looks good enough that it usually wont distract from the adventure, but compared to similar games like God of War 3, the graphical presentation of Darksiders II is subpar. A frustrating detractor to Darksiders II is the sheer amount of random glitches youll encouner along the way - ones that cant be accounted for and appear and disappear for seemingly no reason at all. Seeing Death floating above the ground or over thin air is not uncommon, nor is pressing B to perform an action command only for nothing to happen until a few button presses later. Other random glitches I encounterd include the inability to discard boots, ally AI that just stands in the corner staring at the wall, a Primary Quest icon that leads you in the wrong direction (then shift positions when you check the in-menu map), and an absence of music and sound effects until the game was reset - and thats just to name a few. Most of these glitches only last for a short while, then disappear never to surface again. Others, like a targeting system that rarely seems to target the closest enemy or a camera that is often pointing in an inopportune direction, are quite persistent. Sadly, theyre things youll just have to learn to cope with if you hope to see Deaths journey to its conclusion. The funny thing is, despite its lengthy list of flaws and failures, Darksiders II still manages to offer an enjoyable experience. Despite its lack of variety, the combat is still satisfying to engage in, especially when you run across a behemoth of a boss. And even though theres not enough to do in them, running around such huge environments is still incredible. Certain abilities you amass along the way - like the Deathgrip or the summoning ability - are terribly fun to play with, and make for some really cool dungeon moments (like dashing across a wall and Deathgripping at the last moment to reach the other side). Its also worth noting that the game picks up considerably towards the end, finally finding its stride for the last few dungeons. The puzzles get more creative, the enemies and environments more varied - its just a shame it takes about 30 or so hours to get to this point. Possibly the best part of the adventure, something that all action RPG games could learn from, is its implementation of RPG elements such as equipment and customization. Weapons found on the field can be instantly equipped or sent to your inventory with a single button press. Furthermore, each piece of equipments stats are displayed when you walk near it, as well as how it will raise or lower your own stats should you equip it. This makes fast decision making a breeze, and greatly increases the joy of seeking out the best armor to equip Death with. Every weapon or bit of armor you equip also changes Deaths appearance, which is a cool touch in making character customization feel more personal. The concept of cursed artillery, which you can feed other items to, is also a great way to make the underpowered loot you come across feel like less of a waste. The way equipment is handled in Darksiders II is a true revolution in RPG gameplay, and one of the most solid parts of the experience. Tapping the left stick for Deaths bird, Dust, to show you the general direction you should go, and the deeply engrained Fast Travel system (which lets you instantly warp back to certain areas on the fly) are also great innovations for the genre. Its a true shame the games impressive contributions are so severly underscored by its sheer ammount of flaws and glitches. If youve already played Darksiders II on PS3, Xbox 360 or PC, theres really no need to pick it up again. The Wii U version is a fairly straightforward port, one that looks and runs the same as the original. Its essentially the exact same game experience, albeit with a few keys differences - differences that make this version a great value for anyone who missed the game the first time around. To start, the Wii U version includes the Arguls Tomb DLC that was sold separately with the other versions, as well as the Death Rides, Angel of Death, Shadow of Death and Deadly Despair Packs. You can play using either the Wii U GamePad or the more traditional Pro controller. Both are great options, though using the GamePad for a game like this takes some getting used to. The adjustment period is mercifully brief, though, and the GamePad is quite ergonomic and more than competent once youve adapted. Being able to access maps and menus and to equip items on the fly with the touchscreen is a cool addition, but doesnt significantly affect the overall experience. You can also shake the GamePad to dodge if you so please, though you can opt to use the roll button instead, or even disable motion controls all together. It works better than you would think, but most gamers will probably prefer to just use a button. These additions aside, Darksiders II is very much the same game. I did find it was a bit glitchy when I first tried playing exclusively on the GamePad screen. In fact, when I first tested this feature the action was successfully moved to the GamePad but I lost control of Death and had to reboot twice. Every other time it worked flawlessly, though, so this random glitch likely won't effect most players. THE VERDICT Despite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders II is simply a fun game. The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. Its a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for. Still, if you love action adventure games, its certainly worth checking out - but dont expect it to rival the masterpieces it will inevitably call to mind.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2012,"}
