Back then, the criminals were Italian, the cops were Irish, and the hooch was Canadian. Mafia: Definitive Edition is a captivating, reverent, and regularly gorgeous re-imagining of that highly-respected but not-so-gracefully aged 2002 original. Its brisk pace meant it was over for me within a weekend  and there are definitely a few mission-stalling bugs and rough edges  but its otherwise proven to be a very enjoyable way to re-experience one of my favourite games of the early 2000s. The audio is consistently top-notch, however, from the bark of a Tommy gun to the chirp and screech of skinny vintage rubber. The music is strong, too, from the original score inspired by the original to the soulful sound of Louis Armstrong piping through the radio courtesy of the fresh soundtrack. Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangster Mafia: Definitive Edition retains most of the idiosyncrasies of the original, the closest approximation of which is Classic Mode, where enemies are wilier, health kits are less effective, and even reloading your gun before its empty will forfeit any cartridges you have left in your magazine. The standard difficulty settings are less punishing and realistic, but you can still opt into some of these simulation-based gameplay modifiers, including Mafias infamous but cleverly nuanced felony system that will punish speeding and other traffic violations in a way games like GTA do not. For minor crimes you can still pull over, cop a symbolic fine  as there is no currency to collect or spend  and carry on. As a concession for gamers turned off by this traditional quirk carried over from the original, however, know that the system can be toggled to ignore minor indiscretions. Vehicle handling can also be switched between regular and simulation, though the differences between the two dont seem quite as stark as they do in Mafia III. Regular feels slightly lighter and more responsive  and its more forgiving under heavy braking, applying an ABS effect allowing you to still steer under full brakes. Simulation does not  lock up your wheels and youre going to keep spearing forwards  but its easily still my preference. Theres an excellent sense of weight to the vehicles as they struggle on their tiny tyres and I love tossing them around 90-degree corners once I have some real momentum, which admittedly can take some time in cars built before World War II. Motorcycle handling is strong, too; theyre a new addition to Mafia: Definitive Edition and Im a big fan of really backing it in on the bikes and getting that rear wheel to come loose and line up a quick corner exit. I think the driving is the best its ever been in the series, and Im also a fan of the GPS-inspired directions organically inserted into the world as road signs  they take the frustration out of navigation and allow me to just enjoy hurtling through the streets at speeds thatd rip the wax out of a moustache. In contrast, schlepping around on foot isnt quite as airtight as the action on the road. Theres a nice sense of mass and presence to Tommy himself and his transitions from a casual stroll to a desperate sprint are smoothly handled, but the third-person cover shooting is a little unremarkable, the simple melee combat is prone to some camera jankiness, and I was stalled on a few occasions by odd bugs that would require me to manually reset to the previous checkpoint. For instance, at one stage I was chasing down an enemy who became stuck on a piece of the environment, but I couldnt hit or shoot him because he hadnt reached the section of the chase where were scripted to be allowed to do so. On another, I exited an overturned car during a police pursuit and promptly fell through the map. They werent major frustrations as the checkpoint system meant only a few minutes of time were lost, but they are blemishes. Mafia: Definitive Edition places shootouts in some lovely-looking locations  from a highly-detailed art gallery to a dark, abandoned farm during a heavy storm, and from a bullet-riddled Italian restaurant to an old-timey parking garage  but it is all quite conventional. I cant say I spotted anything thatd truly distinguish it from the last 10 years of competent third-person shooters. Completely rebuilt from the ground up, Mafia: Definitive Edition features excellent performances from its new cast, a fantastic driving model, and a beautiful and authentic city oozing with 1930s atmosphere like overfilled cannoli. Its hobbled slightly by its fairly vanilla third-person combat  and it arguably wastes the potential of its entirely overhauled world by not crafting a few new ways to utilise more of it  but its still a successful rejuvenation of the best story in the series to date, and one that can now stand beside 2016s Mafia III as an equal, rather than a quaint but crusty ancestor.", "date": "Sept. 24, 2020"}
