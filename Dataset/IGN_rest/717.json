Volume asks some interesting questions about the antics of its protagonist in this simulated stealth game, and is able to back it up with a huge variety of rooms to plunder with simple-yet-challenging stealth mechanics to match. However, a few poor design choices might make you re-think the idea of pulling off these capers in the real world. Volumes premise is both novel and unique: Using a forgotten (and decidedly humorous) AI, and a tool called the Volume, Robert Locksley reconstructs virtual rooms and areas to steal from. These rooms are taken straight from the archives of a power-hungry businessman-turned-ruler: Guy Gisborne (voiced by Andy Serkis!), and his many corrupt associates. Not content to merely replicate the act of stealing from these people, Locksley essentially live-streams his exploits across the internet, giving the downtrodden an opportunity to take back whats theirs by following his literal walkthroughs. I enjoyed this odd quirky take on a futuristic live-streaming world, though the frequent references to viewers, the internets, and even a callout to Minecraft felt a little too on-the-nose. The story - told through brief conversations during levels and in emails you can find along the way - can be a bit distracting if youre busy trying to race the clock, but is worth a listen as it paints a vivid picture of futuristic Great Britain under the rule of a tyrant disguised as a simple businessman. Andy Serkis does a great albeit sparse job as a man fast losing patience with the boy you play as. I dont want to spoil any story elements, but its worth noting that Volume does a great job at never outright glorifying your overall objective without providing a counterpoint to give you pause. What follows is one hundred bite-sized levels of stealth, distraction, and misdirection. Each isometric level is crafted around you from the ground up, as shards of polygons form stylish architecture, AI guards, traps, and scenery. Creeping around to the alternately soothing and tense melodies in Volume never got old. Almost every level feels like a new idea rather than a simple copy and paste job, and they blend new techniques with previously mastered concepts well, providing fresh takes on old tactics. While on your quest of virtual pilfering, moving unseen is just as important as tricking guards to leave their patrols to look for you. Certain level elements provide breathing room, like closets and floorboards to dive into - but the sheer amount of checkpoints per level took a lot of the challenge away, especially when excluding retrying segments, the time to beat a level averaged one to two minutes, and I could run through a dangerous room to a checkpoint on the far side and respawn with no pursuers. Shadows are also a nice concept, but make you virtually unnoticeable even when shoving pursuing guards out of the way. Add these concepts to the context of the story, and I would have to question the poor fools who think dark shadows will save them from gun-toting guards. Of course not all of these guards are created equal, as the long-range Archers in particular came off as a joke with their ridiculously slow firing rate and movement speed. I found myself not even bothering to sneak past them half the time. Of course, for every misstep Volume makes, it more than makes up for it with clever use of both new and familiar stealth mechanics. Evading patrolling guards requires a keen sense of awareness - using cover to hide from their line of sight or utilizing gadgets like a silent sprint or the bugle: an item that can be bounced off walls to perform a noisy distraction while Rob crept by silently. Certain levels in particular - including a giant maze-like room with no cover to hide behind - made for some very tense subterfuge. Enemies and traps have enough variety to keep things interesting - like the Rogue with its great sense of spatial awareness and the Knights long range of vision and frightening movement speed. Many enemies synergized perfectly with defensive systems like laser alarms and creaky floors - forcing you to make some tough calls on stealth versus distraction. Even after the roughly 5-6 hour main story is finished, theres still more to be done. Levels can be replayed for the fastest time leaderboards, and Volumes level editor gives you nearly every tool you can think of - even if it doesnt really explain how they work. Pros Unique conceptLoads of levelsGreat variety Cons Inconsistent AIToo many checkpoints Rise of the Resistance is a technical marvel that delivers on its promise to fully immerse riders in the Star Wars galaxy. With its combination of cutting-edge technology, focused storytelling, and sheer scale, Rise represents an ambitious step forward for Disney, although its emphasis on creating an immersive narrative over roller coaster-style thrills may not completely satisfy the adrenaline junkies in your group.", "date": "Aug. 19, 2015,"}
