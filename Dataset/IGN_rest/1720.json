Instead of elves and dwarves, you have a giant card shop thats also a person, a decadent duke, and a scary-looking upside-down guy who only dreams of being able to rhyme  just to give a few examples. Thats the wildly creative premise of Lost in Random, a wholly original action-adventure game that thinks outside the box. Its combat wears thin, but exploring its worlds never does.You play as Even  one of two twin sisters, Even and Odd  who are fated to roll the Queens mystical six-sided dice at age 12. The resulting roll determines which of the six worlds in the kingdom of Random theyll spend the rest of their lives in. Long story short: Odd is sent off to the Queens world but Even isnt willing to let her go without a chase.The world-spanning adventure that ensues after you manage to escape the dreary starting zone of Onecroft, takes plenty of nods toward films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, Coraline, and other similarly gothic-inspired stop-motion films. Despite the entirety of Random being drenched in dark hues of black and green and gray, each world still offers completely unique and decadently layered settings.The other, equally otherworldly characters of the world react to them in weird and unexpected ways that keep you guessing.For example, Two-Towns denizens feature two directly opposite personalities that can shift each time the Queen rolls her dice. This has resulted in the construction of a separate Two-Town, called the Upside-Downtown, which completely obscures the towns skyline, kinda like that one scene out of Inception. It makes Two-Town feel that much more immense, and you can tease apart as much or as little of the zones background story as youd like through side quests, or by speaking to the many interesting NPCs hanging around town before moving on.Meanwhile, Threedom and its people are trapped in a perpetual state of war over a series of petty squabbles between the three outlandish Triplets. The other, equally otherworldly characters of the world react to them in weird and unexpected ways that keep you guessing.For instance, youre constantly told about Lost in Randoms appropriately named and visually terrifying Shadowman. You hear snippets about this terrifying monster that stalks the shadows and snatches lost children who wander too far from home, but when you finally meet him hes frustrated that the war is too distracting and no ones paying attention to him. This is just one of many ways that Random feels lived-in and richly detailed.These otherwise creepy characters are made lovable through the genius of Lost in Random's writing.And these otherwise creepy characters are made lovable through the genius of Lost in Randoms writing. Incredibly memorable characters like Mannie Dex, Seemore, Herman, Ooma, The Nanny, and so many others make moving to the next world kind of like watching the next movie in a 20-hour series of timeless holiday classics.Then theres the semi-real-time combat, which as you probably guessed from the name, leans heavily on dice rolls and cards. Its sort of like Final Fantasy 7 Remakes combat system, but its a bit simpler once you get used to these very random rules. You start each battle with your trusty slingshot, which allows you to shoot crystals off of the faces and bodies of your foes. Once youve collected enough of them, a new card is added to your hand  up to a total of five cards.The part that makes this interesting is the fact that each card in your hand is randomly pulled from your much larger deck  which lets you store up to 15 cards at a time, including duplicates if you want a few cards to show up more regularly than others  and you have no way of predicting which cards will appear when you roll your dice. Dont worry if this sounds too weird, because most of the cards you can equip in your deck include the usual mix of swords, healing potions, and bombs. The real-time part of combat kicks in when you spawn a weapon and button-mash your foes to death or until your weapon breaks.All of this cards business would shuffle Lost in Randoms real-time combat around and make it more appealing than the average button-masher if the enemys AI wasnt so easy to outsmart with such minimal effort.There are two issues here. The first issue is that youre never prompted to select a difficulty level unless you go digging into the menus after already having spent some time playing. The other issue is that, on the default difficulty mode, each foe is packed with a lot of hit points, and a single battle might still take about 20 minutes or longer  simply because of how many of them will spawn before youre finished. Regardless, each of these enemy types are pretty slow and predictable, and its easy to use any damage-dealing card to beat them down without thinking too hard.It feels great for the first few battles, especially when youre playing with interesting card combinations like Blacksmiths Blink and Crystal Curse  the former giving you the ability to deal damage when you dodge roll your way through enemies, which causes crystals to break off of them, and the latter giving you the ability to deal damage each time you break those very same crystals  but the novelty does eventually wear off. Combat encounters end up appearing a bit too often, slowing down the pacing of the otherwise excellent story and dialogue sequences that make Lost in Random truly shine. This sprawling action adventure has way more meat on its bones than you may first expect if youre only looking for a quick dive into a Tim Burton-esque wonderland. Lost in Random is loaded with tons of side quests, interesting lore, and a decent semi-real-time, semi-turn-based combat system that ends up getting bogged down by dumb enemy AI. Beyond that, the five worlds that follow the relatively drab intro section each offer their own unique quirks, struggles, and characters that wont be forgotten any time soon.", "date": "Sept. 15, 2021"}
