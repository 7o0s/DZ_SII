Yet Bandai Namcos latest attempt to capture that Kaiju magic in interactive form follows the trend set by almost every Godzilla game that has come before it: little more than some fan-pleasing movie references heaped atop a towering pile of mediocrity. The first thing most people will probably notice is that Godzilla does not look like a current-gen game. While the character models of the Kaiju themselves look respectably good - particularly fan favorites like Mothra and Destroyah, as well as the several versions of Godzilla - the destructible environments that surround them are far from impressive. The city blocks in each area look as though theyve been copied and pasted to fill space, aside from the few unique structures that mark the difference between one nondescript urban location and the next. Even in the midst of a monstrous rampage, these structures all explode and crumble in a similar fashion, breaking apart into the same standard chunks as the building before it. Even on PS3 or Xbox 360, Id have described these settings as lackluster. Godzilla also suffers from a minor identity crisis. I cant tell what it wants itself to be - a smash-and-go action game in the vein of Rampage, or a monstrous fighting game like the previous Godzilla game Destroy All Monsters. The main game mode centers around increasing Godzillas size by destroying as much as possible, specifically large power generators and other Kaiju. There isnt much else to it beyond that: blow up the generators, kill the other monsters before they kill you. Its not particularly challenging, either - the military tanks and planes were never more than a nuisance; and unless a rival Kaiju spawned at twice my current size (which rarely happens and may have been a bug), I barely saw the orange haze that appeared when Godzilla takes too much damage. After finally getting used to the unorthodox control scheme (I never thought Id have to use two separate buttons to turn left or right after the advent of thumbsticks) I found crashing through a downtown area somewhat entertaining... for a while. Keeping a combo going while on a rampage essentially boils down to using the same few attacks over and over again, and thanks to Godzillas slow speed and ponderous controls, its easy to miss a step or get stuck turning around and lose your combo. Things get especially muddy once another Kaiju enters the picture: battles quickly became a frustrating game of chance that had me spamming the same five attacks, hoping that I would land more hits than my opponent. There is a blocking move available, but even the short time it takes to charge up renders it practically useless. I can appreciate a certain amount of novelty that comes with the slow-paced controls, but Im supposed to be controlling Godzilla: King of the Monsters; I dont think its supposed to actually feel like being a sweaty teamster in a rubber monster suit. Pros Monster designsDecent fan service Cons Lackluster environmentsTedious gameplayWonky controls Apart from its massive roster of Kaiju and an encyclopedia of monsters, Godzilla's poor graphics, uncomfortable controls, and overly repetitive missions make this one of the worst renditions of the King of the Kaiju since he fought Matthew Broderick in Madison Square Garden back in 97.", "date": "July 15, 2015,"}
