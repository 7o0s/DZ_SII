Electret drivers uses a built-in charge to move the diaphragm, as compared to coils and magnets used in dynamic drivers. They are usually a bit pricey to arrange but offer superior detail and imaging, something the Theta Electret quite easily excels at. However, while Asus claims that they are cutting-edge technology, it is in fact quite old and uncommon even in the audiophile category of headsets that it wants to associate with. Electret (and its older cousin, electrostatic) drivers went out of fashion because of the costs involved, as well as the inherent need for an amplifier to reach their true potential (even though electret drivers do not need one, but you would still benefit from it). This is my first time using an electret headset, and Asus has done an incredible job putting the headset together, merging high-end sound quality with beneficial gaming features. At AED 1,100, its a costly endeavor to make, but if you have the pockets to afford it, the Theta Electret will treat you with some of the best sound you will hear from a gaming headset. Design The Theta Electret are massive  almost 1.5x the size of any gaming headset I have tried. They are even bigger than the Astro A50s, if that gives you some perspective. But despite its bulk, the headset is shockingly comfortable on the head. Its nearly half a kilogram of weight is distributed well across the device and was never uncomfortable during the many long gaming sessions that I had with them. The comfort is achieved partly due to the excellent padding on the earcups that is engineered to stay cool and reduce pressure for users who wear glasses. I would usually brush those features aside as marketing buzzwords but they are true in this case. The headset comes with both leather and fabric ear cushions, and they both offer equal comfort and heat management. The clamp force is feather-light as well and never digs into your ears despite the oversized ear pads. The headset are, however, prone to slipping off quite easily thanks to the type of material used on the head rest. It is made up of a single-piece plastic with fabric mesh padding attached to it. The fabric is smooth and will start to slip off with any sort forward or backward movement, creating a lop-sided effect every time you move. The slim head rest simply cant handle the chunky ear cups all that well, and it would had been preferable if they had used leather padding instead to add some grip. Aesthetically, the Theta Electret are quite pleasant looking. The chunkiness of the device is offset by well designed edges and cuts, giving the all-black headset some character to play off of. The ear cups are made of aluminum-alloy for durability, and while the unit does creak under duress, they feel solid in hand and could take some beating. The headset doesnt have any buttons on it  not even a volume rocker  except a mic on/off switch. The ear cups do have ventilation vents, which I am not sure are meant to dissipate heat from the drivers or are meant to make the headset semi-open back for a wider soundstage. Performance Even though the Theta Electret are only 32 Ohm headsets, they are a bit hard to drive. This means that while low-powered headphone jacks such as the ones found on the DualShock 4 or on your monitor can be used for audio, the volume will be well below what the headset can produce. So a DAC or a powerful sound card is recommend if you want to get the most out of the headset. I used the Turtle Beach Elite Pro T.A.C DAC for this review. The Theta Electrets biggest strength is its incredibly wide soundstage. This is exactly what the electret drivers bring to the table  wide and rich imaging that works way better than any virtual 7.1 surround sound solution. The first time I experienced Final Fantasy 7 Remake with these headsets, I audibly gasped at how much of the detail I was simply missing out on from other headsets. The tiny clank of Cloud replacing his sword on his back jumped our more clearly, environmental sounds had depth and distance giving me a sense of place that I never experienced before in the game. The headsets large drivers also help in creating a more immersive experience, where the sound is not just coming from the left and right side but from all around me. The benefits of a wide soundstage is most noticeable in online games like Apex Legends and Overwatch. There were a bunch of times during my escapades in Apex Legends where I would hear enemy footsteps and could pinpoint with relative accuracy where, and at what distance, the sound was coming from  whether they were already in the building I was approaching or an adjoining one. I never noticed this detail before and it certainly helped me better prepare for an incoming attack. The sound quality doesnt suffer in the pursuit of a wider soundstage, thankfully. The Theta Electret delivers a well-balanced audio profile, with nicely forwarded mids and crispy highs. The audio is slightly too raspy for my liking however, possibly due to it leaning towards overpowering the highs to produce sharper footsteps, so some hearing fatigue does set in after some time. Of course, your mileage may vary on this as I prefer a more rounded and warm sound profile. In addition to the electret drivers, Asus has also incorporated its ROG Essence neodymium bass drivers to compensate for any of the shortcomings of the main drivers. The headset handles bass reasonably well, and despite having a separate driver for it, it doesnt override the mids in any sort of way. It is, however, a bit lacking and if you are someone who prefers to feel their bass, the Theta Electret might disappoint. The lack of a punchy bass is mostly felt while listening to music as some songs simply sound a little flat. The headset comes with a removable boom mic which is Discord and Teamspeak certified. It is able to offer decent voice quality that can be used for online chat and voice calls, but they arent clear enough to be able to host any professional streaming sessions on Twitch. It is a bit strange that an electret-based gaming headset actually exists, but to Asus credit they make it work. The ROG Theta Electret are a big, bulky, expensive pair of headsets but one that delivers exceptional sound and comfort  some of the best in fact, from the many, many gaming headsets I have tried over the years. If your pocket runs deep, these headsets are definitely worth considering.", "date": "June 21, 2020,"}
