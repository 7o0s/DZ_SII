While Payback does fix a host of the 2015 Need for Speed reboots missteps, it also brushes away a lot of the stuff developer Ghost Games got right at that time. You see, Need for Speed 2015 brought with it a resurrection of the spirit of 2003 and 2004s successful Underground games and saw the return of meaningful performance and visual customisation. Between all the hokey live-action, first-person fist-bumping it also revolved around encounters with real-world automotive icons. Thats an idea I still genuinely like. Of course, it was very short, the world was largely empty, there initially wasnt any drag racing, and you couldnt even pause the game in single-player. It was flawed, no doubt. Payback remedies all that latter stuff. Theres a much longer experience here  it took me around 17 hours to complete the story alone. Plus, the world is filled with extra activities and events, drag racing is included from the get-go, and yes, you can pause it. Truly a novelty. But elsewhere? Well, unfortunately, Payback has gambled and lost. You may have heard that Payback has dialled back on the pure street racing focus in favour of a self-described action driving experience. The reality is that racing still pads out the bulk of the driving in Payback and the new action driving stuff is limited to a small handful of movie-inspired sequences and Paybacks new police pursuit system. They may look exciting on the surface, but they arent really that demanding; unlike, say, the Stuntman games, Payback doesnt require us to do any of the trickier stuff ourselves  the game takes over all the cool bits. Were just driving from cutscene to cutscene. Theyre well-executed, particularly how they seamlessly swap you between characters and vehicles (like the opening moments of Forza Horizon 3), but theyre completely scripted. Fast and frantic, but shallow and not worth replaying. Theyre really just built to service Paybacks paper-thin story, which starts with a confounding succession of betrayals and ends without ever really going anywhere interesting. Escaping police is now a totally linear exercise, where we have to follow a set path via checkpoints within a time limit.The cop chases feel largely neutered too; escaping police is now a totally linear exercise, where we have to follow a set path via checkpoints within a time limit instead of improvising and doing something unpredictable to throw them off. Taking down cop cars in these events has a welcome enough Burnout 3 flavour to it  muscling your pursuers into spectacular slow-motion collisions with poles and parked cars is fun  but I dont think it was worth losing proper pursuits for. No more darting down random side-streets at the last second to shake the fuzz, or parking in a dimly-lit area with the engine off, like Need for Speed 2015. There arent any cops around during free-roam, either; theyre only present in story missions or at certain triggers spread around the map that will initiate another linear, pre-set chase. Payback changes things up slightly in the penultimate race event, where it adds cops in the middle of an actual race, but otherwise police pursuits are basically now just time trials where the AI is trying to stop you. The cop AI seems robust enough, and theyll work on boxing you in when they have the numbers, but I didnt find them too dangerous. Theyre supernaturally fast (as usual, standard issue Crown Vics are able to go doorhandle-to-doorhandle with seven-figure supercars) but player-controlled cars are incredibly powerful battering rams, tearing through cop cars like a bad curry through a colon. The rest of Payback is wrapped up in drifting and racing  including street, off-road, and drag. The handling model is accessible, arcade fare  long, lazy drifts are possible with a dab of brake and a bootful of throttle. That said, Ive had more than a few events ruined by some overly hostile AI. The respawning is a bit aggressive, too. After clipping an obstacle or skirting with a steep slope I often found myself being respawned in the middle of the track after a few seconds, even though Id instantly recovered and was already speeding off in the right direction. It'd be almost funny if the script was equipped with a single ounce of self-awareness.The events themselves are all tied to defeating themed race crews spread over the map, each of whom introduces themselves like theyre the Most Important People on Earth. Itd be almost funny if the script was equipped with a single ounce of self-awareness, but Payback treats its cast of hip young millennials and soda commercial cast-offs like theyre the coolest thing since the other side of the pillow. Unfortunately, theyre not cool, or funny. Theyre not even actually likeable, to be honest. The three main player-controlled characters are the worst offenders, ranging from irksome to infuriating. The characters arent functionally different from each other; theyre just each tied to one or two of the five specific car classes that are different from each other. Payback splits its cars into five categories  race, off-road, drift, drag, and runner (which are used for battling cops). Cars for specific race types need to be purchased from specific dealers and cant be used in any other race type than the one they were purchased for. Its a bit restrictive, particularly considering the game doesnt always necessarily play by its own rules. For instance, it makes a fuss out of communicating that runner cars are specially-reinforced vehicles built to take on police, but then regularly throws us into cop chases in non-runner cars that seem to handle the events just as adequately. It doesnt mind tossing drag cars into impromptu sprint races, either. I wasnt a fan; my GT-R drag car corners like a whale on a skateboard. Toyota and Ferrari have fallen out of the game for reasons beyond EAs control, but the mix of tuner, muscle, and exotics has otherwise improved from the already decent selection available in Need for Speed 2015. They still look nice too, particularly the weather-beaten Derelict cars were tasked with discovering around the map (think Test Drive Unlimiteds hidden wrecks, or Forza Horizons barn finds). The way Paybacks lighting system plays off the damaged paint and rusty panels of these derelicts is excellent. Beyond the cars, however, I found Payback less visually impressive than Need for Speed 2015 overall. Paybacks dry and dusty casino city and its outskirts make for a large, varied map (and it boasts a day/night cycle this time around) but its not nearly as good-looking as the grimy, reflection-packed, rain-slick asphalt of Need for Speed 2015. The segregated car divisions, I can handle; the upgrade system, I cannot. I hate it, in fact. Individual visual customisation options now need to be unlocked by performing arbitrary tasks out in the world. I get that its designed to get us interacting with all the new Forza Horizon-inspired jumps and speed traps, et cetera, but its a lot of new hoops to jump through to change your cars appearance where previously there were none. Much, much worse is that performance customisation has been distilled into a collectible card game. Unlike Need for Speed 2015, which allowed us to bolt on specific parts to improve performance  you know, like a normal racing game  Paybacks upgrades are controlled by what the game dubs Speed Cards. Paybacks many-tentacled Speed Card system is absolutely not for me. Payback's many-tentacled Speed Card system is absolutely not for me.To make your car faster you need Speed Cards, and each vehicle your crew owns has six slots for Speed Cards (the slots ostensibly represent things like the gearbox, or the turbo, and such). You can earn a single, random Speed Card by completing a race, but at best it will only be an incremental improvement on your current Speed Card line-up. You can also buy Speed Cards for in-game cash from auto parts stores, but the cards they carry are random and rotate every 30 minutes. If you get a Speed Card you dont want, you can turn it into a single Part Token. You need three Part Tokens to have one tug at the Speed Card slot machine (stay with me), which generally yields better cards than the ones you can buy  la carte from parts stores. You can also earn Part Tokens from Base Shipments, which are loot boxes that also contain cash and additional customisation items (like coloured tyre smoke or neons). You earn Base Shipments by racking up in-game reputation points, but there are also Premium Shipments, which can be bought with Speed Points (a second in-game currency that costs real money and seems geared only to obscure how much actual money people may be dropping on Shipments). Its a cold, convoluted, and random system dredged up from the sloppy shores of the free-to-play mobile swamp. How is this a fun upgrade system? It doesnt care what parts you want or how much time you have to play the game. Any time I was awarded a worthless Speed Card I felt nothing but resentment. Surely not an emotion most developers want their games to elicit? It just turns getting your head under the hood and purchasing bespoke parts for your favourite car into a wearisome grind. I couldnt ignore this system because  with the exception of the drift and cop chase events  the AI spanked me whenever I tried to cheap out and enter certain events too far below the suggested car level. You have to acquire Speed Cards and, once youre out of Part Tokens to pump into the vile slot machine, replaying old races is the only way to slowly push your cars level up. Need for Speed Payback is a big, competent, and confident arcade racer but its really let down by its linear cop chases, its overwrought and insidious upgrade system, its dreadful dialogue, and its superficial action sequences. It feels fine and it looks flashy, but Payback really went all-in on its direct-to-DVD revenge tale and it was a bust for me.", "date": "Nov. 7, 2017,"}
