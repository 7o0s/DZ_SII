Framed by a field of far sportier competitors the shiny red station wagon looks slightly absurd. But shes a true sleeper car; from the outside she looks as if she ought to be packing nought but a cabin full of groceries and a back seat stuffed with squawking, snot-smothered kids but underneath shes meanness set to music. Shes stripped of every excess kilo, turbocharged, stiffened, lowered, and converted to all-wheel-drive. Not even the fondly remembered 850 Estates of the 94 British Touring Car Championship I built her in homage to could touch this thing. Shes not entirely unbeatable, though. In torrid conditions the best I can manage is second. But its moments like these where most of whats truly great about Forza Motorsport 6 can be observed all at once. The wet weather is like nothing Ive ever driven through in a game. The offbeat Volvo family truckster-turned-track weapon is a perfect illustration of just how charmingly far-reaching and eclectic Forza 6s garage is, and just how heavily you can modify its cars. The glorious driving dynamics. The superb sound. The unflinching frame rate. All right here. Forza 6 is the biggest, broadest, and best Forza Motorsport game to date by a massive margin. The fastest way through a corner? Take a lion through it. Bucketing rain is Forza 6s biggest bullet point and the effect itself is astounding. It wouldve been nice if the wet weather was able to arrive and break up dynamically (as it does in Forza Horizon 2) because it would add some tactical spice to the racing, but visually and physically its extremely impressive. The streaking droplets on the windscreen, which slosh under the wipers and trace left or right with cornering forces, are a big step up from Horizon 2  far closer to the likes of Driveclub  but its the 3D puddles of standing water all around the tracks that really make Forza 6s wet weather racing an unmissable experience. Hit a puddle with one side of your car at speed and its going to try to drag you off track, as that side slows from the drag of the water. Notice a small lake on the apex of your favourite corner? Take a wider line; you cant steer when youre skimming over the waters surface like the worlds least-practical wakeboard. Its not just slipperier; its like the tracks are actively trying to kill you. It makes for amazing racing, whether youre behind a fancy wheel or content with feeling the feedback though the Xbox One controllers criminally underrated haptic triggers. That this is all achieved with 24 cars on track and at an undaunted 60 frames-per-second is quite remarkable. Night racing is a similarly great-looking effect, from the pitch black Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans  so dark that in chase cam your car is barely visible behind the red glow of its taillights  to the artificially-lit Daytona, with every car throwing multiple shadows from multiple sources simultaneously. Its white-knuckle stuff, with corners suddenly emerging from the ink. Very demanding and very satisfying. Like Forza 5, however, all tracks are snapshots of a certain time of day and temperature; its all baked-in so it can get a little samey. Shame there aren't any tracks that combine both night and rain. When it comes to curating a car roster Turn 10 is the best in the business. Forza 6s garage of over 460 cars takes in everything from cult 80s and 90s performance faves to todays bleeding-edge hypercars, from 60s and 70s F1 cars to race-ready machines out of the current WTCC, V8 Supercars, and IndyCar seasons, and from unrestricted Can-Am monsters to pre-war open-wheel deathtraps. Its an incredible assortment of cars even if the game is a bit of a tease at times, mentioning things like the zany six-wheeled Tyrrell P34 during a key voiceover but not actually featuring the car. As always theyre all fully-upgradeable and primed for painting. Theyre all viewable within the games Forzavista mode too, the look and feel of which is more or less unchanged from Forza 5. Theres also been a great refresh with how you browse the cars. Scrolling left scrubs through manufacturers and individual models are listed vertically. Very welcome considering how cumbersome it was getting in Forza 5 as more and more cars were added. I heartily recommend a years subscription to the Jelly of the Month club for whoever spearheaded this tweak. Can-Am have a giant wing on this? Sure can! The handling remains fantastic, and the sense of grip and weight is even more pleasing than it was in Forza 5. Engine notes remain another big highlight, particularly with a field of 24 cars standing on the throttle waiting for the green. I also particularly like how sounds seem to bounce back off parts of the environment in tighter spaces. The two-pronged career mode does a good job of putting you in a wide variety of the many cars on offer in Forza 6. The Showcase Events, which are bespoke races designed to highlight particular vehicles, racing series, or eras, are a good addition to the game. You dont need to own the cars utilised in these races; you can just hop straight in once theyre unlocked. Theyre good to cleanse the palate between the regular career races. This is where youll find the endurance racing, which I enjoyed in Forza 4 but was absent from Forza 5. Forza 6 features enduros for LMPs, GT cars, Indy, V8s, and others. The regular career races in Forza 6 are delivered in a more linear fashion than Forza 5, which meant I couldnt hop straight into a racing series in the cars I wanted to race most even though I could afford one (returning players are well rewarded, depending on time spent in previous Forza games). I think the biggest sin here though is the dated top-3-or-bust progression system. It simply means your race objective never wavers; start in the middle of the grid, pass seven-or-so cars, finish on the podium. If you dont, you need to start the race again  you cant simply make up points later. I found myself yearning for a bit of a revamp here, perhaps inspired by the more nuanced Grid and Project CARS approach to race weekends. The new Mod system (gameplay modifiers you can apply to single-player to earn bonus credits and XP by achieving certain objectives or enduring specific handicaps) adds some zest to the career but I will admit I often found myself forgetting about it, even though some of them give you increased car performance. Dont worry about this Mod system giving anybody an unfair advantage in multiplayer, though; they dont apply there. Forza 6s online multiplayer has performed well during testing; even during heavy rain and playing against opponents from far across the Pacific the racing was smooth and lag-free. Equally good news? Those of you who prefer couch multiplayer are still covered; unlike most developers Turn 10 hasnt forgotten split-screen. Pros Incredibly varied car rosterWet weather is impressiveRock-solid racingReturning players are well rewarded Cons Baked-in track conditions Like a big bucket of Hot Wheels brought to life, Forza Motorsport 6 is first-order car porn for the automobile obsessed but remains an accessible and exciting racer for those who just want to drive fast in something red with a horse logo on it. Its spinning its wheels in a few areas but whats here is undoubtedly some of the finest racing you can find on console and easily worth the upgrade from Forza 5.", "date": "Sept. 8, 2015,"}
