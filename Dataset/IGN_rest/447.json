Its less interested in telling a cohesive story than it is in throwing elaborate, well-designed platform challenges and combat scenarios at you. Its an old-style approach thats executed so soundly I wanted to ignore its technical and structural failings, but ultimately they do take some of the wind out of an experience that could have otherwise been great. ReCore starts out strong, building its gameplay suite piece by solid piece. Combat, traversal, and exploration are all handled well individually and balanced nicely against one another so I never felt overloaded or underserved by any one part of it. Of the three, combat stands out just a bit more because of a skillful mix of decision-making and reflex-testing that feels demanding but never overwhelming. On the surface, color-coding ammo types to the color of enemy theyre strongest against seems almost insultingly simplistic, but it ends up being just one piece of a much larger, more interesting puzzle. Finding the Rhythm Color aside, each of the five customizable robotic frames for your AI-controlled sidekicks are particularly strong or weak against certain types of foes (such as wolves or tanks) regardless of their color. Knowing this, you might switch to your yellow bot despite facing a blue enemy because youll still have the type advantage. Further, recognizing situations where you can exploit both type and color advantages can allow you to fell even the most leathery tough adversaries in seconds. It's a challenging balancing act that made me feel genuinely powerful. Combat is full of little nuances like this. You can, for instance, build combo streaks by hacking away notched segments of an enemy's life bar. Higher combos mean bigger damage per shot, so you learn to see small, easy-to-kill enemies or ones with highly segmented health bars as walking power-ups to be ~collected~ before turning to the heftier ones to make optimal use of your increased damage. Over time you get a sense of how different enemies telegraph their moves, which ones are easy to dodge, and which ones youll need to interrupt with a charged shot from your rifle instead. Youre thinking about all of this while ninja-ing your way through salvos of bullets, missiles, and laser beams; its a challenging balancing act that made me feel genuinely powerful whenever I managed it. Despite the surprising number of moving parts that come together in battle, ReCore achieves this arcade-style rhythm where each individual element is easy enough to get a grasp on that eventually the commands just come to you in the moment, like suddenly speaking a language instead of just repeating the words you know. I enjoyed leaping before looking, confident that I'd find sure footing. This delightful sense of instinctive mastery is just as often elicited by ReCores elaborately constructed jumping puzzles, and unlike many 3D action games that try to incorporate platforming elements, its handled here with a rare grace. Jumps have just enough hang time to give you a moment to mentally visualize where youll land without feeling sluggish or floaty, and ledges and moving platforms are placed just so, never requiring more precision than the responsive controls feasibly allow. This builds a high level of trust: I came to believe in the platforming design so completely that I enjoyed leaping before looking, confident that if I made the most of my chained double-jumps and dashes (and the occasional robot-assisted glide) Id find sure footing somewhere or other. In the heyday of platformers this sensation was common, but few modern games have conjured it forth the way ReCore does. This is a fortunate thing too, because developers Comcept and Armature have a way of throwing the entire kitchen sink at you all at once. I cackled at some of the more sadistic-looking arrays of timed barriers, laser beams, and moving platforms all dancing with one another over a bottomless pit of instant death. One late-game section has you jumping between tiny moving platforms that appear for only seconds at a time before evaporating, raising my stress levels as only a 3D recreation of an old Mega Man gimmick possibly could. Both in the larger sandbox areas and in the traversal-focused side-dungeons, these intricately designed platform tangles are an intimidating sight, which made it feel all the more sublime when I tore through them with little thought, having been taught so well by the smoothly escalating challenges that preceded them. The evocative art style helped maintain a sense of mystery and wonder. Exploring ReCores beautiful world is almost equally gratifying, though down the stretch of the campaign youre asked to do so just a bit too often. Its rolling, barren dunes are starkly contrasted with massive industrial structures that look and feel alien, despite being man-made. Monstrous terraforming constructs loom constantly in the background, creating a believable sense of scale that, at times, made me feel pleasingly insignificant. This evocative art style helped maintain a sense of mystery and wonder, despite how summarily barren and incomplete most of ReCores world feels. This is by design, according to the lore, though that doesnt entirely excuse it. While there is a certain minimalistic beauty to Far Eden (where ReCore takes place), the magic began to wear thin as I hit the last third of my adventure. Especially towards the end, your forward progress is constantly impeded by the need to stop what youre doing and head back out into the overworld to complete side-missions in order to earn Prismatic Orbs, which serve as keys of sorts. This makes many of the side activities essentially mandatory, and because theyre scattered throughout ReCores appreciably large play areas theres a significant amount of travel time involved to reach them. Whats more, obtaining these orbs often requires a specific bot that isnt telegraphed to you ahead of time, and you can only have two with you at any given time. There were plenty of times Id trek long and hard to find a tough-to-reach area only to find out I needed a different bot to reap the rewards. The only solution is to head to the nearest waypoint, switch out my bot, and make the journey a second time. Along with the long load times these inconveniences break up the pace a lot, padding out what should have been an eight or 10-hour game into something more like 15 hours. Right when ReCore should be crescendoing towards its conclusion, its pace suddenly sputters instead. Its Wind Waker syndrome all over again. It doesnt undo the fun of actually playing it, but these issues keep ReCore from being all that it can be. It doesnt help that ReCore is also dogged by some technical rough edges. Perhaps its biggest issue, at least on console, is its shoddy overall performance. While a mid or even lower range PC can handle ReCore just fine even at max settings, the Xbox One version rarely if ever manages to make it to 30 fps. It never interfered with my ability to play in any significant manner, but it definitely degrades the visual joy of exploring Far Eden a bit. I didnt expect ReCore to be quite as big as it is, and from the looks of things, its possible its developers didnt either. Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within. It feels like a great, arcadey action platformer spread across too big a canvas, and it asks you to draw back over the same lines a few too many times", "date": "Sept. 13, 2016"}
