Director Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Chef) takes on Rudyard Kipling's classic story by sticking close to the essentials and adding in a sense of scope and wonder. Watching the film in 3D, it was easy to be immersed in its world. As impressive as the scale of the movie is, there's also plenty to win over younger viewers being introduced to the story for the first time, from a truly adorable runt-of-the-pack wolf pup to new versions of beloved The Jungle Book songs. The movie wouldn't work without its star (and only non-CGI actor) Neel Sethi. The New York native was only 10 when The Jungle Book was in production, and he perfectly embodies the role. Sethi has the slightly awkward swagger of a young child who feels more ready for the world than he is, filled with confidence as he's challenging massive bears or facing down a dangerous tiger. The Jungle Book is Mowgli's coming-of-age story, and Sethi earns his character's evolution as he faces several humbling experiences and learns what his wolf pack's mantra (or as Baloo would say, propaganda) really means. The film borrows its most direct inspiration from Disney's 1967 animated version of The Jungle Book, but changes some key plot moments that alter the impact of Mowgli's journey in big ways. Given the range of Sethi's performance, it's impressive to realize that he often acted against nothing, as The Jungle Book was filmed largely on a green screen. Sethi fully lives Mowgli's joy and his sorrow as he's interacting with the jungle world, selling the fact that he lives in this land of make believe. But as much as The Jungle Book wouldn't work without a great Mowgli, it also wouldn't work without animal characters that feel as real as the movie's star man cub. The fantastic CGI used to create key characters like Bagheera the panther (Ben Kingsley), Baloo the bear (Bill Murray), Akela the wolf (Lupita Nyong'o), Shere Khan (Idris Elba) and King Louie the orangutan (Christopher Walken) was only half the battle. It was clear from The Jungle Book's trailers that all of these computer-generated creatures looked spectacularly real, but their striking visual effects would mean nothing if they weren't developed into full characters. Fortunately Justin Marks' screenplay brings real depth to the important creatures in Mowgli's life, turning them into fully-developed characters with their own motivations and desires. Nyong'o's Akela is the most affecting of the bunch, while Murray's Baloo brings the expected amount of humor and levity to the story and Elba's Shere Khan -- whose backstory is fleshed out to give his hatred of humans more depth -- makes a terrifying villain. There is a certain amount of darkness in The Jungle Book -- which led to some young children in our theater crying out in fear -- but overall this movie is an earnest event full of joy and wonder. Diving into the rich, timeless source material of Kipling's stories, Favreau was able to take the core of the tale and translate it into a modern audience without needing to diminish any of its strengths. This is an adventure story for children at its core, though some of the movie's exploration of loss and violence, and Mowgli's final decision, might need further explanation for a younger viewer. The Jungle Book is a wonder for both children and adults, and there's plenty of emotional resonance for all audiences. There are many lessons to be gleaned from the movie, like having respect for the power of nature and other people in your society, and not trying to constrict someone from being what that are because of what society thinks they should be. Instead of playing for laughs, Favreau seeks to humble the audience by putting into perspective each person's place in the world -- and what happens when you try to prevent someone from being their true selves -- both of which are worthwhile messages for anyone to hear. Pros Visual effectsNeel SethiEmotional resonance Cons Darkness might be too much for young audiences With impressive visual effects, a strong leading actor and well-drawn characters, Disney's return to The Jungle Book is a fantastic adventure film with strong messages that's good for audiences young and old. There is some darkness to the movie that might be too much for some younger viewers, but for adults who loved the animated movie growing up, Favreau's take on the story amplifies the 1967 animated film's strengths while also adding new depth and emotional resonance to what was already a strong story.", "date": "April 14, 2016"}
