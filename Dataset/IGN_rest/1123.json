I neither follow the CSI TV Show nor do I care for hidden-objects games. Yet somehow I found myself enjoying CSI: Hidden Crimes, thanks to its great presentation and addictive gameplay. Unfortunately though, it also employs one of the worst F2P systems I have ever encountered in a game, one that often ended my game sessions prematurely, leaving me with a sense of frustration rather than joy and accomplishment. The game really knows how the set the correct mood, and its art style, design and presentation recreate the CSI atmosphere rather well and makes you feel like a member of the CSI team. Also, if you like cheesy puns, this game is chock full of them. CSI: Hidden Crimes falls within the hidden objects genre. The game puts you in various crime scenes and gives you a list of items you need to find in the scene. Your job is pick up the six to nine items hidden among the dozens of items scattered around the crime scene. I didnt think I would enjoy games that require attention to detail (never enjoyed the spot the difference type games), yet looking for the required items within the crime scene was strangely addictive, and I cherished the ,link sound I heard whenever I picked up one of the required items. Of the six items you need to pick up, one or two would be actual evidence, and the rest would be arbitrary fillers, which was something that occasionally ruined the investigation illusion - I often wondered why I need to spot the moon in a crime scene taking place inside an apartment. Analyzing the aforementioned items leads you to new crime scenes and criminal suspects. The evidence also helps you build a profile for the killer, and questioning suspects allows to find out how well they fit the killers profile. While some suspects fit the profile more than others, the game never explicitly pinpoints the murderer, and I liked how you need to rely on the interrogations to make a final and informed decision on who to arrest. The game uses two primary resources for your play - stars and energy. You need energy to play the crime scenes and find the hidden objects, and through playing the crime scenes you acquire stars. Stars are the resource that everything hinges on - you need stars to unlock new scenes, interrogate suspects, analyze evidence, and move on to new episodes. Any progress hinges on you having stars. Stars are quite difficult to acquire, and thus you need to visit crime scenes numerous times to acquire a star; the faster you find all the hidden items, the faster you complete a star. Therefore, I had to play the same crime scene over and over again to get the stars required to move on with the mission. That might sound like a drab, but it was surprisingly a fun process. The more you revisit a crime scene, the more familiar you are with it, and the faster you find items the higher your score will be, and the more stars youll get. The game also presents you with a neat challenge curve when you revisit a crime scene, asking you to find items youve found before, and then slowly introducing smaller and more obscure items. Crime scenes did have an arcade feel to them, where you work against the clock and tap vigorously at all the items youre finding until one finally stumps you. However, it is this resource system that is the games biggest flaw. I already said that stars are quite difficult to get, which means that youll have to play the same crime scene many times over to get a star. This wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for how scarce energy is, and without energy, you cant play the crime scenes. So how do you get energy? Well, you have three options - wait, beg your friends over social media, or pay up. Energy slowly builds up over time, and for you to play one scene, you need a 1 hour wait to accumulate enough energy, but playing a scene once is hardly enough to get a star. Hell, sometimes I wait till my energy bar is completely full, burn it all playing a scene 5 times (which adds up to around 5 minutes of play), and still fall short of one star. When you finally get a star, you can interrogate a suspect who leads you to a new scene. But wait, you need a star to unlock that scene. So Ill go back to previous crime scenes, but oh wait, Im out of energy, and theres nothing I can do to refill my energy but wait (or pay up). And now, the stars are even harder to get, leading to more wait times lasting a few hours between each 3 minute gameplay session. Sometimes it would literally take me a whole day just to unlock a new scene, and waiting till the next day to have enough energy to play it. And if I pay? For $2 I can play a crime scene twice, and more often than not that is hardly enough to advance through anything. This means I just paid 2 dollars for a 2 minute gameplay session that didnt result in any progress. To the games credit, you do get some free resources through daily prizes, level ups, and the like. But the resources you get are never enough, and you can easily burn through all the freebies you get just to interrogate one suspect. Pros Great CSI presentationStrangely addictive gameplayActually care about who the killer is Cons Absolutely terrible F2P systemExtremely short play sessions. Instead of offering you extra gameplay options through microtransactions, CSI: Hidden Crimes actively punishes you for not paying, introducing arbitrary obstacles and waiting times that are entirely designed around getting you to pay a few extra dollars, even though paying will get you very little value anyways. With that said, the game is quite well designed, both aesthetically and mechanically. Despite its F2P issues, it can still be absorbing enough to get you come back to it every now and then, especially if youre looking for a game that only requires minute-long bursts of gameplay.", "date": "May 1, 2014, 1"}
