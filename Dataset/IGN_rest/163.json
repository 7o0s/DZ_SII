My first playthrough was exhaustingly difficult. I dont mind a challenge, but I also dont want to feel like Im banging my head against a wall for 10 hours, unsure of what Im doing wrong. However, retreading the 14 levels of cyberpunk brutality as the fully powered-up version of my twin-stick killer finally let me enjoy the frantic, stylish combat. Revenge stories tend to be pretty straightforward, and Ruiners is no exception. Youre a man with VCR text for a face, being told by a mysterious woman in your head that you have to kill a bunch of people who kidnapped your brother. Its pulling from common cyberpunk material like Blade Runner, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Escape from New York to tell a bloody tale full of technological horror, and it mixes in some pretty cool, disturbing characters. Menacing techno with industrial beats suit the violent, dirty world of Ruiner well. (Look for the soundtrack to be featured on your favorite Tumblr synthwave blog.) The flow of gameplay is similarly straightforward: Walk down a corridor, get locked in a room of death, fight off several waves of enemies, die a bunch, eventually survive, and walk down the next corridor to the next room of death. Ruiner has more variables to it than something elegantly simple like Enter the Gungeon or Geometry Wars, but it starts you with a simple machine gun and a bat, and youll have to die many, many times before you earn the fun stuff and learn how to make use of it. Eventually, gadgets like time manipulators, defensive barriers, explosives, mind control, and more provide a nice variety of ways to kill and not be killed. Too often, I didn't know why I was dying.On the other hand, there isnt much variety to the stages, which all look like the factory from the end of Terminator 2. (I love Terminator 2, but 10 hours of this same setting is a bit much.) Youre constantly overwhelmed, barely able to keep up with all the enemies and bullets swirling around you  which is exactly what you want in this style of game, except that Ruiner doesnt do a great job of communicating which enemies are actively killing you. Too often, I didnt know why I was dying, or even if I was taking damage. Many of the boss battles were memorable because they were more than just swarms of foot soldiers, but finally defeating one wouldnt give me a feeling of, That was awesome, I cant wait to play more! as much as, Im glad thats over. Time for a break. At least when you die you can restart right from that encounter instead of being sent back to an earlier part of the level. Ruiner revels in this difficulty, taunting you at the game over screen, guessing you probably dont have anything better to do than die over and over in a video game. Quite often, upon your death, your puppeteer will say, That was painful to watch. Yeah, it was painful to play, too. Under tough but fair circumstances this kind of taunting would egg me on to do better next time, but when some deaths didnt feel avoidable it seemed like Ruiner was gloating over having wasted my time. It forces you out of your comfort zone to deal with a new threat.Another good idea that doesnt quite pay off is that Ruiner throws a lot of different enemy types at you and expects you to regularly respec your skill tree to cope with them (which you can do for free at any time, Diablo 3-style). You may have gotten used to using your Kinetic Barrier to lay down a stationary field that blocks projectiles, but here comes a boss that charges at you with melee weapons, rendering your barrier useless, so you need to pull points from it and pump them into your mobile energy shield instead. While I like the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild-style design philosophy of forcing you to improvise and get out of your comfort zone to deal with a new threat, making you repeatedly pause the action to redistribute skill points isnt the most elegant solution. Between the action scenes theres an interesting but underdeveloped hub world where you stroll through your typical dystopian slum full of sleazy characters and dark alleys. Ruiner thinks it has sidequests, but upon closer inspection, theres hardly anything to do or find that isnt in the main missions. Another missed opportunity is the dialogue options, which dont seem to have any effect on conversations or the outcome of the story. That said, you are rewarded with extra XP, weapons, and health for exploring every nook and cranny of the levels. Even though the exploration is light, I appreciate it as a way to break up all the combat. And as I said, things are better now that Ive beaten Ruiner. I feel like a god blasting through the early levels, and the woman in my head who once taunted me now cant stop telling me how awesome I am (youre graded on every encounter). Its too bad there isnt a New Game Plus option, but you can revisit any level youve already completed to exact your revenge and continue earning XP. Fighting my way through Ruiner felt like work, and if I werent obligated to finish it for the review I probably wouldnt have bothered. Its too bad it focuses on being difficult over being fun, because the combat totally works when youre given access to the full range of weaponry and gadgets and can finally stand up to the nearly endless waves of varied enemies thrown at you. This one is definitely better the second time around. Games should be fun right from when you hit the start button  thats kind of the whole point  but Ruiner puts you through too much of a hazing ritual to get there.", "date": "Sept. 27, 2017"}
