Its Roccats newest and least expensive gaming mouse as well as the companys take on the traditional three-button mouse. It has a fairly low DPI ceiling at just 2,000 DPI maximum, making it an odd entry in the budget-friendly mouse market. Roccat Lua - Design & Features The Roccat Lua is low and long. Palm grippers will bemoan its lack of a rounded hump at the back, but those that employ a claw or fingertip grip will like its trim dimensions and small size. Its certainly easy to flick and swipe. Its really a low-rider among gaming mice, measuring just 1.25-inches tall. Like most gaming mice, the Roccat Lua features a backlit logo. Unlike most gaming mice, however, you dont have a choice of colors. If you buy the Lua, you better like the color blue. Unlike the Corsair Harpoon RGB and Razer Abyssus V2, the Roccat Lua lacks rubberized, textured side grips to help prevent your hand from slipping around on the mouse. The Lua features plastic sides with just a hint of texture. The sides flair out a bit toward the back, providing an ergonomic fit for your thumb on one side, and fingers on the other. My hand didnt slip from the Roccat Lua during testing but I felt that I had a firmer grip with both the Corsair Harpoon RGB and the Razer Abyssus V2. The top surfaces have a soft-touch coating that adds a bit of luxury to the proceedings and help mask its budget status. The Roccat Lua bills itself as a three-button mouse, and though thats true in the traditional sense, I count four buttons: right-and-left-mouse buttons, a clickable scroll wheel, and DPI settings button. The right-and-left mouse buttons are not customizable, leaving only the scroll wheel and DPI settings button to be reprogrammed. You can reprogram the click, scroll up, and scroll down of the scroll wheel, which gives you a couple of options. The mouse lacks side buttons, which are extremely common on pretty much all gaming mice these days, so that's kind of an odd omission. Roccat Lua - Software The Roccat Lua is plug and play, but the Roccat Lua software gives you a few extra options and settings to tweak. The software, however, is more limited than what you get with competing budget mice. On the main control page, you can select how many DPI settings that you want active on the mouse. You can keep between one and six settings active, which is more than usual, but you cant tweak the actual settings for any of them. Unlike other budget gaming mice, the DPI settings are fixed out of the box and non-adjustable. There are seven DPI settings you can cycle through: 250, 500, 1,000, 1,250, 1,500, 1,750, and 2,000 DPI. Unlike with other budget gaming mice, there isnt a way to reprogram a button to act as a DPI switcher for, say, a super-low DPI setting for sniping. With the Roccat Lua, youll need to use the DPI switcher button to cycle through your DPI settings until you get to 250 DPI, and those multiple clicks could cost you a kill shot. The Lua software also lacks the ability to set up profiles for different games, and the mouse lacks onboard memory, which would let LAN-party gamers take those profiles with them. The software does let you adjust the Roccat Luas polling rate. (A higher polling rate means the mouse reports its position to the PC more frequently, making the mouse feel more responsive.) The default polling rate is 1,000Hz but you can lower it to 500Hz, 250Hz or 125Hz. Personally, I couldnt tell the difference between 125Hz and 1,000Hz, but if you have a polling rate preference, then youve got options with the Lua. The rest of the mouse settings are simply the basic mouse options youll find with Windows: pointer speed, double-click speed, and vertical scroll speed. Like the rest of the options, your lighting choices are limited. You have a Hobsons Choice of blue. An RGB mouse, the Lua is not. The only lighting settings available for the Lua is to have the blue logo always on, off, or pulsing via a breathing effect. Roccat Lua - Gaming The Roccat Lua is a tiny mouse best used with tiny displays, say around 24 inches. To test the Lua I played Battlefield and Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a 27-inch, 1440p display. The mouse felt accurate, but I wish I could have raised the DPI level past its 2,000 DPI max. With a higher DPI setting of around 4,000 DPI, I can move from one side of my 27-inch display to the other with a single, short swipe. At 2,000 DPI, I needed two short swipes or a long swipe -- a longer swipe than feels natural. The 2,000-DPI will suffice for laptop gamers and even desktop gamers with displays smaller than 27 inches, but those with larger displays will want a mouse with a higher DPI max. More than the DPI limit, the mouses small size will be the determining factor on whether you like it or not. Its narrow with a rather flat shape and doesnt look or feel like most mice. Its not for palm grip gamers unless you have really tiny hands. Claw and fingertip grippers, however, should enjoy its tiny size for its maneuverability. The Roccat Lua offers few customization options and a limited DPI range. Overall, there are better mice for your gaming dollars.", "date": "June 21, 2018,"}
