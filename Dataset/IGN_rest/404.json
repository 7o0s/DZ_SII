As I trudged through its twisted, nightmarish world, though, that fear soon gave way to unintimidating stealth gameplay and sudden bouts of nausea. It has some solidly spooky concepts to work with, but Here They Lie tries too hard and overstays its welcome as a result. Theres something truly terrifying about not having any idea where you are or what youre doing there and not even being able to trust your own eyes. In Here They Lie, part of the horror comes from not knowing if the world is messed up, or if its just you. The starting area was the scariest for me because everything was so mysterious  as I moved through a train, shadowy figures appeared before me and then vanished. Showing the threat but not actually sending anything my way as I wandered (with smooth movement using the gamepad) through an unfamiliar, labyrinthine subway station was enough to make me tense up quite a bit. It was a pretty good start that kept me on my toes  I never knew if I was imagining it or if there really was death just over my shoulder. Playing with the PlayStation VR added to that tension, at least for a while. I felt like I needed to check over my shoulder constantly for someone or something behind me, and the fact that I was looking around with my actual head made that unsettling feeling more intense. Once I exited the station and started walking through a dilapidated city, that feeling slowly started to dissipate and returned only sporadically. With the introduction of the city, Here They Lie also revealed its first enemies, and thats when it started to slip. Instead of simply walking through a haunting urban landscape, I had to stealthily slip past grotesque monsters (since theres no combat). While their growls and cries are appropriately inhuman, that alone isnt enough to make them scary  for most of Here They Lie, theyre just an obstacle to sneak past, rather than a predatory threat. Death isnt at all punishing and actually put me ahead of where Id been in a few cases. Monsters dont even react to the telltale beam of your flashlight. Theyre little more than props for kids haunted house-style jump scares (like when skeletons fall toward you in a carnival ride). For a moment, Here They Lie starts to break away from its predictable horror formula and becomes really surreal. Hallways bend  which is not at all fun in VR  and it loses its grip on reality even more. But it tries really hard to be edgy and creepy, so much so that its off-putting. Grunting people with animal masks over their heads gyrate to techno in a red building in one scene, and the hidden notes I found in the area discussed an unnamed womans kinks. It feels like Here They Lie is working far too hard to be provocative and trippy horror but doesnt know what its trying to say or even what its talking about, like a kid swearing for the first time. It continues on like that for way too long, spacing out the parts that are legitimately unsettling and leaving stretches of boredom between them. I did lose some sense of how long I was playing (probably four or so hours total), though, since certain cutscenes camera movements were horribly nauseating, forcing me to take frequent breaks. That, combined with pointless Dali-esque surrealism, made playing feel like a chore. Though it has a few unsettling, adrenaline-pumping moments, Here They Lie fails to deliver believable psychological horror. It definitely tries  its filled with the requisite creepy, gargling monster sounds and reality-bending that can contribute tension to scares  but it doesnt blend its horror elements well enough to be consistently terrifying. Relying so heavily on overwrought surrealism and a few haunted house-style jumps to create tension rather than fostering any true discomfort (besides nausea) leaves it feeling flat.", "date": "Oct. 13, 2016,"}
