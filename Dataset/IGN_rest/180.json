Instead, this years effort builds on the superb foundation of the previous game, consolidating its gains and focusing on further satisfying its core audience. Simply, if you liked PES 2017 youre going to find plenty to adore here in regards to the extra depth and variety added to the on-pitch action, plus a number of small tweaks made to the likes of Master League mode. But if youre thinking of switching from FIFA, take note - no concession has been made to try and appease those who are not already fans of the formula PES employs. In a way not overly dissimilar to a fighting game sequel, PES 2018 feels like an exercise in not wanting to undermine or distort the sublime balance the previous incarnation managed to achieve. As such, theres a certain familiarity to the bulk of the headline features. Real Touch+ is an elaboration of PES 2017s Real Touch feature, which improved a players first touch and provided them better awareness in positioning themselves to shield the balls from opponents and bringing it under control. With Real Touch+, the core concept remains but now the whole body is brought into play. Players use thighs, shoulders, stomach, chest and the entire foot  front, side and back  to control the ball, and the result is imperfect passes have a better chance of finding their target, as players have more ways to interact with passes coming towards them. If you liked PES 2017 you're going to find plenty to adore here.This diversity of interaction adds a palpable sense of visual drama to matches and goes a long way to making things look closer to what youd expect to see on TV. It also ups the spectacle, and passing combinations such knocks and flicks, with body parts other than a foot, are flattering for even a beginner. Naturally, players with the highest ball control rating  Lionel Messi, Luka Modric, Neymar Jr  benefit most, but its influence is apparent throughout the game at every level. Playing as Real Madrid - dubbed MD White this year, thanks to the ongoing licensing war with FIFA - I was trying to intercept a pass using Casemiro (ball control 78) when he nudged the ball with his heel to knock it away from an onrushing Antoine Griezmann. It might not sound like much on paper, but the effect in the heat of the game is genuinely exciting to see. This greater ability to bring the ball under control feeds into improvements to how players move both their body and the ball when dribbling, especially at lower speeds. Players visibly shift their weight to change direction more suddenly and tempt defenders into making a wrong move, while a range of feints and delicate touches help make space for a shot in crowded penalty areas. Again, the better the player, the more impact these kinds of dribbling options have, but the real skill rests in how creative you are in stringing together the available moves. Goalkeepers improved a lot last year, but their effectiveness has taken a step backward this season. Their dives are often spectacular and when they make a great save its impossible to not be impressed. Too often though, they make poor decisions and fumble weak shots. Timid strikes from long range are fumbled too frequently, especially when the keeper has a clean line of sight and plenty of time to position himself. They also have a tendency to spill seemingly simple saves back out towards the penalty spot, leaving for an easy tap in. Thankfully keepers performances dont ruin games, but sometimes their actions are awkward enough that youre left cursing their performance and impact on the final result. Off the pitch, menu screens remain as ugly as youll find in any game. Boorish grey blocks filled with plain black text do little to promote the excitement and allure of the worlds richest and most popular sport, which is a shame as some of the content hidden within these menus represent an upgrade on PES 2017. Random Selection Match is arguably the star of the new game modes over last year, giving you the option of playing with a team made of up of randomly assigned players, based on set parameters determined before the match. You can set up to three categories from which your team will be chosen: teams, leagues and nationality. For instance, if you want to give yourself the best chance of using a team of superstars then you might want to limit your random players to being selected only from Real Madrid and Barcelona. Certainly, youre going to have a better team from that combination then youre going to if you allow the game to select from all players in the French, English, Spanish and Italian second divisions. Once your players have been assigned to you there exists the option to trade personnel with your opponent, turning Random Selection into a draft mode of sorts. This can get particularly interesting if youre lacking in a certain key position - such as striker, for example. Its a great mode to use when playing with a group of friends well-versed in the game - the random element forces you to both experiment with new ideas and be prepared to adapt to players youve never seen or used before. Random Selection Match is arguably the star of the new game modes over last year.Depending on their performance in real-life, players receive live stat updates inline with their form. This adds further interest to Random Selection, and other exhibition game modes, in that a player you previously discarded might have a blinding week for their club and is now forcing themselves into consideration for your PES team. Keep an eye on those stat changes before making any final lineup and formation decisions. The new addition of Online Co-op is also worth spending serious time mastering, with teams of three players facing off against one another. Its here that the tactical side of PES 2018 shines, with quality sets of partners able to simultaneously park the bus with their defence and overload in attack. The AI on offer by default is intelligent enough to keep you entertained, but its no replacement for practised, experienced human players and online co-op is apt demonstration of that. Elsewhere, multiplayer modes include the returning Online Divisions; a competition in which you face off against other real players in short seasons, with you being relegated or promoted depending on your match results. Invariably, the more often youre promoted the better your opponents become. If youre looking to test yourself against the most serious of PES player then the ultra competitive PES League is for you, whilst casual fans should stick to standard versus matches. MyClub straddles both online and offline arenas. The idea - much like FIFA Ultimate Team - is to acquire new players and build the squad of your dreams. Very little has changed over last seasons offering, although a tutorialised introduction makes it easier for newcomers to understand more quickly. As ever, it remains a mode that only satisfies if youve got hours upon hours to dedicate to it. Timid strikes from long range are fumbled too frequently, especially when the keeper has a clean line of sight.Master League remains the showpiece offline mode, with a new option to increase the difficulty of managing your clubs off-the-field dealings revealing itself a welcome addition. Choose the Challenge difficulty setting when starting a new game and fresh faces become hard to sign, your current squad is more likely to want to leave if things go wrong and, ultimately, keeping your job is less straightforward. Challenge mode is hardly akin to a Football Manager experience, but it does force you to think about the makeup of your squad over the longer term and that influences your overall approach accordingly. Elsewhere the usual selection of individual cup and league competitions are available for you to win and lose, as is Become A Legend, in which you control a single player and try to make it to the top and achieve glory. Unfortunately, Become A Legend is as stale as its always been and limiting yourself to controlling a single player when so many of the game's improvements focus on linking a team together seems counterproductive. Considering the existence of FIFA 17s imperfect-but-interesting The Journey single-player mode  and its follow-up in FIFA 18  its difficult to see Become A Legend anything other than entirely redundant as a serious option for enjoying modern football games. There are also a few minor issues with server quality in online matches, predominantly when going through the matchmaking process. It can take some time to find an opponent, an issue that is made worse if playing in co-op and seeking multiple players to join your match. Matches themselves have been more stable than previous PES releases on launch, with only a small percentage of fixtures affected by lag. Hopefully any and all issues will be ironed out as Konami reacts to server load. PES 2018 is not without its faults then, but many are easy to forgive because it does a wonderful job of consolidating and evolving on the fantastic groundwork laid by its predecessor. The improvements may not make headlines, but they do make for one of the most complete and satisfying football games. True, its a game that benefits from serious time being dedicated to it, in order to learn all of its possibilities. As such, its not easy to recommend PES 2018 to the casual football game fan. But for those serious about diving in and soaking up all there is to know about Konamis beautiful game, you will not find yourself disappointed. Whether playing online or off, theres a huge amount to do here and a huge amount to love about it. Put the effort in and youre repaid with a genuine sense of satisfaction and a feeling of real accomplishment. Once again, PES has set an incredibly high level of quality for other sports games to try and match.", "date": "Sept. 15, 2017"}
