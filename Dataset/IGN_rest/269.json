Lafcadio Boone awakens in a mansion where guests are being murdered over and over in an endless, single-day loop, and only he can relive the day and prevent the killings. Figuring out just how to use that time cycle in conjunction with a smart investigation gameplay mechanic becomes its own engrossing loop, from the first gruesome murder to the last. The intriguing mysteries of Boones situation, his basic mission, and the ability to rewind the clock are laid out early. Revelations about the mansion and the reason for the murders dont come until later on in the seven-hour story, but the intriguing vignettes in which the plot unfolds were more than enough to keep me engaged. Especially when that twisted and surprising ending delivers on the weird world of the Sexy Brutale. Exploring that world is a continually fascinating ride, with each murder scene taking place in its own section of the mansion. From the casino (also named the Sexy Brutale) to the in-house bar and to many more diverse locations, they each offer a unique set of clues to uncover. Investigating is like an Assassin's Creed spying mission  only fun. Stopping each murder essentially boils down to the same steps: investigate the area and its inhabitants, determine how the environment can be used, and then execute a plan, rewinding the clock when necessary to catch particular events as they happen. But because Boone can never be in the same room as the other people, he has to spy on them from adjacent areas, listening in on conversations for clues of how to use the mansions environments to alter the course of events. Its like an Assassins Creed spying mission, only fun, thanks to the snarky, smarmy dialogue from the guests and killers  You know, its days like this I wish I were LESS competent, one murderer says on the way to a target  in which they drop clues via dialogue as you trail them. The in-game map is a particularly smart and essential inclusion in this process. It tracks every movement of every person in the mansion as you follow them, allowing you to scrub back and forth in time to pinpoint exactly where theyll be at which moment. After a few loops spent spying on houseguests, you can make tweaks to the environment  succinctly summed up in the tutorial murder, which has you putting a blank cartridge in a gun to jam it just at the moment of execution  to prevent each death. Finding out how to do so takes careful, patient investigation of the mansion, but thorough snooping is consistently rewarding. I found myself dedicated to the side objectives of collecting the guests invitations and a full deck of 52 playing cards scattered throughout the mansion, just so that I could see more of it. Thats thanks in part to the gorgeous adorable, macabre chibi gothic art design. Every room of the Brutale pops up like a diorama, and long after Id solved the murders in a particular area Id return to investigate, learning more about the mansion, its inhabitants, and their collective dark past. It certainly doesnt hurt that the entire experience is backed by a delightfully jazzy soundtrack, one that I intend to listen to long after Ive played. Only a brief graphical hitch that pops up as you move from room to room would occasionally pull me out of whats otherwise an engrossing world. Long after I beat the game, I couldn't stop exploring the mansion. Part of what keeps that exploration, and the act of solving each new murder, feeling fresh is that Boone gains new powers with every life saved. Enhanced hearing or lockpicking, for example, opens up new areas of the mansion and also can be used to further investigate the world. The powers add layers of complexity to the investigative process as Brutale goes on, which prevents them from becoming stale. I couldnt shake the feeling, though, that some complexity was missing. Characters respond to other murders in the house, noted by strange, unexpected clangs or booms, yet I never had to affect one area of the mansion to successfully stop a murder in another, even though all the trappings for such an opportunity appear to be in place. As a result, the murders all feel a little too compartmentalized instead of part of a larger, interconnected mansion where one falling domino can affect others  but that leaves room for the sequel I hope The Sexy Brutale gets to expand upon. I enjoyed the process of solving every murder in The Sexy Brutale, and by the time the enjoyably twisted ending came along I was really only disappointed to not have more murders to prevent. Every murder The Sexy Brutale includes is uniquely fascinating to investigate, with the central loop of searching for clues and executing a plan to alter time continually engaging. I found Boones quest so fascinating, the Brutales secrets so alluring, and its world so charming that I rewound the clock just to spend a few more days in Lafcadios beautiful nightmare.", "date": "April 11, 2017"}
