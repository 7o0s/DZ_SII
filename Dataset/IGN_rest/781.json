Heres what I said then: Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is outstanding. With enhanced art and music, tons of extra in-game content, cross-save compatibility, and bundling two huge games for the price of one, its a lot of bang for your buck. There didnt seem to be much room for improvement, but an extra coat of paint convinced me that the PS4 Remaster is the best way to (re)experience the world of Spira. The first thing I noticed was the visual upgrade to NPCs and enemies. Blocky PlayStation 2-era textures still present in the PS3/Vita Remaster have been rounded out on the PS4 version, bringing them more in line with the heroes smooth contours. The next thing I noticed is the additional color and detail added to all of the character models, including the main characters: I could see the tiniest swirls on Wakkas vibrantly blue headband in FFX, and I dug how bright Yuna's earring tassel is in FFX-2. Buildings and fauna received touch-ups as well. Far-off structures are more distinct, making them a part of the world instead of fuzzy background decoration. And thanks to improved light and shadow effects, water and clouds look more visceral, while previously opaque objects in dark rooms like facial features are easier to see. Sharper detail and better lighting meant I noticed things that I hadnt paid attention to before. In Eternal Calm, I saw Yunas fingers twitch anxiously as an old man droned on about his problems. In FFXs Zanarkand, I saw the hair on an NPC sway back and forth as she bounced on her toes. And I noticed colorful pennants lining Lucas stadium after Yuna gave a rousing rock concert in FF X-2. Gameplay-wise, not a whole lot has changed, and neither have the annoyingly unskippable minutes-long cutscenes. You can change the music in FFX from the remastered version to the classic soundtrack, which is a nice touch for people like me who prefer the original score. The PS4 Remaster also allows you to transfer your PS3/Vita save to the PS4, in case you want to continue playing from wherever you left off. (I like the idea, though if you already bought one of the previous versions, it seems a bit excessive to buy it again). Pros Two huge, excellent RPGUpgraded HD visualsLots of contentOriginal FFX score included Cons No skippable cutscenes Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is already great way to play these classic RPGs on the PS3 and Vita, and the even prettier PlayStation 4 version comes with the visual improvements youd expect for the new-generation platform.", "date": "May 13, 2015,"}
