In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity  not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade  a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your hearts content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative. Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff thats been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as theyre laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldnt have a city-builder without them - so its mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that. The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence Im sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, theres plenty of room. And while you cant directly edit terrain while you play, theres an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support. With such large cities, its fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a maps natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district. Lets zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds  three and a half on the fastest  which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesnt seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in. Making a major citys traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I havent come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but theres a sandbox mode thatll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (Theres also an unlimited money mode.) Mass transit is a tricky beast. Its not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. Its easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and its frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it. Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCitys attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesnt match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they dont quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same. What Skylines isnt good at is telling you what youve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didnt want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I dont know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I dont understand why. In that light, its fortunate that its fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump  basically piping raw sewage into your citizens tap water  or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000. Its limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those dont spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I dont mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement thats been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning. Likewise, its really hard to become unpopular without trying. Even during periods of what the in-game fake Twitter and an abundance of abandoned buildings would have me believe to be times of great distress, Ive never seen the general happiness icon in the menu bar dip below what Id describe as a psychotic grin. Those tweets (or Chirps, as theyre called) initially seem helpful, pointing to power outages and the like, but are quickly drowned out by repetitive and useless in-jokes and chatter. Theres no way to turn it off, unfortunately. I suppose I could probably drive public opinion down if I took the bait and really tried. Skylines grants access to unique buildings like stadiums and observatories behind achievements, which range from encouraging, such as educating 50 percent of your population, to the demoralizing, such as allowing garbage to pile up, unemployment to skyrocket over 50 percent, average health to plummet, have 1,000 simultaneously abandoned buildings, or other generally unpleasant things. I havent brought myself to wreak that kind of destruction yet, since I do have a sort of attachment to my cities, but I have unlocked enough of them that I was able to reach the somewhat underwhelming final goal of building a Wonder - in my case a Space Elevator, which served as yet another tourist attraction. Regardless, a lack of public approval doesnt seem to be something you need to fear in Skylines, which is slightly demotivating. Pros Flexible, powerful toolsLooks greatHuge cities Cons Opaque problemsUneventful cities More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. Its a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens apparent concerns. Dont expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.", "date": "March 10, 2015"}
