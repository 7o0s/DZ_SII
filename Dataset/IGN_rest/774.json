After that, Max comforted her devastated friends, pondered her existence alone after curfew, and commiserated with her close friend, Chloe. The events of Life is Strange -- Episode 2: Out of Times finale weigh heavily on Maxs shoulders, and Episode 3 shows how deeply they affect this cast of increasingly likable characters. Life Is Stranges greatest success is in how grounded its world is, despite Maxs mysterious time-rewinding powers and the imminent end of the world. Episode 3 gives us time to breathe after Episode 2s intense drama, but it finishes with something similarly bold. By the end of Episode 3, developer Dontnod takes an enormous and ambitious risk that succeeds in not only setting the story on a strong new path that broke my heart, but also left me ecstatic for Episode 4. Episode 3 is where Life Is Strange finally makes the most of Maxs time-rewinding powers. Each time I think Dontnod has reached the limits of what the skill can do, it introduces something new or better. Verbal puzzles see Max learning secrets, going back in time, and leveraging the information against someone before they ever reveal it. I learned a lot about people I like and others I dont, and my perspective toward some of them changed. Life Is Strange is so effective at humanity that Im becoming more willing to overlook some of the imperfect performances and dialogue  partially because the dialogue writing is finally coming into its own and delivering on this storys potential, and partially because Im enthralled by these people regardless of their hilarious and continued overuse of the word hella.~ Environmental puzzles function similarly, and are bigger and more involved than in previous episodes. I enjoyed exploring Maxs school, the Blackwell Academy, after hours to find a build a DIY pipe bomb  despite its fetch-quest nature, it allowed Max time to monologue, giving me more insight into her state of mind, her thoughts on her friends and classmates, and how shes dealing with the fallout of Episode 2. Using the explosive to blast a path open, entering a room, and then rewinding before a time the bomb was ever built makes Max feel powerful. In Episode 3, her odd gift no longer feels like a gameplay gimmick. Its becoming something she understands  just in time for her to discover a new element of it she cant comprehend. At the same time, while rewinding conversations, events, and major choices is the primary makeup of Life Is Strange, with these puzzles filling in the gaps between them, the power may running out of steam. I didnt undo a single choice in this episode, because it didnt feel necessary. The creative opportunities for rewinding time seem exhausted by now. Perhaps future episodes will prove me wrong, but Episode 3s introduction of a significant change to Maxs abilities indicates a big shift for what she can and will do going forward. Shes able to travel farther back in time than ever, and the butterfly effect on the world is much larger than even Episode 2s outstanding consequences. It weakens the importance of my control over the moment, because the moment feels less important than the bigger picture Max is gaining hold of. Because of this meddling with the past, Episode 3 rebuilds the world around Max. Im intrigued about its new direction, and excited to see where she takes it next  and how her small-scale time-rewinding skills relate to the more expansive abilities shes earned by the end. This episode leaves Max more lost, confused, and hurt than ever, and I feel awful for her and those hurting around her. When Episode 4 opens, and everything around Max is (presumably) different than she or I ever imagined, the first thing Im going to do is check for texts from her mom. Pros Terrific relationshipsGreat puzzlesHuge story changesNew powers Cons Imperfect performances Life is Strange: Episode 3 - Chaos Theory doesnt bring many major moral choices to the table, but it doesnt matter  Maxs evolving time-travel power is growing into something bigger and scarier than she ever expected. This episode poses interesting philosophical dilemmas instead: How far is too far? What is the cost of saving a life? Should anyone be allowed to have this power at all? The people at the center of this story are so engaging that Im starting to outright ignore awkward dialogue, because the emotional gravity of its storytelling is so much stronger than the irregular out-of-place line or questionable dialogue delivery.", "date": "May 20, 2015,"}
