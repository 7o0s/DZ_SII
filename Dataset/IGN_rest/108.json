I gave it a 7.0, for Good. Unfortunately, the Switch version of WWE 2K18 is an inconsistent, buggy mess, and even if the wrestling was as strong as Mark Henry, it still wouldnt save what is one of the worst ports in the Switchs library. Its to be expected that a Switch port of WWE 2K18 would have a pretty dramatic graphical downgrade, and sure enough, wrestlers look much less detailed, theres not as much animation in the crowd, and various lighting and other visual effects are turned off. Its noticeable at first, especially coming from the other versions, but I got used to it quickly. The big problem with WWE 2K18 on the Switch is that even with the graphical downgrade, it still performs terribly. Whenever there are more than two characters in a match, the frame rate slows to a nearly unplayable crawl. And the more characters you add, the worse the slowdown gets. That makes match types like Elimination Chamber, Hell in a Cell, and Ladder Matches an absolute chore to get through. Eight-man matches have been totally removed, for obvious reasons. The slowdown even ruins entrances. Every wrestlers entrance is affected by characters moving at about half speed while their music plays normally, leading to these awkward moments where actions are completely out of sync, making the sequences take twice as long as theyre supposed to. An overall lack of polish permeates every single aspect.On top of the performance problems, you can add on audio crackling when the crowd gets loud and even more bugs than ever before. Every single multi-man match that Ive done Ive had at least one wrestler continuously run into either the turnbuckle or the apron for extended periods of time, and Michael Cole or Corey Graves on commentary will start talking about a wrestler, then abruptly stop before finishing the thought. Theres just an overall lack of polish that permeates every single aspect. The very faint and dim light at the end of the dark tunnel that is WWE 2K18 is that at least 1-on-1 matches are fine, for the most part  though backstage brawls take you to slowdown city if you ever go into split screen by entering a room or hallway that your opponent isnt in. And there are a few smaller arenas where the slowdown isnt as substantial, allowing you to at least play triple threat or fatal four-way matches. WWE 2K18 for the Switch wasnt ready to be released, plain and simple. The degree of slowdown in any match type with more than two people in the ring at the same time is simply unacceptable. Add onto that the weird audio glitches and an overall lack of polish, and the underwhelming single-player modes that impact all versions of WWE 2K18, and you have a Switch port that even the biggest of wrestling fans should stay far away from.", "date": "Dec. 9, 2017,"}
