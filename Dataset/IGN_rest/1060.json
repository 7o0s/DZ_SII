The new area, called Brume Tower, is an enticing warren of intersecting tunnels, narrow landings, and precarious ledges absolutely crawling with powerful enemies and lethal snares. Claustrophobic corridors open to cindery courtyards patrolled by formidable monsters. Colossal flame-breathing giants, agile sorcerers, and bloated crawling creatures that explode like living bombs are just a few of the vicious new threats prowling the corridors. Slender ledges and sudden drops add to the difficulty, but I found I could also effectively use them to turn the tables on crowds of enemies. The numerous corners, pits, windows, and portholes also allowed me some interesting tactical options. Arenas are cleverly designed to heighten the tension of combat, creating opportunities for ambushes and heart-palpitating last-second victories. On more than one occasion, I found myself approaching the potential problems with a strategy reminiscent of the planning required by a Batman: Arkham City challenge room. Before stepping into the chamber, I had to size up the threats, go over my options, plot a plan of attack, and calculate contingencies. My careful planning didnt always turn out as expected. I remember patting myself on the back after skillfully dispatching a particularly nasty foe, only to watch his scattered body parts regather themselves as he sprang back to life. Crown of the Old Iron King managed to scare and surprise me more than once with clever new twists. Seas of heaped ash provide ample hiding places for enemies to spring up and attack when least expected. Glowing idols scattered around the map created volatile adverse effects, from summoning new foes to rendering certain nearby enemies immortal. Whenever I stepped outdoors, though, the immersiveness was broken a bit by some truly ugly, smeared renderings of the distant landscapes. With such a fiery and nightmarish theme to work with, Id hoped to see something comparable in splendor to the lovely seaside beauty of Majula reflected in the distance. This just doesnt compare. Crown of the Old Iron King is predictably difficult, but the boss encounter scaling extends beyond grueling and into ludicrous territory. I met one titanic foe in New Game Plus Plus whom I failed to defeat after more than 100 attempts. Ive never before encountered a challenge in a Dark Souls game I couldnt overcome with persistence, and I couldnt help but feel a bit frustrated. Despite a thorough understanding of his patterns and abilities, I simply couldnt do enough damage to wear him down. I bet I could have beaten him with the help of two experienced players, but this is the first time I didnt feel like I had a chance on my own. Pros Great combatPlenty of surprisesWonderful challenge Cons Awful sceneryFrustrating boss Boasting some of the best combat in the series, Crown of the Old Iron King is an intriguing and immersive odyssey. Though less visually impressive than Crown of the Sunken King, this second DLC installment rewards strategic planning more fully than any other episode in the series. Creative traps and engaging battles make this a wonderful addition to Dark Souls 2.", "date": "Aug. 26, 2014,"}
