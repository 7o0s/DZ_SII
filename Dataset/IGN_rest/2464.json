Its not a game about football so much as it is a game about the guys playing football. And exactly how they play it - their behaviours, tendencies, and individual techniques - makes for a livelier game. No longer are you a massive deity in the sky moving generic pieces around a pitch, nor should you think of your team as a collection of stats. Here, players take on a life of their own. The biggest development is a feature called Magic Moments. This refers to a set of 39 RPG-like traits that are distributed across the roster of players in combinations that give each of them their own personality. So, for instance, only gifted shooters like Kevin De Bruyne can hit ferocious rising thunder-bastards that rifle into the net, while Ronaldos headers are practically laser-guided. Magic Moments go further than merely adding new moves, though. They also offer effects such as fighting spirit (which gives players better performance when fatigued), super sub (where players improve if brought on in the second half), and man marking (which enables a player to more doggedly stick to opponents). Whats good is these animations happen automatically, whether a pinpoint cross or an acrobatic clearance off the goal line, triggering by themselves if youre in the right time and place. This makes players feel as distinct to control as they are to watch. This stuff contributes more than any novelty new trick because it emulates footballs intangibles. Get Liverpools Henderson on the pitch and his captaincy attribute reduces team fatigue. Similarly, with Neymars notorious penchant for going down a little too easily in real life, here he comes loaded with an effect called malicia, which roughly translates from Spanish as ,raftiness, due to his success at winning free kicks. These hallmarks bring an extra element of authenticity without seeming like unfair advantages - after all, watch Henderson in real life and youll see how motivational (and shouty) he can be. As a result, PES 2019s players transcend their stats. Its not just about how theyre rated out of 100, but what unique quality they can bring to the team. Keep in mind, however, that you do need at least a base level knowledge of football to appreciate this, otherwise it can all feel a bit random. How is the casual fan to know their teams stamina would endure if only they brought on a certain player? Some kind of icon on the HUD wouldnt have gone amiss. Magic Moments noticeably impact games and therefore need highlighting. Players feel as distinct to control as they are to watch. There are more distinct player behaviours too, here called playing styles. Ever the poacher, Harry Kane will tend to linger in the box, while Bayerns sweeper keeper Manuel Neuer frequently races off his line to intercept wayward balls. Obviously, such behaviours are lessened when youre in control, so they come into play more against the computer. Shutting down an AI Kieran Trippier who loves hugging the touchline and delivering crosses, or identifying and then isolating a target man like Karim Benzema, adds more ways of strategizing. Teams truly feel like theyre composed of individuals, each with specific strengths and weaknesses. All this, of course, leads you to the oppositions goal, and every effort on target here looks utterly unique, as if the animation was crafted for that exact moment. At one point in a match I played, Gareth Bale sprinted to meet a 50/50 ball before the onrushing keeper and just managed to poke the ball under him as momentum took the Welshman sailing over the top. In what seemed to be the same continuous animation, he picked himself off the floor, raised his arms, and roared towards his adoring fans. The blending of these separate motions is virtually flawless. That said, in replays I have seen more clipping issues than I recall last year, such as a foot passing through a rival leg, but theyre easy enough to miss on the default camera view. Shots look good, then, but they dont always feel good. The moment balls hit the net is still strangely anticlimactic, as if PES 2019 is waiting to catch up, and what should have been screamers seem more like ghost goals. Its been an ingrained PES problem for a while now, and Konami has yet to find a solution. In FIFA, if a shot is good enough to beat the keeper you know about it the moment it leaves your players foot, and consequently that shot has a build up. In comparison, PES feels a little loose and lawless. A lazy header that has no right troubling the keeper will worm its way under their flapping gloves, while what looks like a surefire blast from five yards out will go embarrassingly wide. PES shots look glorious in replays after the fact, yet strangely empty in the moment. PES shots look glorious in replays after the fact, yet strangely empty in the moment. On the offensive PES 2019 is slick, but defensively its lacking. Jostling often results in a foul, and sliding seemingly inevitably leads to card. Football is a contact sport, yet referees here actively penalise the slightest collisions and rarely play the advantage. You end up relying on the command that brings a teammate over to pressure the ball carrier while you block off passing options. Sure, this is a widely used tactic in the modern game, but that its the only viable one here greatly restricts your defensive options. In terms of improvements to modes, well start with Master League, and one feature impacts it above all others: team roles. There are 22 different team roles ranging from Creator, who boosts team growth, to Workhouse, who improves team stamina. Those who fit the role of Hero, Superstar, and Legend attract income through sponsorship, merchandise, and fan clubs, so lose an icon like Messi and youll take a financial hit. For those not enamoured by tinkering with formations in the team management screen, team roles bring an exciting extra dimension to Master Leagues coaching by turning players into utilities. Richer player individuality also feeds into more detailed transfers. You can search for players who fit a specific niche, like a Rising Star or Bad Boy, filter by abilities such as Explosive Power, and choose based on playing styles like Trickster or Long Ball Expert. Contract talks themselves are slightly more refined too, letting you set performance bonuses and sell-on fees, and more importantly, showing you how likely the club is to accept the offer. Propose to trade your Ryan Shawcross for Ronaldo and watch the probability of a deal plummet to 0%. While it does make for more involved negotiations, its far from the headline act Master League needed to rope in new fans. Other than those two additions, Master League plays it disappointingly safe yet again, unless youre particularly into the menus newly embedded video clips showing, say, your custom manager silently giving an interview. Theres also the official pre-season International Champions Cup, which would be a real plus if anyone cared about it. And finally, there are nine new leagues, but the likes of the Scottish, Russian, and Argentinian divisions dont make up for omission of the traditional Spanish, Italian, and English leagues, nor the galling loss of the UEFA Champions League. That Chelsea still play under the name London FC coats PES 2019 in that familiar layer of inescapable inauthenticity, as though youre on the outside looking in, and Master League simply cant escape that shadow. But for the minority so inclined, you can take the extra steps to download community data files and import correct team names, kits, and logos. NOTE: Unfortunately, the servers werent up for MyClub mode at the time of review, so Im not able to give a verdict on that specific feature. You shouldnt buy PES 2019 for its new modes - there arent any of note. Nor should you buy it for major changes to existing modes - the ones made are minor. If you do opt in this year, it should be for the focus on player individuality that sets this iteration apart from all previous years. Its not just a case of introducing bespoke animations, but accurately reflecting each players ingrained habits, too. Football, after all, is a battle thats both physical and psychological. From PES 2019s crisp and robust action to the mind games unfolding behind the scenes, this is a game successfully capturing both sides.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2018,"}
