Since then we've had the Extended Cut DLC that fans asked for, and three multiplayer packs adding weapons and maps, but none have added weight to the Mass Effect chronology like the Leviathan DLC. At about three hours long, Leviathan doesnt quite reach the perfect mix of combat and storytelling that drove older add-ons like Mass Effect 2s Lair of the Shadow Broker. Instead, it focuses on revealing story elements that impact the trilogy as far back as the original Mass Effect. After Shepard receives a message from Admiral Hackett via the Normandys computer, youll head to a new lab on the Citadel. There youll speak with a man named Dr. Bryson and begin investigating important new information about the Reapers that could have a direct bearing on the war. After some dialogue and an action prompt (Im being vague to avoid spoilers) youre off to your first combat area, something that youre going to do at least two more times. It's here youll encounter this DLCs weakness. For starters, the combat portions fail. Its merely a trudge through sets of the same enemies youve fought a million times, appearing like so many targets to absorb your rounds and slow your progress, feeling intentionally propped up to extend the length of your stay. Frankly, it feels like filler, and heres why: Remember the explosions going off while you scoured every level of the building in the Shadow Broker content for Liara? And how the tension created by her plight drove you toward the storys conclusion? Theres nothing character-driven in Leviathan that connects with your crew or friendly characters, nothing compelling you to kill the cannon fodder. Its hard  or worse, forgettable  to fight for characters you probably wont really care about. While the combat isnt as motivated or as strong as it could be, let me be clear: the story told here is exciting, and worth playing for the weight it holds within the entire series. It does an amazing job of making you feel awkward and uneasy as youre exploring strange areas that are decidedly unfamiliar and uncomfortable. Some of the set pieces, like the ocean wreckage youll come across, are desolate and destroyed, but beautiful just the same, and will have you stopping to take in the new environments unique to the series. The locale also makes a perfect place to surprise you with Leviathans final revelation. If youre playing Leviathan during your first playthrough of Mass Effect 3, the events will resonate more powerfully than for those who have finished the game. The dialogue added at the end (about 30 seconds' worth) just isnt as impactful if youve completed the game multiple times, because you still know how it all ends. That could be a problem with this DLC, and all future story-driven DLC for that matter. When you know the outcome, its hard to go back just to hear one more story told by the Shepard. CLOSING COMMENTS While BioWare has delivered great Mass Effect 3 DLC in the past, Leviathan falters a bit with a lack of motivation, and subsequently homogenized combat. It does however impress by adding new elements to the storyverse that didnt previously exist. Youre going to feel creeped out, pick up some cool weapons and mods before you reach the stunning conclusion . It doesnt reach the near perfect balance between character-driven story and tense gameplay that past pieces of DLC have, but it does tell a story that changes the Mass Effect universe forever. IGN RATINGS FOR THE MASS EFFECT 3: LEVIATHAN (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 7.5 OVERALL Good (out of 10) All told, Mass Effect 3 is an absolutely amazing game, one that successfully puts a bow on the Mass Effect trilogy while still leaving us hungry for even more. It looks and plays great, but Mass Effect 3's true strength lies in its ability to tell a deeply-woven story. Better yet, the sheer ambition shown by BioWare in announcing an intersecting trilogy complete with save importation becomes fully realized in Mass Effect 3. BioWare deserves applause for not only having the courage to attempt something like the Mass Effect trilogy, but for pulling it off with such exceptional poise and skill. Mass Effect 3 isn't the best game ever made. But it'll certainly be in the conversation for a very long time to come.", "date": "Sept. 2, 2012,"}
