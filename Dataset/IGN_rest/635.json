I started to snooze on my sofa, so I told myself that the GamePad was dying anyway and literally went to my room to take a nap instead of playing. To its credit, amiibo Festival can be very relaxing in a uniquely Animal Crossing way But it often feels like theres nothing happening. Amiibo Festivals charm and wit make up for it somewhat, but both its main board game and its minigames are simplistic and its amiibo integration clunky. Its at its best when played with friends  otherwise, its slow and sleepy. Bored Game? Amiibo Festivals core attraction is a simple board game set in a typical Animal Crossing town. You have to get the most Happy Points to win, a sweet, adorable incentive to move around the board. However, its slow-paced, and theres nothing terribly competitive about it. Simple isnt bad, necessarily, but theres not enough to make me want to come back to it over and over again. Watch 10 minutes of amiibo Festival's board game above. Although theres not much going on gameplay-wise, amiibo Festivals main attraction is filled with cute little details. My favorites are the scenarios that pop up whenever you land on a non-event space, like watching shooting stars or talking to a friend, that result in you either losing or gaining Happy Points or Bells. Nearly every single one of the scenarios is charming, and I even paid attention to the NPCs turns to see what would show up. The board game does integrate Animal Crossings turnip trade, the Stalk Market, very well. Buying low and trying, mostly through luck, to sell high made me feel like I was affecting my chances instead of being at the mercy of a die roll. Its a gamble, and I sold all my turnips more than once for a modest profit only to land, to my dismay, on a space with a way better price on it the very next turn. Even with the Stalk Market, however, I still felt like I was barely doing anything besides tapping my amiibo on the GamePad and pressing A. ...Bored Game Two or three of Amiibo Festivals eight minigames are strong, and even though they're not terribly complex, I still enjoyed their endearing nature. My favorites  the Quiz Show, Mystery Campers, and Island Escape  are all games my much younger self would have absolutely loved. Unfortunately, theres not enough depth to them to keep my interest for too long. Once I played a few rounds of each minigame, Id mastered it  every playthrough after that felt like more of the same. How well can you do at amiibo Festival's Quiz Show? Get a peek at the questions above! The Quiz Show is the biggest standout. I've played well over a thousand hours of Animal Crossing over all the games, and I still found some of the quiz questions difficult. A lot of them require specific knowledge, like who in real life made a painting that's featured in the games, and my roommate beat me once with a combination of art history knowledge and lucky guesses. Sadly, most of amiibo Festival's minigames use amiibo cards, three of which are included, in frustrating ways. One hybrid of rock-paper-scissors and whack-a-mole required a lot of switching between amiibo cards and tapping them to the GamePad's NFC reader at the right times, but it's horribly clunky and not very fun. I ended up fumbling with the cards a lot and getting irritated. Pros CharmingFun ideas Cons SlowShallowPoor amiibo use Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival is undoubtedly charming, using the world and little details of Animal Crossing to their fullest. However, theres not enough to it to keep me coming back. The amiibo integration is cumbersome and hard to play with, and interesting ideas like the use of the stalk market are limited by a slow pace. Its delightful enough to make me smile, but its still a bit boring.", "date": "Nov. 19, 2015,"}
