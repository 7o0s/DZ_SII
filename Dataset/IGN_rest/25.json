Its new content ranges from an excellent new standard multiplayer map and Zombies Easter egg challenge all the way down to some maps prone to miserably unbalanced spawn camping and a dogfight without enough room to spread your wings, which makes this an inconsistent but overall worthwhile expansion. Of the three new core multiplayer maps, Egypt stands out as the best and one Im always hoping for to pop up in the rotation. For all its narrow corridors through ancient ruins, Egypt still has plenty of space on the two outer lanes for long-ranged shootouts. I rarely played a game where engagements were limited to one part of the map, and I enjoyed seeing how every person made their own playstyle work here. In one game I was up against an incredible sniper who used the many pillars and entryways as cover while picking off my team. In that same game I encountered a person who was able to successfully run through most of the map with the shovel. Regardless of loadout, Egypt offers a great playground for hide and seek with plenty of options for tactical flanking and escapes thanks to its abundance of cover. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: WW2 didn't really need another small map, but that's what we get with V2. It offers plenty of flanking options that contribute to even more chaotic firefights around and in the tower in the center of the map, so it is at least an interesting map to fight on. The tower has several entrances and open areas above and below it where you can toss grenades or snipe in or out of the tower, making this map a lot less favorable to snipers, but very friendly to explosives. V2 offers plenty of flanking options that contribute to even more chaotic firefights. The main downside is that if your team gets exceptionally stomped, V2 ends up becoming a special kind of hell. Like Valkyrie from The Resistance DLC, this small map has few spawn points, and that means spawn camping is a problem. The 1.13 update that added unlimited sprinting certainly contributes to that awful cycle. Ive only joined one Domination match where I felt trapped in my spawn so far, but it was a frustrating problem my team couldn't solve. The third map, Dunkirk, is the worst of the bunch. Its a long, narrow map with an open beach on one side and a line of buildings on the other. It's okay for Domination and less interesting for Kill Confirmed or Team Deathmatch, but the limited spawn points make this an awful map for Hardpoint. More often than not, one team spawns right next to the capture point, making the match a foregone conclusion. Thats worked to my teams advantage several times, and its still not fun. Smart explosives paired with a coordinated team charge can help even the odds, but not enough to make it feel balanced. Tipping the scales further from fairness, Dunkirk also suffers from opportunities for spawn killing. War Mode was my favorite addition to the Call of Duty multiplayer suite when it debuted in WW2, but the newest map becomes progressively less fun with each objective you complete. Operation Husky adds tactical tools for both teams with its crates of limited Molotov cocktails and tripwires, and these made for a more interesting start as the Allied forces attempt to capture and return three cases to a base. I would have liked the first area to be a tad bigger so the lane between the buildings didnt feel so congested, though I do appreciate that the Axis forces can sneak into the Allied base and retrieve the collected intel to turn the tide of a match back in their favor. As a small nitpick, the fact that it says Flag Captured when you deliver a case to the base makes Operation Husky feel a little unpolished, considering it isnt a flag. The second objective has the Allied team throwing bodies at a point to try to capture it. It's not overly difficult to defend as the Axis team since the point is in a small room with a nearby spawn, and the additional Molotov cocktails and flamethrower help keep things interesting once players start camping the room. But that's ideally where I like to stop playing Operation Husky, because the third objective is bad. Its a shame since its the only instance of aerial combat in multiplayer, but this first-to-25-kills team dogfight is so cramped for space that I often saw people accidentally fly out of bounds and explode before they could get back in  and its happened to me more than once, too. Even when things stay contained, battles are a bit dull because while the plane is fine to maneuver it lacks interesting weaponry beyond machine guns. The new Nazi Zombies chapter, The Shadowed Throne, takes the team to Berlin as the zombie horde spreads. I liked this map more than the previous DLCs The Darkest Shore; its not a big map, but every room is filled with interesting details, many of which are important to the Easter egg mission. Its just as challenging to figure out as the last, but better in that multiple steps for different objectives can be done early on simultaneously. Like previous chapters, its fun to play with someone who knows how to get the puzzle started, learn from them, then use that knowledge in another game. The Shadowed Throne also introduces a the Wunderbuss, a neat weapon thats great for eliminating hordes of zombies after its been charged by shooting what amounts to a dart that sucks the energy out of a zombie. The three melee weapons  a nail bat, a combat knife, and a pickaxe  made slaying zombies and scavenging the walking corpses for supplies early on better, too. Its a shame, though, that the only new zombie is just a regular zombie that evolves into a shrieking fire corpse. Its incredibly easy to kill compared to the terrifying spider zombie from The Darkest Shore. The War Machines new multiplayer content has some high points, but also its fair share of duds. I count the large, versatile Egypt map as one of my favorites in all of Call of Duty: WW2, while Id be happy without ever playing Domination or Hardpoint on the unbalanced Dunkirk map again. The new War mode map, Operation Husky, has a similar problem: its more tactical first objective being far more entertaining than its irritating dogfight at the end. The Shadowed Throne Nazi Zombies chapter, at least, remains consistently fun with a great new location and Easter egg mission, but it could have used a more interesting new zombie.", "date": "April 14, 2018"}
