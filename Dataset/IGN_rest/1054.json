While having the BioShock experience up close and personal via tablet or phone with slight but not deal-breaking audio-visual concessions is great for immersion, some perplexing touch-screen control decisions bring new frustrations to the forefront. Whether this is your first trip to Rapture or a return visit after seven years away, BioShock's story and setting remain enthralling. While the textures aren't as detailed or the splicers movement as smooth as they are on a decent PC or the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions (read our 2007 BioShock review), the underwater dystopia is still a sight to behold and a marvel to listen to. Moments like scouring a dilapidated office for supplies with creepy posters adorning the walls while a psychopath has an creepy conversation with himself and a static-tinged 1940s tune plays in the background really cement the almost survival-horror nature of BioShock. If you're playing on an iPad with a decent set of headphones and notifications off, the immersion of the iOS version makes up for a lot, as there's precious little to distract you from Rapture's charms. When it comes to combat, however, the touch-screen controls aren't quite up to snuff. Surprisingly, movement and aiming is actually done reasonably well with virtual analog sticks. As you'd probably gather, iOS touch screens can't replicate the precision of a mouse and keyboard or gaming controller when it comes to combat. Firing a gun or a plasmid is a bit less intuitive than it's been in previous versions of BioShock, but at least those have big, hard-to-miss icons to tap. At the beginning, when you're facing off against one or two lightly armed splicers with the Electro Bolt plasmid and a wrench or pistol, I started to get the sense that iOS devices just might be able to handle BioShock's combat. However, as the encounters and your artillery get more complicated, the platform's ability to support it diminishes greatly. Even with the removal of the jump button, finding your way through Rapture is still simple enough, though you may find yourself accidentally tapping the crouch button from time to time. However, it would have been nice to be able to set waypoints during the periods that the directional arrow isn't pointing you towards your next objective, as constantly bringing up the map via the tiny menu button in the upper left corner can be frustrating. Perhaps the most egregious control change for iOS is the use of first aid items. What was a simple button or key press on physical controls has become the equivalent of rubbing your stomach while patting your head. You have to basically remove your thumb from the virtual thumbstick or stop aiming with your right hand and press the health bar icon in the upper-left corner. Seeing as how you're likely in the heat of combat when you need to do that, losing movement or aiming for a second or two as you heal is simply unacceptable, especially when you're taking on Big Daddies that can sap nearly your entire life bar early on. Changing guns or plasmids is also a bit of a chore. Instead of bringing up a radial menu with the push of a button, you can either tediously scroll through your weapons or access an immersion-breaking menu that lists everything. Honestly, I wouldnt have an issue if the game included auto-healing when youre near death and weapon-switching when youve completely depleted a guns ammo. The Pipe Dream-style hacking puzzles are also surprisingly more difficult with a touch screen. They're certainly manageable (especially when tonics make them easier later on), but you may find yourself overwhelmed by the speed of the puzzles and the slightly unwieldy tile-swapping at first. While it would have been nice to have the Challenge Rooms that were added to the PlayStation 3 version of BioShock, there are a few neat little bonuses that come with the iOS version. There's some decent stat tracking with fun graphs showing your plasmid and gun usage, and if you've got a sizable GameCenter friends list, you can check out leaderboards. You can also peruse BioShock's lengthy art book that lends itself nicely to tablet navigation. Pros Good immersionDecent movementNice extras Cons Unwieldy healthVisual downgrades If you want a low-stakes return to Rapture, BioShock on iOS might do the trick. If you ratchet the difficulty down and accept the fact that you might not be able to hack every device or plunder every explorable area, having the world of BioShock closer than ever has its own charm. However, if you've never played before, you can likely find cheaper and better-looking versions on consoles or computers that won't be as tough to control.", "date": "Sept. 1, 2014,"}
