In many ways, the re-announced, presumably reworked Metroid Dread of 2021 feels like that 2D-ish Metroid game we should have gotten 16 years ago, following two masterpiece Metroid games, Zero Mission and Prime. Its not often we get to say this about a game that emerges from more than a decade of development purgatory, but the wait has been worth it: The epic delay allows Metroid Dread to use the Switchs power to greatly improve on what could have been accomplished on previous Nintendo systems, and makes the supposed conclusion to Metroids mainline story something of a grand finale. Everything works in handheld form, but you really have to dock the system to get the full 2D-style Metroid experience on your TV that weve been missing in the three decades since Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo (that said, Zero Mission looks pretty cool emulated on the Virtual Console). Playing on a big, HD screen reveals sprawling alien scenes in diorama-like backgrounds, lit by the dynamic glow of Samuss arsenal and projectiles. Also thanks to the Switch, the action never seems to drop a frame. Thats important, since combat is lightning fast, and just keeps getting faster with each powerup. Everything seems to speed up as you move through Metroid Dread. Upgrades add to your movement, and reduce backtracking time with boosts, dashes, and jumps, all while youre making incredibly short work of once-powerful enemies with your new arsenal.One issue I had with the last Metroid, the 3DS remake of Samus Returns, was the cramped controls of the 3DS hindering the action  especially the new, twitchy combat. That combat makes a return in Dread, but here on the Switch its much more comfortable  and more fun. The counter system from Samus Returns, which requires careful timing to react to enemies visibly foreshadowing their attacks, is just one of many moves including dashes, feints, dodges, and timed-charge attacks that make up your bag of tricks, and that can take up a lot of buttons. Its not bad on the Switch in handheld mode, but Dread only really shines with the Pro Controller. If I had to beat a boss  and these are some of the toughest bosses in Metroid history  I docked every time. These are some of the toughest bosses in Metroid history. Those boss fights range from the traditional big, drooling monsters with patterns and weak points to learn, to almost Smash Bros.-esque encounters with enemies that mimic your move set. The variation is welcome, especially in contrast to the way Samus Returns pitted you against the same boss bugs many times over. I dont want to give anything away, but these are some of the best boss fights Ive ever played in an action platformer: Without exception,they seemed impossible at first, but post-victory, I felt like theyd made me a better player. One repeated encounter youll have is with the creepy, crawling EMMI bots which you might have seen a lot of in previews of Metroid Dread. These are less what youd think of as boss fights and more akin to stealth missions (and sometimes a manic race to the finish line if you are spotted). The EMMI pursuing you transform entire regions of the map into one-hit-kill zones (you do have a small window of escape, but its vanishingly small)  which makes another new-to-Metroid feature of Dread, auto saving, which triggers just outside the EMMI zones, extremely welcome.What We Said About Metroid: Samus Returns on 3DSWhile its been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, Metroid: Samus Returns is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. Its a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, its nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids. - Samuel Claiborn, Sep 12, 2017Score: 8.5Read the full Metroid: Samus Returns Nintendo 3DS ReviewOne aspect of boss fights that Im not too keen on, however, is the use of counters as quick-time events: Timed button-pressing sequences that you must complete to transition to another stage of a boss fight. It is often impossible to discern whether you even need to be shooting a boss while you await its next counter-able move. I would like to be able to use my 200-some stock of missiles to just destroy a boss the old-fashioned way; what am I collecting all those missile tanks for if I cant even barrage a boss with overwhelming firepower once in a while?There are some truly inscrutable puzzles that left me pondering between play sessions.Speaking of collectibles, the many ways missile tanks and other upgrades are hidden is exquisite. There are some truly inscrutable puzzles that left me pondering between play sessions, and going for a 100% run is a great way to experience the intricate way the world is put together. The Speed Booster and Shinespark moves are especially conducive to mind-bending puzzles and require incredibly precise, split-second platforming thats both fun to figure out and gratifying to (finally) pull off. By employing some classic Metroid moves, like bomb jumping, I was even able to sequence break and get some upgrades I couldnt even use yet, which made me feel like a badass. That kind of flexibility and freedom made the world feel that much more welcoming to exploration and experimentation. If you arent a completionist, you can choose to shoot through Metroid Dread in a shorter burst. According to the game log, I spent 11 hours on my first run, reaching 82% completion  but that figure clearly excludes pause screens, which you might spend a lot of time on because the map itself has been overhauled and tracks mysterious things you cant interact with, items you saw but didnt obtain, and rooms with a secret you didnt even spot. I pored over the map screen frequently to discover secrets, but also to discover my next step. I suspect that many will turn to a strategy guide for the latter, since Metroid Dread does very little to direct you to your next objective. As a general opponent of hand-holdy waypoints, I like this change  especially in a game that emphasizes probing every block. In addition to the tricked-out map, you also get a scanning tool thats balanced just the right way to give you clues to secret paths but doesnt lead you around by the armcannon.The map, and really the world itself, morphs a few times, too  especially in the later game. I wont spoil any late-game tricks for you, but while they arent quite to the scale of Castlevania: Symphony of the Nights upside-down castle, the new routes youll have to work out and the enemy obstacles youll encounter are all quite cool. Dread ramps up the speed at which you get new tools and access new map areas to something of a fever pitch.Im not sure I needed another length of game added onto the end of this, anyway. As my fellow editor Kat Bailey put it, Samus Returns overstayed its welcome  and it was stretched a bit thin by the end, with repetitive bosses and a map that took a while to make your way across. Dread learns from that mistake and gets the pacing right, ramping up the speed at which you get new tools and access new map areas to something of a fever pitch. Its up to you to pick a point, take a breath, and backtrack if youd like. Otherwise, you can power on through to the end. (You will absolutely want to bring as many ammo and life upgrades with you as possible, though  again, these bosses are no joke!). Metroid Dread on Switch OLEDIn my review of the Nintendo Switch OLED, I was able to test out Metroid Dread. While playing in handheld, I quickly noticed how much Metroid Dread benefits from the Switch's OLED display. Some sections have darker blacks and subtly gray areas, particularly in the sections where an EMMI is patrolling, and the OLED's ability to display absolute black made those areas eerier and creepier. Even Samus Aran herself, whose bright blue power suit stands in stark contrast to the environment around her, regardless of which area she is roaming around. Check out my further impressions in the full Nintendo Switch OLED Model review. - Taylor LylesOne point at which Metroid Dread slows down a bit too much, though, are thinly veiled load screens between areas  elevators, trams, and teleporters. These hard transitions break up the world more than in previous games, which is one spot where the Switchs 2016 hardware catches up with Dreads ambition. Samus does something completely unexpected.Earlier this year there was a bit of ballyhoo around this being the final chapter of at least one Metroid storyline, and whatever you are thinking that means, its crazier. Unlike the Prime series and other spinoffs, this is a mainline Metroid game  the fifth since 1986s Metroid  and though the story is sparse (probably for the best after some hammy diversions like Metroid: Other M), it supposedly wraps up here. Despite the twistier elements of the plot, there is one series-peak moment when Samus does something completely unexpected. Its subtle, and its lovely, and I cant wait for fans to experience it. That subtlety extends to much of the story, as well. There isnt a lot to it: A bounty hunter, a bunch of innocent but very hungry aliens, and of course a new reason for how you lost all your great weapons and equipment. I found it refreshing that, where games like Other M went way too far building out the world of Metroid and ended up with some pretty awkward results, Dread shuts that world out and focuses. Instead, Dread is grounded in a story about Samus and the vanished birdlike alien race that raised her, the Chozo. Its an approach that reminds me of series greats, Metroid Prime and Zero Mission. And those Chozo? They sure built a lot of subterranean tunnels for a race equipped with wings, but we can let that slide. Metroid Dread gets so much right after so many years that I almost feel resentful that we didnt get this game and a few sequels in some steady cadence starting in 2005. But instead, Im incredibly happy to play a Metroid that is back at the top of its game. Even though its the latest in a decades old series, Dread has just enough clever innovation to balance its familiarity. The universally recognizable mix of tough puzzles, tougher boss fights, ever-evolving exploration options, and intricate level design that recent games like Hollow Knight and Ori get so right has an origin point: Its Metroid. I love those games, but the Metroid team, a mix of old and new developers now, have shown that they know how to do it best.", "date": "Oct. 6, 2021,"}
