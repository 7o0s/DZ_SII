They're actually a great physics-management series. Trials has always been at its best when it's caused me to think on the fly (literally) about how to properly land a motorcycle that's just launched off a ramp hundreds of feet into the sky. To that extent, Trials of the Blood Dragon represents some of the franchise's best moments with some truly insane stunts with ridiculous jumps, speedy movement, and the awesome addition of a grappling hook. Then it makes you get off your bike and shoot things in dull interludes, and it ends so quickly it can't quite make a great impression. Spinning off from the story-free Trials series by injecting the same neon 80s nostalgia we saw in the over-the-top Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is mostly a good move. While previous Trials have a sort of BBC-inspired dry comedy to them, Trials of the Blood Dragon is pure camp, straight out of Miami Connection or The Running Man. In fact, Trials of the Blood Dragon is actually broken up into a batch of mini-campaigns that lampoon 80s and 90s landmark works like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Starship Troopers, and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Most of those homages work pretty well, and the animated cutscenes between each stage are well done, but what brings some of these old-school throwbacks down is the voice acting. Granted, much of the source material Trials of the Blood Dragon references is based on bad acting, but theres an art to capturing the brain-dead enthusiasm of those sources. Here, there's so little life in the main characters that pipe up during levels (including some unneeded stereotype chatter during the Vietnam stages) that I completely tuned them out and tried to concentrate more on the top-notch techno soundtrack. I had a blast riding through Indiana Jones-style ruins and garish Japanese skyscrapers.Trials of the Blood Dragon's best moments are exactly where I expected them: on the seat of a bike as I zoomed down hills, through loops, and caught mad air while trying to keep upright and at a high speed to earn the best grades with fast and crash-free runs (though I wish there were bonus points awarded for landing risky flips). With such great source material to reference, I had a blast riding through Indiana Jones-style ruins and garish Japanese skyscrapers. Adding a grappling hook to certain stages intensified the action adding a new layer to pondering the speed and momentum of the bikes. Where do I attach the cable? When do I let go? If anything, I wish the grappling hook was used earlier and far more often than it is, especially when a later stage briefly includes a puzzle that keeps you swinging from a single hook for an extended period to avoid sawblades. I similarly enjoyed brief sections where you had to take into account alternate physics when dragging a nuclear bomb behind the bike, handling a minecart or tank, and flying through space via a jetpack. When Trials of the Blood Dragon took that physics management away from me, my interest dropped like a lead balloon on Mars. While they look great, a ride down the side of a skyscraper and a drug trip in Miami frustrated me by changing the physics and throwing the track together at the last second, respectively. Platforming and shooting is rarely challenging or rewarding.Those were mere drops in the rage bucket compared to the many shooting segments scattered throughout Trials of the Blood Dragon. The platforming and shooting is rarely challenging or rewarding (save for a section where you have to escape literal Hell and outrun lava), and it really sucks to have a great run on the bike negated by a bad floaty jump or stray bullet from an enemy. It gets even worse when stealth comes into the equation and you have to hide behind barriers and wait to avoid slow searchlights. There are also sections where you use the gun while on a bike, which I enjoyed when needed to shoot targets that moved ramps into place but got annoyed at when enemies were scattered on the track and caused deaths for reasons beyond bad landings. Even though I was able to complete Trials of the Blood Dragon's campaign in under four hours, I would have prefered an even shorter run that was purely vehicular. Yes, Trials of the Blood Dragon is exceptionally short, especially in comparison to previous Trials games. The 27 levels each run three to eight minutes long, and there's no level editor to increase the track count. Still, the gorgeous stage design and soundtrack will probably pull me back into some of the non-shooting levels I've conquered to race my previous scores and leaderboard friends. There's also the metagame of the Ominous Locked Safe that can only be unlocked with keys found by following cryptic clues. I've yet to make progress in that area, but I'm happy that Redlynx's proclivity for overarching puzzles extends to this Trials, too. Here's hoping this one will actually conclude in our lifetime. Pros Exciting vehicular mayhemAtmospheric soundtrackCute cutscenes Cons Underwhelming shootingPhysics-defying sections Much like you'd see in a seedy 1980s movie, Trials of the Blood Dragon is like a pretty good first hit of a drug. The buzz is short and mostly enjoyable, but it's so different that you might get hooked on the series. It's got a great gateway due to the story's ties to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the flashy neon art, the constant pop-culture references, and fantastic techno score. Just realize that the shooting is bad and that you may come down from this high way earlier than you'd expect. But if this is your first Trial, know that there's lots more to consume.", "date": "June 17, 2016,"}
