You generally need some details going in; how many like-colored gems are required to earn points, what you need to do in order to score combos and move onto the next stage, and so on. Puddle does away with all aforementioned pretenses, leaving you with all you need from the beginning; just get your puddle of liquid to the goal by any means necessary. Puddle Gameplay Trailer Puddle throws you right into the experience with everything you need to know from the get go. You begin by looking at a silhouetted cup of coffee resting on a table in a sterile lab. However, once you begin shifting the screen from left to right, the coffee eventually spills out onto the table and through an obstacle course of narrow paths; hazards that will destroy, soak up, or evaporate your puddle of liquid will begin to appear. You'll even be put into boss ~fights,~ timed sequences where you'll have to use your wits in set areas to defeat your enemy. These boss fights account for some of the most challenging moments in the game, and are extremely fun and rewarding. Your goal is to guide a puddle of liquid through a 2D system of obstacles by tilting the screen either to the left or the right using the triggers. You'll have to lean very gently at times to keep your liquid from moving too fast into a deadly situation that will eliminate all of liquid. Should your liquid meter dip below a certain amount, then you'll be forced to play the stage again. Your only responsibility is to get to the goal by any means with enough liquid left over; it's really that simple. However, ~simple~ doesn't translate to ~easy,~ and Puddle will throw more than a few difficult situations at you. Puddle gets extremely challenging in later stages, and you'll be required to be mindful of physics, momentum, gravity, and even the physical properties of your puddle. You'll have several different liquid types that you'll need to progress through the game's stages, including liquid metal that rapidly cools and slows down (requiring you to pass it through heating points to keep it moving), acid that eats through certain organic obstacles, and nitro-glycerin that will straight up explode if it moves too fast. You're given basically no guidance as to what you should do in the game, but that's never an obstacle, as figuring out what needs to be done is just another part of the puzzle. Boss battles account for some of Puddle's more challenging and fun objectives. However, should you be stuck in a tough situation and unable to progress, Puddle gives you the ability to skip it. You are given a finite number of skips (or ~Whines~ as the game calls them), so you have the option of passing a level that you're having trouble with, but you must be judicious with the ones that you opt out of since you can run out. As you complete each stage you are given a rating of Au, Ag, or Cu (Gold, Silver, and Copper, naturally). These ratings are based on how quickly you complete each stage, not just how much liquid you have left. Performing well and earning Gold and Silver medals will net you some unlockables in the game's Laboratory mode, a mode that lets you play around with various liquids and environmental objects to experiment with the game's physics system. Puddle's aesthetic also mirrors the game's straightforward gameplay formula. The backgrounds are seldom in focus, but the objects in the foreground are often blackened out silhouettes of discernible objects. The use of color is limited, as the environments often adhere to one uniform scheme. Certain hazard objects and your puddle itself are often the only objects that stick out colorfully, reflecting the gameplay's focus of your puddle and the obstacles in your way as being the only things that really matter. Puddle's look is subdued, but by no means ugly. CLOSING COMMENTS Puddle is dirt-simple by design, but its simplicity betrays a high degree of challenge. When you start to get into the game's later stages, you'll find yourself stuck in some situations that require not just a high degree of perseverance and a steady hand, but also a lot of patience. Puddle is in many ways a Catch-22, a game with extremely accessible gameplay but also some insanely difficult puzzles that might frustrate some newcomers. Still, if you are looking for a game that will tax your brain without complicated a control scheme, then Puddle might be the one to quench your puzzle thirst.
