Now, it has just become a matter of one click with even the next-gen consoles featuring capturing and streaming gameplay built-in. As the world increasingly moves towards watching video games (evident by Amazons $1b acquisition of Twitch) it has become the imperative of content creators to produce videos of high quality and be able to share those video in an easy and affordable manner. Over the past few years, we have seen many manufacturers releasing their own game capture solutions to the market, and one name that definitely stands out is Elgato. The Germany-based company has been pushing out capture devices that not only allows creators to record gameplay footage but also simultaneously stream it over Twitch, Youtube, Ustream, etc. Elgato HD60 is their newest addition, which as the name would suggest supports 60fps recording at 1080p resolution. Design & Features Elgato has taken the Apple route in packaging the HD60 - there are no thick set of manuals to read, or complicated instructions to follow. Inside the box, all you will find is the device, a sticker, and the necessary cables. The device itself is barebones and simple. Its matte black finish is marked only by an Elgato logo, with both of the HDMI in and out ports residing on each side of the device along with a USB port and a mic jack for commentary. The simplicity in the packaging means Elgato expects the HD60 to run right out of the box. And it does indeed. Setting it up is quite simple: just hook up the consoles HDMI to the devices HDMI in port, run a cable from HDMI out to the display, and hook it up to a PC via USB and you are ready to go. Keeping it simple also means that, unfortunately, Elgato has shed some features that still might be useful for some. Most notably is the lack of the composite port which allows you to hook up retro consoles. Considering the favorable demand for Lets Plays of old-school games, it seems like an oversight to skip on that. The HD60 also doesnt provide raw files. Recorded gameplays are compressed with the H.264 codec (mp4 container), and while the video quality is absolutely sufficient at the highest setting, those craving for that extra bit from their recordings will be left short on that front. Unlike the AverMedia Live Gamer Portable, the HD60 records to PC only, instead of having an option to also save on an SD card. This could make the HD60 a little difficult to carry if you intend to record footage during events or conventions as you would have to lug around a laptop or a desktop around with you. Of course, the AverMedia Live Gamer Portable could only record at 30fps on SD cards, so its not too much of a drawback if you are completely focused on 60fps content. Software The backbone of any capture device is its bundled software, and thankfully Elgato provides an extensive, easy to use, and robust piece of software to work on. Available for download from the official website, the Game Capture HD works with both Windows and Mac, and provides out of the box support for all the major streaming services, including Twitch, UStream, and even YouTube. With the software open, the gameplay screen takes up the majority of the desktop space. Its surrounded by a number of options which allows you tailor your recording and streaming needs accordingly. The main Settings menu supports separate profiles for PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, iPad, etc, with each allowing you to set their respective resolution, desired quality, frame rate, picture, audio properties, and more. From the main control panel you can set the games volume, streaming bitrate, enable live commentary (which automatically reduces game sound for clearer narration), take a screenshot, and even input your videos title and description. Streaming from the software is extremely simple as well. Just add the account details of your favorite streaming service, set the bitrate, and hit the Stream button below the gameplay screen to instantly start a live show. I tried a number of random streams on Twitch and YouTube and they always worked immediately with good video and audio clarity. If you are a sponsored streamer, the Game Capture HD also provides seven overlay presets which you can adorn with images, logos, and a camera feed of yourself. These presets can be changed on the fly during streaming and doesnt require a connection reset or a software reboot. The software also has a useful feature called Flashback Recording, which lets you grab video segments that you werent recording by sliding back on the timeline and clicking the record button. This lets you retroactively record any awesome moments that you may have missed out on, which is a cool little trick if you are absent minded like me or just didnt think anything special would happen. Elgato doesnt specify how long the software keeps the video on the buffer, but it seems to be about an hour. Recorded gameplay can be saved at the maximum quality of 40mbps, which takes up about 18.1GB/per hour. The software also provides rudimentary editing options where you can cut and remove unwanted video segments from a file. Those looking for an extensive suite of options wont find it here, although it would have been nice if Elgato provided certain styling options in the way of PS4s SHAREfactory, so at least mature streamers could make their content look a little more presentable. If you are inexperienced with Premiere Pro or After Effects, and have no idea how to import the recorded files into a more manageable file size, the Game Capture HD does help in that regard, however. You can output video files formatted specifically for YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Email, Apple TV, iPad, and iPhone. Performance To test the HD60, I recorded gameplay footage from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on PS4 (which runs at 60fps), along with Sunset Overdrive from Xbox One. In both the games, the captured video was excellent at the highest quality setting with barely any difference to the actual gameplay. Below are a couple of sample recordings of the games to give you general idea of how your videos will appear to your viewers. Of course, our video players compression has taken its toll on the footage, but viewing it at 1080p should give you a respectable idea of the final quality. Besides image quality, one of the other things I immediately tested for was lag. Usually, running a connection through a device introduces a noticeable lag in the gameplay, but I am happy to report that the HD60 subverts this issue completely. Of course, you will find lag if you plan to rely on the capture feed, so you are better off using your HDTV or monitor to play the game. Pros Excellent video and audio quality recordings at 1080p60Bundled software is robust with extensive optionsRidiculously easy to useFlashback Recording is a boon Cons ExpensiveLimited to HDMI connections onlyNo SD card support for recording At AED 899, the Elgato HD60 is steeply priced, especially considering AverMedia offers the same features and more with the GamerZone ExtremeCap U3 capture card at a slightly cheaper price tag (approx. AED 650). That said, despite a few of HD60s limitations - it only accepts HDMI connection, and requires a PC to save recordings - its still a great device that offers the highest quality gameplay footage at maximum frame rates. That along with the functionality and ease of use of the bundled software should be a delight to any serious streamer.", "date": "Jan. 13, 2015,"}
