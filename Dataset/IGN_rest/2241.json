Theyre a hardware manufacturer best known for their USB docking stationsthe little USB-A connector is even their logo. But theyve recently made a strong push into gaming peripherals under the brand Plugable Performance. Their first headset, the wired HS53, represents a bold take on the category. Their vision: Make a great, no-frills gaming headset. Soup up the critical parts, and strip everything else away. Then sell it at an unbelievably low pricein this case, a meager $44.95. Plugable HS53  Design and Features The HS53or Onyx Headset, depending on where youre readingis a delightfully spartan headset. Its all black, from the plastic ear cups to the brushed metal frame. While most gaming headsets are chasing louder neon color combos, the HS53 looks refreshing in its restraint. Plus, Im a sucker for all-black gear. But the headset still looks like a gamers kit, complete with incredibly large, memory foam-laden ear cups. Brushed aluminum connects the headband to the ear cups and help the headset feel durable. The rest of the headset is plastic and synthetic leather. Plugable calls its plastics high-quality, but they feel pretty standard and lightweight. Thats not exactly a bad thing, as it helps the headset weigh-in at just under a pound. Theres a retractable boom mic on the left ear cup. It can be pulled out several inches and bent for optimal positioning or easily pushed back into the ear cup when you dont need it. But even fully retracted it still juts out like a gross little nubbin. The headset connects to your controller via a braided cord ending in a 3.5mm headphone jack. That can be plugged directly into your controller, or into a cheap, plastic module that lets you adjust volume and mute the mic. Theres also a long 250cm TRS Y-cable to connect to PCs. The 53 in the name comes from the large 53mm drivers (sidenote: presumably the HS stands for, ahem, headset). The headset offers what Plugable calls ~True 2.0 Stereo, and it's what they call their implementation of stereo audiowhich is designed to accurately take advantage of games environmental audio despite being just stereo sound. Theres relatively little branding on the deviceboth the HS53 and Plugable logo arent nearly as noticeable in person as they are in photos. But the microphone protrusion and general design clunk will probably prevent the headset from replacing your everyday headphones. Thats a long list of features for a wired headset. But Plugables main selling point is the price tag. At just $44.95, its cheaper than pretty much all of its competitors. Plugable HS53  Gaming Several hours after I began reviewing the HS53, I found myself on their site for the third time that day. I was triple-checking that the headset did, in fact, only cost $44.95. The Onyx headset just feels way too nice for such a low price. The thick band remained comfortable for hours at a time. The synthetic leather ear cups felt sturdy and did a good job isolating outside noise. I never had head or ear fatigue, and there were days I used them for upwards of four hours at a time. Im a fan of the cleverly implemented unidirectional boom micits easy to position, and my friends never had a problem hearing me. I would prefer it didnt jut out as far when retracted, but its still a better solution than many others Ive testedlike the hard plastic options that always feel on the verge of breaking or the removable boom mics that are so frequently getting in lost in my couch cushions. Of course, thats not to say the headset is perfect. The HS53 is a budget headset, and that means there are some budget concessions. The volume/mic muting module feels extremely cheap, like an empty plastic shell and the audio doesnt exactly offer much of a wow factor. One of my favorite ways to test sound profiles is to see how accurately they play a few of my favorite songs. The HS53s are punchy, with an extremely bass-forward sound profile, which muffles some of the mids and highs. That being said, the true stereo did well replicating directional audio. I tested it against a slew of games, and where I most appreciated it was, surprisingly, in the new MLB The Show. Each time I stepped up to the plate, I could hear fans jeer, taunt, and applaud my superhuman rookie from all directions. If youre accustomed to higher quality gaming headsets, the sound profile might feel too muddy to you. But if youre replacing something like the PS4s included ear buds, this thing is going to blow you away. For less than $50, I have absolutely no hesitation recommending the Plugable HS53 headset. The build quality stands toe-to-toe with competitors that cost double, or even triple, the cost. And while the audio falls short of amazing, its still a stunningly comfortable headset at a fantastic price.", "date": "July 11, 2019,"}
