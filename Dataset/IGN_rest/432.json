Honestly, given the pace the show has settled into, there wouldn't be enough time to do that properly. Instead, the show expanded outward and went even bigger with its conspiracy, sucking Angela into the malicious mix right at the end for a huge cliffhanger. We got closer to learning about Phase 2. Not ~all the way,~ of course, but close enough to know that it involved malware triggering an explosion meant to take down a building - one that seemed to be the new hub for all of E Corp's physical documents. But even Elliot wasn't totally sure of the entire plan or all of the ramifications. He just knew enough to want to stop it. What we didn't learn more about was the chat between Whiterose and Angela, from the first part of the finale. Not the David Lynch-ian empathy test or the cordial introductions, but the dialogue that happened off-screen that seemed to drastically alter Angela's entire outlook. We're still in the dark about that, and for a good reason, really. She's now become the skeleton key to everything. Tyrell called her after shooting Elliot and she was expecting the call. She may have even been expecting the reason for the call, knowing that it would come once Elliot was eliminated. Plus, there was the ~We've Got Tonight~ ending that involved Trenton and Mobley, in their new Fry's lives, chatting about undoing all the damage they'd caused and then being approached by Elliot's prison buddy/Dark Army protector, Leon. Yes, there was a ton going on here, and plenty of morsels to take us into Season 3, but I mostly want to focus on the two biggest, and best, scenes. At this point, you're either in or out on Mr. Robot's trickery. There's an argument to be made that the mind games, thanks to an unreliable narrator and his even more unreliable alter ego, have been overdone. But you could also make a claim that this show executes the twists very well and has done a good job of weaving them into the fabric of the story. What I really enjoyed here was the fact that the series anticipated everyone thinking Tyrell might be a figment. It was an odd theory that many, including myself, floated back near the top of the season, even though it didn't quite fit given the fact that he had his own entire side story back in Season 1. Still, was the Tyrell that we met last week real? That was a somewhat valid question. Because of this, the show, and Mr. Robot, was able to trick us -- and Elliot -- into thinking there was a trick when there wasn't. It was the ultimate crying of wolf. Elliot stood his ground against Tyrell, thinking he was imaginary, and got shot for his trouble. It was a very powerful moment. Hell, it would have even worked if Tyrell had turned out to be fake like Elliot believed. It was just a well done scene. Meanwhile, the reveal that Scott was behind all of the phantom Tyrell messages that Joanna was getting wasn't the most satisfying of side reveals, but Joanna's cold reaction, in both furious verbal response (~F**k her and her fetus corpse!~) and then retaliation for getting beaten (she'll have Derek frame Scott for the murder of his own wife) helped complete her reveal as the most vicious character on the entire show. I'm not sure how she'll continue to fit into the story since Tyrell, as it turned out, hadn't been contacting her at all, but she's still become fascinating. The second best scene in this finale, after the Elliot/Tyrell standoff, involved Dom and Darlene, and Dom leading Darlene through the halls -- past rooms of standing, gawking agents -- so that she could show her the big board. The ~Crazy Wall~ that displayed the entire E Corp hack case, complete with pictures, directional arrows, and indications of a criminal hierarchy. Darlene's had a great journey this year as the de facto fsociety leader who was in over her head, so for Dom to play into those insecurities -- while Darlene was trying to play down her own importance -- was a brilliant move. Leaning back into Fight Club, after it already exposed Elliot as an unwitting pawn in his own mind's plan, Mr. Robot gave us the final ingredient here - a massive, pending building explosion and direct orders from Mr. Robot himself to kill anyone who stood in the way of the plan, including Elliot. But Angela's creepy involvement, and the hanging mystery of Whiterose's ultimate scheme, keep this show, and kept this finale, from simmering too much inside Elliot's head. Also, in parting, and as on-the-nose as it came off, it was amusing to hear that one FBI agent talk to Darlene about Burn Notice and then mention ~blue skies~ and ~Characters Welcome~ - throwing a bit of friendly meta-shade at the previously upbeat primetime tone and tagline on USA that Mr. Robot was crucial in saying goodbye to. My micro-complaint is that it took me out of the scene. After a half season of trickery, and Elliot trying to get rid of (or make peace with) Mr. Robot, the story came full circle in the finale when Elliot believed he was being mentally duped when he wasn't. It was a massive miscalculation that got him shot while trying to stop a destructive plan he himself had created. Season 2's finale didn't give us all the answers we craved, but the show, by digging an even bigger conspiracy hole, gave us more of an indication that it knew where everything was headed.", "date": "Sept. 22, 2016"}
