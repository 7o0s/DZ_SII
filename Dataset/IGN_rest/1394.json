However outside of that -- the final few minutes and your choices therein -- Around Every Corner just keeps the narrative moving and fails to be all that memorable. Picking up slightly after the end of Episode 3, Walking Dead Episode 4 finds the survivors in Savannah and ready to make their way to the water in an effort to escape the zombie apocalypse. But, of course, a number of misfortunes befall them and keep them off the waves. As Lee Everett, you play using the tried and true adventure setup and make choices that craft the third-person story as you go. Every episode starts with a simple goal that gets more and more complicated as the chapters roll by, but there's something about Episode 4 that's different than the others. Perhaps it's that Kenny never really drives home what his plan is after we get on the boat with our limited fuel, but the motivation to get on the water never seems all that thought out and only gets muddier as Lee worries about the task at hand. Oddly, the voice on the walkie talkie that developer Telltale Games teased at the end of Episode 3 isn't the focus of Episode 4. Similarly jarring, the episode packs a few odd moments that seem like they're from the ~it was all a dream~ bin; these are things like a sudden search for Clementine that's accompanied by chilling music, a TV conveniently falling on a walker's head, and zombies appearing in a locked-down hallway you were just in. All of this is still spread out among what makes The Walking Dead so much fun. As Lee, we build relationships through the dialogue choices we make and establish ourselves as a compassionate father figure or a badass with a gun. There are more zombies than ever, and the game puts us behind Lee's gun in a first-person perspective to drive home how our bullets save or jeopardize lives. Actions matter more than ever, but the bumps in the road mean that Episode 4 doesn't feel like The Walking Dead: The Game we've been playing. Read previous reviews, and I talk about watching Lee evolve and dealing with these moral dilemmas. I didn't come away from this episode with those memories. There are still choices here and maybe they're not as drastic because I've established my Lee, but none feel as epic as what has come before. Part of this has to be because of the cast. Episode 3 left us with old timers Clementine, Kenny and Ben and filled out the ranks with new faces. Episode 4 doesn't do much to pair Lee with any of the established folks and instead puts Omid's injury as what's slowing us down before introducing even more people. I'm all for expanding the cast, but none of the new folks get all that fleshed out, and regardless of your choices, they aren't around in the end. While Clementine gets some excellent dialogue and a few grown-up moments, the only established person really given the chance for some character-defining Episode 4 choices is Ben, and he sucks. No one's ever been a Ben fan, and the follies that have led to that hate are the core of his story here. But even with the chance to grow and change, he's still bumbles his way through Around Every Corner. Maybe that's to tempt you with darker decisions regarding him, but either way, I felt no sympathy for the teen and thus didn't really care about his story thread. As usual, the vocal performance here is stunning with each actor nailing his or her character (Try not to be depressed when you hear the disappointment in Clementine's voice.), and the comic art style of the game sings with muted colors and a graphic novel feel. Performance is marred by stutters and poor lip syncing, but those technical hiccups remain forgivable. Yes, I didn't feel as connected to the story this time around, but I'm still interested and engaged when I'm playing. I want to know how Lee's tale will play out, and that speaks to how good the overall narrative is. And that's the important thing about The Walking Dead game: the overall narrative. Episode 4 didn't wow me for most of the time I was playing it, but there are touchstone moments in it that are awesome. These are choices and events that will drastically affect what comes in the finale and thus shape the true value of Episode 4. Right now, I can only review on episode by episode basis, but remember that there will be one review for the overall game when these episodes are said and done. Episode 4 might not be packed with game-defining events, but is every chapter of a great book? THE VERDICT I really, really don't want to call The Walking Dead: Episode 4 -- Long Road Ahead a filler episode, but that's what it feels like. The voice on the radio teased at the end of Episode 3 isn't the focus in Episode 4, the boat thread isn't concluded here, and there are a bunch of characters introduced but removed by the time the final credits roll. Will some of those new faces play a crucial role in the finale? Probably, but as of this moment, their disappearance feels unrewarding. Episode 4 is fun, but the events that stand out all come in the final few minutes. The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 2: Starved for Help wasn't what I was expecting. Rather than focus on more walkers and more headshots, the game turns everything around and made me focus on the possible threat of other survivors. It made me focus on who Lee would actually be in this world -- the guy with morals or the guy doing what it takes to get by. I dug that; it's definitely a different experience than the first episode (including its additional technical issues), but that's what I want out of episodic content.", "date": "Oct. 10, 2012,"}
