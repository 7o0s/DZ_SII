On deck, everyone has a role to fill: someone has to steer the hulking bird, man its guns, and make repairs when things catch fire and go to hell. If anyone slacks off or performs their duties haphazardly, everyone dies. But despite some glitches and the occasional frustrations of wrangling inconsistent crewmates, there's a certain undeniable satisfaction that comes from surviving an intense battle with your ship held together by duct tape and chicken wire. Guns of Icarus Online's massive encounters between teams of two to four zeppelin-style airships ships play out across sprawling open-air arenas. Though currently limited to only a handful of different map locations, the mix of post-apocalyptic debris-filled deserts, windy mountaintops, foggy islands, and ocean side vistas are visually stunning battlegrounds. Between the cool steampunk aesthetic of each ship and the harsh but eye-catching environments, the game simply begs for a deeper story to be told about the vibrant world you duke it out in. It's disappointing there isn't one to be found here. Instead, this multiplayer-only affair offers up familiar map-specific modes like deathmatch, king of the hill, control point, and resource race to fight through, but even without a story or adventure mode, orchestrating ship-to-ship combat in first-person view from the deck of huge flying ships does make matches intense and exciting. Work as a team or failure is certain. From sluggish flying fortresses to scrappy little vessels, each of the six different airships you can pick from have their own distinct visual design, deck layout and maneuvering capabilities. Captains can customize the loadouts for different gun stations on their ship with a nice assortment of weaponry ranging from harpoons, flamethrowers, and machineguns to cannons and rocket launchers. Beyond their armament slots, the unique ship designs are a blast to work on and around in battle. You'll climb scaffolding to hop into a gun station, run below deck to make crucial repairs, and even precariously balance along tail rudders to reach engine propellers. Figuring out the location of key systems on each ship and the quickest ways to access them is crucial, and running around to frantically fix damage as you're bombarded by incoming fire delivers a particularly panic-stricken thrill. Duties are broken down into three classes that help better define your role in any given battle. Captains have the hardest job -- flying the airship, scouting for enemies to mark, calling out orders as needed, and maneuvering the ship in battle so gunners can get a good shot from their positions. It's a pressure-cooker role. Being a crappy captain will quickly earn the ire of your crew, possibly spurring them into mutiny. Gunners specialize in pumping rockets, hot lead, and jets of fire into enemies, and they get lots of ammo types to swap out to aid in their task. Engineers wield handy tools like wrenches, hammers, and fire extinguishers to fix and rebuild all the stuff that breaks when you're being bombarded. They're often the busiest in battle, since you have to run around throughout the ship to perform triage and repairs. Each class has its own job to do and is relied upon by teammates to pull their weight. Anyone can hop into a different role in a moment's notice regardless of their class, which gives you flexibility to pick up the extra slack when chaos erupts or another crewmember needs a hand, but you get perks for working within your job description. While the duties of Captains, Gunners, and Engineers are fun in their own right, they're pretty focused and somewhat limited in scope. It doesn't take long to burn through the unique elements of each class, and after a dozen or so matches, you'll wish there was more to content there to give these classes life. Guns of Icarus Online's achievement-based class progression system does provide some added goals to strive for, even if meeting them doesn't earn you much of anything for your troubles. At present, ranking-up in your classes doesn't unlock anything or appear to have a major impact on your character or their abilities. It's a key ingredient that's missing, and it does put a damper on some of the enjoyment that comes from busting your backside to complete challenges. Even with varying objectives, most of the multiplayer game types are very similar, and the small selection of map locations, though well-crafted and visually distinct, makes the scope of content seem narrower. Fire in the sky. While Guns of Icarus Online does a tremendous job of capturing the excitement of crewing an airship in explosive combat high above the clouds, its rough edges add up to make it feel like a work-in-progress more than a finished game. Visual bugs and glitches abound -- you'll fall through the ship floor at times, spawn inside other players and solid elements, and get caught floating in midair as you ship sails away when matches end. These awkward moments are jarring, given how beautiful and polished the game looks otherwise. Without a proper tutorial to explain how gameplay and systems work, getting acclimated to the different roles is confusing from the get-go. It's encouraging to hear developer Muse Games is actively working to improve the game and add more content to make Guns of Icarus Online a better, more expansive experience. What's here is fun, but there's still a long way to go before it reaches its full potential. In the meantime, it's worth sticking it out to see where the studio takes it next. THE VERDICT Guns of Icarus Online scratches a certain itch that few other games can reach. Blasting enemy airships out of the sky while racing around to help your crew keep its own flying vessel from rattling apart feels unique, thanks to stellar ship designs, realistic-looking environments, and the importance of being a well-oiled cog in a greater machine. There's no striking it out on your own here. It's a very different, very refreshing kind of co-op experience. But despite its visual beauty and impressive execution, limited gameplay and general bugginess hold everything back. This beast has room to grow. When it does, expect great things. For now, a little turbulence makes for a bumpy ride.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2012,"}
