But Peril on Gorgon is a fairly big chunk of side-adventure that took me about eight hours to play through, making it well worth coming back and reacquainting myself for. Its not terrifically ambitious as far as gameplay goes, but it falls squarely into the more of a good thing category. Within the first hour or so youre sensationally presented with a mystery clutched in the hand of a severed human arm, and soon after the story drops a shocking revelation about Spacers Choice and its drug-pushing pharmaceutical research operation (which Firefly fans might be less surprised about). That quest takes place mostly on the mountainous, industrial asteroid base of Gorgon, but also sends you on quests to other new locations around the Hyperion system. Theres the largely abandoned and creepy Ambrose Manor, an orbital research facility, an exclusive club on Byzantium, and a mercenary ship, and all of those settings keep Peril on Gorgon from feeling one-note. Its not really a mystery, of course  more like an extended series of quests to find the journal of the facilitys lead scientist, at which point the shadowy figure who dogs you the whole way reveals themselves without any actual sleuthing on your part. But overall, its a decent story with a handful of intriguing characters, starting with the enigmatic heiress Minna Ambrose who hires you for this job, and its dressed up in some fun private eye trappings. I cant say I was floored by the main reveal, but theres a clever spin on it that raised my eyebrows and enhanced the delivery to make it a little more memorable. And in the end you get to make one of Obsidians trademark morally gray decisions to determine how it all turns out  though naturally it doesnt have an impact on the main story. You decide whether your character is the type who'd execute a Nazi-level monster on sight.Well, I say that its a fun story, and its mostly delivered with the same dark satirical tone as the rest of The Outer Worlds, but your companion characters treat the war crime-level atrocities you uncover with the seriousness they deserve. That doesnt always mesh well with the grim comedy of the rest of the story, but it does lend it a fair amount of gravity when, for example, you decide whether or not your character is the type who would execute a Nazi-level monster on sight. I played largely with Parvati and Nyoka at my side, and if theyre any indication, each one has a good amount of spontaneous commentary with full voice acting. That makes Peril on Gorgon feel every bit up to the level of the main game in terms of fully voiced, well-acted characters. There's quite a bit of reading to do. Too much, sometimes.That said, theres also quite a bit of reading to do. Too much, sometimes. One character jokes that there are enough logs and messages scattered around Gorgon to fill a book, and that doesnt feel like much of an exaggeration. Every so often youll run across a terminal with logs, incoming messages, outgoing messages, and archived messages, each of which has multiple entries to page through. Most of them are pretty entertaining tales of corporate malfeasance, but if you want the full story then it can be a lot to get through all at once. Exploration is rewarding thanks to lots of attention to detail and environmental storytelling, like when you find a character you were sent to track down alongside his journal or a headless marauder lying next to a neck-high tripwire trap. In keeping with Gorgons role as a pharmaceutical research lab, the sheer amount of drugs you come across is astonishing  there are piles of syringes everywhere. I was a little disappointed that, given the test lab setting, I was never pushed into a situation where I felt tempted or pushed to use a drug with negative side effects myself. Run-of-the-mill enemies certainly didnt do it, and neither did the story, which seems like a missed opportunity. Nothing is really added to The Outer World's adequate combat.Nothing is really added to The Outer Worlds adequate combat  youll fight marauders, psychotic test subjects (basically identical to marauders), space pirates (basically identical to marauders), robots and, of course, primals. Peril on Gorgon is very much more of the same in this department, though I did find a couple of unique weapons, including one science weapon that fills an entirely different role than any other weapon in The Outer Worlds, and one that was just a goofy looking melee weapon. It took me around eight hours to complete the main missions and the two big side quest chains, which were mostly a series of amusing but simple fetch quests. Its a decent amount of content to come back to The Outer Worlds for, and if youre playing for the first time it extends the length of a full playthrough to around 40 hours, fleshing out this relatively lean RPG quite a bit. The Outer Worlds Peril on Gorgon DLC is mechanically unambitious in that it doesnt introduce any new ideas to change up gameplay, but it does take the crew of the Unreliable to several new locations around the Hyperion system as it unveils a fairly lengthy and entertaining detective story.", "date": "Sept. 9, 2020,"}
