In Someday Youll Return, youll undergo a desperate search of the Czech Republics Moravian forest  alone, on foot, and struggling to maintain a hold of your own sanity. Yet what will really test your resolve will be the stop-start stealth sections, half-baked game mechanics, and uneven puzzle design youre forced to suffer along the way. This supernatural nature walk could have been a compelling cross between Firewatch and Silent Hill, but Someday Youll Return lacks the sharp writing and engaging performances of the former, and cant pull off the scares of the latter. It certainly gets off to a decent start, though, and I enjoyed hiking around Someday Youll Returns woodland setting for the first few hours. The absence of objective markers on the HUD means that navigating between landmarks and campsites is entirely based around studying maps and observing the colour-coded trail markers in order to get from A to B, which felt true to my real life experiences of orienteering through nature. The downside of this realistic approach to Someday Youll Returns wayfinding is that its very easy to get lost, particularly when the environment becomes foggy, or day turns to night, or it just hasnt been made clear where youre supposed to be heading to next  all things that happen with some regularity. Its not just Someday Youll Return; its more like every other moment youll return  up and back the same paths and trails, past the same rock and tree assets, circling and zigzagging your way to where you hope youre supposed to be going. Any tension and suspense built up by the plot is all too frequently dissipated by such monotonous retreading. Missing Persons Playing as increasingly distraught father Daniel, youre on your own for large stretches of time in Someday Youll Return, and much of the context for the events that unfold is provided through Daniels interactions with other characters on his phone or his constant monologuing. This is a bit of a shame, since the actor who plays Daniel has a more erratic method of delivery than a paperboy on a broken bike. Still, the search for Daniels daughter Stela maintains a reasonable level of intrigue through to Someday Youll Returns conclusion, with countless notes, journal pages and other texts to find scattered throughout the world to gradually help you piece together whats really going on. I particularly enjoyed the occasions these scraps of writing formed the basis of a puzzle, such as the scavenger hunt list found in a major campsite area which demanded that I carefully follow its detailed step-by-step instructions in order to uncover a series of hidden page fragments that assembled into an encoded message, before studying a cipher in order to solve it. Unfortunately the bulk of Someday Youll Returns puzzles are not nearly as cerebral, and too often rely on point-and-click adventure-style pixel hunting or other genre cliches like lazily turning pipe valves to progress through. Considering its 15-hour length, Someday Youll Return would likely have benefitted from having the bulk of its more basic brain teasers trimmed. Considering its 15-hour length, Someday You'll Return would likely have benefitted from having the bulk of its more basic brain teasers trimmed.Someday Youll Returns stealth sections seem similarly dispensable. As his search moves from abandoned camping grounds to more sinister subterranean settings and his grip on reality loosens, Daniels surroundings will at times devolve into a nightmarish hellscape, with zombie-like sentries patrolling the area that can stun you with a piercing scream before transforming into spider-like monsters in order to finish you off. Youre given no means to combat them with, so instead you just slowly crouch-walk your way through these sections trying to avoid an instant death. These sections arent in any way frightening, just frustrating, since even after youre given an enemy-slowing stasis totem youre still liable to be stunned and kicked back to a checkpoint by an unseen enemy offscreen. Someday Youll Return does a commendable job of creating unease with more subtle tricks like whispering voices and creepy dolls placed in its environment, but when it goes all-in with the horror it becomes exhausting rather than exhilarating. Its not just Stela who goes missing, but also a number of Someday Youll Returns game mechanics. A number of elements are introduced, used once or twice, and then largely forgotten. You can brew your own potions by scouring the landscape for various kinds of flowers and herbs, preparing them using a cutting board and mortar and pestle, and then following specific recipe steps. However, despite the fact that theres always an abundance of plants to pick all across the map, only one or two out of a half-dozen of these potions are ever really necessary, and even then its only when their use is explicitly spelled out for you. For example, you might need to brew the Calm Mind potion to quell Daniels vertigo in order for him to cross a rope bridge between you and your destination, because thats literally the only way for you to progress. Daniel can also craft or repair items with his tool kit but, again, this is an ability thats only ever called on in very specific and obvious circumstances  like when youre presented with a ladder with missing rungs in the vicinity of a few pieces of rung-sized wood  which robs the construction gameplay of any sense of agency or invention. Someday Youll Returns central mystery is an intriguing one so its a shame that the plodding stealth sections, superficial crafting elements, and incessant backtracking muddy its allure. Someday Youll Return is just barely worth the effort the first time, let alone a game you might actually consider coming back to.", "date": "May 5, 2020, 6"}
