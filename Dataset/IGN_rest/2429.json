Without his suppressive fire obliterating any aliens who dared to proceed down the long corridor from their main spawn point, the nasties were able to pick my battle brothers apart one by one, the defensive position collapsing like a house of cards. My plan had almost worked beautifully. Just like this game. Tactics isnt the first video game adaptation of the asymmetrical, turn-based board game that pits slow Space Marines packing potent firepower against swift and deadly Genestealers who excel in melee combat  but it is the slickest-looking. The terrain is detailed and readable. Each creeping alien and hulking suit of power armor is adorned with small touches that help them pop. And whether youre storming the corridors of a ramshackle ork vessel or an abandoned, eerily pristine Eldar frigate, theres plenty of cool stuff to look at and blast into a million pieces in a panic to kill the oncoming swarm. Mechanically, everything about the tactical experience is expertly balanced and nurturing to creative tactics and hectic long-shots. Similar to XCOM, deciding how to break up limited action points between movement, adjusting your facing, taking shots, and covering approaches with overwatch, is the key and most interesting challenge. Advancing quickly with your Space Marines can keep you ahead of the mission timer or save an ally in a tricky spot, but it exposes you to vicious counterattacks that could cost the entire mission. If youre too conservative, though, you risk getting surrounded and overwhelmed or not getting to the objective in time. The tension is a constant ebb and flow that rewards you with cathartic moments of relief when a careful plan or desperate gambit pays off. Power cards can offer potent, short-term bonuses, or be exchanged for extra movement points (as the Space Marines) or spawn tokens (as the Genestealers), often a thought-provoking dilemma. It's apparent Space Hulk: Tactics was designed for a gamepad and had some sub-par mouse controls slapped on after the fact. When playing as the Genestealers, the atmosphere is turned on its head. You always have the upper hand in terms of information and freedom of movement, but youre also forced to be cagey and deceptive as a frontal assault is more than likely to fail. It feels a bit less shirt-wringing, but also more fun. Finding the chink in the armor of a Space Marine formation that would allow me to isolate the metal-clad crusaders and skewer them one by one rarely got old. And the ability to draw your enemies out of position with decoy units lets you engage in some delightful psychological warfare. I just wish it controlled a bit better. Id much prefer to be using a mouse and keyboard in this type of game, but it seems really apparent Space Hulk: Tactics was designed for a gamepad and had some sub-par mouse controls slapped on after the fact. I had to choose between trying to play it like a PC strategy game and having my clicks often not register or trigger something unintended, or pick up my Xbox controller and deal with the hassle of, for instance, having to use the buttons to manually cycle through all of my units instead of simply clicking to select them. Mouse scrolling doesnt work very well either, and stops working at all in some cases, like when youre trying to choose a target for a power card. Theres also an option to play in first-person mode for the Space Marines, in which you use WASD or the control stick to move one square at a time. It really allows you to become immersed in the spooky, foreboding setting of the space hulk, but is generally pretty terrible from a gameplay standpoint. Certain actions, like the often useful diagonal move, cant be easily executed in first-person, and it deprives you of the battlefield overview so crucial to planning out your next decision. This limited it to being mostly a novelty  something I would jump into every once in a while just for a quick hit of eye candy  rather than a legitimate, alternate way of playing. The Space Marine campaign's story presents the typical grimdark, far future melodrama of the 40K universe in all its cheesy glory. Aside from skirmish and ranked match modes that work pretty much as one would expect, there are single-player campaigns for each faction. The Space Marines get 13 missions across a dynamic map with events, dilemmas, and collectible loot. The story is nothing to write home to Terra about, but presents the typical grimdark, far future melodrama of the 40K universe in all its cheesy glory. The nine-mission Genestealer campaign, by comparison, feels like a bit of an afterthought, with not much in the way of campaign mechanics to speak of other than a couple opportunities to decide between one of two approaches to a specific mission. Throughout the campaign, both factions have the ability to unlock new unit types, abilities, power cards, and specialized gear (for the Space Marines). This helps add some personality to distinguish between, for example, the heavy weapons guy whos really good with an autocannon and the one whos really good with a flamethrower. I did find myself wishing they had a little more personality in the context of the story, though. Other than the tormented Sergeant Tahariel and his Librarian, Hagios, none of my boys in red got much of a backstory or specific mission dialogue to help them seem like real people. Theres also a full-featured mission editor with a surprising amount of customization available. You have full control over map layout, positioning of spawn points, and objectives for each team. You can even apply special rules, like preventing genestealers from spawning on the first turn or reducing the starting Psy points (basically mana) for a Space Marine Librarian to create really interesting match-ups. And its very easy to use compared to some of the in-mission controls. Its one of the best editors Ive seen in a game of this type in a while. As a tactics game, the challenge and depth of Space Hulk Tactics is spot-on. The characters and levels look great. Each unit type has plenty of cool abilities to create vast possibilities for approaching a problem. Every map is laid out in such a way as to force both teams to constantly make interesting decisions. The Space Marine campaign has some really cool ideas that help it not feel like youre just hitting Next Mission over and over. Its just a bummer that the controls get in the way of me being able to truly dive in and enjoy it, like having to eat a really nice Thanksgiving pie with just a spatula.", "date": "Oct. 12, 2018,"}
