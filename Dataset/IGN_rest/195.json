Yakuza Kiwami is a trip back to Kiryus first adventure, complete with all-new visuals, a restored Japanese dub, and gameplay enhancements that bring it nearly up to the level of more recent Yakuza games. While its a great way to re-experience how the Yakuza saga began, Yakuza Kiwami also showcases just how much the Yakuza series has improved since that original outing. While the riveting crime drama story of Kazuma Kiryu emerging from a prison stint after taking the fall for a friend remains the same as the original Yakuza, the details on the character models and backgrounds have been completely reworked to look on par with other Yakuza games on the PS4. That gives Kiwami a cinematic feel that helped me get into the twists and turns of its betrayals and action. The graphical upgrade also helps Kamurocho feel more vibrant and alive as a recreation of a bustling Japanese nightlife area, Tokyos neon-lit Kamurocho, and is packed with attention to detail (including real-life brands and stores). The distinct feel of the Japanese setting is one of the most appealing parts of the Yakuza series, and Kiwami continues to nail it. Gameplay has seen a substantial improvement as well. Instead of the clunky-feeling combat in the original we get something much more like the recent Yakuza 0, where Kiryu can use several different fighting styles and earn upgrades to boost his power and learn new moves. Kiryus brutal beatdowns feel like the kind of raw, unrefined fighting you would associate with a criminal underworld. While three of Kiryus selectable fighting styles  Brawler, Rush, and Beast  carry over from Yakuza 0, Kiwami does drop the ball in teaching you how the styles differ and how theyre best used. In contrast, Yakuza 0 went to great lengths to teach the ins and outs of each fighting style, helping you grow acquainted to combat more thoroughly. You'll encounter the lovably weird Goro Majima.Besides combat, exploration and character interactions have also seen an overhaul. Fighting randomly encountered enemies as you explore Kamurochos back alleys is seamless, and when you see innocent people in need you can intervene to help them out for rewards. And sometimes, when you least expect it, youll encounter the lovably weird Goro Majima, whos determined to help Kiryu re-learn all the fighting prowess he lost while imprisoned by using the strangest means possible. Fan-favorite sidequests like visiting hostess clubs, chilling at the batting range, and belting out songs at karaoke make their return alongside some new activities. The oddest is a bizarre female wrestling game like the one seen in Yakuza 0  only this time, its framed as a spinoff of an actual Japanese Sega arcade game about fighting insects. Yeah, Im a little puzzled by it, but its this kind of offbeat weirdness alongside high drama that gives the Yakuza series its distinct charm. Youll see plenty of other peculiar people and bizarre situations across Kiwamis sidestories, though compared to some of the strange scenarios in Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 0 they seem a bit tame. Even with new additions, however, Yakuza Kiwami feels especially light on content compared to recent series games like Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 0, which can run more than 70 hours. The main story is around a third that long, and most of the side stories are easy to clear. That does explain why Sega is selling Kiwami at a lower price than usual. The first couple hours of are not great.A much bigger problem with Yakuza Kiwami is that Sega passed up a crucial opportunity to improve the overall flow by trimming out and refining parts that never worked well. Honestly, the first couple hours of are not great: they involve an obnoxious fetch quest to retrieve a ring and a tedious stealth sequence infiltrating a funeral. Only after slogging your way through these are you able to see the first of several lengthy, fun action sequences and have the whole of Kamurocho open up to your exploration. The structure of Yakuza Kiwamis story also has some pretty significant flaws. Time jumps and flashbacks out of nowhere make following certain story threads confusing, and there are points where the main plot gets frustratingly sidetracked just as things are getting interesting and it focuses instead on side characters. The fact that there are some entirely new story cutscenes added in  some of which make this problem worse  leaves me wondering why Sega didnt do a more dramatic revamp to bring the flow more in line with the modern Yakuza games, which put a lot of similar character development into the optional substories instead. Yakuza Kiwami makes great strides in updating the classic original Yakuza game to modern standards. But while it adds better combat, bizarrely charming side quests, and a gorgeous graphical revamp, it also ignores some of the originals biggest problems in pacing and storytelling. And because of its relatively short length, Yakuza Kiwamis fun trip through the tangled web of Japans criminal underground feels like a prelude to something bigger and better to come.", "date": "Aug. 21, 2017,"}
