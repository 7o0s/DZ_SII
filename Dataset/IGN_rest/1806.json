Without fail, each time I played a new course a Pokmon would appear out of nowhere, or do something cute, or react to something I did in a surprising way, and I (this is not an exaggeration) would sit up on the couch, point at the screen, and go ~Aaah!~ in delight. I love the way The Pokmon Company has, in recent years, begun letting more companies outside Game Freak (think Niantic with Pokmon Go, or Legendary Pictures with Detective Pikachu) make media that shows off Pokmon not as collectibles or as static RPG party members but as lovable, intelligent creatures. After successfully digging into their combat prowess in Pokken Tournament, Bandai Namco has been handed the far more peaceful reigns of an on-rails nature photography game and charged with portraying Pokmon as wild creatures in living ecosystems to be observed, befriended, and only ~captured~ via camera. Given the timbre of my happy yells every time a Wooper said ~Woooh!~ at me, if my neighbors had known what I was doing they'd probably agree that New Pokmon Snap is a delightful success on this front. Despite its flaws, I was a big fan of the original Pokmon Snap on Nintendo 64 back in 1999. The classic on-rails photography game had a very fun premise, sending you on a nature safari to try and get the best photos possible of Pokmon living and interacting in their natural habitats. Though the idea was sound and many of Pokmon Snap's best moments are still memorable to this day (the Jigglypuff concert! Charizard popping out of the lava pool! Surfing Pikachu!), it was painfully short, with only just over 60 Pokmon available across seven courses that were precisely the same every single time. Even with the meat of trying to solve a few puzzles to line up some rarer shots, 1999's Pokmon Snap inevitably left me wishing for so much more. If ~Pokmon Snap, but more~ were the baseline for New Pokmon Snap being any good, it would handily clear that simple bar.22 years later, I had a real fear that New Pokmon Snap would end up similarly repetitive or limited in either sheer Pokmon numbers or in course availability. But I am happy to report this was a non-issue: If ~Pokmon Snap, but more~ were the baseline for New Pokmon Snap being any good, it would handily clear that simple bar with far more courses, available Pokmon, and possible photos than its decades-old parent managed. It even has more (in a sense) of what made old-school Pokmon Snap's final course, Rainbow Cloud, so special  though I can't say more about it here due to Nintendo being overly precious about that part. New Pokmon Snap also has far more story to drive it along, with a Pokmon professor named Mirror and his crew of research assistants trying to solve yet another Pokmon mystery, though overall its a fairly forgettable progression tool. You'll visit a sparkling beach, a dense jungle, a desert, underwater caverns, and several more locations, all of which look better than I've seen any Pokmon game look yet  beauty which comes at the cost of some occasional frustrating framerate dips when it pushes the Switch beyond its comfort zone. These are most noticeable in one stage in particular, when an absolutely massive Wailord slowly breaches the ocean surface and briefly slows everything to a crawl. Lighting Up the Room You'll start your photo expedition with nothing but your camera, but you'll quickly unlock a set of tools that will enable you to take better photos: edible fluffruit, glowing illumina orbs, a music player, a scanning feature that will sometimes spark unique reactions, and an accelerator that you can use to catch up with fast Pokmon. You'll find plenty of use for all of these, but of the entire toolkit the illumina orbs are perhaps the most surprising. Their most obvious use is to activate crystabloom flowers that can attract Pokmon or even trigger changes in a course, you can also just throw them right at Pokmon to make them glow. A lot of Pokmon won't really react to being hit with these orbs beyond glowing, but don't get discouraged. A handful of Pokmon will have huge, surprising reactions to being hit. Try one on the Tangrowth at the start of the Park course at night for one of my favorite examples, and have your camera ready the second it hits. Most of the Pokmon manage to look very good without melting your Switch in your hands though, and for the most part will react in interesting ways to just about anything you (literally or figuratively) throw at them, be it fruit, glowing Illumina Orbs, or a catchy tune. It's easy to view being on-rails as a limitation, but in New Pokmon Snap it's apparent that keeping your own interactions with the world a bit more limited than in something like a typical Pokmon RPG has freed Bandai Namco up to make the many different things the Pokmon themselves do far more varied, detailed, and enjoyable to watch. New Pokmon Snap gracefully avoids Pokmon Snap's problem of repeating the exact same courses ad infinitum in several ways. Most courses get both day and night versions, with each variation including more than enough distinct Pokmon and interactions to merit the duplication. Many courses also hide branching pathways, some obvious and some hidden, that let you get better views on certain monsters or discover new ones entirely. Trust is earned and your Research Level increases.Most interesting though are the multiple ~Research Levels'' that govern how comfortable the creatures on any given course are with you, and thus how varied their interactions with you and one another will be. For example, there's a brief (albeit hard to miss) appearance by a Grookey and a Pichu at the very start of the first stage you visit. They run into the middle of the road, spot you  a human being in a big ol' technology pod  and immediately bolt. You'll catch glimpses of them here and there throughout the rest of that nature park level, but they're shy and elusive to start. You have to be quick and accurate to get a good photo of them early on, which is where the challenge offered by New Pokmon Snap often lies. But after repeated visits to the park and numerous well-scored photos, trust is earned and your Research Level increases. Eventually, rather than scurry off any time you appear, Grookey and Pichu will greet you the moment they see you, waiting around and cheering at you long enough for you to snap adorable photos of the pair at a more leisurely pace. They'll chase you playfully through the level, introduce you to their buddy Scorbunny, and pose repeatedly so you can get a really good shot for your Photodex. This gradual storytelling that occurred as I visited courses over and over again is the greatest unexpected joy of New Pokmon Snap. It allows Bandai Namco to tell little visual stories and pepper them throughout each level, such as a colony of Bidoof slowly building a dam I can eventually cross in my little photo-taking pod, or solving the mystery of what Pokmon keeps leaving charred fruit sitting around. Good as all this was, by the end of New Pokmon Snap  which I reached after about 15 hours  I greedily wanted there to be even more to these observable plotlines and was disappointed when grinding to finish Research Level 3 didn't magically throw me into a course overflowing with exciting new Pokmon and interactions. All I got was an achievement. I greedily wanted there to be even more to these observable plotlines and was disappointed after finishing Research Level 3.A somewhat clunky sidequest system helps you reach the resolutions of the more puzzling of these staged stories by having NPCs request you look into certain locations or Pokmon for rare or hidden photo opps. The hints themselves were useful and helped me discover a number of genuinely cool shots I may have otherwise missed. But actually finishing the quests could be annoyingly precise  I'd often feel confident I had gotten the photo it was asking for but didnt receive credit because the timing was slightly off of what some unspecified rule demanded. The rewards are hit or miss too; sometimes youll get cool new photo editing tools like filters, stickers, or frames, but other times youll get nothing beyond the satisfaction of completion. It's in a handful of photo-taking-adjacent systems like these that New Pokmon Snap trips over itself a bit. One example is in its tutorials, which serve to over-explain simple mechanics and progression early on, while a notable segment later fails to give an essential detail about what the player ought to be doing next. Another irritating example is the ~star~ rating included in photo scoring, which both serves to indicate how rare the moment you snapped a photo of actually was, while also providing four slots per Pokmon to fill in the PhotoDex. But there's sometimes no apparent rhyme or reason to which photos get unique four-star ratings and which don't. Somewhat frequently, I would discover what I believed to be an amazing, exciting interaction in a level and managed to get a photo I was proud of, only to find that jerk Professor Mirror didn't recognize what I'd snapped as anything different than the Pokmon's everyday, default activity. Meanwhile, I have multiple Pokmon PhotoDex pages filled with photos that, to my eye, are almost indistinguishable, yet they all have different star ratings. It's ultimately not a massive issue, as I can still save any cool shots I get to my album and show off my discoveries, but Mirror's lack of recognition and unclear standards often deflated my excitement a bit at finding something I thought was rare. There are plenty of unlockable filters, frames, and stickers to turn cool photo moments into silly, shareable snaps.Where New Pokmon Snap gets its addendums right is how it takes cues from modern photography and photo editing (remember, the original came out before digital photography was really a thing). There are plenty of unlockable filters, frames, and stickers to turn cool photo moments into silly, shareable snaps. Turns out, it is very fun to put silly hats and glasses and bow ties on Pokmon! The Re-Snap feature in particular is a great addition that lets you go back and adjust a shot in the moment, in case you were just a little bit off or out of focus. It's not a perfect do-over button (which is probably for the best), but rather a way to make small adjustments to the second a photo was taken so you're not left frustrated that something wasn't just so. Also, while the online features were only just enabled yesterday, their mere existence is an essential function and I'm already enjoying some of the cool snaps my fellow reviewers have shared while decking out my own profile with my favorites. Fun as these are, the most memorable bits of New Pokmon Snap lie squarely in its photo-taking core. This is especially true of the best moments with Pokmon who do not often get the spotlight in other games, like the Bouffalant I saw wearing a flower crown, or the horrifying time Pinsir's teeth stuck out of its mouth, or when I learned exactly how a Stunfisk eats a piece of fruit. Even right now as I'm writing this, I'm puzzling in my head over how to interact with a particular area in one of the later stages that surely, surely must hide some very cool moment, if I could only tease out the right combination of fruit and orbs and music and Pokmon and timing to find it. Having told myself when I started that I wouldn't try too hard to fill my entire PhotoDex if it didn't happen organically, New Pokmon Snap has me feeling a bit like a kid again  eager to catch 'em all. After a 22-year gap, New Pokmon Snap is a successful modern reinvention of all the best ideas of Pokmon Snap, with more courses, more Pokmon, and more reasons to revisit familiar spots in pursuit of the perfect shot. Some of its supportive systems, like its photo scoring and tutorials, can drag down momentum or even frustrate at times. But at the end of the day, some artificial grade is utterly secondary to the clever environmental storytelling youll experience as you level up courses, the fun of discovering surprising photo opps, and the sheer joy of observing a moving ecosystem of believable, personable, and lovable Pokmon.", "date": "April 28, 2021"}
