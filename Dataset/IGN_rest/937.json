The first episode of Telltales six-part Game of Thrones game represents that cruel reality explicitly; in two hours of dialogue decisions made with the knowledge that being good and noble might mean the downfall of House Forrester and the original characters you control, it sets up great anticipation for future episodes and delivers a strong ending of its own. First, a warning: definitely do not approach this game as a way to introduce yourself to Game of Thrones. Its made for existing fans, in that it requires a good amount of knowledge of the story, and it begins with a massive spoiler for anyone who hasnt seen the first three seasons or read through the third A Song of Ice and Fire book, A Storm of Swords. For that matter, youre best off skipping this review until youve gotten that far in, since the entire story revolves around fallout from those events. The game mimics the structure of the show (and the books) by jumping between the perspectives of three characters: Garred Tuttle, squire to Lord Forrester; Ethan Forrester, who must step up to rule the Forrester seat of Ironrath in his fathers absence; and Mira Forrester, Ethans older sister and handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell in Kings Landing. Each of them has their own distinct role to play in attempting to salvage House Forresters future, and each maintains the pace with a few difficult decisions to make. Garreds scenes involve a lot of simple, straightforward quick-time event-style action. Its not challenging, but it breaks up the dialogue with brutal bloodshed, and it sets a tone that raises the stakes of the diplomacy that follows. His decisions of whether to try to save everyone or sacrifice them for the greater good are tense, thanks to the ticking clock that adds urgency to almost every dialogue choice, but typical. His bigger quest is to deliver a secret only to certain ears, which is a bit silly because youre never given a reason to want to divulge it. You have to deliberately choose to fail. (And yes, I went back and replayed just to see what would happen if I haphazardly blurted it out at every opportunity.) Scenes from Ethans perspective are some of the strongest. His heated negotiations with the lord of a rival house, while receiving guidance from his advisors, are especially well written and acted. Later, the decision of which of his advisors to elevate above the others also carries weight - not because it has any major impact on this episode, but for the implications for the future aggressive or diplomatic stance of the house. And we get the opportunity to establish our version of Ethan as a harsh or lenient lord. Miras scenes in the capital city of Kings Landing are a good change of setting from the grays and browns of Ironrath, and playing her small part in the power struggle between Margaery and Cersei adds another layer of intrigue to the plot. Choosing just how much to ask of Margaery and how far to bend to appease Cersei  and whether to trust offers of help  are some of the most interesting from the big-picture perspective. Across the board, acting is up to the high standards Telltale has set with its past games. Plus, all the characters from the show who appear - Margaery Tyrell, Queen Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, and Ramsay Snow  are authentically voiced by their TV actors, and the likenesses are good enough that details like Cerseis signature lopsided sneer and slightly raised eyebrow come through. Those portrayals are undermined slightly by occasionally glitchy animations, with characters or limbs sometimes warping into place or briefly vanishing. And while the painterly art style generally looks quite good, the brushstroke effect on backgrounds can be distracting when the camera moves and causes the strokes to shimmer around. Its important to note that most choices in Episode 1 have little or no significant impact within this two-hour section of the story. In fairness, its an episode that positions itself as a prologue, concluding with Your story begins, so much of what makes this a great start for the series is the promises it makes  or implies  for whats to come. It caps off with a powerful and shocking ending that reminds us both of the kind of harsh world were in, and also that the major events of this story are going to be beyond our control. Pros Original charactersGood writingBig implicationsGreat ending Cons Glitchy animations Tough decisions, well-acted original characters in interesting situations, and a strong, provocative ending kick off Telltales new Game of Thrones series in a great way. Its nature as a side-story to the HBO show means we wont get to decide the fate of Westeros, but this introduction is convincing evidence that the future of House Forrester puts enough at stake to make choices matter.", "date": "Dec. 2, 2014,"}
