The only one who can put things right is your custom-made character, with some help from some old-school Sonics. The premise behind Sonic Forces sounds like an amazing mix for a Sonic game, but its inconsistent level design and overall inability to capitalize on its potential leaves it just a few steps short. The character creation is a huge selling point and one of Sonic Forces best features, and it feels great to be able to live out a childhood Sega fan dream of making your own Sonic character. You pick their species, customize their look, and dress them up in all kinds of fashion, from stylish (swanky Sega-themed gear, slick shades, and sporty shoes) to downright odd (clown wigs, shutter shades, and wrestling belts), unlocking more as you play. Seeing your creation do wild stunts alongside Sonic, doing fistbumps and taking down some rampaging robots, is a whole heap of fun. There are three types of stages in Forces, all of which have great visual design (take a moment to check out some of the crazy Eggman mechs rampaging through the backgrounds) and are set to a stellar soundtrack that combines Sonic remixes, 16-bit throwbacks (see how many common Genesis instrument samples you can hear), and cheesy late-90s pop-rock. If you're coming off of Sonic Mania the physics will take some getting used to.Modern and Classic Sonic stage types have you controlling those respective versions of Sonic, using their distinct playstyles to run through a mix of 2D and 3D levels. If youre coming off of Sonic Mania, as I was, the physics here will take a bit of getting used to, as they dont feel anywhere near as smooth  Classic Sonic, in particular, feels odd, as he speeds up a lot faster than in the old Genesis games but doesnt get strong momentum when running up hills. Modern Sonics stages are generally more linear and focused on high-speed boosting through whenever the opportunity arises, while Classic Sonics levels offer more in the way of branching paths and alternate routes. Both types can be fun, though the overall lack of speed in Classic Sonics stages compared to Modern Sonics feels a bit odd. The third type of stage has you controlling your custom character with a unique playstyle based around a special gun called a Wispon that harnesses different kinds of wisp energy. Lightning, for instance, gives you a supercharged electric whip and lets you zoom through strings of rings and enemies when powered up, while the drill sends you charging in a straight line to attack and lets you burrow into the ground. The Wispons you equip can greatly affect the way you go through stages, and its fun to go back to previous levels to find hidden secrets and earn more gear by using a new loadout to access hidden routes. All three stage types have a persistent Sonic problem: they dont do a great job of foreshadowing danger, so when youre moving at high speed through hazard-laden stages youre going to find yourself taking hits or falling into pits you couldnt possibly have reacted to. Its nowhere near as unfair as in games like the notorious Sonic 2006, at least, but it definitely doesnt go out of its way to avoid these unfair-feeling traps. Overall, the stages feel inconsistent: youll have a few fun runs with a lot of cool gimmicks like high-speed rail chases and sliding down a giant tube of water followed by one with a focus on finicky platforming and bad hazards. One thing they do have in common, though, is that all of the stages are on the shorter side (relative to most Sonic games) and theres no limited number of lives to worry about, so a lousy death due to questionable design every so often is a lot less rage-inducing than it could be  plus, it makes the stages easier to go back and replay to try and earn loot. But the short levels have a downside: a lot of potential for interesting stage design goes unrealized because everythings over so fast. Classic Sonic suffers the most: his presence in Forces seems like an afterthought since he appears in only a handful of levels that are over far too quickly. Amazingly, the boss battles are actually quite good.Amazingly, the boss battles are actually quite good in Forces, which is surprising because Sonic boss fights tend to be a fairly weak element. Theyre challenging but not overly long, and feature some stunning backdrops like a reality-bending battle with new foe Infinite among the winding coils of a giant snake. The problem is that there simply arent enough of them, and most of them are over way too fast, limiting their impact. That lack of meaningful climactic moments part of the overall problem: throughout the story, Forces feels like its ramping up to become something amazing, suggesting an epic battle between Sonics friends and Eggmans army. But both the story and the gameplay just wind up fizzling out towards the end of the five- or six-hour campaign. Heck, you dont even get to fight some of Sonics old rivals that you see introduced early on. That feels like a real bait and switch. After youre done with the main game you can replay levels to improve your scores and times, rescue other players avatars in previously beaten stages through SOS missions to earn you gear and weapons, and unlock a handful of hidden (and quite short) challenge stages, but it still feels like theres a fair bit of wasted potential. More levels and more big, exciting boss fights would have gone a long way. On top of the joy of creating and playing as your own character, theres a lot of goofy charm that makes Sonic Forces hard to be too disappointed with. The graphics are colorful and engaging, and the music is a pumping backdrop for extreme team-ups, super-speed cinematics, and lots of ruminations on the power of friendship. There are some really fun levels in the mix, too, and surprisingly strong boss fights make for some unexpected highlights. But Sonic Forces doesnt build on its handful of good ideas as much as it should, and it screeches to a halt just as it seems to hit its stride.", "date": "Nov. 11, 2017,"}
