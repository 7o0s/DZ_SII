{"name": "Trials Evolution", "name_review": "Trials Evolution Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/trials-evolution/56872/review/trials-evolution-review", "text": "Trials HD is one of the top five best-selling games on Xbox Live Arcade, has moved over two million copies, and was voted Best Arcade Game of 2009 by the Xbox 360 community. That's a hard act to follow, but Trials Evolution does a lot more than just follow its predecessor. By all accounts, this is the bigger, better game. Trials is a motorcycle stunt game that uses a complex, exaggerated physics system to send players careening over wild obstacle courses. You must finish each track as quickly as you can with as few faults as possible, but the devilish developers atRedLynx have made sure the game lives up to its name. It's at its best when tossing you down exhilarating roller coaster tracks that launch you high into the sky, throw you for loops, and get you jumping out of your seat because you can't believe you just stuck that landing. When the later levels crank up the difficulty and you can't make it over the first hurdle -- even after 100 tries -- a good amount of gamers will decide they've had enough and move on to something else. But there are also plenty of Trials experts (re: gluttons for punishment) that will dominate those late-game deathtraps. This reveals an important point: Trials Evolution eventually becomes maddeningly difficult, but there are enough breezy levels before things get cruel to justify purchase for gamers that just want to have fun. The difficulty curve ramps more gradually here than in the previous game. To proceed through the single-player career you tackle tiers of levels grouped together by difficulty and interspersed with ~license tests~ that teach you advanced techniques and grant you new bikes. When you don't have enough medals earned to unlock the next tier you must return to previous areas to hunt for silver and gold medallions, but because of the ingenuity of these track designs it's a pleasure to replay and improve your game. Whereas Trials HD kept us confined to similar warehouse environments, Evolution opens the doors to the outside, turns off the lights at night, throws weather at us, and curves our riding lines to show off more amazing backdrops. From haunted wooded areas to active warzones to flooding sewer drains to crumbling ancient ruins, Evolution never shows you the same area twice in a row. These levels hold many a site to see as we bump and ride our way around, learning their intricacies and discovering their delights. That imagination lets us down when it's time to customize our rider, though. As clever as the level designs are, the stuff you unlock couldn't be more pedestrian. Finishing tracks earns you money that can be spent on helmets, shirts, and pants. But, for the most part, these items are just standard motorcycle gear offered in different colors. It's a shame these little rewards weren't given the same care as the rest of the game. As of this review I have $135,875 burning a hole in my virtual pocket and nothing I care to spend it on. With animated backgrounds and explosions going off all around you, the game dazzles as it flies by even if it's not the most graphically impressive title on XBLA. The rider's ragdoll animations are amusing but dated and checkpoints are often reset before textures are quite ready for it. And that ridiculous macho posturing rap rock had me turning the music off right away. Every level ends with a random, ridiculous ~finishing move~ that rewards your racer for crossing the finish line with an untimely death. He may be catapulted off a cliff, have a semi truck dropped on his head, or he may float away and explode on the moon. These bonkers fatalities will have you waiting around at the end of a level just to see if the developers have anything else planned. Adding to the enjoyable insanity are levels that pay tribute to other popular Xbox Live Arcade games like Limbo and 'Splosion Man. The developers obviously had a good time creating these levels, but why should they have all the fun? Trials Evolution gives players the exact editing tools the developers used to build their levels. It's a graphic interface that takes getting the hang of but should yield whatever Trials levels your little heart desires. Unfortunately, this review doesn't touch on what may be Trials Evolution's greatest asset: that promise of never-ending user-generated levels. Everything RedLynx created is amazing on its own. But with the tools to match and surpass what RedLynx is offering, your fellow Trials Evolution players will be keeping you riding long after you've completed the single-player career. When you want to race against other players you may do so both locally and online. These matches are played on one screen with up to four players in a comical race to the finish line. It's a nice little addition that will make for some good couch competition but I tired of it quickly. Of course, we currently only have access to the included levels, and once Trials Evolution is released you can import user-created levels to race in multiplayer. CLOSING COMMENTS Trials has cleverly adapted to its environment and become even more of an everyman's game. It's still incredibly challenging, but the hill to the hardest levels is less steep. The thrills are more thrilling. Track sharing and multiplayer make it more communal. Rarely have I played a game that better caters to all walks of players.
