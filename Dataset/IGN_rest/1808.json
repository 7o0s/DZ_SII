With all that experience, it should probably come as no surprise that the latest edition, MotoGP 21, is a deep, satisfying, and sometimes unflinchingly tough modern motorsport simulation. Its packaged fairly similarly to Codemasters F1 series and KT Racings WRC games, only with 50% fewer wheels and 500% more terrifying crashes. Of course, if youve been keeping close track of its progress youll find that MotoGP 21 is a lot like MotoGP 20  identical even, in some areas  although there have been a couple of welcome tweaks that do genuinely improve the bike handling and the racing. MotoGP 21s sensation of speed is quite remarkable, especially in first-person, and the feeling of weight is also excellent. On track the racing is aggressive and dangerous: relative to last years game, changes to the suspension system means the bikes feel more alive over bumps, and particularly under heavy braking. Milestone has also added brake temperature management, which augments the racing with yet another layer of strategy to wrestle with. Brakes that are too cold or too hot, for instance, wont be as effective, and I definitely noticed when the bike wasnt pulling up as quickly. Changes to the suspension system means the bikes feel more alive over bumps, and particularly under heavy brakingOff the track, there are plenty of staff opportunities and R&D tasks to juggle to improve your bikes performance  of course, that stuff has become pretty typical in modern motorsport sims, including MotoGP 20. From researching upgrades to establishing a junior team, MotoGP 21 sticks closely to last years script. MotoGP 21 is an extremely demanding racer, though, and the degree of difficulty increases exponentially the more you lower the riding aids, which offer assists like throttle and braking input modulation and a cornering assist that irons out frantic left stick inputs  basically an invisible guiding hand to help the bike dip left and right more smoothly. Even with those crutches, however  and even against relatively sedate levels of AI competition  MotoGP 21 requires a high level of finesse to succeed. As a result, pulling off a win or placing well after a great fight on track is a rather rewarding experience. Mode Rash For racing fans yet to try Milestones series, MotoGP 21 turns out to be a good year to jump in thanks to a new tutorial mode that adds an extremely useful launchpad for getting accustomed to MotoGPs tricky brand of bike racing. MotoGP 20 never took time to educate you on how to ride or even how to use your bikes systems, but this years instalment rectifies that with a simple series of playable lessons outlining everything from straightforward bike control, to fuel management, and to electronic systems like engine brake, anti-wheelie, and traction control  all of which can be adjusted on track, on the fly. As such, despite its otherwise steep difficulty curve, MotoGP 21 is probably the most beginner-friendly MotoGP game in years, and I think the effort to make it slightly less impenetrable for newbies is a very good move. The effort to make MotoGP 21 slightly less impenetrable for newbies is a very good moveThe rewind feature also returns to take the sting out of learning to ride in MotoGP 21, and unlike in Milestones Supercross 4 its an unlimited resource here. I for one think thats a more sensible approach; it certainly makes it more forgiving on cack-handed maniacs like me. Of course, if youre a complete purist, rewinds and all other assists can be reduced or toggled off to force you to suffer the full consequences of coming off your bike so that you can experience one of the most notable new additions this year: a full, manual bike-retrieval sequence. That is, after coming off you wont automatically respawn on your bike; youll need to jog over to wherever the bike came to a stop, lift it up, and hop back on. I actually really like how this looks in-game  and its certainly a cool, authentic little sequence to layer into the racing  but the fact that manual bike retrieval is only applicable to humans and not the AI means its enormously and fundamentally flawed. How is it fair that the AI racers still respawn on their bikes instantly, speeding away while I was still hoofing it back to my own bike? Itll be neat if this is fixed in an update, but in its current form the function is pointless to use. Super Bang-on MotoGP 21 also introduces the real-world series Long Lap Penalty, a narrow and specifically longer route placed somewhere on each track that serves to punish riders for track limit violations and false starts. Long Lap Penalty zones have been added to every track from the 2021 championship and definitely bolster MotoGP 21s feeling of authenticity, though Id stress Ive never seen the AI have to take one yet. Finally, while MotoGP 21 is filled with character faces only a mother could love, theres some pretty great detail to be spotted elsewhere, from the mistreated rubber of a cooked tyre to the gleam of wet asphalt. Off-track, however, the recycled vignettes and same-same menus make things feel a bit stale, generally. Its also peculiar that female riders are still being referred to as blokes  that just feels half-baked. A new tutorial system makes MotoGP 21 a good year for new riders to jump aboard this long-running motorcycle racing sim, though its other additions are slim enough that returning players will probably feel let down. One of the biggest new features, making you retrieve your bike after a spill, wont be a good idea until the AI has to do it as well, but the tweaks to the bike handling are notable improvements to what is still most certainly the best-feeling MotoGP game to date.", "date": "April 24, 2021"}
