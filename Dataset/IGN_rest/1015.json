Beneath the subpar graphics and cliche story lies strong combat, lovable characters, and an abundance of customization options. It may not be the deepest or most innovative RPG, but it has a lot of heart. Fencers (those able to wield fairy-infused weapons) collecting Furies (said fairy-infused weapons) is what drives the straightforward plot, which doesnt offer much in the way of excitement or surprises. Thats a shame, especially since youd think a story about preventing an apocalyptic resurrection of warring gods would be more a lot more interesting. Luckily, Fairy Fencer Fs ho-hum story is buoyed up by its likable characters. Everyone from the lazy, self-centered protagonist Fang to the stuck-up Tiara, boasts distinct personalities, enhanced by voice actors who really chew the scenery with hilariously over-the-top line delivery. Admittedly, a lot of the non-voiced dialogue is pretty asinine, but the translation team slyly sprinkles in some Western humor to spice things up, including terms like tsundere masochistic and an allusion to a famous Space Balls quote that that had me cracking up. This one-two punch of cheeky localization and enthusiastic voice over kept me engaged in Fairy Fencer F long after I stopped caring about the plot. When I wasnt laughing at silly banter, I was happily shaping what kind of Fencer I wanted each of them to be. Customization in Fairy Fencer F is fun thanks to a flexible system that lets you distribute experience points however you want. I could, for example, increase Fangs basic sword prowess, or unlock combo attacks that can be chained together to give combat a satisfyingly rhythmic feel. You can also boost a Fencers stats by equipping them with fairies found in acquired Furies. Its best to pair Fencers with a fairy that reflects their strengths (i.e. equipping Fang with a fire-based fairy that will enhance his pyro spells), but I like that I could change out these tiny beings to score all types of different benefits like higher attack percentages in battle or extra experience points. And any fairies not equipped were put to good use with World Shaping, a nifty feature that lets you change the parameters of a dungeon to your advantage. Even a fairys World-Shaping powers are customizable thanks to Godly Revival, a mode that lets you remove one of the special Furies used to seal away the gods, then fuse it with a fairy to give that fairy an extra stat boost. I didnt quite understand why actions in Godly Revival dont tie into the story more (you dont actually need to remove all the Furies from a sleeping god to finish the game), but nevertheless I liked being able to increase a fairys effectiveness in battle. Speaking of battle, I really dig Fairy Fencers combat, which offers a surprising amount of lateral movement during an enemy encounter. I could move my Fencers around the battlefield, adjust a spells AoE using the L1/R1 buttons to target specific enemies, choose from a wide variety of magics and abilities, and even transform into Fury form, a type of overdrive that lets Fencers use a special skillset for a limited time. This broad range of attack options kept the turn-based combat system fresh and interesting, even when the same enemies appeared over and over (and over) again to challenge my Fencers. Amano, where are you? Difficulty wise, enemies dont offer much of a challenge, save for the tough-as-nails minibosses. That might seem like a bad thing, but I reveled in the speed and ease with which I dispatched monsters, since it made me feel nigh invincible when charging through Fairy Fencers linear, bland-looking dungeons. There was much ado about famed Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano being this projects concept designer, but his influence on the world design is barely detectable in the cheap-looking environments and cutscenes. Also conspicuous is the absence of composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose collaboration on the soundtrack was hyped up, but whose actual contribution feels somewhat limited. Thats not to say the music in Fairy Fencer F is bad (I like its light, whimsical sound), but theres nothing memorable about it either. Clearly not here. Luckily, Fairy Fencer Fs aesthetics do have a few bright spots. The battle animations are cool to watch, especially when Fencers transform into Fury form. This triggers a frenzied cutscene complete with rockin guitar riffs that made me laugh with their over-the-top presentation. I also liked the character designs, which are done by Hyperdimension Neptunia artist Tsunako. Theyre not terribly original, but theyre nice to look at, and I appreciate that only one of the characters is designed with fan service in mind. I managed to zip through Fairy Fencer F in a little over 30 hours, but those with compulsive tendencies can spend many more hours finding and collecting all 100 Furies hidden throughout the world. You can also start a new game+ in case you missed a Fury, or want to reach the top of Shukesoos Tower, a bonus dungeon that grows with every Fury left in the ground during World Shaping.

It may have boring level design and a monotonous plot, but I was able to enjoy it for its amusing characters, great localization, and satisfying combat.", "date": "Oct. 6, 2014,"}
