But while it sports several subtle features aimed at tournament goers and mod enthusiasts, its price and lack of current-gen compatibility limit its potential audience considerably. In terms of build quality, the TE2s metal base doesnt make it too ungainly, but its black, angular body feels notably sturdier and more substantial for its inclusion. Combined with the foam padding along its underside, the TE2 sits unmovably on laps and tabletops alike. While the added weight may not seem like an issue with it resting on a flat surface, Id imagine that holding it under your arm while walking a tournament hall all day could get tiring, which is where the new shoulder strap comes in handy. Or err...would have come in handy. The TE 2 has hooks for it, but the strap itself is sold separately, which seems odd when youre ponying up $200 bucks. Thankfully, the stick is otherwise pretty loaded. Backlit Sanwa-30 translucent buttons are laid out in a familiar Vewlix configuration, marking the first time a Mad Catz stick has come stock with illuminated hardware. Dont worry if you prefer to stay low-key, as theyre easily toggled off with the flick of a switch, so you dont have to worry about keeping anyone up with those late night lab sessions. The tourney-proven Sanwa JLF stick shaft sits in a standard square gate, providing the smooth, predictable feel that Mad Catz stick owners have come to expect. The lock switch for the guide and start buttons works the same as it ever has to prevent accidental pauses and disqualifications during tournament play, but the detachable USB wire is anything but typical. Where old TEs had a rear compartment for the cable to fold into, the one on the TE 2 is completely detachable, and gets stowed within the sticks body, which opens easily with the press of a button on the front face. This reveals storage for not only the USB cable, but for an included screwdriver with an interchangeable head, and anything else you can fit in. Cool as it is, disconnecting the USB cable and popping open your stick to stow it seems like a much bigger to-do than just stuffing it into an external compartment. That said, having such easy access to the sticks interior makes it great for modders, as the button wirings are easily accessible and conveniently color-coded. Even the generic-looking Killer Instinct art can be changed out with ease, thanks to a removable top bezel and unscrewable clear panel. Its a modders dream stick. But while all that is nice, in terms of practicality, the TE 2 is in questionable territory at this juncture. Sure, its the only option if you want a stick to play Killer Instinct with on the Xbox One, but if youre planning on playing anywhere but home, youll likely be faced with the prospect of bringing multiple sticks, as this one isnt compatible with any other consoles. Thats not really a knock on the stick though, just the reality of the fighting game scene as it stands today. THE VERDICT While there will no doubt be more fighting games coming to the Xbox One, and resourceful individuals may find ways to mod the stick to work on other consoles, the fact remains that this is a $200 dollar piece of hardware to play one game at the moment. If that isnt a problem for you, the Mad Catz Fight Stick TE 2 is the best (and currently only) way to have an arcade-style experience with Killer Instinct. Its sturdy feel, modability, and premium feature set make it a worthwhile investment for anyone planning on using it for the long haul of the new console generation.
