{"name": "redshirt", "name_review": "Redshirt Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/redshirt/17985/review/redshirt-review", "text": "Redshirt presents itself as a science-fiction parody, specifically of Star Trek. It's right there in the title  you play as one of Trek's famously anonymous grunts, the folks who show up for a single episode simply to die so that the cast members can look like they're in actual danger. Redshirt isn't actually a Star Trek game; it's far too irreverent, and pokes fun outside of Trek lore, like the matriarchal Asrion race (a dig at Mass Effect's Asari). Its full of sly, loving nods at the unacknowledged roles that are never shown on screen, like the poor guy who has to clean up after a transporter accident. But what makes Redshirt special is its brutal, extraordinarily effective satire of modern human interaction. Unfortunately, despite having a central focus, Redshirt struggles at being a complete game beyond its satire. The core of Redshirt is a social simulation. Like in The Sims, you create a character just assigned to the space station Megalodon-9 and guide them through friendship, romance, and their career. This is done primarily through Spacebook, a Facebook knockoff where Redshirts truly vicious satire kicks in. Because it reduces human behavior into only whats documented online, Redshirt forces you to treat relationships and hobbies as manipulable, disposable, and only useful as far as they can improve your character's position. For example: every character has three interests, like Fitness, Games, Music, Culture, Self-Indulgence etc. For everyone else on the station, those interests are set in stone. For your character, they can be changed by items you buy or events you schedule on Spacebook. So if you go out to eat regularly, eventually you'll have Xenogastronomy become one of your interests. Theres a strong gameplay mechanic here of figuring out which interests will be the most successful at achieving your goals, then figuring out the most efficient way to build that while maintaining friendships. And you need to change your interests around to progress  other characters won't friend you if they don't share an interest, and higher-level jobs require that you possess those interests in order to get. Unless, of course, you start sleeping with the hiring manager  which again, requires manipulating their interests until they like you. I liked the way the game considered identity as something fluid, and playing it with any sense of ambition forced me to wonder how my own presentation of my online social life was less about who I am and more about whats useful to me in the moment, which is quite clever. You could, alternately, get your redshirt a steady job and some friends and try to live a decent, happy life. But the problems with that approach start to show where Redshirt falls apart. First, there's no strong external pressure that forces difficult decisions. Everything in Redshirt revolves around your character, with the exception of an unnamed event that will supposedly destroy the station 160 days after your character's arrival. Because the destruction event isn't specified and no story works toward it, all it gives is a motivation to earn as much money or power as is required to avoid it. Everyone else on the station behaves as if all is normal, all the time. Of course your love life is just an excuse as well, Commander Raker. Day-to-day interactions suffer from a lack pressure or urgency. As you make friends, you won't be able to keep everyone happy  there will be break-ups, rejections, lonely obsessions, and so on. But the enemies you make don't compete against you for jobs, or try to turn your other friends against you  just a stream of nasty messages. They, and almost everything else on Megalodon-9, are static. The one partial exception to this rule is the occasional Away Mission you're called to do. There, you and teams of other random grunts are threatened and a few are killed, occasionally leading to you having to make a decision of who to leave behind. Second, the act of day-to-day play isn't terribly entertaining. The positive feedback loop of setting goals and then attaining them works, but there's nothing else. This is a common issue with social simulations: their focus on slowly changing, abstract relationships doesn't provide direct challenges; it's too two-dimensional. A game like The Sims gets around this through use of space; success allows you to expand and improve your living arrangements. Or a game like Crusader Kings II has both internal and familial politics to deal with at a two-dimension level, but it also has the external politics of trying to improve your nation's positions on the map. Redshirt has no spatial component whatsoever. This means that if you ever get stuck in a rut  say, needing to just put your head down and work a job for another week to level up a skill  it provides no intrinsic rewards just for the act of playing. This Away Mission turned out quite poorly for the redshirts involved. Finally, Redshirt is a little bit glitchy. Most of the glitches are cosmetic, like the wrong text or window being overlaid on something it shouldn't, and can easily be worked around. But I did have one bug where suddenly my characters' interests went totally haywire, and she was into Music far beyond every other skill, without even trying, which seriously hampered my ability to change my character's personality in order to get promotions. The developer is quite responsive and consistently patches the game, though, so it has more of a occasionally ragged indie feeling than a this game isn't ready. Pros Joyously cynical relationshipsAccessible interfaceScience-fiction homage Cons Little challengeBuggy Redshirt is a noble, satirical, and generally successful experiment in social simulation. At its best, it presents a gleefully cutthroat philosophy of human interaction, pushing you to be as terrible as possible within a charming cartoonish parody. It doesn't always manage to hold onto that feeling, but Redshirt has enough unique personality to endure.", "date": "Dec. 4, 2013,"}
