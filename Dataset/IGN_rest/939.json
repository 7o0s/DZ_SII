The Wii U is far more accessible than before, thanks to an updated interface that gets you into menus and apps much faster, and a quick-start menu that lets you jump into a game from standby mode. It also boasts a killer library of first-party games that offers experiences you wont find anywhere else. Yet this system still suffers from third-party neglect, and its major point of difference, the GamePad, is underutilized. Although the latter is a fantastic piece of kit, Nintendo has yet to justify it wholly with its software, and it faces the danger of being ignored by consumers as a crucial part of the system altogether. Given the growth the Wii U has undergone in the last 24 months, our original review is no longer as relevant as it once was. The experience of owning this console has changed; accordingly, we've gone back and re-evaluated it to update our assessment. After peering at it with fresh eyes, it's obvious that this system has quietly transformed from being a good one into a great one. The System At 4.6 cm (1.8 inches) by 26.9 cm (10.6 inches) by 17.2 cm (6.8 inches), the Wii U is a compact system that sits very comfortably beside other consoles in an entertainment center. With its rounded edges and a choice of black (pro) or white (basic) colour schemes, its stylish and unobtrusive, although scratches tend to stand out on the pro consoles black finish. On our office launch unit, thats very obvious after two years of use. For storage, Nintendo offers only 32GB of internal storage on the pro model, and a stiflingly paltry 8GB on the basic version. Its a short-sighted move that Wii U owners have to work around by purchasing SD cards or an external hard drivethough neither storage option is particularly fast by todays standards. (Support is limited to the SDHC format for SD cards, and to USB 2.0 external drives.) Buying additional storage is a necessary extra step youll have to take if you plan to keep multiple full-sized retail games on your system, such as Bayonetta 2, which weighs in at 14.6GB. Inside the system lives a 1.24GHz multi-core processsor, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, and a 550MHz graphics core. When compared to its current-gen peers, the Wii U trails the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in terms of raw power, but this is largely a gameplay-over-graphic console that excels within that framework. Even still, choosing this system doesnt mean sacrificing good looks in order to have funNintendos incredibly skilled at creating fantastic-looking games that run on these specs. Mario Kart 8, for example, looks beautiful at 720p and 60fps. The Interface The Wii Us interface is clean and straightforward, and since launch has been tweaked for the better. Turn it on and youre able to access pinned apps (your friends list, the Miiverse, the eShop, the internet browser, Nintendos TVii, and notifications) on the bottom toolbar, and recently played games, settings, and installed games across three rows on the main screen. For the download-happy, youre able to move apps and games into customizable folders to keep everything orderly. We criticised long load times in our original review, but getting into the Wii U menu from standby mode now takes under 30 seconds, thanks to general OS speed and stability improvements. On top of that, the quick-start menu on the GamePad slashes the time it takes to load a game or app in half by bypassing the menu entirely; I was able to get to the Super Smash Bros. for Wii U start screen in 25 seconds from standby. Ultimately, its a fairly snappy system, even when compared to the newer consoles. Online communication and social interaction on the Wii U is limited, however. Theres no universal standard for in-game chatso you might be able to talk to your friends in one game and then have no means of communicating with them in anotherand many key first-party games like Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Mario Kart 8 wont allow in-game chat outside of public lobbies. While this is understandable from a family friendly standpoint (Nintendo doesnt want kids subject to the kind of language youd hear online in Call of Duty), using Skype for smack-talk during a Mario Kart race isnt quite the same. You do have another option for human contact via Wii Us Miiverse, which is a fun if inessential element within the interface. The social network remains a little baffling for newbiesit could be tweaked a bit to improve accessibilitybut with some persistence theres a friendly, helpful, and wildly creative community to be discovered (and its now accessible on PCs and mobile phones, too.) Its sub-communities, essentially forums dedicated to games and apps, are particularly endearing, and are elevated by the ability to post screenshots directly from your game and create fan art inspired by them. If you want to shop, the Wii U eShop is easy to navigate and regularly updated. Additionally, it allows your system to download a purchased new game prior to release, granting you access the moment it officially launches. You can also visit the Virtual eShop, which offers a currently limited selection of classic games from previous Nintendo consoles. Media options on the Wii U are serviceable, if anemic. Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and Hulu Plus work finesimilar to what youd expect from a Smart TV. Wii Us own integrated entertainment-app TVii, which collates your channels into one viewing platform, hasnt been promoted or mentioned by Nintendo in over a year (and its still not, and will likely never be, available in Oceania). Despite that insistent pinned icon on everyones GamePad, it may be something of a lost cause. The Software But such peripheral issues fade into the background considering what the Wii U has been primarily built for: playing video games. Since its launch in 2012, Nintendo has slowly added to whats become an outstanding library of first-party games; Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Super Mario 3D World, Pikmin 3, Bayonetta 2, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD are all beautifully crafted, polished, and incredibly fun, and only available on this system. And with games like The Legend of Zelda Wii U, Mario Maker, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker on the horizon, it looks like the trend will continue at least through 2015. The system still suffers from lack of third-party support, though. If you want to play games regularly outside of Nintendos own stable and only own a Wii U, youre going to find it tough-going. Big blockbuster games from third parties rarely come to this system, and certain genres, like sports and shooters, are almost extinct. Better sales could turn this situation around, but the trend has only got worse since launch. Still, theres a lot of good stuff to be found here. Nintendo continues to quietly support indie games, with more added to the Wii U eShop each month. Older gems such as Lego City Undercover, ZombiU, and the optimized-for-Wii U Rayman Legends offer one-of-a-kind experiences. The Wii Us library may not be huge, but two years in, theres a lot to play with. Pros Killer first-party software lineupInnovative hardwareEasy to use interface Cons Lack of third-party supportGamepad is underutilized The Wii U may not be the most powerful console on the market, but what it lacks in specs it makes up for with a stellar lineup of first-party games and innovative (if underused) hardware. Lack of support from significant third parties like EA and Activision still holds the console back, though, and the gaps in its library left by absent multiplatform games are significant.<br><br> But its tough to beat the unique experiences that the Wii U offers. Second-screen gaming, unique tablet integration, and a clutch of generation-defining exclusives make the Wii U impossible to ignore. After two years of growth, the Wii U has become a great system that can still offer much more.", "date": "Dec. 1, 2014,"}
