Set on a fictional, high-latitude island far off the coast of Britain, Fortune Island is more of a driving purists playground than Forza Horizon 3s more experimental DLC. The star attraction is the Needle Climb, a several-mile stretch of sealed switchbacks that winds up Fortune Islands highest peak. The Forza Horizon series has been begging for a ribbon of road like this since the beginning, and the Needle Climb doesnt disappoint. The entire length is one long Drift Zone, too, so shredding up and down it in whatever car you see fit is actively encouraged and rewarded. Its not the Stelvio Pass or Trasfagarasan Highway, but itll do quite nicely for now. Its a very well-crafted bit of asphalt and Forza Horizon 4s drift-happy handling dynamics absolutely sing on it. Theres also an amazing unsealed trail that wraps around behind the base of the peak, featuring several sections poised on the very edge of a high, rocky cliff which reaches down into the distant ocean. During events, the most dangerous sections have safety walls added but in free-roam its an incredible challenge trying to maintain speed and still cling to the loose dirt surface while hanging it out sideways through the perilous corners. Ive definitely thrown enough Hoonitrucks into the sea at this point to send Ken Block bankrupt two times over. Well, that one puckered up my butthole. Theres a sleepy maritime feel to Fortune Island that I really like and, while its still unmistakably British, overall its quite distinct from the main map. You may not agree during the day, but wait until the wild light show at night as the aurora borealis ignites the starry sky with an eerie green glow. Its stunning stuff, particularly watching it dance across the bodywork of cars and reflect off standing water. There are also severe storms, complete with branching lightning strikes. These newly-added weather phenomena dont necessarily have an impact on the moment-to-moment gameplay but theyre spectacular to look at. If this expansion is capable of anything its giving a potent reminder of just how spectacularly good looking Forza Horizon 4 can be.

Its broken up into 10 rounds and, once you hit the required influence targets by completing the available races and stunts, youll receive a clue to decipher. These clues point to a task that needs to be fulfilled in order to receive the rough location of a treasure box hidden somewhere on the map. I dont expect the clues will stump too many dedicated gearheads  theyre really just a matter of finding the area of the map referenced in the clue and carrying out the task hinted at in the right car. The right car is generally referenced with a fairly obvious riff on its model name but, if you dont actually know what an Italian four-five-eight is, a brief shuffle through the Autoshow should turn over the answer without too much hand-wringing. Assuming you dont already own the required cars youll need to buy them to complete the tasks but, considering each treasure box contains one million credits, that shouldnt be a problem. The treasure boxes themselves function in much the same way as traditional Forza Horizon Barn Finds  a rough area will be marked out highlighting where to search. Ive enjoyed finding them, though I gave up searching for any at night. With very little man-made light on the island it can get extremely dark, and I found myself blindly stumbling through the countryside to little avail whenever trying to uncover chests at night. A cropped photograph of the landscape near the treasure box should help you narrow down locations, though; I know using the landmarks in the background of the pics to narrow down the final resting spot of chests was very helpful to me. A handful of the modest selection of 10 new cars arriving with Fortune Island are available through these treasure boxes, and the remainder are available in the Autoshow. Its another scattergun blast of interesting international metal, from the idiosyncratic (the 1953 Morris Minor Series II Traveler, an estate version of the quintessentially British Morris Minor), to the iconic (the 2002 Koenigsegg CC8S, Koenigseggs first-ever production car, of which it built only six) and to the insane (the 2018 Funco Motorsports F9, a 7.4-litre, twin-turbo V8 sandcar with a neck-snapping 1750hp on tap). Drift Club 2.0 is a cool new Horizon Story that showcases FH4's Formula Drift cars. Two other standout features are the new Trailblazer point-to-point stunts (which have no checkpoints but the first and last and dare us to straightline through the challenging, undulating environment) and Drift Club 2.0 (an excellent new Horizon Story with seven chapters that uses the seven cars from the Formula Drift pack and sets us loose on and around the Needle Climb). Getting three stars in Trailblazer events isnt always as easy as it looks because sometimes your fastest car wont necessarily be the one best suited to taking on the huge jumps and bumpy terrain without becoming unsettled. Theres some trial and error involved in Trailblazer that I find pretty satisfying. I didnt find the point totals required to three-star each Drift Club 2.0 chapter particularly challenging but I did have a huge amount of fun doing them (and then doing them again, and again). Its also worth noting we dont miss out on things like seasonal changes or Forzathon Live events while hooning around Fortune Island, either; what happens on the mainland happens on the island as well. Pros Great controllerLots of media and peripheral optionsEasy gameplay sharing Cons Interface needs refinementNo DVR integration At the Xbox Ones launch, Microsoft took the position of wanting to be the console that offered everything in one place, but it didnt fully deliver on that. Now, a year later, the Xbox Ones major features have been strengthened enough so they clearly stand out, and the media-saturated environment they live in has also been nurtured and grown. Whether you come to your living room to watch video content or TV, listen to music, or play games, theres a lot to choose from in each category.<br><br> That said, there are still areas that need to be honed. The Xbox Ones interface needs refinement to make controller-only navigation feel simple; it cant rely on its alternative controls (SmartGlass, the optional Media Remote accessory) to shore up the gaps. And it wouldnt hurt if Microsoft worked with developers to eliminate lower resolutions and framerates in third-party games, as it currently makes the Xbox harder to choose for people who want to play the likes of Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age: Inquisition. But if Microsoft pushes out the same amount of substantial updates between now and next yearas it did between last year and nowthe Xbox Ones poised to become an amazing system by November 2015, no matter if it has Kinect or not.", "date": "Dec. 21, 2018,"}
