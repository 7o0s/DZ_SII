Heres what we said then: Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears. DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud. This is digital action at its finest, steeped in the blood of angels, spiced with gunpowder, and garnished with a middle finger. You can say all the same things about DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In fact, its added some fresh features to the already polished eight to 10-hour campaign to make it even better. Obviously, the most noticeable difference for this version of DmC over the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 editions is its looks and performance. The colorful, vibrant world of Limbo looks great in 1080p resolution, and runs smoothly at 60 frames per second. That makes a big difference for an action game. It also adds eye-catching layers of lighting and shadow effects, and all of this brings it more in line with the excellent PC version. A small selection of character and weapon skins lets you dress Dante up in his signature red-and-black outfits from previous Devil May Cry games for a little extra variety. The only hitch is that on both PS4 and Xbox One, I saw cutscenes drift out of sync with their audio. Its just a little surprising, considering everything else looks so good. Its beauty is more than skin deep, too. DmC already had one of the most elegant combat-control schemes of any action game to date, but this Definitive Edition adds a lock-on system. That makes it easier to track enemies and execute signature lunge moves like the Stinger, or to focus on the biggest threat in a group of enemies. Dont like the sound of easier? Dont worry, because the sublime combat system, which already offered lots of fun options with which to kick demon tail, can be sped up about 20 percent, which makes fights more intense. On top of that, brutally challenging new difficulty modes like hardcore or Gods Must Die will give any expert demon slayer a deadly run for their money. Toss in the rebalanced enemies with different attack patterns and tells, a new 60-floor arena called Bloody Palace made exclusively for Virgil, and youve got plenty of reasons to keep fighting the demonic hordes of DmC again and again. Pros Excellent combatSuperb styleCustomizationColorful world Cons Cutscene hitches DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition brings the same great game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, along with a couple of tweaks to make it feel different for returning veterans. The sharper visuals, smooth 60-fps gameplay, and other features and enhancements gave me plenty of reasons to be happy about coming back, and to recommend that you pick it up for the first time.", "date": "March 10, 2015"}
