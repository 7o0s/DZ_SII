Beat Sneak Bandit combines complex puzzles with one-button rhythm tapping. The entire experience is wrapped up in a funky art style and soundtrack. The premise? Evil Baron Von Clockface has stolen all the world's clocks, and it's up to you to get them back! Gamers must tap the screen in rhythm with the music to move  mistime a tap and players remain rooted in place. The goal is to tap your way through each stage while avoiding obstacles like roving security guards and spotlights. Every element of Beat Sneak's level design smartly supports this simple one button premise. When players are facing a wall and tap, the bandit simply turns around and heads back the other direction. When facing a staircase, a tap sends you up the stairs. These ~limited~ controls form the foundation of Beat Sneak's ingenius puzzles. Did we like it? Beat Sneak is full of genuinely clever, multilayered puzzles. This alone makes the game a lot of fun. Solving all these dense puzzles with such a simple one-button movement mechanic? This is what makes Beat Sneak one of the App Store's best. Almost all the stages generate that oh-so-satisfying ~aha!~ moment, especially when puzzling out how to obtain all four optional hard-to-reach bonus clocks in each stage. Some later puzzles aren't quite as clever or fun, however. Later levels over-rely on complex networks of teleports zipping players around a stage to keep the difficulty high. Beat Sneak is at its best when players are using rhythm and logic to perfectly tap their way past a security guard, not forcing players to memorize a huge circuit of teleports. Should you buy it? Developer Simogo really showed off its smarts with each stage's bonus clocks. These are more than just replay value boosters; nabbing all four almost always requires players to rethink how they approach each level. Beat Sneak introduces new wrinkles over the course of its 65+ stages, keeping the experience fresh throughout. The game is an excellent value at $2.99, and will take gamers several hours to tap their way through. CLOSING COMMENTS Beat Sneak Bandit is polished, challenging, wholly original and a heck of a lot of fun.
