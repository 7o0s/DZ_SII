With a force of a gut punch, the scene reminds us that few things are more terrifying and hopeless than the prospect of surviving on an alien world alone. Thats the feeling The Solus Project replicates in its best moments, and that, combined with the pressure of holding the fate of the human race in my hands, kept me glued to it long after I grew disenchanted with its weak puzzles and crafting, or the way its survival elements quickly take a back seat to survival horror. Our world is dead already, and the male or female protagonist you choose is a member of a key reconnaissance team searching for a new habitat for humanity. It's not going too well. The ship gets shot down by a strange blast from the far-flung candidate planet below, and you may be the only survivor. If you fail to report your findings, it's likely game over for the rest of us. The early nods to survival games give The Solus Project some of its best and most intense moments. Our hero scrambles out of the escape pod along a beach that would look somewhat like Northern Ireland's Giant's Causeway were it not for the gigantic planetary bodies hogging the sky overhead. In the far distance something resembling a ruined man-made structure juts up, and its existence exudes both promise and menace. But the opening tutorial does a great job of hammering down that the more pressing issues take priority, whether it's the need to find food and water or craft a makeshift torch to stave off the cold nights and provide light for the surrounding caves. Survival elements are so light that they're an annoyance rather than interesting.But you'd be wrong to think this was something as enticing as a DayZ in space, because the survival elements are so light that theyre an annoyance rather than interesting. The torch, even though it's powered by what looks like a clump of ball moss, never actually burns out. Amusingly, there's far greater danger in the solar-powered flashlight you later pick up powering down at a crucial moment than losing the light from a burning stick. Other crafting elements are similarly simplistic, although it's usually cool to discover how logically the process works. Late in the 25-hour campaign when I crafted another torch, for instance, I was pleased to find I could light it just by plopping it in a campfire. Further sucking the danger out of this world is the fact that food is as easy to come by as light. Hostile and eerie though it looks, this might as well be Eden thanks to the way drinkable water dribbles from numerous rocks throughout the world, and both native fruits and sealed provisions from the wreckage litter the caves and beaches. It's soon clear the survival elements exist only to add some tension to the act of exploration instead of actually presenting a challenge, but the trouble is that the concept gets pushed so far back in the background that I ended up paying no more attention to eating and drinking than I might pay to logging manual saves in a game like Fallout 4. By the end, in fact, hidden relics had boosted my stats so high that I found myself annoyed when the need to eat or drink presented itself again. Its so easy to do its just a chore. Puzzles are rarely more demanding than finding a nearby item to open a gate.Puzzles pepper the alien world as well, but they're rarely more demanding than finding a nearby item to open a gate or using a portable teleporter to sneak through barriers and up columns that would normally be impassable. Some admittedly stumped me for a bit, but often in those cases I'd find the answer had been almost right in front of me all along and Id simply overlooked it. I get the impression such systems are simple by design. The PC version of The Solus Project is gaining some attention as one of the few ~complete~ virtual reality games on Steam, and fiddly things like robust crafting or convoluted puzzles might translate poorly to the HTC Vive's controllers and menus. Unfortunately for the rest of us, it comes off as a little less than satisfying with a traditional gamepad. But again, its survival elements seem to exist only to enrich the experience of being lost and alone on a strange planet rather than to make it a challenge. The Solus Project delivers that sensation fantastically, thanks in part to an appealing aesthetic that pulls as much from Stargate as The Blair Witch Project. Even more impressively, it manages to induce spine shivers and goosebumps within a game design that has no direct combat, and in which exploration largely consists of getting from one point to another. Its presentation thrives on a constant tug-of-war between extremes, switching out one for the other just in time to avoid drudgery. In one sequence I'd crouch through claustrophobic tunnels barely wide enough for my shoulders; the next, I'd be standing in vaulted temples where histories from a seemingly dead civilization lined the walls. Elsewhere I might tiptoe through stonewrought corridors with cobwebs that spoke of centuries of disuse; mere seconds later I'd be outside dodging fireballs in a meteor shower or running for shelter from an otherworldly tornado. Moments and sights like these make The Solus Project worth playing. The design of the beaches and ruins never changes significantly, but they're used to great effect. Most of all, it succeeds on the strength of a building dread that intensifies as its roughly 25 hours roll to a close. Jump scares are so rare as to be almost entirely nonexistent; instead, it relies on a creepiness that inked its way under my skin through both visuals and an effective use of sound. The majority of it reveals itself through the notes and inscribed slabs you read with a scanner, but also in the hints of quick movement in spaces that once seemed empty. Just when the world starts feeling mundane and predictable, The Solus Project shocks with sights like spiky caves where organic blades shoot down and impale anyone passing through. When the end comes, it's not exactly surprising, but it delivers a satisfying coda to the despair and horror that's been building for the past few hours. The Solus Project is a satisfyingly creepy exploration game that uses a brilliant understanding of setcrafting and circumstance to capture the experience of being alone on an alien planet. Ambience and mood are kings here, and the experience deals eeriness and beauty in equal measure. Sadly, its puzzles are seldom rewardingly challenging, and while it introduces survival elements to heighten the tension an abundance of supplies and indestructible items end up making these elements more annoying than welcome.", "date": "July 20, 2016,"}
