Very swift - this Batman: Arkham Knight DLC took me only a half hour to complete. Catwomans Revenge is a mostly fun, self-contained story set in a toy store that The Riddler has converted into a robot factory, and the dark, moody Arkham take on toys - if you can call these monstrous figures that - is a genuine delight. It is however, a very slight experience that brings nothing new to Arkhams world. If youve played Arkham Knight and its predecessors, youll know Catwomans set of skills by now. She can crawl along designated parts of the ceiling, use a whip, and generally move a little faster than Batman in combat. Catwomans Revenge makes good use of each, though I wish Id been able to let her loose in a less confining environment. With its dark, twisting corridors, dusty teddy bears and sad model planes, Winslows Toy Shop is a wonderfully twisted, Tim Burton-esque place to look at. Its just a very small space, made to feel only slightly larger by plenty of underground spots to hide and lots of climbable ceilings. Consequently the first section, which requires Catwoman to stealthily pick off guards, took me no time at all. I was there just long enough to appreciate the gag-heavy NPC dialogue: hired goons in the Arkham games have never been so comically dumb. Once youre done sneaking around, Catwomans Revenge switches gears into more traditional Arkham Knight rhythms, as the Riddler throws wave after wave of robots at you in an electrified arena. The sheer volume of them made this quite a difficult fight at first, but that means it creates lots of opportunity for stringing some fun combos. Its a shame that outside of this fight, theres very little to do in Riddlers secret factory. There are a handful of collectables and a half-baked puzzle I quickly solved through trial and error, but otherwise its disappointingly devoid of Nigmas usual mind-meddling finesse. The life of Catwomans Revenge is extended somewhat through a couple of new AR maps. Though they virtually rehash the beats of its campaign - sneak, then fight on an electrified floor - I had fun fighting against tougher enemies and sentry guns. It's a delight to put Catwoman's skills to use against Arkham's more formidable foes, but the tantalizing taste I was given here just left me hungry for more. Pros Dark, moody environmentChaotic final battle Cons Too shortWhere are the puzzles? Batman Arkham Knight: Catwomans Revenge has a wonderfully twisted setting, but an- all-too-brief campaign doesnt utilize it enough. Like Arkham Knights Batgirl DLC before it, this is a blink-and-youll-miss-it affair.", "date": "Dec. 2, 2015,"}
