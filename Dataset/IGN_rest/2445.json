If it werent for the tedious chore of gathering resources from planets surfaces, itd be a revival to celebrate. As humanity takes its first step into the stars we find were not alone, and that many of our neighbors are delightfully stupid. Theres the pathetically needy Tywom banana slugs, the obsessively bureaucratic Measured, a sleazy race of con artists whore basically Watto from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace with longer necks, and plenty more  each stranger and more surprising than the last. All the major aliens have a distinct style and personality thats brought to life by diverse character models and fun voice acting. The absurdist and occasionally laugh-out-loud humor of Star Control: Origins dialogue is its greatest asset, and it uses it effectively to cover up some of its deficiencies  there are various jokes about why every member of each alien race looks and sounds exactly like the others, for example. Listening to aliens casually discuss interstellar fish genocide or the proper number of ears to everyone should have is usually well worth taking the time. Dialogue couldve used a bit more variety for common interactions, though: having every conversation with the malfunctioning starbase AI end with EXCEPTION - CIVIL FAREWELL NOT FOUND! and every rescue when you run out of fuel come at the cost of listening to the Tywoms god-awful Star Trek fanfic gets old pretty quickly. It's a reminder that Star Control: Origins is an adventure game, not an RPG.Funny as they often are, its very rare that the dialogue decisions you make seem to have any effect on the outcome of an encounter other than to play your character straight or as a wise-cracking captain with a mean streak. There are definitely a few points where you can choose to accept or decline an offer from an alien, and what you choose may have consequences that must be resolved through a sidequest, but theres never a risk of endangering an alliance by insulting your allies or anything like that. Nearly all of the quests are solved by traveling to a location, checking it out (maybe blowing something up), and returning to the questgiver. Sometimes you can opt to attack a ship youve approached, but I dont think Ive ever been able to talk my way out of being attacked. That lack of control over the outcome of conversations is a reminder that despite its open-galaxy map, Star Control: Origins (like all the Star Control games before it) is an adventure game rather than an RPG  which is fine, except that theres less value to replaying this 35-hour adventure. Navigating the galaxy to chase your quest objectives can be a hassle sometimes because, unless youre meticulously marking your map with the multi-colored marking tool, it can be a pain to find what youre looking for. If youre given a star systems name you can search for it in the map screen easily enough, but if someone asks you to travel to another species homeworld without mentioning it by name you cant just click on that races name on the map, even if youve been there before. Instead, you have to scroll through the detailed captains log screen until you find where theyve specifically been mentioned, at which point you can click on the name to auto-pilot your way to them. I can certainly understand not wanting navigation to feel so automatic that you barely have to look at the map, but putting it behind this much annoying menu fiddling is a step too far. Its also frustrating that Star Control: Origins doesnt keep track of which systems or planets youve already visited and stripped bare of resources (or passed over). Especially in the late game, it was aggravating to find that Id already been to a system a few days earlier. Star Control: Origins greatest sin, though, is that it failed to learn the lessons of the original Mass Effect. Remember how just about everybody loved that game except for the parts where you had to drive the Mako landing vehicle around empty planets? Star Control: Origins is a lot like that, except that its annoying driving makes up a much greater percentage of your playtime. Star Control: Origins' greatest sin is failing to learn the lessons of the original Mass Effect.Everything you do on a planets surface is boring at best and an annoying chore at worst. After a simple landing minigame (where success usually feels all but guaranteed but occasionally seems impossible) you zip across the colorful and visually interesting landscapes of your choice of what must be thousands of planets on the galaxy map. Thats all well and good  these tiny spheres range from hospitable Earth-like worlds to frozen wastelands to toxic, volcanic hellscapes to planets that seem to be made entirely of gold. But theres precious little to do there beyond driving over glowing pickups representing dozens of different elemental resources (almost all of which are effectively junk loot, since theres no crafting system to use them in) and finding crashed alien ships to salvage. On the aforementioned golden planets it can look suspiciously like something out of Sonic the Hedgehog as you zoom along picking up a long row of floating gold rings, but without any of the high stakes of that gameplay. That in itself would be boring, but like the Mako before it, Star Control: Origins landing vehicle is cursed by bouncy physics. Anytime your landing vehicle runs up against an obstacle its anybodys guess whether youll glide over it smoothly or bounce around wildly, potentially ending up facing 180 degrees from where you were intending to go. You cant actually flip over and get stuck, at least, but the unpredictability of it never stopped being annoying. Other than that, the only thing to do on planets is combat, but its absolutely dismal. Most planets are uninhabited or populated with mostly docile wildlife that barely even reacts to being shot (a rhino-like animal will charge you if you dont kill it quickly, but its kind of hard not to), and hunting them barely seems sporting. But fairly frequently youll find resource-rich worlds defended by utterly incompetent drones or turrets that are completely incapable of hitting a moving target unless its headed directly toward them. They can all be easily defeated by circle-strafing, but generally you can ignore them entirely and scoop up the resources theyre protecting as if they werent even there. That is, unless you manage to get your lander killed by one of the far more deadly natural hazards; then the drones might camp your landing site, destroying you instantly when you attempt to land again. And as far as Ive seen there are only two weapons available for the lander, but neither is fun to use. Once I hit the point about two-thirds of the way through the story where money no longer seemed to matter as much because I was able to get all the resources I needed from running the story missions instead of landing on planets, things improved considerably. The story became much more interesting and expansive, and boss fights and new enemy types made space battles even more diverse and challenging. Space is where the real action is, and the punchy, top-down arcadey space combat is the most fun I had in Star Control: Origins.Space is where the real action is, and the punchy, top-down arcadey space combat (which is almost directly lifted from the original games) is the most fun I had in Star Control: Origins. These one-on-one arena battles have a lot of variety thanks to a wide selection of offensive and defensive abilities. There are straightforward missiles, beams, and laser bolts, but also mines, area-of-effect attacks, shields, cloaking devices, speed bursts, and many more. Each ship gets a combination of two abilities in addition to its own speed, acceleration, turn rate, recharge rate, and durability, and that keeps dogfights interesting as you bounce off of planets gravity wells, warp through wormholes (which can also teleport projectiles), and pick up stat-boost items. Judging a targets trajectory well enough to peg it with a relatively slow-moving missile by while simultaneously shifting your own ships movement to avoid incoming fire is a good challenge, and outmaneuvering a slow, heavy-hitting ship with a nimble but fragile fighter craft feels great. It makes a lot of sense that this head-to-head combat was what Stardock chose to break out as its Fleet Battles multiplayer mode, which can be played against the AI (which actually gets tough!), online, or in local two-player mode. Like with Fleet Battles, in the campaign you can collect a fleet of ships to send into combat before you endanger your flagship (which must survive or its game over) but the vast majority of those I found felt pointless. If I was up against an inferior opponent it made the most sense to send in my much more powerful flagship to destroy it quickly; if I was facing a strong enemy, like a Scryve battlecruiser, the weaker ships in my fleet would be destroyed comically quickly with area-of-effect attacks and my flagship was the only one that stood a chance. It doesnt help that Star Control: Origins doesnt give you a view of the capabilities of your ships or your opponents ships at the moment youre selecting which one to use, so its extremely easy to pick one that has no chance at all against the attacker. Though the ships are in general creatively designed, I found it weird that even though this is a game about bolting alien tech onto your human-built spacecraft to dramatically improve its speed, capacity, and combat abilities, the look of your flagship doesnt change at all from start to finish no matter how many fancy engines and weapons you acquire. Thats especially bizarre considering that since this is a game that includes a highly customizable ship-builder tool for use in Fleet Battles that allows you piece together a custom craft from a healthy assortment of parts. When the technology is built in already, why would Stardock would completely miss this important, rewarding aspect of an action-RPG upgrade loop? Star Control: Origins does a great job of creating a new universe and stocking it with a diverse range of weird and funny aliens to fight in intense arcadey space battles. But everything youre forced to do on a planets surface is boring at best and an annoying chore at worst, and that kills a lot of momentum. Because of that, I didnt really start to click with Star Control: Origins until the last third of the campaign when money became mostly irrelevant and the focus shifted to its strong points of story and space combat.", "date": "Sept. 23, 2018"}
