Confusingly enough, this is the sixth version of the 3DS family of systems, and the second to drop the namesake 3D feature for the sake of a lower price. The original Nintendo 2DS is, without a doubt, the ugliest in the family, but does have an attractive price at only $79.99. The New 2DS XL is very pretty in contrast, with a middle-of-the range $149.99 price  $50 cheaper than the full-fledged New Nintendo 3DS XL  creating a nifty little package that feels great to play with just a small handful of problems. Shared Features On the surface, the New 2DS XL includes everything the New 3DS XL does in a smaller, better-designed package, just without 3D. The C-stick is still a little nub resembling a rubber trackpoint found on ThinkPad laptops, offering the same dual-stick experience as the New 3DS XL. It can get a bit uncomfortable for long stints of play, but it works for sporadic camera movement used in the Monster Hunter series or for quick inputs for attacks in Super Smash Bros. Its not perfect, but its definitely better than nothing, and is a feature the original 2DS lacks. Larger screens, exactly the same size as the New 3DS XLs (4.88 and 4.18), mark another obvious improvement from the original 2DS (3.53 and 3.02). Oddly, just like the original 2DS, the New 2DS XL keeps both the front and back-facing dual cameras, so you can still snap poor-quality photos in 3D even though it lacks the functionality to display them properly. Maybe Nintendo anticipates games someday that may need all three cameras to function probably, but otherwise it seems like an unneeded expense. Like previous Nintendo systems, the New 2DS XL can connect to WiFi, but with some frustrating limitations. If youre trying to connect to a public WiFi signal that requires a browser log-in, you wont be able to, unless Nintendo releases a patch someday to fix the issue. (Hint hint.) Not the most terrible issue if you can change router settings at will, but incredibly annoying if its your parents router or if you live in a dorm at a university. But Better If theres a reason to get a New 2DS XL instead of a New 3DS XL if money is no object, its that its smaller and considerably lighter, avoiding the somewhat top-heavy weightiness of the New 3DS XL by moving all of the aforementioned features and the speaker from the top screen to the base. The New 2DS XL actually weighs the same 9.2 ounces as the original 2DS but manages to subsist in the slimmer, more attractive clamshell package. The Home button and volume slider were also moved to accommodate the New 2DS XLs smaller size. Almost unnoticeable but not unappreciated, the volume slider is stickier on the New 2DS XL than it is on the New 3DS XL, making it a challenge to accidentally adjust the volume. The game card slot is smartly protected by a new cover, preventing accidental game ejects previous models are prone to. The cover also hides the slot for the Micro SD card, making it easier than ever to get to  no tools are required, as they are for the New 3DS XLs convoluted process. Overall, the New 2DS XL is significantly more comfortable to play than the New 3DS XL or the original 2DS. Its less-chunky bottom half fits easily in my hands comfortably, and unlike the New 3DS XLs sharp design, the shoulder buttons slight curve feels natural to press. The design change is small, but it certainly makes a big difference in play. I found myself using the ZL and ZR buttons to pan the camera in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate notably more often than on the New 3DS XL, all because they were more comfortable to use. Change Isn't Always Good The speakers, which were moved to keep the top screen thin, are awkwardly placed on the bottom of the New 2DS XL, causing muffled sound and odd vibrations when at max volume. Theyre technically in stereo, which is an upgrade from the original 2DSs mono speaker, but the sound is even more difficult to appreciate without headphones. I nearly missed the stylus entirely with its well-tucked-away slot next to the headphone jack, but its there in miniature. The unobtrusive size was most likely to keep the New 2DS XL as small as possible, but it is just slightly too short to be comfortable to use. Mirror Display I immediately noticed how much brighter the New 2DS XL's top screen is compared to the New 3DS XL's. However, that ~oooh shiny~ moment passed when comparing it to the New 3DS XL in other ways. Primarily, the colors displayed on the New 2DS XL are ever so slightly washed out. It's as if the picture's brightness setting was turned up too high, making the blacks less deep and the colors less vibrant. The contrast is lacking, and turning down the console's actual screen brightness doesn't fix the issue. Its another very modest difference that you might not notice just looking at it, but definitely discernible when comparing consoles side by side. The other noticeable difference is that the top screen is slick with a glossy coating. Though it looks sleek, it actively diminishes the angle of comfortable viewing. Seriously, this thing is so reflective you could spy on someone behind you with it, which is not great for playing in a well-lit environment. Power is the Answer Screen issues aside, the New 2DS XLs processor seems to pack even more of a punch than the New 3DS XLs. The New 2DS XL loaded Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate even faster than the New 3DS XL, both on startup and between areas. It also achieves the same enhanced draw distance, improved frame rate, and frame rate stability the New 3DS XL boasts when compared to older 3DS models. You can expect to play any New 3DS-exclusive games like Xenoblade Chronicles 3D on the New 2DS XL just as well, if not better  just without the 3D. The New Nintendo 2DS XL is an obvious upgrade over the ugly doorstop-like 2DS, and is a joy to play on. The hardware updates are welcome, and the processor is quick even when dealing with the most notoriously slow-loading games. The drawbacks come in the form of screen and audio quality, which prevents the New Nintendo 2DS XL from being a clear upgrade over the New 3DS XL. But if you want to play New 3DS exclusives like the upcoming Fire Emblem Warriors, and don't care about 3D, the $149.99 New Nintendo 2DS XL is a good choice.", "date": "July 14, 2017,"}
