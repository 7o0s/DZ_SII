Certainly of the console generation, but theres an argument to say this is the best in what used to be known as the Pro Evolution Soccer series since PES PS2 pomp even if the menus havent improved much since then. If you put a lot of stock in an alluring user experience, youll probably have a few gripes with PES 2020 (which I refuse to stop calling it, Konami). Even after a facelift, the menus are pretty bad; a forlorn love letter to an era of awful PS2 menu music and cluttered formation screens. Yes, the songs that play in the background are now a little less ear-offending than before, yet place PES next to FIFA 20s predictably slick, Sky Sports-aping presentation and this really is a Champions League vs Johnstone Paint Trophy scenario. It doesnt help that the menus bring quirks that don't just hinder, but hurt the user experience. For some reason, every time you try and sign a player through an agent menu in MyClub mode, it forces you to look at the potential transfers you could sign before bumping you back a screen, whereby you have to push the deal through again. Its as frustrating as watching Ashley Young dive about like he was auditioning for a role in The Swan Princess. Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. The thing is, skipping through ugly formation screens is an easy-to-forgive, fleeting annoyance when you finally get a ball at your feet and see what a (mostly) brilliant performer PES 2020 is on the pitch. Slower and more deliberate than FIFA 20, considered, measured passing combines with crunching interceptions, creating believable ebbs and flows in play. The build-up to goals is as satisfying as any football game I can remember in recent memory. Owing in large part to PES 2020s effortlessly believable ball physics, passing your way through the field to a goalscoring opportunity is a joy. Konamis ball has always led the field when it comes to seamless animation and this year is no different. Even after close to a hundred matches the bespoke twitches and constantly evolving movement of players can still surprise. The utter joy of PES is simple and has never been more pronounced than this seasons entry: even after 40-odd hours with the game, you can still see completely unique passes and assists. And, after all that build-up play, comes the shot at goal itself. Yes, shooting in PES 2020 is glorious. Compare it to FIFAs somewhat anaemic and predictable daisy-cutters and well, theres just no comparison to be made. Whether playing a controlled shot, a lob, a scything half volley, or even a simple 10-yard tap in, a combination of lovely, bespoke animations and enjoyable rumble feedback make every shot feel like a hair-raising event. The sheer variety of goals is also ahead of its EA rival, with patient midfield tiki-taka antics as likely to result in a bulging of the net as direct wing play. Taken as a whole, the on-the-pitch experience is a step up from PES 2019, and a cut above FIFA 20 - and thats surely the most important element for a football game. There are a couple of issues alongside the base level brilliance, however. Crossing is one area in which PES 2020 is extremely consistent but not in a good way. While the animations that power whipping the ball into the box always look great, there seems to be a weird physics quirk at play this year. Over the course of all my time with the game, Ive pinged hundreds of crosses into the box, yet more often than not, these flighted balls not only bypass attackers, they also fly past the defenders. About 60% of the time, crosses miss every player on the field entirely, often trickling out of play in slightly disappointing style. Though defending in PES 2020 is generally granite-strong and responsive, there are a few minor off-the-ball issues. While sharp interceptions feel sturdy and satisfying, centre backs occasionally down tools in annoying fashion. On several occasions Ive had centre-halves completely doze off, time seemingly standing still for them as they let an opportunistic striker beat them to a chipped through ball. Thankfully, these defensive brain freezes are rare enough that I can overlook a CB going AWOL every now and then. Defenders can also be outfoxed by a couple of new skills inspired by the legendary Barcelona schemer, Andrs Iniesta. Its a tad frustrating that these showy flair moves are difficult to pull off against the AI on all but the lowest difficulty settings, though theyre much easier to use online against fellow players. The Finesse Dribble lets you perform tight turns and shimmies by twirling the right stick, but while the animations look fantastic, I often found a double tap of sprint or a shot feint was more effective for beating a man than stick flicks. The Dummy Kick is more of a success story. Pressing triangle/Y just as you play a ball results in your player hitting a no-look pass; a technique that can drag the opposition out of position if you nail the timing. Pulling off this move makes me feel like a nonchalant badass. Not that dribbling past or generally outfoxing players in PES 2020 is easy. Unless youre playing on Amateur difficulty youll find the AI will win most 50/50 encounters (which technically makes them 49/51 encounters at best). Even when controlling Juventus hulking superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, the Old Ladys tree-necked colossus is as prone to being tackled as any jobbing lower-league player. Mercifully, its markedly easier to skip past fellow human players in online duels; whether playing simple Kick Off matches or ranked head-to-heads in MyClub, Ive lost count of the number of times Ive been left for dirt by a pacy winger under another players control. A special mention for Kylian Mbapp: the PSG phenomenon has single-handedly destroyed me in a half-dozen matches. Even after 40-odd hours with the game, you can still see completely unique passes and assists. As for modes, PES 2020 plays things a little safe. The returning Master League can still be fiendishly addictive, yet this manager mode is pretty much the same as its ever been, albeit with snazzier presentation. Regular training ground cutscenes now bookend chapters revolving around, say, an upcoming derby or the scripted loss of a star player before an important cup game. These cinematics either involve a custom-made coach or a host of legendary figures you can appoint as your manager, like a strangely svelte Deigo Maradona, Zico, or Bebeto. Theyre fairly well done, though the inclusion of a Mass Effect-style choice wheel, which lets you praise or criticise players, has no real bearing on how seasons play out. Aside from more in-depth transfers that involve more accurate player valuations and trickier negotiations, Master League essentially offers the same experience its been serving up for close to two decades. It can still easily swallow whole days of your life, and it can prove horribly moreish when it gets its teeth into you, but a little more invention would have been welcome. MyClub also returns in much the same format. Putting together a custom team by using scouts to sign players and by paying agents to buy stars remains addictive, even if the mode hasnt really evolved. While you can spend real-world money on MyClub coins (see the boxout below for more on that), its still simple enough to build a winning side by churning through objectives to earn free GP  say, by renewing player contracts or winning a match from a losing position. Building a ragtag team composed of bygone-era legends, big-name superstars and promising youngsters still gives my inner footy nut a weirdly paternal pleasure. With the focus on levelling up existing squad players rather than constantly forcing them out for new signings, it's easy to build up a real bond with your mishmashed group of comrades. MyClub has really struck a chord with me t The online action can be patchy every now and then, though. Ive experienced lag in both MyClub and the new eSports mode, where the latters online divisions and weekly competitions arent yet fully functional at time of writing. Most of the matches I play are buttery smooth, yet the odd game plagued with harsh server hitches never feels that far away. In PES defence, tweakable matchmaking options, like a parameter that prioritises stable connections, at least gives more patient players the chance to find smoother games at the expense of having to wait a little longer in online lobbies. Thanks to EAs colossal financial advantage over Konami, licencing in PES 2020 obviously remains an issue. Euro 2020 sides and teams from Serie A and Frances Ligue 1 all get their proper kits and badges, and theres even a noteworthy coup: this year, Juventus is an official partner of PES  an exclusive deal which sees the Italian giants appear as Piemonte Calcio in FIFA 20. Still, there are glaring holes when it comes to certain leagues. Unless youre a massive fan of the Danish Superliga or Thai League 1, the fact the English Premier League is still unlicensed is hard to stomach. Granted, at least the fake names make more sense now. Instead of say, West London, Frank Lampards Blues now appear as Chelsea B. As a general rule of thumb, unlicensed teams now get their real name with the addition of a letter signalling their kits colour, so Liverpool R rather than Merseyside Red. Its a small improvement, but a welcome one. Though the series licensing issues arent likely to be solved anytime soon, at least PES 2020 boasts the best player faces in the biz. Some of footballs top stars look downright gobsmacking this season. Whether its Messi and his gloriously unkempt ginger beard or Arsenals David Luiz appearing as every bit the glowering Sideshow Bob cosplayer he is in real life (complete with trademark wristbands), Konamis facial-scanning tech continues to astound. If you gave me the choice of playing with PES 2020s ludicrously life-like, ultra expressive stars and their occasionally fake kits or their slightly dead-eyed FIFA counterparts, Id probably choose Konamis unlicensed kickabout champs every time. Microtransaction Reaction Microtransactions predictably make a return to MyClub this year. Coming in the form of MyClub Coins, you can once again pay actual human money for the chance to buy randomly assigned top players, which still feels kind of gross. New Special Agents are swapped out weekly, giving you the chance to buy players from specific clubs for 100 coins  Arsenal may feature one week, PSG the next. Top Agents charge 250 coins to sign stars spanning PES 2020s entire player base, but quality isnt always guaranteed, with elite tier black level signings far less likely to crop up. It means youre more likely to get a Chris Smalling than a Virgil Van Dijk. On the UK PS Store, MyClub Coin packs range from 79p for 100, all the way up to 79.99 for 12,000. In PES 2020s defence, at least Konami gives you other options to sign stars that wont cost you a penny. Not only does it spit out free MyClub Coins for regularly popping back into the mode, like rewarding you 30 coins for logging in over consecutive days, the games free in-game currency can also be used to sign players. GP is handed out generously for winning matches, completing competitions, and ticking off simple objectives. Indeed, PES 2020 doles out so much GP, after just a weeks play I have a team starring Messi, circa 1986 Maradona, Willian, and Ronaldinho. Not a bad line-up, considering I never bought a single MyClub Coin. As GP is handed out so freely, it definitely eliminates some of the pay-to-win ickiness thats still attached to FIFA 20s FUT. I know it feels like Ive criticised eFootball PES 2020 a lot, but ugly menus and a slight lack of ambition can be forgiven when the on-field action is this awesome. Thanks to first-class animations, incredible shooting, and brilliant build-up play, PES has arguably never been more enjoyable to play. Presentation and licensing shortcomings rear their ugly heads for another year, but in spite of the overly safe returns of Master League and MyClub, this is a generous footy package. When it comes to class-leading quality on the pitch, PES is still in a league of its own.", "date": "Sept. 26, 2019"}
