You've probably heard of this series before -- it's the franchise that equips its heroes with extendable grappling hooks for arms and takes away the common platformer ability to jump. Yes, that's right -- you can't jump at all. So you instead have to strategically make use of the ceilings and walls around you as latch points -- sending out your bionic arm like Spider-Man shoots out his webs -- and swing yourself from place to place. It takes some getting used to, but Bionic Commando should ultimately feel fresh for anyone who's never tackled a 2D entry in its series before. And even if you have, chances are this particular installment hasn't ever come across your radar. The game pairs its side-scrolling, arm-swinging action sequences with some strategic maneuvering across a map screen, as you direct a helicopter to carry you into both hostile and neutral territories. Your ultimate goal is the rescue of the missing hero Super Joe, and you'll gather several gun and communicator upgrades along the way -- as well as farming collectible cartridges from fallen foes to extend your life meter and wire-tapping enemy communication networks to gain info about what the bad guys are up to. CLOSING COMMENTS Having never played this specific Bionic Commando game myself prior to this 3DS re-release, I've got to admit to being pleasantly surprised by how much is here for your investment of four bucks. The style and amount of content here rivals other great Game Boy games from Capcom in the early '90s -- fans of Gargoyle's Quest, which was re-released itself to the 3DS Virtual Console a few months ago, should especially take notice.
