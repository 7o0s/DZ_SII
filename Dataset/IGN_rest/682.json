These are lovingly handled remasters that bring out and preserve the beautiful art direction of the originals, and the upgrade to 60 frames per second lends even greater fluidity to all three Uncharted games already excellent gameplay. I only wish The Nathan Drake Collection presented itself more like a celebration of Naughty Dogs great series rather than a simple bundle of three admittedly brilliant games. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is now eight years old (read our original Uncharted: Drakes Fortune review), but you'd be hard-pressed to notice here. Though it certainly can't pass as a native PS4 game, remaster developer Bluepoint has upgraded just enough so that Drake's first outing still has those visual ~wow~ moments, and the doubled frame rate alleviates the original PlayStation 3 versions slightly sluggish aiming substantially. Otherwise, there are no gameplay enhancements to speak of, besides the welcome lack of Sixaxis control elements. Despite the fact that its successors improved upon it in every imaginable way, Drakes Fortune still feels like magic to play. Its play spaces feel ever so slightly constricted compared to the broader, more vertical designs of the later games, and I noticed a clunky character animation or two, but even by today's standards, it balances gunplay, platforming, and exploration with rare grace. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is on a whole other level however. (Read our original Uncharted 2: Among Thieves review.) Even compared to many PlayStation 4 games, the urban ruins of Uncharted 2's Nepal are absolutely double-take worthy. Theres an unbelievable amount of detail among the dilapidated buildings and rusted hulks of cars that have long since stopped running, and this remaster really helps it all sing. It's worth noting that though Bluepoint reportedly evened out the aiming mechanics for all three games, Among Thieves still feels half a step snappier than its predecessor, making its gunplay more immediate and enjoyable. Perfect pacing, excellent character banter, and incredible set pieces like the insane Nepal helicopter sequence make this the best game in the series. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Finally, we have Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception (read our original Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception review), a bigger, more narratively ambitious game than either of the previous two. It effectively delves deeper into Nates past, and his personal relationships, which are just as much a part of Uncharteds success as its gameplay. Right from the start, its cinematography frames Uncharted 3 like a big budget Hollywood film, and the increased visual fidelity and improved textures and character models really help complete the cinematic feel that Drakes Deception got so right the first time around. It might sound odd to complain that three beautiful versions of three excellent games is all you get in this package, but youll get little else from The Nathan Drake Collection. The new Speed Run mode is nothing but a timer in the corner, and along with the omission of the multiplayer modes from Uncharted 2 and 3 (which I honestly do not miss), theres a surprising lack of supplemental materials. You wont find any nice character bios, or concept art of the series many stunning locales here, which seems like a missed opportunity given how well Uncharteds universe lends itself to such content (and seeing the treatment Rare Replay got earlier this year). Though not a huge deal, I think Sonys flagship series deserves a bit more reverence than this package affords. Pros Excellent visual remasterSmoother gunplayWonderful charactersThree excellent games Cons Short on extras Missing bells and whistles aside, these three exemplary games have never looked or played better than they do here, so whether youve played them before or not, Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection should be in your library. These games have aged remarkably well, theyre still an absolute to play, and their characters are as charming and memorable as ever.", "date": "Oct. 1, 2015,"}
