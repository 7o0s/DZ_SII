However, with such a shallow pool of loot to change things up for repeated playthroughs, this action RPG leans a little bit on the repetitive side. Nine Parchments tells a light story of a group of drop-out wizard apprentices whove decided to skip their normal training regimen for a quick path to power by gathering artifacts. Its whimsical tone is very similar to developer Frozenbytes charming Trine trilogy, which makes sense because Nine Parchments shares the same fantasy universe. What makes Nine Parchments stand out from most other top-down shooters is its combat, which is all about zipping around the screen with a fun and useful blink teleport as you blast away at foes with an assortment of potent spells. Most of these powers are nothing too fancy.Each of the eight playable heroes begins with three distinct spells, but quickly level up and progress until they eventually gain a total of nine from over 40 decently fleshed-out available abilities. Most of these powers are nothing too fancy  for instance, some are fast-moving projectiles like fireballs, some are beams of ice or lightning, while others specialize in area-of-effect and damage over time. After a little bit of trial-and-error experimentation, I found myself seamlessly executing complementary combos like using my ice beam to freeze enemies, then switching to my main power spells to take them out permanently. Those enemies all come with elemental resistances and weaknesses, making it essential to pick a diverse set of powers as you level up, especially in single-player. It can definitely get a little frustrating when you square off against enemies that become nearly impossible to take down if you don't have the right type of spells. For instance, an Ice Hog can also have a fire resistance buff, making it immune to both Ice and Fire spells. If you choose to specialize in those elements, thats your worst nightmare. That said, if you are prepared with the appropriate spells, Nine Parchments allows you to blast through vulnerable foes with little to no effort thanks to a triple-damage modifier against appropriate targets. Thankfully, it does a great job mixing up the enemy types you face, and if you crank the difficulty up to the top setting enemy spawns are randomly generated. Since this is a co-op focused game, its important to make playing with friends easy, and Nine Parchments does a good job of getting people together. You can freely and easily drop in and out of a friends game in local or online multiplayer whenever you choose. On Switch, individual Joy-Con play is supported, but without the use of the second stick its much harder to aim, so I dont recommend that unless you have no other option. Nonetheless, playing with friends is when Nine Parchments is at its best. Playing with friends is when Nine Parchments is at its best. That said, it does get a bit more complicated when playing co-op as the difficulty scales when playing with other people. To compensate, you can strategize together and combine spell beams to create even more powerful magical abilities that work especially well against bosses. There were numerous occasions during my single-player playthrough where I died dozens of times attempting to take down a boss by myself, but jumping online and getting some help from a few friends made those same battles a lot more enjoyable. With a full group of heroes, we were able to combine all four of our spell beams together, creating a single super giant magic beam to finish of the boss. But unlike a game like Diablo 3, where massive replayability comes from the cycle of killing ever-more-powerful enemies to earn ever-more-powerful loot, Nine Parchments is underwhelming when it comes to opportunities for character growth beyond choosing your nine powers and finishing the campaign. The vast majority of the chests I opened contained exclusively XP, with the occasional cosmetic hat thrown in. The only other type of loot is the rare staves, which can give you a simple stat boost and can lead to side quests that unlock new characters. Those side quests act more as separate battle arenas inside of certain levels, where your only objective is to clear a room of enemies. Theyre short and fun, but extremely difficult with underwhelming rewards. However, one of Nine Parchments biggest flaws lies within its wonky save system. Its extremely frustrating that you can only have one save at a time per profile because if you started a game in single-player mode and want to switch to online multiplayer, you have to start over from the beginning. Your character's level and experience is saved but all of your story progress is completely wiped away, and theres no way to levels to get back to a level you want to play. Nine Parchments elemental magic action makes for a good co-op dungeon crawling experience. Its light on interesting loot, but big on whimsey and fast-moving action. If you plan on running through the campaign on your own, your run might be a little frustrating because you cant exploit every weakness, but having some friends join you on your quest evens the odds. But without the promise of exciting rewards for battling bosses, I soon ran out of reasons to replay.", "date": "Dec. 9, 2017,"}
