Like the Rival 600, the Rival 650 Wireless boasts two sensors (one for tracking movement and another for detecting lift-off from your mousing surface) seven buttons, eight-zone RGB lighting, and an adjustable weight system. So, whats different other than the lack of a wire? For one, the battery required to power the mouse adds a not insignificant amount of weight to the mouse. For another, the wireless freedom adds to the bill, but it still costs less than the stellar but expensive Logitech G Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse. Lets get to it and see how the Rival 650 Wireless performs in action and how it stacks up against its wireless rival from Logitech. SteelSeries Rival 650 Wireless  Design and Features Minus the cord, the Rival 650 Wireless is identical to the Rival 600 Gaming Mouse. It features a soft-touch plastic finish on the side grips and palm rest, and the left and right mouse buttons have a matte finish and a gentle concave shape that cradles each of your mousing fingers. The rubberized scroll wheel offers a pleasing, notched movement, and behind it sits a button to adjust the DPI sensitivity. On the left side are the two usual forward and back buttons along with a third button that sits just out of reach in front of your thumb. It comes unassigned and is programmable like the rest of the buttons, but you must adjust your grip and reach to engage it. You wont want to use it for any action you use with any regularity. The other two side buttons, however, sit just above your thumb right where you want them to be. They do not protrude too far from the side surface of the mouse so they stay out of the way when you don't need them. And they offer a gratifying click when pressed. The Rival 650 Wireless features the same 8-zone RGB lighting as the Rival 600. It looks like there are only four zones  the scroll wheel, the logo and the two strips on the palm rest  but each lighting strip has three programmable zones to bring the total to a colorful eight. You can certainly get creative with your lighting options. Underneath, the mouse serves up not one but two sensors. In addition to the requisite sensor to track movement  in this case, SteelSeriess TrueMove 3 optical sensor  it features a second depth sensor that detects when you lift the mouse off of your mouse pad. You can set the sensitivity for lift-off detection to prevent your cursor from moving when you lift your mouse up from the surface. The TrueMove 3 sensor is the same found in Rival 600 Gaming Mouse and has a range of 100 to 12,000 DPI. The Logitech G Pro's HERO16K sensor offers higher sensitivity up to 16,000 DPI. The mouse includes eight 4g weights. The sides of the mouse snap off to reveal slots for its adjustable weight system. The sides attach via magnets, which do an admirable job of keeping the sides steadily in place even during the most furious of gaming action and yet still make it easy to snap them off to add or remove weights. The mouse includes eight 4g weights inside a handy rubber case, and you can put four on each side of the mouse, which gives you some flexibility on how you want the weight distributed, from left to right and front to back. Even without a single weight added, however, the Rival 650 Wireless is a heavy mouse. Without any weights, it tips the scales at 121g and can go up to 153g with all eight weights on board. By comparison, the Rival 600 ranges from 96g to 128g, and the Logitech G Pro weighs only 83g. In addition to the weights package, the Rival 650 Wireless ships with a charging cable and USB 2.4GHz wireless adapter. The mouse is rated for 24 hours of continuous usage, and SteelSeries claims a 15-minute charge will provide 10 hours of battery life. SteelSeries Rival 650 Wireless  Software With the SteelSeries Engine 3 software, you can customize the Rival 650 Wirelesss settings and lighting. The software is exceedingly well designed and easy to use. There are two main tabs for the Rival 650 Wireless: Settings and Illumination. On the Settings tab, you customize any of the mouses seven buttons and set the sensitivity level for the mouses two DPI settings. Other mice offer more DPI settings, but I find two suffice because I use one for normal action and a lower setting for aiming with a sniper scope. Also on the Settings tabs is a Lift Distance slider that you can use to adjust the sensitivity of the mouse so it stops tracking your movement sooner or later when you lift the mouse up from the surface. I had trouble discerning much of a difference between the low and high setting, but fast-twitch eSport gamers will likely enjoy this performance tweak. On the Illumination tab, you can set the RGB lighting for the mouses eight zones. You can choose from a color picker and set different effects that include breathing or color-shift effects or a steady, always-on color. You will be hard pressed to find a more colorful RGB mouse. SteelSeries Rival 650 Wireless  Gaming I put the Rival 650 Wireless through its paces with CS:GO and Overwatch. With its soft-touch plastic surfaces, concave mouse buttons, and universal shape, I found the mouse immediately comfortable. SteelSeries calls its grip style universal, and I can see both palm and claw grippers happy with its shape. The slightly rounded palm rest provides enough of a platform for palm grippers, but the mouse still sits low enough that claw grippers will be comfortable, too. The mouse buttons offer a satisfying and quick click with just the right amount of travel. I also found the 12,000 DPI sensor to be super accurate  I did not find myself pining for a higher sensor like the 16,000 DPI unit of the Logitech G Pro. I was able to line up kill shots on both CS:GO and Overwatch quickly and accurately. I set up one of the side buttons in CS:GO to duck, when I found I preferred to using the default Ctrl key. It let me crouch and fire with better accuracy than needing to hold down the Ctrl key along with and one of the W-S-A-G keys to move my character. You may find, however, that a game supports only two of the three side buttons. CS:GO, for example, did not recognize the front-most side button and let me re-assign only the back two buttons that sit above your thumb, which youll likely use mostly for moving forward and back when browsing the web. The Rival 650 Wireless is one heavy mouse. The reason to go with the Logitech G Pro or another wireless mouse over the Rival 650 Wireless will not have to do with its performance but rather its weight. The Rival 650 Wireless is one heavy mouse. Without any of its weights added, it weighs nearly has much as the Logitech G Pro with all of its weights on board. I prefer a heavy mouse, and I found myself using the Rival 650 Wireless without any of its weights added. I liked the feel of it at its lightest weight, but I feel like I wont be able to take advantage of its weight system because its already as heavy as I want it to be with nary a weight added. The Rival 650 Wireless is a well-designed, comfortable, and accurate mouse. I have no complaints about its performance or design. Even the software is first-rate. And should you balk at its high price, you can quickly justify the cost by comparing it to the spendier Logitech G Pro. In the end, the decision on whether to pull the trigger on the Rival 650 Wireless will come down to weight, and only Heavy mouse aficionados need apply.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2019,"}
