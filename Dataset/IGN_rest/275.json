Attack on Titan Season 2 was worth the nearly four-year wait. Picking up where Season 1 left off, the first episode introduces a new story arc with familiar faces with a heightened sense of intrigue. Beast Titan opens with a quick flashback of some critical events from the first season. The flashback provides enough information to get even new viewers up to speed without weighing down the episode. The episode picks up significantly after that. There is a lot to take in as the episode moves quickly, but considering the cliffhanger we were left with in the last season, the fast pace is appreciated. Things jump between two supporting factions: Hange Zoe and her squad, and the members of the 104th training squadron. Zoewho has been holding things down since the season finaleand the other Survey Corp members discover the titan lodged within a wall. Shes angry, stressed and looking for answers that arent forthcoming. This is an excellent starting point for Season 2. I want to know what's going on with the folks who are in the thick of things. Of course, I want to know how Levi and Mikasa are doing, but there should be more opportunities to see things from the perspective of supporting characters. Thats the beauty of the show. The characters are developed enough that even the supporting cast can carry an episode or two. There are a few quick scenes featuring Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Erwin, and Levi. It's been a long time since we've seen them, but all I need to know is that they are alive and well. They don't need to be the driving force of every episode. It makes sense to see them in a state of recovery. Theyve fought long and hard, and deserve to rest. My favorite aspect is that the season starts off with plenty of suspense, especially with the discovery of new titans. Why is there a titan trapped in a wall? When Pastor Nick appears with an ominous warning for Zoe, its obvious he knows something the Survey Corps doesnt. Hes a powerful clergyman, so what is he hiding? What about the mysterious Beast Titan? Where does it come from? Why is it so intelligent? I have so many questions and Im excited to hopefully have them all answered throughout the season. With that said, one troublesome element of the episode was the quality of the animation. Some scenes were jarring as the animation didnt look as sharp and seamless as others. I noticed this particularly with the scene of Zoe and the crew on top of the wall, and saw other examples throughout the episode. Its at its worst in scenes where people are just standing around. Call me nitpicky, but I couldnt help but catch little details that could have been improved. Its only the first episode, so I hope this isnt an indication of what to expect from the rest of the season. While some scenes animation quality threw me off, the positives far outweigh the negatives. The last few years without Attack on Titan have been long, but the creators know how to keep me hooked as the first episode starts with the right balance of action and suspense. This new story has some shocking moments and a good amount of time spent with the supporting cast.", "date": "April 4, 2017,"}
