While it still has some substantial holes to fill in, UFC 3 is certainly the best game yet in the series, thanks to its fantastic overhaul of the striking system and the much improved, goal-oriented career mode. Its best moments, its a combat sports game that truly captures the excitement and depth of an MMA fight. However, the sleazy, microtransaction-infested Ultimate Team mode casts a dark shadow over it. UFC 3s biggest change to its usually exciting fights is the complete reworking of its striking system. Previous games adopted a Fight Night-style approach of using parries and counters, which always felt a bit out of place in an MMA fight. In UFC 3 there are no parries, but that doesnt mean there are no counters. You can now freely sway with the right stick to dodge and duck under punches and throw any punch or kick while moving  a combination that leads to a dynamic striking system that feels much closer to how actual fights in the UFC play out. Its super satisfying to be able to pick up on an opponents tendencies and punish them accordingly. If they have a penchant for throwing lots of straight jabs, for instance, that can be dealt with by swaying left and right as you move inside. That being said, theres a risk factor as well: swaying into a hook or ducking into an uppercut or knee can lead to big damage, which opens the door for all kinds of baits and mind games. It's super satisfying to pick up on an opponent's tendencies and punish them.One area that could still stand to be improved is the impact of all these strikes, which is inconsistent at best. Sometimes a knockout strike will look like it hits just right, giving that satisfying crack and appropriate collapse. Other times, youll get hit with a high kick in the armpit and fall face first on the mat. Even if it sometimes looks a little janky, the stand-up in UFC 3 is one of the best in the combat sports genre: it requires a ton of thought and stamina management, skillful use of your fighters combos, and a careful balance of offense and defense. It wouldve been nice to see the same attention paid to the stand-up spent on the ground game, which hasnt changed much since UFC 2. The biggest problem is that theres still just not enough information to let you know why youre losing a dominant position. More feedback with regards to whether you were too slow on a transition, dont have enough stamina, or pressed the wrong direction would go a long way, because as it is its hard to tell what went wrong when the tables suddenly turn. In single-player mode theres at least a prompt to let you know which direction you need to block, but its very light colored and sometimes can blend in with the mat. In online mode, no such prompts exist at all. It's hard to tell what went wrong when the tables suddenly turn.Thankfully, if you hate the ground aspects of MMA, UFC 3 includes both Knockout Mode and Stand and Bang mode, both of which remove the option to take your opponent down. Knockout Mode is particularly notable as it now has hilarious commentary from Snoop Dogg. Or, if you hate the striking, theres a new Submission Showdown mode that removes all strikes. Theres something for everyone. Also in the win column, UFC 3s new career mode is a big improvement over prior years. Like its predecessors (and career modes in virtually every sports game these days) you start with a fledgling fighter working your way up through the ranks to get to the UFC. The big, differentiating thing this time around is that you have a meaningful choice of how you want your character to spend the time between fights. First, you get to choose which gym to train in, each with its cost of membership and its own focus, whether it be boxing, wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or other forms of martial arts. But resources are limited and better gyms require more cash per week of training, leading to tough decisions regarding whether you want a gym thatll offer better training rewards but fewer weeks to train, or a lesser gym that will give you more weeks to accomplish everything you need to get done but smaller returns on your training. You have a meaningful choice of how you want your character to spend the time between fights.Once youve got a gym, you get 100 training points to spend for every week of training, and everything you do costs a certain amount of points. Train will allow you to improve specific stats through simulated exercises that have a small chance to injure you; Learn has you doing a minigame with a UFC fighter in order to add new moves and perks to your repertoire; Promote, gives you a number of choices of how you want to promote your upcoming fight, or otherwise spend your time without exhausting yourself; and Spar puts you in a 60-second practice fight in order to learn a weakness of your upcoming opponent. All of this adds up to one of the best thought-out and designed career modes Ive encountered in a combat sports game, with decisions affecting both the course of your career and how effective you are in your next fight. In the top 10, almost every fighter dwarfed my stats.The problem  and its a heartbreaking one that almost ruins an otherwise excellent evolution of career mode  is that the difficulty spike once you start getting into title contention is just straight-up unfair. I went pretty much undefeated until I broke into the top 10 with my character, and from there almost every fighter I faced just dwarfed me in terms of stats. Its not just the raw numbers, either: the AI just turns its skill up seemingly at random, leading to a feeling where youre only winning when it lets you. Stand-up fighters feel like they have impenetrable defense, and ground-based fighters make it feel impossible to get back up. I dont want to blow through the opposition unchallenged, but I also dont like getting my teeth kicked in without what at least feels like a fair chance to defend myself. Taking the fight online brings you to the usual suite of options, including a Quick Fight for casual play and the Ranked Championships mode returning from UFC 2 for the more hardcore crowd. Online play has been mostly fine in my experience, aside from the previously mentioned issue of having absolutely no feedback about why your transition blocks arent going through. UFC 3 brings back the controversial Ultimate Team Mode, but its important to note that everything involving loot boxes and microtransactions is effectively quarantined off to this mode. Which is appropriate, because many people will want to stay away from it. Ultimate Team Mode feels like it was built for a free-to-play mobile game.Ultimate Team Mode feels like it was built for a free-to-play mobile game. You have a team of four fighters that you can equip in the lightweight, middleweight, heavyweight, and womens bantamweight divisions, which sounds fine. The catch is that these fighters, along with the techniques and boosts that you can equip them with, come from cards that are only obtainable through random packs (ie loot boxes) using both earned in-game currency (coins) and, you guessed it, UFC Points that are bought with real money. The only way to have any choice in which fighters or moves you add to your collection is through the Item Scouting Shop, which has an inventory that refreshes every day. You can pay UFC points to lock an item in a certain slot, but theres no way to pay for any particular card with real money  you have to instead pay an absurd amount of coins. To be fair, there are a ton of ways that you can earn coins and packs. Youll get coins after every match, you can complete challenges that refresh daily in online matches, you can complete solo challenges, and you can complete sets by turning in cards you dont need that fit certain criteria. But still, the rate at which you can afford new packs is frustratingly slow. That leads to the biggest problem with Ultimate Team Mode: even if you completely removed microtransactions from the equation, the mode would fall on its face because the progression is painfully slow, the customization options are convoluted and random. Id much rather spend my time in any of UFC 3s other modes. EA went back to the gym with UFC 3 to work on many of the weaknesses that had the previous two games struggling to find their footing. A fantastic new striking system and a much-improved career mode lead the charge, but UFC 3 is still hamstrung by a cumbersome ground game, weird collision issues, and the straight-up terrible Ultimate Team Mode. Its still not a knockout, but Round 3 is UFCs best yet.", "date": "Feb. 1, 2018,"}
