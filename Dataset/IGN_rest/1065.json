The virtue is that, as a giant mech, you run around planets -- quite literally, in this case -- using their gravity to zip around a solar system-sized map, hopping from one world to the next and shooting opponents. The vice is that, well, thats about all there is to it. A paltry two modes, Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, are included. Deathmatch is self-explanatory; Orbital Warfare is a more strategic team-based affair thats essentially King of the Hill in space. At the outset, youre given full access to all of Orbital Gears 12 weapons and four Utilities, which also sadly means theres no progression system. The weapons will be familiar to anyone whos played a sci-fi FPS over the last 15 years, ranging from pulse rifle and flack cannon to grenade launcher and flame thrower. Many of the weapons seem to have an odd pause between depressing the fire button and discharge, though. While it makes sense for delayed action weapons like the chaingun, an instant-hit weapon like the Discharger suffers from having to tap the fire button twice. My favorite weapons are the grenade launcher, which can be used to exploit a planets gravity by firing bouncing balls of explosive energy onto its surface, and the Hornets gun that fires multiple enemy-seeking missiles at once. As cool as some of these weapons are, it seems like a missed opportunity to not make you work for them. The modestly helpful Utilities are temporary augments that can be activated at any time, coming in the flavors of a shield, speed boost, mines, and an orbiting satellite that fires at enemies. Match wins will come from strategy and skill with your weapons, though, not from this lackluster assortment of relatively weak extras. There arent too many surprises in level layouts, either. The six Deathmatch maps and three Orbital Warfare maps are pretty similar to one another with a couple notable exceptions, such as the Dark map in which all planets except for one glowing gas giant are kept practically invisible due to a lack of light, and the Fusion Core map that gets rid of planets altogether and features a series of girders surrounding what Im guessing is a fusion core. (Thank you, level namer.) They offer some different strategic elements (like camping in the dark), but from my experience most servers tend to stay with the more traditional maps. Another blow against its simplicity is that, while Orbital Gear can be a lot of fun for competitive play, and offers an arena for tense battles (I can see it being adopted by the esports community), the lack of a single-player mode is a problem. Mainly because, even a week and a half after launch, there are at most a small handful of servers available at any one time, and often none whatsoever. Without other people playing, a multiplayer online-only shooter is about as useful as a disconnected telephone. Pros Novel premiseFast-paced shooting Cons Loose controlsNo progressionHard to find opponents Orbital Gear can be a frantic shooter that pulls you in with its gravitational gimmickry, but lacks the forward momentum to keep me playing for long. It makes the mistake of giving you all the weapons up front, leaving you with nothing to work for. Worst of all, though, there just arent enough players around to keep this online-only multiplayer solar system occupied. <br/><Br/> <figure><img alt=~~ class=~image SCREENSHOT~ data-model=~image~ data-pk=~110249~ src=~http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_me/screenshot/default/gear_pj98.jpg~ /> <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption> </figure>", "date": "Aug. 22, 2014,"}
