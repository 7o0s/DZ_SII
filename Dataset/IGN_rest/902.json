In another case of art imitating life imitating art, those games are now being adapted back into comic form. Fables: The Wold Among Us #1 collects the first three chapters of this digital-first series. This comic serves both as an easy gateway into the franchise and a way for Fables veterans to return to a simpler time in the franchise's history. The Wolf Among Us #1 opens much in the same way the original Fables #1 did way back in 2002. The series flashes back to a time when the Fables still hid out their secret New York enclave and Bigby Wolf was the sheriff. Once again, Bigby has a mystery to investigate, though one slightly less dramatic than the murder mystery that drove the first arc of Fables. The premise allows co-writers Matthew Sturges and Dave Justus to rehash the basics of the franchise and the main characters without breaking the flow of the story. Newcomers will learn all they need to immediately know about Fabletown and its residents without being burdened by too much discussion of the Adversary and other conflicts that came to dominate the main series. The writers are more interested in exploring the character dynamics. Bigby is still very much an outcast among the Fables at this stage, the subject of plenty of mistrust and outright scorn. That colors his interaction with characters like Snow White and Beauty. For the most part, however, Bigby's interactions involve characters who play smaller roles (or no role at all) in the main series. We see more of the rivalry between Bigby and his hated enemy, the Woodsman. We see the bizarre friendship between the lone wolf and Colin the pig. There's a great, caustic relationship between Bigby and Mr. Toad (now reduced to the humble status of a tenement landlord). And above all, these issues are driven by the relationship between Bigby and a mysterious working girl who wanders into his path. It's that last pairing that really gives this book its flavor. The Wolf Among Us plays out like a detective noir in many ways. There's the loner hero, the seedy New York backdrop, the femme fatale who drops into said her's lap, and the overwhelming sense that all of this is building towards a grim conclusion. At times The Wolf Among Us feels almost too familiar when held against early issues of the main series. Luckily, this noir element is there to offset that sense of familiarity and give the book its forward momentum. This issue features three different pencillers, one for each chapter. The shift from one to the next can be a bit jarring, especially as the chapter transitions aren't all that obvious in the script. Steve Sadowski sets the visual tone with his thick blacks and heavy shadows, while Shawn McManus follows up with a somewhat lighter and looser approach. Of the three artists, McManus's style is the most traditionally Fables-esque, though Sadowski and Travis Moore's work is more in keeping with the darker tone of the script. All three pencillers are capable enough when it comes to bringing the story to life. All three tend to rely on fairly dramatic angles that keep even the dialogue-driven scenes visually interesting. Unfortunately, the digital format didn't really do the series any favors. Fables is normally a very vertically-oriented comic. Artists like Mark Buckingham are able to create a storybook feel despite the often mature dialogue and themes. The whimsical page borders go a long way towards creating that effect. But this issue has none of that. The panels are smaller and more cluttered, and the art isn't given quite as much room to breathe. On a final note, I have no experience with The Wolf Among Us in game form, so I can't speak to how much has changed in this adaptation or how closely the visuals adhere to the game's presentation. I can say that the issue never feels oddly paced, as if it's trying overly hard to mimic the beats of a game. It just reads like a Fables comic, and that's never a bad thing. Pros Authentic Fables feel.Accessible to newcomers.Injects a noir tone into the series. Cons The art lacks some of the charm of the main series. With the core Fables series ending in a matter of weeks, it's good to know we'll have at least one quality Fables comic on the stands for the foreseeable future. The Wolf Among Us is an enjoyable look back at a simpler time in the series' timeline. It combines familiar elements with a strong noir approach. And even if the art has its issues, the rotating team of pencillers keep the script humming along. Fans of the franchise should definitely give this comic a look.", "date": "Jan. 15, 2015,"}
