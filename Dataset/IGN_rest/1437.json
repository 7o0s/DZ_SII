Its two previous titles -- side-scrolling shooters known as Soldner X and Soldner X-2  were popular forays into a retro genre. And for its third outing, SideQuest Studios decided to throw a curveball in the form of an equally retro RPG called Rainbow Moon. Rainbow Moon may have a deceptive name suggesting that its more of an 80s cartoon than a hardcore role playing experience, but rest assured that its very much the latter. Taking inspiration from a variety of games from the past, Rainbow Moon combines obsessive grinding, equipment and character upgrading with strategy-based battling. While it doesnt quite soar to the heights occupied by the best RPGs ever created, its still a worthwhile purchase for those looking to dump scores of hours into something that we dont see too much of today: a bona fide old-school RPG. The plot of Rainbow Moon is simple and, like many old-school RPGs, largely unimportant. The games protagonist, Baldren, finds himself stranded on a mystical satellite aptly known as Rainbow Moon. The same dimensional rip that deposited him there also brought a plethora of monsters to the once serene moon, and its up to him, along with the various characters that join him on his adventure, to rid the moon of its unwelcome new inhabitants before getting back home. Dont expect a story in the vein of Final Fantasy VI or Wild Arms here; Rainbow Moon emphasizes mechanics and gameplay far more than plot. Mountains of roughly-translated (yet strangely endearing) text and an almost complete lack of character development affirm this fact. As soon as the game begins, it becomes impossible to ignore Rainbow Moons crisp graphics and vivid colors. Sure, the character designs leave something to be desired, but the enemies you fight might as well have been lifted straight out of Dragon Warrior on your NES. Battle a poison-hurling scorpion here, a laser-firing mech there, or a fast-moving zombie in another locale; the variety of enemies is fairly vast, but expect palate swaps as enemy types get stronger (no doubt a nod to the RPG glory days of yore). Rainbow Moon also benefits from a strong soundtrack with some truly catchy tunes and a limited voice track that gives virtually all characters you speak with quirky hello and goodbye sound bytes bound to put a smile on your face with their ridiculousness. But lets get down to the nitty-gritty: gameplay and, more succinctly, combat. As you explore, youll run into enemies both directly (like in Chrono Trigger) and via random battles (like in Final Fantasy IV). Regardless of how an enemy party is engaged, things typically play out the same way. Your party  which can consist of up to three characters at a time  will be pitted against a hostile crew that may only contain a single enemy, 20 enemies, or anywhere in between. Even if the way you initially get launched into battle proves conventional, the actual fights themselves are anything but. Dont assume youre going to get a deep combat experience like Final Fantasy Tactics here, but youll still get something very much inspired by that kind of game. Turn-based combat plays out on a grid, forcing you to think more tactically than many other games in the genre. Your characters will have various skills at their disposal, varying speeds at which they move, and even a certain amount of moves they get to execute each turn. Enemy and character strengths and weaknesses also play a huge part in combat. Fighting is only marginally deep, but still exceptionally satisfying and quite different from what youd find in other likeminded games. Outside of battle, Rainbow Moon assaults players with all manner of options, upgrades, equipment and more. The games two currency types  Rainbow Coins and Rainbow Pearls  serve different purposes that make your party stronger in equally different ways. Coins purchase items, weapons, armor, skill scrolls and more, while Pearls upgrade specific character traits ranging from strength and defense to speed and luck. Purchased equipment can be further upgraded by using items found during and after battle. These items provide varying types of permanent statistical boosts to your gear that can make a strong character setup even stronger. All of these features mix seamlessly with a fairly straight-forward questing and side-questing system thats shallow on story but still fun to work your way through. The main quest often sends you from character to character for brief conversations, an occasional fetch quest or a foray into a deadly dungeon. Side quests have you doing all kinds of activities, from retrieving lost items to killing devious enemies. Combined with Rainbow Moons vast map to explore  rife with geographic diversity and plenty of territory to cover  the game is dense. For the audience that this game is aimed squarely at, thats a good thing. CLOSING COMMENTS I played Rainbow Moon for over 30 hours on hard difficulty and still have so much more to do on both the main quest and various side quests I encountered. A representative from the developer told me that he spent more than twice that much time with the game, and that even shooting through the main quest on standard difficulty without exploring and doing side quests will take longer than my time investment. This is only supported by the fact that theres a Trophy for spending 100 hours with the game, a Trophy that wont be difficult to obtain if you really try to see and do everything in Rainbow Moon. Rainbow Moon also has a Platinum Trophy, a rarity for downloadable games, so the investment may very well be even more than that. At the end of the day, the rub with Rainbow Moon is that its a time investment, and its not a time investment those of you who dont like grinding RPGs will want to make. But for those of you that do enjoy a solid, old-school grind, spending time with Rainbow Moon is time well spent, especially considering Rainbow Moon costs a meager $15. Put bluntly, thats a hell of a value. Put more bluntly, Rainbow Moon is a lot of fun, and RPG fanatics should play it. IGN RATINGS FOR RAINBOW MOON (PS3) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 7.0 Presentation A rough translation of a shallow story doesnt bring the entire package down. Rainbow Moon totes quick load times and easy-to-navigate menus. 7.5 Graphics A colorful palate makes Rainbow Moon pop. Animations are a little stiff and character designs wont blow you away, but Rainbow Moon was called pretty by several of my co-workers over the last few weeks. 7.5 Sound There are some great tracks in Rainbow Moon that really keep with the games old-school vibe. Theres no voice acting per se, but thats okay. This game derives its inspiration from an earlier time. 8.5 Gameplay Rainbow Moon shines here with tactical battles complementing a host of upgrades, making it both highly rewarding and heavily customizable. 9.0 Lasting Appeal If you want to get a Platinum Trophy, youre looking at 100 hours at the least. But even if you opted to blow through the game in 40 hours, you still get incredible value for your $15 investment. 8.0 OVERALL Great (out of 10) Pros Vivid, colorful graphicsEnjoyable combat systemVast world to exploreLots of upgrading and customization Cons Weak story and character development I played Rainbow Moon for over 30 hours on hard difficulty and still have so much more to do on both the main quest and various side quests I encountered.
