But until recently, most 1440p ultrawide gaming monitors have been limited to 100Hz or 120Hz refresh rates. MSI is pushing the envelope with its MPG341CQR ultrawide, which aims to be a 34-inch, 144Hz gaming ultrawide with fewer sacrifices. MSI lent us a unit to see it if it lives up to the promise of its spec sheet. MSI Optix MPG341CQR - Design and Features The $800 MSI MPG341CQR is a monitor made for gaming, no doubt about it: between its ultrawide aspect ratio, frameless bezels, and RGB lighting along the bottom and rear of the display, it has a distinct gamer aesthetic. That includes the sharp angles and copper accents on the stand, which is tilt, swivel, and height adjustable. The RGB lights are configurable through MSIs Mystic Light engine, though the fragmentation of the Mystic Light software makes this a bit confusing. I tried three different MSI programs before I found one that could control both my MSI monitor and my MSI motherboardDragon Center, which makes no mention of monitors or motherboards on its home pageeven then, I couldnt get the two pieces of hardware to sync properly. MSI really needs to simplify its software offerings. The MPG341CQRs curved VA panel sports a resolution of 3440x1440 with a super-smooth 144Hz refresh rate, 34-inch diagonal size, and FreeSync 2 built-in. I also found that it worked with Nvidia's G-Sync using a GTX 1660 Ti. Those are some pretty impressive specs, and MSI tops it off with HDR400 support. HDR400 isnt that impressive, given that its the bare minimum a display needs to gain the HDR label, and the MPG341CQR doesnt provide enough brightness or any local dimming features to truly take advantage of HDR signals. But youll be able to send HDR content to the display without getting incorrect colors, so at least its something. Since Nvidia now allows for experimental variable refresh rates on FreeSync gaming monitors, I tested the MPG341CQR with G-Sync as well by enabling the feature and running Nvidia's Pendulum Test. I was able to eliminate screen tearing without any visible artifacts or other issues, so while it isn't strictly validated by Nvidia as being G-Sync compatible, this monitor's variable refresh rate feature should work with Nvidia cards as well. Few other monitors can match these specs, with the LG 34GK950F being the MPG341CQRs chief competitor. LGs offering, however, uses an IPS panel rather than VAmeaning better response time and color accuracy, but lower contrast ratio, which can make things look washed out (especially when gaming at night). MSI boasts a 3000:1 contrast ratio for its display, meaning youll get darker blacks and a more vivid image. (It also claims to have a 1ms response time, but these values are rarely trustworthy, and as a VA panel its likely to be a bit higher than monitors with other types of panels.) IO is plentiful, with two HDMI port, one DisplayPort, and one USB-C port for video input, with the USB-C port also supporting charging up to 5V/3A. You also get three USB 3.1 gen1 portsone on the back and two on the side, with one of the side ports supporting quick charging up to 18W. Finally, youll find headphone and microphone jacks on the side, which can receive signals from your PC using the 3.5mm jack on the back, and an upstream USB port on the back of the monitor that can send data signals to your PC (say, for Mystic Light syncing). This also connects the monitors built-in 720p webcam to your computer, though the webcams weird placement at the bottom of the monitor makes it less than ideal for video chats. Finally, you can adjust the displays settings using the joystick nub on the back of the monitor. This is still the most convenient on-display method of navigating an OSD, and Im always happy to see it instead of the typical four or five buttons that come on cheaper models. (Alternatively, MSIs Gaming OSD program will you adjust settings with your mouse and keyboard.) The MPG341CQR is flush with options, from the typical brightness and contrast picture settings to a Night Vision mode that lightens the black level, a Screen Assistance setting that applies a crosshair to the middle of the display, and a Refresh Rate setting that displays the refresh rate in the corner. You also get some motion blur and response time features, which Ill discuss in more detail below. The Gaming OSD app even lets you switch between settings profiles using facial recognition, if multiple users share the computer. MSI Optix MPG341CQR - Testing As with every monitor we review, I ran the MPG341CQR through some of Lagoms LCD test patterns to evaluate its performance. Black and white levels were right where they should be, with both the blackest and whitest squares in each test pattern being barely distinguishable from reference black and whiteand the black is quite dark compared to monitors with TN and IPS displays. Gamma was a bit low at around 2.1, though, which means the image may look just slightly washed out compared to monitors with gamma closer to the desired 2.2. There was no visible banding on gradient patterns, though, which is always a plusbut I did notice a bit of screen-door effect on large areas of solid color, likely due to the subpixel layout of this particular panel. Its subtle, and some people may not notice, but eagle-eyed users may be able to spot it. It didnt bother me too much in regular use, though. Since this monitor uses a VA panel, response time is inherently going to be slower than TN and IPS panels, which can lead to ghosting in the image. Lagoms response time test uses an animated GIF that shifts multiple squares of pixels between two shades of grey. If they produce noticeable flickering, that means the response time is slow, and will produce ghosting. The MPG341CQR performed decently for a VA panel, with noticeable but not strong flickering in the three darkest transitions. Blur Busters UFO test, similarly, showed some ghosting trails behind the UFO, but it wasnt the worst Ive ever seen on a monitor. Few other monitors can match these specs. Many VA panels have an overdrive feature that helps improve response times and reduce this ghosting effect, and the MPG341CQR is no exception. However, I found that its overdrive featurecalled merely Response Time in the on-screen displaydidnt have a huge effect. The Normal, Fast, and Fastest settings all produced very similar results, with moderate ghosting in both Lagoms flickering GIF and Blur Busters UFO animation. Leave it set to Fast and call it a day. The Anti Motion Blur setting, on the other hand, should be avoided at all costs, as it creates heinous motion artifacts and disables FreeSync. Finally, viewing angles are what you would expect for a panel of this typenot terrible, but not as good as IPS panels either. The curve helps alleviate this, and as long as you sit dead centerwhich is usually the case with PC monitorsyou shouldnt notice major color shifts. On an all-black screen, I noticed very little clouding in the corners, too. MSI Optix MPG341CQR - Gaming Firing up an actual game is where the MPG341CQR really shines. Its 34-inch size coupled with the 21:9 aspect ratio and 1440p resolution make for a pretty fantastic gaming experienceits big and engaging without being too over the top, like some may feel about other monitors. Its still a bummer that many games render cutscenes in 16:9 with black bars on the side, but most modern games at least support ultrawide aspect ratios for actual gameplay, so its still well worth stepping up from a traditional 16:9 monitor. Couple that with a super smooth 144Hz refresh rate, and youve got a recipe for a pretty great experience. The furious, fast-paced action of games like DOOM and Overwatch are sights to behold, provided you have the graphical horsepower to take advantage. Even the hardiest GPUs would struggle to hit 1440p at 144Hz today in most games, but I didnt have a problem doing so in less taxing games like Overwatch. Besides, it leaves you a bit of room to grow, and resolution scaling can help bridge the gap somewhat as well. Firing up an actual game is where the MPG341CQR really shines. The only real downside to this monitor is the ghosting, and while it isnt as bad as some other displays, I wish the overdrive feature worked better so I could adjust this to my taste. If youre sensitive to ghosting, youll have to decide whether its worth the other tradeoffs, but Id wager most gamers wont notice it too muchand theyll appreciate the improved contrast ratio over similar IPS displays. All told, though, you arent going to find many other monitors with these specsmost require you to compromise on either the smooth motion or the high resolution. At 32-inches, 3440x1440p, and 144Hz, it doesnt feel like Im sacrificing much when I game on this, and considering its main competitor is $200 more with worse black levels, the MPG341CQR gets a thumbs up from me. The MSI MPG341CQR boasts a combination of specs you wont find on many other monitors, which makes for a compelling package, even at $800.", "date": "Oct. 6, 2019,"}
