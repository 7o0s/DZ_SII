The Dome is long gone, but its spirit lives on in Madden NFL 22  though not necessarily in the way EA intends. This years version seeks to capture the earsplitting crowd noise that was once the Metrodomes calling card with new homefield mechanics, and it succeeds sort of. But while its a functional way to experience football, its also charmless and frequently strange  the video game equivalent of navigating a concrete concourse under a dirty teflon roof.After planting its flag last year with Next-Gen Stats  a system that uses on-field cameras to produce more refined if not always noticeable improvements to the animation  Madden NFL 22 takes the same slow and steady approach that has characterized the pace of improvements to the franchise over the past decade. Visually, it does not appear to be a large step up from the version of Madden 21 that ran on the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X, though it is noticeably smoother when running in the 60fps Performance Mode (or 120fps on Xbox Series X). Its familiar enough that, after my first few hours with Madden NFL 22, my immediate reaction was to say, Yep, its definitely Madden  which is to say that the odd glitches, clunky interface, and slightly robotic animation continue to be very much in play. This has been the Madden experience in a nutshell for many years now. Its a grab bag of experiences and ideas, some of them decent, many of them undermined by poor execution and a lack of polish. Its hard to pick any one area where this years version truly excels; almost every one of its best features is done better by one of its major competitors like 2K or Konami. Its biggest success over the past five years is probably the X-Factor system, an arcadey but fun way to differentiate certain superstars by granting them certain special abilities, which is likely the biggest reason that Madden NFL 22 is dredging up NCAA Footballs old homefield advantage mechanics and calling them M-Factors.I've been arguing that Madden should add homefield advantage for years now.Homefield advantage is Madden NFL 22s most notable new feature, impacting virtually every one of its modes in one way or another. It seeks to shake up the in-game atmosphere, which has been lackluster for years, and add an additional layer of strategy to boot. Its not a bad idea on the face of it; yes, its a feature arguably being recycled from a series thats almost a decade old now, and you can goof on the notion of homefield advantage when many teams in the NFL has long since priced out their most dogged fans, but the truth is that homefield advantage is still very much a factor in cities like Seattle and Green Bay  a factor that has never really been reflected in Madden. Frankly, Ive been arguing that Madden should add homefield advantage for years now, so Im glad to see it finally here.Five of Madden 22s Most Notable ChangesMadden NFL 22 once again includes a large number of updates and tweaks, some of which arent always obvious at first glance. Pretty much every mode has received an update of some sort, even if its only an update for the existing mechanics. Here are some of the highlights:Homefield advantage seeks to capture an actual gameday atmosphere: Madden 22 incorporates homefield advantage via a new momentum meter. Making a big play or scoring will push the momentum toward your team, unlocking perks like increased stamina. Home teams all have unique perks designed to reflect their history and real-life atmosphere. Its a smart addition, but the balance of the momentum swings need further refinement.Face of the Franchise now lets you play defense: Where previous versions of Face of the Franchise only let you play on offense, this years version lets you play as an up-and-coming linebacker. Practically speaking, the story is the same, the main difference being the defense-oriented challenges that are presented. Face of the Franchises deficiencies remain, but its not a bad way to improve your skill at controlling a player in the middle of the field.Career mode lets you hire offensive and defensive coordinators: In the real NFL, offensive and defensive coordinators are almost as well-known as the head coaches. Madden NFL 22 now makes it possible to hire (and fire) offensive and defensive coaches at will, each of which have a unique skill tree that offers buffs to certain position groups. I like the idea behind it, but its rough interface makes it feel a bit cobbled together, and there are virtually no consequences for simply firing a coordinator and hiring someone else. Like many of Maddens ideas, its a start, but it could be taken so much further.The Yard introduces a campaign mode: Fans of Maddens co-op mode will find a new campaign mode featuring unique stages, challenges, and bosses. The mode is divided into four chapters, each featuring a unique venue with its own house rules. The Yard is Maddens other half  a surprisingly fully-featured co-op mode that dispenses with any hint of realism in favor of pure arcade silliness. If its to your taste, there are plenty of enjoyable hours to be had with The Yard. Madden Ultimate Team overhauls how it handles chemistry: Madden Ultimate Team doesnt feature many notable updates this year, but fans will be happy to know that its updating how its handling chemistry  a sometimes-finicky mechanic that governs the stat boosts that your team receives. It mostly amounts to condensing the existing feature into items that can be equipped to your squad. Of course, it must be said that Madden Ultimate Team and modes like it remain controversial, owing to their reliance on microtransactions, which have recently come under fire from international governments who argue that they constitute a form of predatory gambling.As for whether it works... Im not entirely sure yet. The idea is that a little momentum meter will tick up whenever a team makes a big play, unlocking perks like stamina boosts while potentially scrambling your opponents playart and causing the screen to shake. Away teams can even flip the script by silencing fans and unlocking perks of their own. Its all fine in theory, but the momentum doesnt quite ring true to me. In one game playing as the Browns, I unleashed a bomb to Odell Beckham, scoring a touchdown and taking the lead. A clear momentum swing, right? Clevelands fans would be going out of their mind. But the best I managed was to reset the momentum back to neutral.Momentum doesn't quite ring true to me.Its clear to me that theres still some tinkering to be done with the balance of the M-Factors, and the development team seems to know it too  due to balance issues, only a handful of them are available in Madden Ultimate Team. The spotty execution is likewise in evidence in the remastered gameday audio, which will cut out whenever the camera cuts to an exterior stadium shot, and the new presentation, which is frankly not good. Putting aside that it looks nothing like an actual TV broadcast, it tinges much of the graphics in a sickly shade of green, which for whatever reason I found very off-putting.Other ways in which Madden almost comes together but doesnt quite manage it are evident throughout. The interface is actually a step back this year, cramming together information in a mess of text and overlapping menus that somehow manage to be more confusing than ever. This, in turn, hampers its player avatar  a decent idea that feels more confusing than it should owing to how opaque even basic functions like character progression can be. Elsewhere, Madden NFL 22 has effectively thrown up an under construction sign, acknowledging that the much-needed scouting overhaul for career mode wont be available until after launch.Madden NFL 22 has effectively thrown up an ~under construction~ sign.Its most thoughtful updates tend to be the ones that pass unnoticed by fans. For instance, Madden NFL 22 introduces halftime adjustments, a small but significant new feature that has a notable impact on in-game strategy. If your opponent is burning you deep with Tyreek Hill, you can choose the Defend Deep Pass option at the expense of giving up shorter passes. Or if youre in the lead, you can choose to focus on running the ball. Simple. I wish Maddens features were always this straightforward.This is where I reveal that Im mainly a sim player, with the bulk of my playtime being devoted to my long-running online league  a sports genre rarity that I appreciate a little more with each passing year. Most Madden fans will tell you that Franchise mode has been disappointing over the past decade or so, with EA only relenting and committing to substantial updates to the modes after heavy backlash on social media. This is the first year that we get to see the fruits of EAs labor, and the results are decent, if a bit mixed. Playing as the Buffalo Bills, I was pleased to see a short in-game cutscene acknowledging the magnitude of an upcoming playoff game with the New England Patriots. Such story moments have been sorely lacking from Maddens franchise mode over the years, and they go a long way toward imbuing each season with a sense of narrative.I was pleased to see a short in-game cutscene acknowledging the magnitude of an upcoming playoff game.Still, Maddens franchise mode has a ways to go before it catches up with the competition. Its version of the salary cap bears little resemblance to the real-life NFL, with no ability to restructure contracts or convert money into bonuses. Special teams are an afterthought  a shame, given that undrafted players who eventually develop into stars, such as Vikings receiver Adam Thielen, frequently come from the ranks of special teamers. And even the meaningful additions  like the ability to hire and fire coordinators who confer buffs to different parts of your team  have a brutalist feel to them thanks to the ramshackle nature of the interface. What We Said About Madden NFL 21Madden NFL 21 is a great example of why competition breeding innovation is a good thing. Without a comparable NFL experience on the market, EA has allowed its marquee sports franchise to fall behind in almost every significant way. In a world where its contemporary sports games continually evolve with innovative new game modes like NBA 2K20s Neighborhood, deep franchise options like MyCareer, MyTeam, and MyLeague in the NBA 2K series, or even the cinematic story mode from EAs own Fight Night Champion  a boxing game from 2011  Maddens lack of innovation has reached a tipping point. There is no excuse for Maddens stagnation. I appreciate the tweaks to the core gameplay and the chaotic novelty of The Yard, but that isnt enough to make me want to sing its praises.  David Jagneaux, August 27, 2020Score: 6Read the full Madden NFL 21 reviewI think at least some of my problems with the mode can be summed up in a recent conversation where I asked a producer why it wasnt possible to include legends like Randy Moss in the fantasy draft, wondering if it was an NFLPA issue, and they admitted that it simply hadnt been considered. This is a feature, I should mention, that has been in both NBA 2K and MLB The Show for years now. Maddens franchise mode lacks that joyful sense of wish fulfillment that accompanies the best career modes, its rigidity betraying Maddens overall lack of verve and creativity.Whatever sense of joy Madden might have seems to be reserved for its resident arcade modes.Whatever sense of joy Madden might have seems to be reserved for its resident arcade modes, which are, for the most part, a cut above the core simulation modes. Launching The Yard or Superstar KO is a bit like stepping into a different game entirely, with the stadiums, menus, and even the color palette shifting into a brighter, more hyperactive mood meant to elucidate the chaos of backyard football. These modes tie in much more firmly into the player avatar who sits front and center on the main menu screen, with progress in The Yard applying to Face of the Franchise, and vice versa.It seems clear that Madden NFL 22 is trying to establish a centralized experience akin to its competitors, with progress in one mode unlocking global rewards like cosmetics in others. Its not quite there yet, though, and much of the blame can be laid at the feet of the interface, which consistently hides its rewards behind one too many button presses. It doesnt help that none of the rewards apply to the core career modes, which means were being funneled toward arcade modes like The Yard and the ever-present Madden Ultimate Team so we can climb on to the neverending game-as-a-service treadmill. MLB The Show works because it offers balanced rewards for all of its modes; in Madden, the modes still feel too siloed away from one another, which makes the global awards it does offer feel ultimately underwhelming for anyone who isnt heavily invested in The Yard.Face of the Franchise is short, pointless, and ugly.Of course, even if EA does refine its interface and improve on its global rewards, none of it will matter much if it doesnt fix Face of the Franchise, arguably a symbol of everything that ails the series. Ostensibly Maddens flagship story mode, Face of the Franchise is short, pointless, and ugly. It takes a good idea  letting us live out the dream of getting drafted into the NFL and playing out a career  and utterly fails to execute on it.How does Madden NFL 22 differ on Xbox One, PS4, and PC?Madden NFL 22 is more focused on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S this year, fully completing its transition to the new generation of consoles. However, it hasnt left the Xbox One and PS4 entirely behind. The previous-gen version includes many of the individual improvements to the modes, such as The Yards new campaign and updates to Face of the Franchise. However, the PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions wont include the touted Homefield Advantage improvements, nor will they feature the enhanced animation introduced in last years version. This will leave the PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions feeling much as they did last year. In a practical sense, this means it will move at a slightly faster pace, but cutback animations and jukes in particular will feel less refined. The differences arent as sharp as you might think, though  absent the enhancements to the gameday atmosphere, the two generations look and feel surprisingly similar. The biggest difference is apt to be in Madden NFL 22s new performance mode, which pushes the framerate to 120fps on Xbox Series X|S.Also, EAs ~Dual Entitlement~ system returns, but with a catch. While you can still technically upgrade to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S version of Madden NFL 22 for free, its only available through the special MVP Edition, which costs $99. Face of the Franchise once again casts your customized character as a young star on the rise, with a story built around a series of challenges and story moments en route to the NFL Draft. College football games return in a neat bit of set dressing, but are hardly integrated into the overall story and quickly forgotten. The handful of choices you make  whether to attend a Nike event or take the team out to dinner, for example  are almost always a strictly mechanical means of boosting your stats or earning more currency for purchasing in-game items, with little impact on the story. The impact of the story choices you do get to make, such as when you talk to scouts before the Draft, are hazy at best. And when the second season of your NFL career rolls around, your character is still referred to as a rookie, as if Roger Goodell hit some cosmic reset button.As with everything else in Madden, an extra layer of polish would do Face of the Franchise a world of good.This is Face of the Franchises third year, and its hard to get a read on EAs intentions for the mode. Is it story-driven wish fulfillment? A glorified tutorial? All of the above? I have a sneaking suspicion its that last option, which is why it feels so messy and unfocused. As with everything else in Madden, an extra layer of polish would do Face of the Franchise a world of good  a character progression system that isnt needlessly obscured, a better sense of how rewards can be spent across the various modes, and a finale that doesnt consist of a handful of NFL players offering congratulations in hastily recorded cellphone videos. Maddens biggest problem seems to be that its trying to be all things to all football fans. It wants to be an in-depth sim and a silly arcade game and a competitive multiplayer game, and it wants to do all of it with roughly 10 months of development time per year.With the new console generation fully underway, I get the impression that Madden would like to be perceived in the same light as SoFi Stadium or Allegiant Stadium  a glittering showcase arena for football. But its still much closer to the multipurpose stadiums of old; the big concrete bowls that would host baseball on Saturday, football on Sunday, and monster truck rallies on Monday. The NFL long ago abandoned multipurpose stadiums like the Metrodome, recognizing that their dedication to utility meant that they could provide a gameday experience that was at best functional. As Madden looks to the future, it might want to consider how it can learn from the NFLs example. Madden NFL 22 is a grab bag of decent  if frequently underwhelming  ideas hurt by poor execution. Face of the Franchise, to put it mildly, is a mess. Homefield advantage is a solid addition, but it doesnt quite capture the true extent of real on-field momentum swings. The new interface is an eyesore, and the new presentation is cast in a strange and unflattering shade of sickly green. Its smoother and marginally more refined, but in so many ways its the same old Madden. In short, if youre hoping for a massive leap forward for the series on the new generation of consoles (or on the old ones), youre apt to be disappointed.", "date": "Aug. 20, 2021,"}
