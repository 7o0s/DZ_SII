It's a desire that comes through in its environments, with their gleaming sci-fi structures set against rolling green hills; in its aliens, with their brightly colored armor and guttural muttering; and in its sweeping backstory, which feels under-explained without the free companion graphic novel. Unfortunately, while Midnight Star hits all the right aesthetic notes  hardly surprising, as its development studio was co-founded by one of Halo's creators  its gameplay falls short, and all that stuff becomes window dressing for a mildly enjoyable, ploddingly repetitive, free-to-play shooting gallery. To be fair, Midnight Star does a decent job addressing one of the key failings of first-person shooters on mobile devices: the awkwardness of moving and aiming with a touchscreen. Movement is handled automatically, with Lt. Charlie Campbell trudging through nicely rendered alien scenery between bouts of blasting apart enemies. You're therefore free to focus on aiming  and, as the enemy indicators to your sides light up, turning to deal with the threats that continually try to outflank you. They don't try very hard, though. At the default ~normal~ difficulty, your enemies seem more interested in stepping out of cover and staring at you than in actually shooting, and their slow-moving bullets apparently take a while to charge up, giving you plenty of time to shoot their huge, round faces before they become a threat. At higher difficulties, the shots get considerably more frequent and your enemies much tougher, although they still seem more eager to run around and hide than to actually fire back. Your own tactics, meanwhile, are to stand out in the open and tap to shoot enemies as quickly as possible with a variety of unlockable firearms (although the starting assault rifle, which can be repeatedly upgraded, worked just fine through all 14 available missions). Instead of cover, you have a limited force field  activated by pressing two fingers to the screen  that can block incoming projectiles, forcing you to think fast while picking off targets. You can also zoom in on specific enemies for bonus headshot damage, and turning to face new threats is as simple as tapping the enemy indicators to the right and left, which change from yellow to red if someone's readying a shot from off screen. At its best, Midnight Star becomes a constant stream of firing, zooming in, reloading, and throwing up your shields, punctuated by occasional breaks in the action when an alien runs up close for a slow-motion melee quick-time event. Thanks to the distinctive audio and visual cues, instantly switching actions and responding to different battle situations quickly becomes second nature, and the fun comes more from moving fast enough to keep up an unbroken kill spree (while the booming announcer counts off each slaying) than it does from the simple thrill of hammering enemies with bullets. It nevertheless gets repetitive fast, though, and thanks to the small handful of enemy types and behaviors, Midnight Star's charms are short-lived and better enjoyed in short bursts. Then there's the story, which involves time manipulation and a disaster that leaves Charlie and his three crewmates as the apparent last survivors of humanity, and which unfolds in conversations between static character portraits. It's not the most compelling way to deliver plot, but it works well enough, except for moments when the characters offhandedly reference events and concepts that aren't explained in-game. The free iOS graphic novel Midnight Rises fills in some of the gaps (and helps define the main character beyond his smarmy voice-overs), but having to read a separate piece of media to understand the story is a drag  and even with its help, the story feels somewhat confusing. Pros Slick visualsFast and funUnobtrusively freemium Cons Overly simpleRepetitive battles Midnight Star's alien-filled shooting galleries are an enjoyable test of tappy reflexes, but the short-term fun of its simplistic action can't keep pace with its grandiose sci-fi ambitions. The end result is a polished-looking but shallow shooter that still has a long way to go, even compared to its iOS competition.", "date": "Feb. 15, 2015,"}
