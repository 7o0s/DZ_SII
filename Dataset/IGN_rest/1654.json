It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix. The first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. One of the prettiest games of the year, Trine 2 always offers something amazing to look at. Watch the Trine 2 Launch Trailer If you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me ~have fun,~ -- and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is. It does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizards platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long. When playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flame thrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying. This giant toad is just one of Trine 2's many Herculean denizens. The few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though. CLOSING COMMENTS Trine 2 throws players into a dazzling fantasy world and gives them three fun characters -- tools, really -- with which to save it. It's delightfully open-ended, from how you solve problems to whether or not you go it alone. Fans of puzzle games will not be disappointed.
