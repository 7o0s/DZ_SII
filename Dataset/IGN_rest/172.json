Heres what our reviewer, Darry Huskey, said last year: Pokkn Tournament takes a lot of what we know from old fighting gaming favorites and sticks them into a blender, delivering a unique take on both Pokmon and on fighting games in general. Sometimes all those ingredients spill over a container thats a little too full - there is a surprising amount to learn beyond the beginners level, and that may alienate some Pokmon fans without fighting game experience. Pokkn Tournament does do a good job, though, at alleviating this bloat of mechanics with single-player modes to help ease into the action. Full Pokken Tournament Review The same holds true for Pokkn Tournament DX for Nintendo Switch, which is essentially the same game as the Wii U version, just with five more characters, a Daily Challenge mode, a new three-vs-three mode, ranked battles online, split-screen local play, and all of the convenience that comes with being on a console/handheld hybrid. Its fortunate that Pokkn runs and looks great as ever whether the Switch is docked or in your hands. The caveat is that if youre playing in Split Screen mode the frame rate takes a dramatic hit, even with the enormous border around the screens. All 5 new characters and Mewtwo/Shadow Mewtwo are available from the start.The five new Pokmon that Pokkn Tournament DX adds are Croagunk, Darkrai, Empoleon, Scizor, and Decidueye, and its great that all of these characters and the originally unlockable Mewtwo and Shadow Mewtwo are playable right at the start. My personal favorite is Scizor, who has the unique mechanic of creating swords that float behind him and can either be called upon to enhance basic combos or used as tricky projectiles. Im a big fan of air combos too, and hes got a great launcher that pops the enemy into the air for a follow-up air combo. The Daily Challenge mode, on the other hand, feels tacked on without any real vision to it. Every day you get a new challenge that gives you a specific Pokmon, with a specific assist team, in a specific mode, with the promise of rewards in the form of skill points... which arent very useful. Ive only gotten to experience a couple of these so far, but none have offered any interesting twists outside of having to win a fight using a character that I dont normally use against easy AI bots that dont require any sort of deep knowledge of a character to beat. Calling them challenges is a bit of a stretch. The new three-on-three battles are neat, especially because they feel more like actual trainer battles in which your Pokmon faint, forcing you to throw out a new one to continue the fight. It seems strange that they werent in the Wii U version with how much sense they make here. All things considered though, the mode doesnt dramatically change the way you play -- theres no tagging characters in mid-match a la Marvel vs Capcom -- and all it really adds is two more characters on both sides of the arena. Pokkn Tournament DX serves as a definitive edition of Nintendos fighting game, and it fits well on the Switch aside from choppy split-screen multiplayer. Five new characters and a new three-on-three mode are noteworthy additions, though the new challenge mode doesnt live up to its name.", "date": "Sept. 21, 2017"}
