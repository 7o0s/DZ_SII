Developed by Other Ocean Interactive, the studio that found success in the old-school 2D platforming genre with Dark Void Zero a few years ago, Tenorman's Revenge is a similar take on South Park, offering up a 2D side-scrolling presentation with a definite focus on cooperative gameplay, and is absolutlely filled with South Park details and an accurate atmosphere. While the game is not without some issues that prevent it from being a truly great experience, Tenorman's Revenge should still have plenty to offer fans of the hit TV show. South Park: Tenorman's Revenge Video Review For those unfamiliar with the character, Scott Tenorman is an old adversary of Eric Cartman, not to mention his half-brother. Tenorman was an erstwhile bully, making Cartman's life a living hell, so Cartman returned the favor (and then some) by forcing Scott to inadvertently eat his parents, making him cry in front of his favorite band, Radiohead, and earning their derision. To be sure, it was a pretty messed up episode of the show, and something that Tenorman did not take lightly. To get his revenge, Tenorman stole Cartman's Xbox 360 hard drive, forcing Eric, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to embark on a quest through several locations and time periods, all inspired by the show, to not only get it back and save South Park, but also destroy Scott Tenorman once and for all. On the surface, Tenorman's Revenge contains some fairly standard tropes of the 2D side-scrolling genre. You're able to jump on many (but not all) of your enemies, as well as gather weapons that can be used against them, like baseball bats, crowbars, bubble guns, water balloons, and more. There are also boss fights that you'll find yourself in, fighting against the main villain, Scott Tenorman, and also some well-known characters from the show, like ManBearPig (super cereal). Get ready to face off against hordes of robot gingers. Each of the four main characters has their own special moves to bring to the mix. Cartman, for example, can belly burst through specific walls, while Kyle can use his ginger powers to walk through barriers that would otherwise be impossible to cross. Also, depending on which of the four main characters you choose, you'll be able to access their superhero alter-egos, including Cartman's Bale-inspired Coon, and Kenny's Mysterion, each with their own special abilities that will be crucial for getting through some sections of the game. Tenorman's Revenge is also centered on being a co-op heavy experience. At the beginning on any game, you'll choose from between an online or a local game, and either one will enable players to drop in and out of a running game at any point. Random players will be able to log into your match as you play with online enabled, helping you gather time crystals and cores and shave time off of the clock in order to earn better medals at the end of the stage. Online play felt very seamless, and aside from some slowdown and lag here and there, handled mostly well. Unfortunately, playing the game alone can be pretty frustrating. The levels are designed in such a way that you won't be able to collect all of the time cores and power up without either teaming up with a four-player group, or going back and repeating entire stages with different characters. Once you've started a stage as one character, you won't be able to select a new one without completing the level first, so trying to go through and pick up extra time cores if you need them to progress is a pain. Play as the boys' superhero alter-egos. The problems don't stop there for Tenorman's Revenge; a variety of minor annoyances bog the whole experience down. The camera is a pain, often pulling too far away from the action and making some of the platforming sequences and jumping more frustrating and harder to navigate. Additionally, there are some pretty big gaps between the game's checkpoints, and considering that your character only has three hearts to work with, you'll find yourself stuck repeating the same difficult sequences often. Luckily for South Park fans, the game fares much better in the looks department. Having been created using the very same assets as the TV show itself, Tenorman's Revenge mirrors the look and sound of the show fantastically. The characters are accurately modeled and voiced, and the environments are littered with a variety of in-jokes and references that will undoubtedly delight fans of the show. The music is a little on the heavy-handed side, but the storyline, graphics, and voice work feel right at home next to the TV show. CLOSING COMMENTS Tenorman's Revenge definitely gets points for presentation, offering as close of an experience to the TV show as you're likely to find. The look and sound feel pulled straight from an episode of the show, as does the crude sense of humor. Were it not for a host of minor annoyances and issues in the gameplay, this would be an easy recommendable classic for any South Park fan. That said, you might want to check out the trial version before dropping money on this one.
