Brad Pitt's portrayal of a schizophrenic in 12 Monkeys and he and his counterpart Edward Norton's take on multiple personality disorder in Fight Club make me a bit envious. No, I'm not looking to get myself placed in a padded room and pumped full of meds, but the freedom their characters have to just do, say or be anything they want moment to moment sounds refreshing to me. Insanity, in these scenes, looks rather liberating and exciting, like a place where you have no idea what will happen next. The reality of a severe mental disorder is probably more akin toAfterfall: Insanity, a bad survival-horror game from indie developer Intoxicate Games. It's likely just as boring, nonsensical, repetitious and frustrating as it drags on pointlessly. The befuddled mess that is Afterfall's story feels like the byproduct of a writer stricken with psychosis. As the developer's website attests, ~the story and the idea for the universe were conceived within the minds of dozens of people working remotely and refining the details over internet message boards.~ Like a person with multiple personalities, an amalgamation of ideas and half-cocked alternate history ideas formed the universe of Afterfall, where World War II ended in a shaky peace treaty and, invariably, a world-ending nuclear apocalypse. Select groups of Polish citizens were put into shelters, where they've been living for years and dealing with ~Confinement Syndrome,~ a mental illness that comes from being cooped up. Of course the underground society erupts into chaos as an epidemic of apparent madness sets in, and it's up to protagonist Albert Tokaj to try and stop it and survive. Story is delivered through awkward cut-scenes that rarely make sense, leaving me wondering why Albert cares about anyone, and unsure why he's doing what he's doing. Albert's insanity seems like an accidental result of, it poor story telling rather than clever use of narrative devices to convey his deteriorating mental state. The trite ending clears up some of the more bizarre plot points, but it would have been nice if those moments were originally presented in a way where Albert acknowledges his own mental issues and combats them, creating drama instead of maddening confusion. As a self-proclaimed horror title, Intoxicate wants Afterfall to scare its audience. At first it succeeds, with dark environments that make good use of lighting effects and some eerie sound effects that make the early enemy appearances intense. Only it can't capitalize on the momentum it builds early on, instead squandering it with room after room of the same foe. Some may look different, sure, but they'll still run straight at you and present next to no challenge on Medium difficulty. If films and other horror games have taught me anything, the key to making tension and scaring the audience lies in knowing when to pull a punch, something Afterfall basically never does. Sometimes overturning a box or having noises down the hallway result in no confrontation works far better than having enemies predictably erupt from the shadows in every room. Albert's propensity for ravaging his enemies doesn't add to the tension, either. He may be a seemingly weak psychologist, but he dispatches mutated and mad people without batting an eye. Wooden voice acting occasionally attempts to portray his horror as he witnesses events around him, but he never feels believable Having been so sheltered his whole life you'd think he'd be sickened by his actions, but he takes to dismembering people like a completely detached killer. I get that this may be intentional because you're supposed to wonder if he's losing his mind, but it made his reactions in cut-scenes seem forced and totally fake. Just look at Isaac Clarke in Dead Space, a game that Afterfall pretty blatantly takes inspiration from: Clarke may turn into a killing machine, but he screams when he's hurt, and also clearly feels disgusted and horrified as he yells while squashing his enemies beneath his boots. I can identify with Clarke, but Albert might as well be a Vulcan for all the passion and emotion he has. Afterfall's shooting is functional, but the melee combat disappoints. Albert moves like his limbs are made of cement, resulting in laborious melee battles. The team at Intoxicate tosses in a host of melee weapon choices, but the abundance of ammo makes mercifully unnecessary. Outside of the places where Afterfall takes away your guns and forces you to fight in hand-to-hand combat, I avoided it altogether. And that's a shame because fighting something up close and personal makes it, well, more personal. This is where Afterfall could have scared me by making me look at the faces of the monsters I'm fighting, or had Albert react like a human being, but instead melee combat just falls flat on its face due to stiff mechanics. More Afterfall: Insanity Videos Deeply flawed games can succeed if they get one thing really right, as Silicon Knights' Eternal Darkness proved by turning the act of losing your mind into great gameplay. Afterfall tries to conjure up similar moments by putting camera shake and dimming effects on Albert's view when pipes randomly explode, or when a monster sneaks up on him in the dark, but they occur too irregularly, and always function the same. Just like the encounters, all tension dissipates because I already know that it is a temporary effect, and that it won't be any different than the time before. CLOSING COMMENTS You need a clear, unified vision to shape a game into something that makes sense and compels the player to see it through to the end But scares and gameplay in Afterfall fall flat as scene after scene repeat the same notes, turning what could have been a spine-chilling adventure into a treadmill to an unsatisfying finish. The lesson to be learned here isnt that smaller developers cant make awesome games, but if they want to make something truly great it probably shouldnt come from a consensus of people scattered. Multiple personalities in the mind, or in game design, apparently results in nothing short of madness. And not the good kind, either. IGN RATINGS FOR AFTERFALL: INSANITY (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 4.5 Presentation Afterfalls menus are functional, but the story and its delivery are just nonsense. 7.5 Graphics Sometimes the environments are striking, and the use of lighting impressed me on more than a few occasions. 5.0 Sound While the occasional ambient noise or musical composition added to the rather limited tension, the voice acting is awful. 4.5 Gameplay Too predictable to be scary, the campaign drags on and on with bad melee combat and a character who has nothing to fear so long as he has bullets, which he always does. 4.0 Lasting Appeal I wouldnt have finished it once if it wasnt an assignment, and I sure as hell wont play it again. 4.5 OVERALL Bad (out of 10) Real-life insanity is probably every bit as boring, frustrating and repetitious as this bad horror title.", "date": "Jan. 12, 2012,"}
