Youll make tough choices about which members of your group stay and which go, mediate disputes, and yes, youll even fend off zombies. Of course, Story Modes family-friendly adventure replaces Walking Deads despair with a lighthearted sense of humor and camaraderie, written with a lot of heart that kept me invested in this story and its mysteries. At first, the world is a mystery in of itself. We play as Jesse, the heart of a group of friends and aspiring builders. As for what it means to be a builder in the world of Minecraft: Story Mode? I couldnt tell you, because almost no time is spent on introducing us to Telltales take on Minecrafts inherently blank-slate universe in Episode 1. Instead were quickly tossed directly into the drama. Ten extra minutes of opening scenes devoted to who these friends are, where they live, and other worldbuilding or character moments would have gone a long way towards orienting me into what this blocky world is all about and what its rules are. Are they kids? Adults? Do people in this world have jobs? Im not sure. These concerns fade into the background once the compelling world-ending plot kicks into high gear. The themes might be heavy - death! destruction! betrayal! - but its all presented in more of a light, Ghostbusters-esque vibe. Jesse, faultlessly voiced by actor/comedian Patton Oswalt if you play as a male or Catherine Taber as female, perfectly balances heroics with laughs. The rest of the squad isnt given enough screen time to grow beyond one-dimensional status, sadly. The episodes heaviest moment comes when your group makes a discovery that forces them to question everything theyve always believed in. Pretty heavy stuff, for a game mostly content to get by on laughs. Telltales commitment to genuinely forking paths more than ever before is off to an impressive start. On my episode-closing stats screen I found out that only 29% of players had experienced a rescue sequence I assumed was mandatory. The episode ends on a heavy choice, too. Allowing me to truly navigate my own path through this adventure feels great, and does make up for some of Story Modes storytelling shortcomings. Minecraft: Story Mode will work as a traditional save the world! adventure for just about anyone, but big Minecraft fans will be able to enjoy it on a much deeper level. Cute in-jokes like punching trees as part of a training montage, gathering nine slime to craft a slime block, and admiring a chicken-torturing device made the Minecraft fan in me smile. I especially liked the couple of time-lapse building sequences that show elaborate structures being erected, and the opportunity to craft story-critical items by placing them directly onto a crafting table. Even more impressive is Story Modes gorgeous in-game sets. Each looks like it was painstakingly and lovingly created directly in Minecraft itself. Its extremely authentic and impressive, with lots of huge buildings and vistas to soak in, combined with plenty of tiny street-level details when wandering around town. Still, I wish there was more to play around with in these spaces. Minecrafts trademark is its unrestricted freedom and interactivity, yet Story Mode Episode 1 only contains a couple true puzzles. Those that are here really work, though. Theyre smartly integrated into the plot and environment, and feature clever solutions. But that isnt enough gameplay to sustain a two-hour episode, the rest of which is made up mostly of on-rails quick time events. Pros Lots of heartStrong central mysteryAuthentic visuals Cons Very few puzzlesWeak characterization Minecraft: Story Mode is a pleasant, family-friendly adventure that very quickly won me over and kept me invested in its twists and turns. The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes. Sparse interactivity and a lack of commitment to explaining this world and its inhabitants hold Episode 1 back, but Im still absorbed in my story, and eager to find out what happens next.", "date": "Oct. 14, 2015,"}
