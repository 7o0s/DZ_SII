Thats not just because this MMO shooter is enormous in scale and can potentially have hundreds of players engaged in combat at once, and theres a heightened sense of camaraderie and accomplishment, but also that it can sometimes be slow and confusing. Also, it took awhile to deploy. After some setbacks because of server outages (Developer Daybreak Studios said this was due to issues with the microtransaction system in this free-to-play shooter), things cleared up and I finally enlisted into PlanetSide 2's three-way battle. While most soldiers know what they're fighting for and what's motivating their troops, I went in blind. For background, I never played the original PlanetSide, nor did I play the sequel when it debuted on PC two years ago. As an uninitiated player, I found I was given precious little information about the nature of the three factions doing battle. Of the three, I chose the Vanu Sovereignty's sleek sci-fi style (and Mass Effect-like theme music) over the steampunk-esque Terran Republic and the standard space-marine duds of the New Conglomerate. After roughly three hours on the battlefield, I still have no idea why everyone's fighting for control of checkpoints on these giant maps. But Im still happy to take part, because the action is great. Even though it's debut was marred by outages that lasted into the second day, my experiences once I connected with a server in PlanetSide 2 have been mostly seamless. Outside of a few lag-afflicted allies who seemed to chug alongside me during long sprints (I never saw enemies disappear in the same way), the combat never seemed to stutter. In terms of visual quality, what PlanetSide 2 achieves in scope, it sacrifices with a world may not be impressive during firefights but sometimes impressed me when I stopped to take everything in. The aforementioned character design could be a bit more varied, too. The choice of three similarly designed factions, two genders, and five skin tones make for pretty uniform troops on the battlefield. Fortunately, PlanetSide 2's presentation issues never really stand in the way of waging (free-to-play) war. I noticed I have become a better soldier in PlanetSide 2 very quickly, and it's all because I've been following orders. Exciting, right? I tend to take a lone-wolf (read: kamikaze) approach in multiplayer shooters, but the first hour of combat alternated between boring and confusing when I tried that approach. The continent of Koltyr (the only map accessible to new players) is massive  perhaps too big for firefights with only a few dozen soldiers in combat  so I often found myself alone unless I deliberately stuck to a group. After a few minutes of lonely sprinting, I'd arrive at an unmanned base with no objectives. When I'd run into another person on the battlefield, I'd often cause or fall victim to friendly fire, because even though the three factions have somewhat-distinct designs in the main menu, the purple, red, and blue-clad humans are far more difficult to tell apart in the heat of battle, and not all of your teammates have name overlays for some reason. I'm not sure why the three sides have such similar colors  purple is a mixture of red and blue, if you remember your kindergarten art classes  but it definitely forced me to follow the leader instead of seeking out clearly designated opposition. When I fell in line (and discovered the instant action option that quickly transported me to combat zones), I finally started notching a few kills. Even though the majority them occurred in conjunction with other soldiers by my side offering aid rather than racking up headshots or killstreaks, I felt a different kind of accomplishment. When we'd steamroll through an enemy outpost, capture all of their strongholds, and joyously traverse through the plains between bases, I felt more like a member of a squad than I have after even the most dominant of team deathmatch victories. On the rare occasion I could grab a seat on a military vehicle larger than the ATV -- my current level can't spawn anything else, nor can I take the wheel on any weaponized transport -- the trip to our next mission felt even sweeter. On the other side of that coin, however, I never really feel like I'm truly winning in PlanetSide 2's war. The persistent battles never end; outside of an emblem flashing on the screen for a few seconds to celebrate a captured base or a personal kill-count milestone, there's nothing that really signifies whether my soldier or faction is much of a success or failure in PlanetSide 2's world. The fact that the first few hours have had the same uniform objective of occupying enemy bases hasn't helped, either. I'm also dismayed at how little currency I've earned after four or so hours in battle; while I wasn't very productive for the first 60 minutes, my subsequent success in capturing checkpoints and scoring kills has only been enough to purchase a turret-dropping ability and a new rifle. I've also got to spread my (lack of) wealth across five classes; while I'm mostly using the light assault class, I've also got to consider getting a better sniper rifle for long-range firefights or the up-close action that suits the rocket-launcher-wielding heavy assault class. At this point, I'm more than halfway to the 15-level tier needed to move on from Koltyr to what PlanetSide 2 has deemed the frontlines, and a level away from accessing aircraft and additional grenade slots, but I'm hoping this new world has bigger opportunities to grow as a soldier.
