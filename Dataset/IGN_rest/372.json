One of the great things about South Parks last-minute production schedule is that the show is frequently able to lampoon current political events mere days (or even hours) after they unfold. Its become tradition for the show to tackle the outcome of various US Presidential elections. This year is no exception. The twist this time, however, is that even Trey Parker and Matt Stone didnt foresee the outcome of this election. Donald Trumps surprise victory last night forced some last-minute changes with this episode. Even the title changed from The Very First Gentleman to Oh, Jeez earlier today. But Parker and Stone are nothing if not adaptable, and its a testament to their comedic skills that this revamped episode fit as seamlessly as it did into the larger Season 20 narrative. Mind you, there were a few points in Oh, Jeez where it was clear some material had been reworked. That was obvious mainly in the interaction between the victorious Mr. Garrison and the distraught Randy, which didnt quite gel with where the show left them two weeks ago. And perhaps the idea of Bill Clinton forming a Gentlemens Club would have made slightly more sense if he actually had achieved the status of the countrys first First Gentleman. But none of that really mattered in the end. Parker and Stone were still able to work the Trump upset into their ongoing storyline and keep their many plates spinning. It was certainly an eventful week. Gerald found himself playing international man of mystery at the behest of a crestfallen Turd Sandwich. Seeing Gerald flip-flop between being terrified for his life and then relishing the chance to pull another fast one on the Danish was pretty great. Whether it was Gerald trying out his vocal repertoire or struggling to suppress his laughter when faced with own trolling history, this episode was a strong reminder that Gerald can be one of the shows more amusing adult characters when given the chance. Maybe not enough to rival Randy at his best, but who can, really? They're not ready for President Garrison. Geralds storyline reached a fitting conclusion as he discovered that he had walked right into a trap. He and his fellow trolls are now at the mercy of the Danish, doomed to be Rickrolled while the rest of the world feels the wrath of Troll Trace and goes the way of Fort Collins. Speaking of which, the glimpse of a post-apocalyptic Fort Collins was highly amusing. Back home in South Park, Randy tried to take Mr. Garrison to task for winning the election, only to be dragged into the cult of Member Berries. Seeing Caitlin Jenner projectile vomit a stream of Member Berries onto Randys face has to be one of the better sight gags this show has ever produced. It only got funnier as Randy repeated the favor back home. And while the Member Berries continued their takeover of the town, tensions flared at South Park Elementary in the aftermath of the election. Here the episode delivered another instant classic sight gag, this time in the form of Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby performing an inspirational tap dance number. I was slightly mixed on this portion of the episode, mainly because Im starting to grow tired of the Cartman/Heidi subplot again. Their scenes together tend to rehash the same beats and that played out Women are funny spiel Cartman has been repeating all season. But there is hope that things will turn around again as it seems Cartman is hellbent on actually traveling to Mars to escape the fallout of Troll Trace. And if Cartmans contribution this week fell short, Butters was there to pick up the slack. Butters is rarely funnier than during those periods when he finally gets fed up being the butt of everyones jokes and lashes out at the world. His Wieners Out campaign is still going strong and still yielding some great comedy. Its clear that, in addition to all the Member Berries/JJ Abrams business, Parker and Stone maneuvering the season toward a boys vs. girls civil war and tying that into a larger feminist backlash against the election and all the other dumb things the men of the world have done lately. Itll be interesting to see how much Parker and Stones reaction to the outcome of the election fuels these final three episodes. Back in 2008, About Last Night attempted to put a hopeful spin on things by reminding viewers on both ends of the political spectrum that the world wont suddenly stop turning because of one election. Is there room for that sort of optimism this time around? Whatever the case, Parker and Stone clearly aren't done having their say yet. Despite an unforeseen turn of events in the real world, South Park's 20th season kept humming along this week. ~Oh, Jeez~ managed to gracefully work Donald Trump's election win into its increasingly massive narrative. This episode delivered many funny moments and hilarious sight gags, while at the same time raising the stakes even higher in a world plagued by Member Berries, Troll Trace and a brewing gender war.", "date": "Nov. 10, 2016,"}
