Dozens of knitted dinosaurs inhabit an island crafted from felt, foam, cotton wool, and sequins. While Nintendo has already played with this style before in 2010s Kirbys Epic Yarn, Yoshis Woolly World does a much better job of exploring its potential. Its always a pleasant adventure with interesting mechanics dotted about, but occasionally it pulls it all together and creates some really great levels, which feel specifically designed around Yoshi, and those really make it worth playing. This arts-and-crafts ecosystem is a mellow and idyllic world in which to spend ten or so hours. The colours are rich and vibrant, the textures are great, and its got some ridiculously catchy tunes. It all has an endearing handmade finish, with plenty of exposed stitching and loose threads on show. The textile conceit is really sold by small, wonderful details, like when Yoshi tugs at one of those threads it can unravel and turn into a butterfly, which flutters offscreen to reveal a secret area. (I told you it was a contender for the cutest game ever made.) Theres so many of these wonderful imaginative touches. Shy Guys are armed with crochet hooks, ready to unpick their enemies. A a soft halo of fuzz surrounding knitted characters catches the light as they move. Yoshi himself, being made of thread, unravels and recombines himself in subtle ways to suit his environment: on ice, his feet weave themselves into skates and in water, they turn into a big propeller. Woolly World really makes the most of its setting, and invests a lot of imagination into elaborating it; I noticed little details right up until the very end that made me grin. The textile aesthetic always creates a world which is visually appealing and comforting to explore, but sometimes it does more, producing levels and instances of gameplay that could only exist within the logic of this world. These stages also succeed because theyre thoughtfully designed in a way to challenge Yoshi and his abilities. Actually, Yoshis a bit of a problem for most traditional platforming situations. His tongue and ability to throw balls of yarn allows for enemies to be tackled at a distance, while his hover-jump forgives most errors of judgement. But at its best Woolly World concocts levels that are challenging even for Yoshi. Theres a brilliant Boo level in which a curtain passes across the screen, revealing platforms and enemies in silhouette that cant be seen otherwise. The curtain moves quickly in the foreground, and soon there are multiple drapes overlapping and disappearing, resulting in a level which is in constant flux. Yoshis hover-jump is now essential, allowing you to take calculated leaps into the unknown and, sometimes, buy precious seconds until safe ground materialises. It no longer feels like a bit of a cheat, since the circumstances demand it be used with precision and skill. Woolly World doesnt consistently reach those heights, but theres still plenty of fun and inventive stuff to play around with in its less memorable levels. Its also hard to get bored since levels regular shake-up the pace. You can thrown baby chickens to create temporary clouds of cotton wool. Slide through jungles, leaping between curtains. And there are fantasy interludes in which Yoshi transforms into a motorbike or an umbrella, but sadly these sections last for no more than 30 seconds and occur so sporadically they never feel like a core part of the experience. Its a shame as they provide some brilliantly surreal moments, like when I kung-fu kicked a log fort as Yoshi patterned like a cow. (More of this please.) I could definitely have done without the monotonous mid- and end-stage boss battles, however, which all end up feeling like variations of each other. You can zip through levels in a few minutes, but theres a multitude of collectibles entreating you to go back. They include beads, stamps, daisies, and balls of wool. Its all a bit much, and the desirability of each one varies quite a bit. The only ones I found myself interested in were the daisies and wool, as they have the most enjoyable and satisfying rewards. If you collect all 40 daisies in a given World, a Special Stage is unlocked. These levels tend to be some of the strongest in the game, so its a shame you have to find every daisy, which in truth is a bit of a slog. Collecting wool nets you a more immediate prize in the form of a new playable Yoshi. Its the same basic character model but there are some cool and weird patterns to be found, including a Shy Guy disguise and one that makes Yoshi resemble the inside of a watermelon. Theyre frivolous but I found collecting them to be surprisingly addictive. I found stamps and beads, on the other hand, much less appealing. The former are acquired by collecting specific gems, which are plentiful and spread throughout levels, but the catch is theres no way of knowing which bead secretly contains a stamp. So effectively the challenge is to collect every bead. It's part of a bigger problem: invisible items, hidden areas which cant be visually detected whatsoever, and concealed item boxes appear throughout Woolly World. Youll probably come across the most important ones, but I never felt like these were rewards for my natural curiosity; they rewarded my determination to scour every inch of a level. Ultimately, stickers arent worth it, while gems allow you to purchase Power Badges, a range of power-ups and perks that last for an entire level. Theyre fun, make the game easier, though tellingly the badge I equipped the most was the one that revealed all hidden items. Pros Arts-and-crafts styleImaginativeYoshi's challenged Cons Only a few great levelsTedious boss battles Theres a handful of really great levels in Yoshis Woolly World, which makes the most of its setting and choice of character. The world is exactly what I expected, thematically and in terms of structure: sand, snow, clouds, and fire, punctuated by bosses holed-up in themed fortresses. Its incredibly familiar, but the imaginative and attractive art style makes it feel fresh and appealing. Outside of those great few levels, Woolly World is a more forgettable and fragmented experience. Cool mechanics are cooked up, but theyre dropped into levels which never realise their full potential and fixate more on unearthing frustrating collectibles.", "date": "June 23, 2015,"}
