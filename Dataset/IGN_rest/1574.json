The franchise has been adapted to myriad platforms, and is no stranger to both consoles and handhelds, ported to everything from the PlayStation to the Game Boy Advance. Now the series is making its debut on the Nintendo 3DS with Tekken 3D Prime Edition, the first 3D handheld iteration of the series. Tekken 3D: Prime Edition Video Review Tekken 3D Prime Edition manages to get the basics right. The combat boasts the fluidity that the series has become known for, and the graphics are excellent. The fighting unfolds at a silky smooth clip regardless of whether or not you have 3D turned on. The fighter roster is also impressive, offering the full cast from Tekken 6. However, aside from the basics, Tekken 3D Prime feels pretty shallow, severely lacking in any modes outside of standard one-on-one fights. You won't find much in the way of unlockables here, a stark contrast to other games in the Tekken franchise. Tekken 3D Prime Edition really nails the fast-paced, fluid action of the series, and it's as well done here as it is on consoles. The 3DS iteration of the series does a great job of capturing the speed and intensity of Tekken 6, along with gameplay elements like Tetsu Power (which beefs up your character's strength somewhat after they've taken a beating). The characters feel like they have in the past, and the 3DS makes very little compromises with the series' formula. The 3DS's somewhat cramped button layout doesn't really lend itself to intense fighting gameplay, so the developers have opted to include a compromise by adding four buttons on the touchscreen for each character's more complex moves, similar to the system seen in other fighting games on the handheld. Tekken 3D Prime Edition boasts the full roster from Tekken 6. Tekken 3D Prime Edition also features the fully stacked roster from Tekken 6, offering roughly 40 fighters in total. The one key difference is that Tekken 3D features the younger version of Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken Tag Tournament 2) in place of the more traditional older version of the character, as in Tekken 6. The cast list is varied, representing a mix of classic characters and newcomers, each one boasting a balanced fighting style. Unfortunately, when it comes to depth outside of the actual fighting, Tekken 3D Prime Edition comes up short. The modes are pretty much straightforward fighting modes that lack any real kind of story or even customizability elements. The game's Quick Battle mode is your standard 10-enemy arcade style mode leading up to the credit sequence, while Special Survival is an endurance mode where you have to fight in a series of one-round battles in order to gain new cards (more on them in a second). Aside from that, there's really not much here as far as depth is concerned. Tekken 3D's gameplay is smooth and fluid. In lieu of being able to customize your character, you're instead given a card collection system. You'll earn cards and card points for completing the game's Special Survival and Quick Battle modes, which you can then turn around and trade with other players through the game's Streetpass function. There are several hundred cards that can be unlocked, each one showing a different static image from Tekken's past. The trading element of these cards adds a communal element to Tekken's standard fare of gameplay, but doesn't offer the same amount of depth that the currency and customization elements from other Tekken games. You can edit a few elements of your character, including your name and customize their outfit color, but other than that, the customization elements are basically not there. The game moves along at a smooth 60 frames per second clip, even when displaying in 3D, which is an impressive feat on the 3DS. The character models are well animated, and boast a nice amount of detail. Overall, this is one of the better looking games available on the platform and a fine showcase of its 3D capabilities. CLOSING COMMENTS Tekken 3D Prime Edition definitely gets props for recreating the fast combat and fluidity of the series on a handheld. However, the lack of any real depth in the modes and lack of customization features for your fighters makes it tough to want to spend an extended amount of time with it. IGN RATINGS FOR TEKKEN 3D: PRIME EDITION Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 7.0 Presentation The modes are pretty slim, and other than a 3D version of the Tekken: Blood Vengeance movie, you won't find many extras. 9.0 Graphics Fast, fluid, and well animated, Tekken 3D looks great on the 3DS. The action unfolds at 60 frames per second even in 3D. 8.0 Sound Plenty of voicework and some decent music. 8.0 Gameplay The action is fast and frantic, matching the console games, but the lack of modes is problematic. 7.0 Lasting Appeal Aside from straight brawling and a lackluster card-trading meta-game, you won't find much here to keep your attention. 7.5 OVERALL Good (out of 10) Tekken 3D Prime Edition definitely gets props for recreating the fast combat and fluidity of the series on a handheld. However, the lack of any real depth in the modes and lack of customization features for your fighters makes it tough to want to spend an extended amount of time with it.", "date": "Feb. 14, 2012,"}
