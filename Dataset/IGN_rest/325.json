It's glorious and promising, if a little tough. But it's the followup moments I find more representative of my time with Divide, in which I roamed aimlessly through a sprawling train station with roomy passages that go nowhere with only an easily missed verbal clue from a past conversation for directions. It's that confused wandering that I remember most about Divide, and it overshadows this isometric RPG's moderately lively dual-stick combat and decently fascinating science-fiction story; strengths which are further tarnished by a clump of bugs and a few iffy design decisions. I enjoyed the story well enough, even when the voice acting swung wildly from decent to awful. This is the story of David, a widowed Mr. Normal from modern-day Los Angeles whose armor takes hours to get any more substantial than a blue blazer, and whose little daughter who goes missing after he dons a pair of high-tech contact lenses found in a mysterious package from his late wife. Divide is at its best when it highlights the difference and distance between David's humdrum reality and the trippy metallic fascist police state he lands in, and there's a believable build in tension as he meets new people and finds new data about his wife in terminals he hacks with his nifty lenses. Yet awkwardness creeps in even here, whether it's in the voice work that often doesn't match up with the subtitles or in the occasional shifts from an isometric perspective to eye-level view for a cinematic effect in conversations. Sometimes these shifts work, particularly when the camera opts for a 2D view requiring nothing more than left and right flicks of a thumbstick, but they tend to cause confusion when they shift to more artsy angles. In the first such sequence, I spent a few moments bumping into chairs and invisible walls before I realized I was supposed to aim at a very tiny, specific spot and pull the right trigger in order to chat with the chap seated at the table. From there, I was greeted with a good number of conversation topic choices with the guy (although slightly awkwardly on account of Divide's insistence on using only the DualShock 4's thumbsticks, bumpers, and triggers for every action). I always looked forward to these little snippets of story. I always looked forward to these little snippets of story, and in hindsight after completing the 11-hour campaign I wish there were more of them. Instead, the bulk of Divide consists of lonely, repetitive hours aimlessly walking through a labyrinthine underground complex, steering David with the left stick and clamping down the right trigger to aim his contact-lens scanner in order to uncover hackable terminals (which yield ~hashes~ to power even more hacks) or boxes filled with credits for upgrades. Very early on, I geeked out when I discovered the scanner sometimes revealed ghostly messages on the walls and cheered whenever I at last amassed enough hashes to unlock a terminal that opened a new door. But Divide excessively relies on this concept to the point of boredom. By the time I'd moved to the second big area I'd grown weary of backtracking to dig through every terminal and box for more credits and hashes and recoiled at the idea of the doing it again. Most of the time, I was more concerned about figuring out where in the hell I was supposed to go, which Divide makes much harder than it needs to be. Hacking into specific workstations unlocks floor plans that are accessible through the DualShock 4's touchpad, but even then the often-vague objectives left me backtracking over acres of narrow territory for some clue as to what I was missing. Sometimes, the only hint as to what was terminal or door you're supposed to find next gets dropped in a snippet of dialogue so quick that youll miss it if you sneeze  and even if you hear it clearly it sometimes isnt much help. A recurring bug blacks out a whole level when David marches up certain stairs. Complicating matters further still is a recurring bug that blacks out a whole level when David marches up certain stairs, leaving you to guide him blindly through experimentation. Important stairwells often end up hidden behind walls or furniture. The maps David downloads have zoom buttons that apparently don't work. At other times, Eris  the key NPC companion who tags along with David and shoot things when he needs her to  would completely disappear from the screen. (She's definitely not supposed to.) She's essential to furthering the plot, and yet sometimes I could only find her by carefully scanning for signs of a conversation box with the right trigger. Perhaps all this backtracking and rummaging wouldn't be so bad if Divide sprinkled these long searches with a greater variety of gameplay and enemies. Exploration is supposed to be one of the chief attractions here, but hours go by when it's just David against variations on the same metallic corridors and the same metallic bots. On the few occasions when David instead finds himself in a cozy apartment or on a thin bridge showcasing the decayed highrises of a future Los Angeles, the visual shifts feel almost merciful. Fortunately, it's usually fun to kill the bots. David never gets more to use besides a upgradeable super-powered stun gun of sorts, but  when I could get it to work properly  I enjoyed using it to blast apart the robots or (later) knock out human enemies. Much of the fun comes from the risk created by the gun's need for a several-second recharge, and that quickly forced me to learn how to use corners and other environmental elements to line up good shots. The options get more lively as David picks up upgrades or buys them from vending machines he reactivates, giving you abilities like causing the robots to explode remotely or commanding one to fight against the other. Divide encourages you to avoid combat altogether if you can. Sadly, the combat never feels fluid no matter how many upgrades David stuffs into his device.The twin-stick controls are prone to misses and skips, and always feel fiddly at best. Sometimes the flighty A.I. causes the drones to sit there while David jogs around them. Divide also encourages you to avoid combat altogether if you can, but this has nothing to do with interesting stealth mechanics. Instead, it merely involves running past drones or running up behind them and hacking them into hibernation. Early on, I enjoyed toying with the approach, but as the hours flew by I found that combat became effectively unavoidable. Worse, stripping the exploration of action just rubs in the repetitiveness of the scenery even more. As a saving grace, the music's fantastic. Chris Tilton, known for his musical work on Assassin's Creed: Unity and SimCity, wears the caps of both composer and co-game designer for Divide, and he's clearly in his element in the former. The subtle orchestral music drenches Divide's abandoned darkened corridors in ominous moodiness, and stirs emotion even when the voice acting falls flat. It's therefore strange that its not more more generous with its use. Looking back, nothing convinced me of the awfulness of those long, half-aimless backtracks through Divide's corridors like the occasional absence of musical accompaniment, which left me alone with nothing but annoyance and David's ceaseless footsteps on the tiles. There's a decent science-fiction story holding all of Divide's pieces together, but it's not quite strong enough to outweigh the disappointments of excessive backtracking through repetitious metallic levels that barely look different from the last. A great musical score and a moderately interesting combat help keep it interesting, but bugs and repetitive encounters made the campaign feel much longer than it needed to be.", "date": "Feb. 5, 2017,"}
