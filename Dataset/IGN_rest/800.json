I also finally better understood complex unit micromanagement in Dota 2 (a complicated skill Id never previously wrapped my head around in 700+ hours of play). But these successes happened largely in spite of the excessive, often unhelpful buttons on this peripheralnot because of all of them. In fact, the Tyon's usefulness primarily comes from its Easy-Shift thumb-button. Easy-Shift is a small, springy button beneath the Tyons indented thumb-rest, and it effectively doubles the functionality of the mouses other buttons. Immense customization options let you combine Easy-Shift and other buttons to do things like replicate keyboard strokes, open software, and navigate your PC. And of course, dominate your games, given its broad array of possible uses. Pairing Easy-Shift with buttons on either side of the device let me manage my control-groups in strategy games. Easy-Shift and left-click became the fastest way for me to reload weapons in first-person shooters. And mapping Ctrl+Alt+Del, volume control, and browser navigation to Easy-Shift commands through the included Roccat Talk software was effortless. Offloading keyboard functionality onto the Tyon is by far its definitive feature, and one that's very compelling. A majority of the Tyon's other buttons keep this mouse from being a stand-out winner, though, largely due to poor placement. The two angular buttons on the outside of the left-click button are instantly accessible and form naturally to my index finger, but the two on the right-click side are less reachable because of the downward slope of the Tyons right side. I rarely, if ever, used these. The analog switch on the Tyons left side is even less useful. Resting in a neutral position between thumb and index finger, the switch can be tilted for, as an example, altitude control in Battlefield 4. Its imprecise stiffness caused me to make jittery adjustments, and if I lost my grip, it snapped back to its regular position and caused disorienting camera shifts; I avoided this button most of the time as well. But by far, the dorsal fin switch atop the Tyon is its least effective feature. Clicking it left or right allows characters to lean around corners in certain games, but comes with a massive problem. If I aim down sights by holding a usual right-click, leaning around a corner with either my middle or index finger isnt just uncomfortableit often means I mess up my aim or hit another button. Its also so far back on the Tyon that I have to pull my finger way back, which again is neither comfortable for me or effective in-game. I not only ignored using this entirely, but I deactivated it entirely; too often in twitch games, Id accidentally bump the fin. More often, I wished it wasnt even there to begin with. Outside of the sharply contrasting situations with its buttons, the Tyon is actually quite nice. It's heavier and wider than most mice, which is great for my larger hands, and means I never lifted it off the mousepad. In fact, the Tyon made my work mouse, a MadCatz R.A.T. TE, feel like a cheap toy. Not having the Roccat Talk DPI customization options on my heavier R.A.T. at home is a huge bummer now, too. Scaling to find the right speed is essential in the sort of shooters and MOBAs I playand I never appreciated it, or the possibilities of using a different type of mouse, until I used the Tyon. Pros Great weightIncredible customization optionsEasy-Shift functionality Cons Inconvenient button locationsImprecise analog paddle; nearly useless fin Purely in terms of hardware, Tyon is superbit has a fantastic form factor, with a great weight and comfortable grip. It also offers incredible customization ranging from simplistic lighting features to an Easy Shift thumb-button that doubles the functionality of everything on the mouse.<br><br> Unfortunately, the experience of using it is dragged down somewhat by its other unique buttons: the dorsal fin atop the mouse primarily just gets in the way, and the analog thumb switch lacks the necessary precision to be worthwhile. The additional buttons on either side of the left/right buttons are inconveniently placed as well. But if you can live with this mouse's foibles (and its $100 price tag), its benefits are hard to pass on if you want to be a better, more effective player in MOBAs and shooters.", "date": "April 19, 2015"}
