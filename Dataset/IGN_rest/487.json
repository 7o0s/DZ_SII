After all, The Division has always been at its best when the bullets are flying and your team is the only thing standing between you and the swirling chaos of explosions and gunfire, and Underground delivers that in concentrated shots without the long, pointless slogs through empty city streets. In typical Division fashion, though, this expansion still finds a few other ways to waste players time, like by saddling them with an ultimately unnecessary grind that threatens to tire them out before they ever get to the good stuff - which incidentally, isnt all that good anyway. The structure for The Division: Underground is simple and functional once you polish off its one-mission introduction: head to the new social space underneath your base of operations, amorphously named The Terminal, and either set up a jaunt into the New York City subway system for yourself, or matchmake to find a squad to roll with. From there, youre dumped right into a mission thats cobbled together from randomly chosen rooms, enemies, and objectives. Theres no stumbling about wide-open spaces in search of purpose here; just follow the yellow dot until your motion tracker lights up, and let the good times roll. Combat has always been my favorite thing about The Division, and Underground essentially allows you to mainline it with very little filler or interruption. The thing is, Underground doesnt really do much to spice that combat up. Youll find some neat jamming beacons that prevent ability usage until you destroy them, and an occasional alarm to take out to prevent reinforcements from pouring in, but thats it as far as new wrinkles go. No new enemy types, no unique objectives to complete, just the same room-clearing youve likely already done for hours upon hours. Between fights, new environmental hazards like downed electrical wires or leaky gas mains pop-up for you to contend with, but youll have seen them all after a few runs, so they wind up being momentary interruptions rather than interesting challenges to face. Combat remains the clear focus, and Undergrounds inability to make it feel new or fresh is its central problem. Undergrind Its far from its only one though. Like the Dark Zone, Underground has its own ranking progression, so whether your gear score is a paltry 100 or a hefty 250, you have to start in the same place. This creates two issues. One is that as a low level character, I get matched with lots of teammates who are overleveled for the content, which means I might as well sit in the back and sip mojitos, because my overpowered cohorts will likely have ripped through a wave of enemies before Ive so much as laid eyes on them, essentially trivializing the content for me. The other is that if you happen to be one of those well-geared agents, youre stuck grinding out missions that offer you little in the ways of challenge or reward until you reach a high enough rank to attempt longer, higher level operations. If matchmaking were based off of gear level, this problem could have been mitigated, but as is, Underground mixes people of low and high gear level, creating a poor experience for both. The natural answer, then, would be to play solo if you dont have a group of like-leveled friends to call on, but Underground falters here too. Even when going it alone, every Underground mission is a strict no respawn affair. Worse still, you generally dont get any loot or Underground XP unless you complete the entire mission, so if you spend 20 minutes carefully making your way through, only to be surprise-killed by one of The Divisions magical monster closets that spawn threats on your flank without warning, your time was for nothing. This is particularly infuriating when you fail due to a bug that prevents any damage from registering against enemies for the remainder of a mission. After losing four solo attempts exactly this way, I just gave up and resigned myself to playing co-op, despite the matchmaking issues. For many hours, I held out hope that once I unlocked the higher difficulty multi-phase missions, things would become more interesting, but that hope proved false in the end. These turned out to be nothing but a series of single-phase missions tacked on to one another, with spongier enemies that churned out higher damage numbers. Its just a progressively scaling gear check as opposed to more elaborate mission types that might require some planning or strategizing. Pros Combat focusStreamlined experience Cons Lacks varietyNeedless grindMatchmaking woes Focusing on The Divisions strength while trimming the fat sounds like a great idea, but Underground fumbles the idea. This is the same combat youve already experienced, just in a dingier, more confined setting, and the lack of gear-appropriate matchmaking means youre either stuck watching overpowered allies mow down hapless enemies, or youre stuck doing it until you unlock more challenging content, by which time I was exhausted. The Division: Undergrounds thankless grind through countless trivial battles feels empty, and ultimately, pointless.", "date": "July 7, 2016,"}
