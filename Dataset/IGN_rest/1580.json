Michael Jackson: The Experience has shipped on almost every major video game platform this generation. Considering Jackson's legendary catalogue of hits, this makes sense for publisher Ubisoft. Michael Jackson: The Experience HD, one of the first rhythm games to arrive on the PlayStation Vita, does a better job at shaping Jackson's music into enjoyable play sessions than the PS3, 360, PSP, and DS versions did. Despite a limited setlist and sparse mode selection, the Vita version keeps a fairly smooth rhythm going. Michael Jackson in the Billie Jean pre-song cutscene. Michael Jackson: The Experience HD features 15 songs to play with three difficulty settings for each. Most of these songs make for plenty of fun. You honestly can't go wrong with tracks like Smooth Criminal, Beat It, and Bad. After selecting a song and difficulty, your fingertips need to keep up with the beat. Follow the on-screen indicators to draw arrows, arcs, and circles to score points. After just a minute or two, these gestures feel great. While Michael Jackson: The Experience HD isn't brilliant, something brilliant happens somewhere along the way. The on-screen indicators merely indicate direction and timing of your gestures, not the actual location or duration on the touch pad. This means a little improvisation comes into play as you follow along. Your style evolves as you move your fingers across the screen. Resting the Vita on a table and using both pointer fingers proved especially effective and fun. Alternate your hands or add a flourish of the wrist for your own amusement. Something about it echoes the excitement of real dancing. Each song comes with a set of challenges unique to that song, like completing it with a certain score or at a specific difficulty setting. These challenges add extra goals to each on top of the obvious ~do the best you can.~ As you earn points with each performance, your total cumulative points also increase and unlock additional features in game. You can even earn different gloves for Jackson to wear that offer him special bonuses, like +5 points in ogre slaying (Editor's Note: not a real bonus). Performing Smooth Criminal. Cranking the difficulty up to expert, throwing on a good pair of headphones, and jamming to Smooth Criminal does maximize the charm and challenge of Michael Jackson: The Experience HD. But even a mediocre player can plow through it in two hours or less. With only 15 songs to play, the experience ends with painful quickness, especially considering the price of entry. Michael Jackson: The Experience HD also lacks the same mode selection as other rhythm games. An absence of a training mode means you need to react fast in the expert-level performances (doable, but sometimes tricky). And while the ad-hoc multiplayer battles do provide additional methods of play with a friend, they're still bound to the tiny setlist. CLOSING COMMENTS Michael Jackson: The Experience HD does what few rhythm games can: allow for physical improvisation in the midst of a choreographed routine. Not just the freestyle section, mind you, but an actual variation in gesture type. This goes a long way in making the music both fun and personal. Unfortunately, like the other Michael Jackson games, Vitas first rhythm game suffers from a short setlist and only one real mode of play. Its a shame the experience ends in a tragic few hours, as dancing with your fingertips offers a special sort of enjoyment fitting for the King of Pops best tracks. IGN RATINGS FOR MICHAEL JACKSON: THE EXPERIENCE (VITA) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 Presentation Clear, crisp interface and no hiccups during play. 6.5 Graphics Jacksons character model looks decent and animates well. Environments, usually mirroring the respective music video, also work. CG cutscenes look low-budget. 7.0 Sound Most of these tracks honor Michael Jacksons incredible contribution to music. Some, like Ghosts and Speed Demon, dont have the same punch. Needs way more tracks! 8.0 Gameplay Simple, challenging cues for fingertip gestures. An uncommon allowance for improvisation, as cues do not dictate location or duration of gestures, leaving it all up you. But it ends too quickly. 5.0 Lasting Appeal With only 15 songs to play Michael Jackson on Vita won't last for longer than a few hours. Luckily song-specific challenges encourage multiple tries. 6.5 OVERALL Okay (out of 10)", "date": "Feb. 14, 2012,"}
