I mean, the original Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 isnt just considered as one of the greatest sports games ever made; its literally wedged amongst the top three highest-rated video games of all time on Metacritic. Youd probably be better off cutting your losses and photocopying the Mona Lisa at this point, right? Well, no, because despite the high bar set by the originals, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an absolutely rip-roaring remake. Vicarious Visions has successfully brought Neversofts esteemed classics back to life, allowing old and new fans alike to experience these masterpieces through a modern lens while remaining entirely respectful to the moves, the maps, and the music thats been seared into the brains of millions since the turn of the millennium. THPS1+2 pushes off on the right foot immediately, with a fantastic intro fusing footage of the iconic stars of the original games with clips of the new skateboarding superstars joining the roster. It shouldnt be understated how effectively this otherwise fairly simple sizzle reel instantly injects these new skaters into the fabric of Pro Skater, meaning they dont just feel tacked on. Things just get better from there. The levels, the moves, the pros, the songs  every element of the original games that earnt them their legions of fans is back with a 2020 makeover. Maybe you played Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD back in 2012. Maybe you think youve already had this experience.You have not. Not like this. Everybodys Heard About the Bird Its actually quite remarkable dropping into each of the nearly 20 levels and marvelling at just how authentically they mirror the geometry of the 1999 and 2000 versions of these same maps. Theyre obviously infinitely richer with granular detail, filled with impressive lighting, and  unlike the PS1 oldies  feature a draw distance that stretches to the horizon instead of disappearing into fog when it hits double figures, but theyre also wonderfully familiar. The graphics dont necessarily eclipse those of other triple-A sports sims but theyre quite handsome, and importantly theyre vastly superior to the peculiarly stylised and generally unattractive look of THPS5. There arent really any duds amongst the maps but I was particularly impressed by the Malls mild reinvention as an abandoned and decaying ghost town that looks like a flood has swept through it, and Venices vibrant colour explosion, with almost every surface sporting generations of layered graffiti. Hangar is also a highlight; its never been the most interesting level but here its been turned into a virtual shrine to original Tony Hawk developer Neversoft, which is a nice touch. Both individual games are represented as a separate string of levels in THPS1+2  and you can progress through them independently  but beyond that everything is unified and accessible from a central hub. Skills points for your skaters that you earn in THPS1 maps, for instance, make your skater perform better for the THPS2 maps  and vice versa. This is a good, elegant solution that beats having each game as an otherwise unrelated mode, like in Vicarious Visions last remake effort, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. Those of you with robust memories may remember where a lot of the collectibles and goals on the maps are because, as this is a faithful remake, they obviously havent moved. If you recall where Ollie the Magic Bum disappears to each time you jump over him I guess you may find yourself going through the motions a bit, but its difficult to fault Vicarious Visions for sticking to the originals. One place where the remake goes beyond the original road map is that new challenges have been added to the THPS1 levels to make them consistent with the longer lists in the THPS2 ones. This freshens things up a little while they last, but the biggest boost comes from the absolutely exhaustive list of overarching challenges that can be completed across any of the maps at any time, from certain strings of tricks to specific enormous points totals. Completing these ties into a new, overall leveling system that earns you unique decks, plus cash to drop on other gear for your skaters in the store. Many I achieved by accident, though others I completed after spotting them while shuffling through the menus. Especially on the first run through, THPS1+2 feels like one of those games where youre always achieving something, whether you know it or not. Returning veterans will probably have every map unlocked within a day or so, but with 21 challenges for each of the 21 pros plus several hundred extra challenges on top of those, I cant really begin to estimate how many hours of play there are here. Chuck in multiplayer and the much-enhanced create-a-park tools and it may be endless, especially as parks can be shared online. I predict that some players of a certain vintage may end up a bit anesthetized to all the pop-up notifications and flashy bonus-collection-button-mashing  I know I became a bit numb to it  but I wouldnt say it compromises any of whats great here. If you just want to hop in and play through some incredible-looking maps from THPS1 and THPS2  whether youre looking to chill, chase scores, or chuck a controller around between some friends, THPS1+2 will satisfy. But if you want to devote yourself to chasing over 700 challenges across every skater and earn boards and other booty, THPS1+2 can most certainly supply that. There are no microtransactions and everything in the game can be unlocked via gameplay. G.O.A.T. Despite sticking with tradition in terms of the maps, the default controls are actually more akin to those in THPS3 and THPS4 rather than the first two games. But before you freak out, know that the more limited, original movesets are available to toggle on for purists who crave an experience precisely like the original games  removing things like reverts, wallplants, and even manuals if you want  but Im enjoying the default controls as they are. I have a lot of love for EAs Skate and Im fascinated by Skater XLs technicality, but theres also a lot to be said for THPS1+2s big combos and pure arcade thrills and spills. For the young or inexperienced who may find all of this a bit too frantic and unforgiving there are cheats that can be activated to make things easier, though those scores are tracked separately so your kids or your grandma wont be able to completely overwrite your greatest no-assist accomplishments. If youre concerned about the presence of such a crutch, remember: this is a game from the 90s, and the only thing more 90s than video game cheats are acid-wash jeans and the soundtrack to Batman Forever. Speaking of soundtracks, the famous THPS music selection is virtually all present and accounted for, and thats perfect because its such an indisputably integral part of the original games. Vicarious Visions has also augmented it with a well-curated list of old and newer tracks, so its now doubly longer than it was originally. You can toggle them off if you want but, while not all the newer songs are to my taste, several are pretty good. For instance, Id never heard of Rough Francis before THPS1+2, but these guys are awesome. Exposing me to new songs that will go on regular rotation in my car for the next few decades is exactly what Tony Hawks Pro Skater games did back in the late 90s and early 2000s, and THPS1+2 is doing it all over again. Impressively, THPS1+2 hasnt just captured the spirit of the originals in terms of the meticulously rebuilt maps and faithful feel  its done it in subtler ways like this, too. Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015s disastrously dismal Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5 that its difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old-school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. Its pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activisions business strategy, but when its this much fun Im finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years.", "date": "Sept. 3, 2020,"}
