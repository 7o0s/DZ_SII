Below are impressions based on the first few hours we've spent with the game. We'll be updating them as we play more this week, followed by our full review.] Assassins Creed Rogue intrigues me. If you dont already know, Rogues protagonist  Shay Patrick Cormac (hes Irish, by the way)  betrays his creed and becomes a Templar, hellbent on revenge. But three and a bit hours in, Im still an assassin. The game is biding its time and developing its new protagonist nicely.Shay isnt the brutal killer so many of the trailers have made him out to be; hes playful, good-natured  a loveable rogue, if anything. So the knowledge of what lies ahead, that some sort of traumatic event is just around the corner, is definitely creating a sense of anticipation thats caught my attention. History has always played a pivotal role in the Assassins Creed series. It serves as both inspiration and backdrop, an invaluable resource for dramatic events, supporting characters, and villains. But Rogue feels like its more interested in the idea of history and how its constructed. How does the phrase go? History is written by the victors. And when you think about the series, that sort of partiality has always coloured previous entries. Weve seen events unfold almost exclusively from the perspective of its hooded heroes. Three hours in, it feels like Rogue is ready to challenge those inherited narratives. The sequences outside of the Animus also support this approach. Like in Black Flag, these sections take place in first-person with you working for Abstergo industries. You quickly gain access to classified documents, which present the villains of previous games in a much more sympathetic light. Im by no means an Assassins Creed scholar, but Ive played all the major entries in the series and it seems like everything is on the cusp of being undermined and overthrown, which feels exciting. I just hope it follows through on this approach with conviction, introducing true ambiguity to the series, revising key episodes, rather than using it as a simple pretence for Shay breaking bad. In terms of gameplay, Rogue is much less intriguing. Right now it plays like a direct sequel to Black Flag. Ive spent my first few hours learning to sail and the basics of naval combat. Ive upgraded my ship, visited small ports, and sang more than one catchy shanty with my crew. That also means there are odd moments of frustration when traversing the world and you cant quite jump in the desired direction. Rogue feels mechanically much like what has come before, but in terms of story, ambition, and what its doing with its protagonist, it feels fresh and could change the way look at the narrative of the series. Pros Intriguing, fresh storyCompelling protagonistImpacts the wider series Cons Same old control problemsEmpty world Rogue has the most interesting story of any recent Assassins Creed game. Its fascinated by its own history, and introduces a level of ambiguity which changes how we look at the formerly simple conflict between Assassins and Templars. So it's all the more disappointing there's so little to do while the story is being told; the upgrade economy's pointless and most of the tasks are quite trivial. Story aside, so much of Rogue feels redundant, repetitive, and ultimately in need of reinvention.", "date": "Nov. 12, 2014,"}
