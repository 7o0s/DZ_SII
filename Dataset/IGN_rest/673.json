Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance doesnt take any risks with the series bread and butter turn-based tactical combat - Im still having a blast tossing explosive penguins and grinding late into the night to create the most perfectly customized cast of demonic misfits I can manage. Its those new metaphorical leaves that give each new Disgaea its unique flavor though, and Disgaea 5s many new branches succeed in keeping the formula fresh, even if they dont all improve on the systems theyre replacing. If you havent played a Disgaea game in a while, dont worry: its still the addictive time sink of an RPG its always been. As ever, you can tweak your many party members and their gear in an overwhelming number of ways, and pretty much all those ways involve a time and/or resource investment. Just when Id thought I was happy with where a given character was, Id decide to re-roll them in order to boost their leveling progress (called reincarnating), level some new gear, and slap some new passive abilities on them to squeeze out just a few extra drops of power. This what Ive always loved most about Disgaea - theres practically no limit to what you can do if you have the patience and conceptual understanding to do it. Disgaea 5 expands these possibilities even further with some new monster types and character classes, not the least of which is the Maid, a class dedicated to making efficient use of consumable items. In the past, having a character spend their one action per turn on a healing or attack item felt like a waste given the other options at their disposal. The Maid smartly solves this with a passive traits that allows her to use an item in addition to her standard action, and she can eventually earn other traits that greatly increase the range and effectiveness of items as well. This effectively transforms what used to be an uninteresting resource into something that can be the difference between life and death. Even the less successful ones, like the new Interrogation or Quest systems add some new flavor, despite feeling slightly extraneous and fiddly to manage. Accepting quests gives you near-term goals to shoot for in order to unlock new classes or earn rare items, but theres no way to check on them unless you go back to the quest NPC in the hub world. Interrogation bends captured enemy units to your will, but the actual benefits seem a bit light given the trouble of capturing them versus killing them. Disgaeas structure is such that you dont need to make use of every system and mechanic available to you in order to succeed, so it never feels like an obstacle to progress. New Bells and Whistles New classes aside, Disgaea 5 supplements its familiar core with even more extra layers than just about any entry in the series, though not all of it necessarily succeeds. Some of the winners include a map editor that allows you to create and share your own custom maps, the ability to assign your characters a subclass, and the new Squad system, which allows you to group party members together in order to gain unique bonuses and abilities. For example, characters thrown into the Giant Killer Squad will be giant-sized for their first three turns in battle, and members of the Foot Soldier Squad get stat bonuses based on how many people have been enlisted to their ranks. Though thats a lot to manage, it provides a welcome incentive to hire and level as many characters as you can to to take full advantage of what squads have to offer. Darkness...My Old Friend Its okay that Disgaea 5 doesnt take any huge risks with its tried-and-true formula, but I do wish the series would hold on to ideas that work and iterate on them rather than always toss them for something new. For instance, Disgaea D2s monster mount system added an excellent new layer to the relationship between human and monster units, but its been scrapped for the older Magichange system, which while novel, doesnt provide the same functionality and feels like a step sideways. Magichange isnt bad or anything, but its effects are temporary, and require you to redeploy the monster unit afterwards, making it less flexible. This is the first Disgaea for the PlayStation 4 and though it doesnt take huge advantage of the added power, Disgaea 5 is the sharpest, cleanest looking one yet. All the jagged edges on the sprite characters are gone, and the special effects on big spells and attacks run hitch-free. Beyond the technical improvements though, Disgaea 5s use of color is worth commending. This series has always been a colorful affair, but theres a really great balance of warm and cool colors, and some nice gradients between the two here. Its subtle, but it helps Disgaea 5 look markedly better than its most recent predecessor. Pros Deep customizationStrong RPG systemsVisual improvementsNew classes Cons A little too familiar Few franchises can get away with feeling this similar from version to version, but Disgaea is just that deep, requiring you to understand and exploit character stats, equipment attributes, and class abilities at a level most modern RPGs have abandoned in the name of accessibility. Disgaea 5s many new and tweaked gameplay features hit way more often than they miss, and together with its distinctive brand of campy fun and some subtle but welcome visual improvements, they make this one of the better Disgaeas.", "date": "Oct. 7, 2015,"}
