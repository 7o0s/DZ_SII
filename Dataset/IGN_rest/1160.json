That sums up the overall vibe of Terraria pretty well. This devious little indie sandbox game borrows so many ideas that it essentially is Minecraft in 2D, but it also beefs up the familiar gameplay in exciting ways. Theres a lot more creepy-crawly stuff to kill, and the staggering number of deadly doodads you can MacGyver together to slay them with is mouth-watering. Theres some gnarly fun to be had in these uncharted depths, and Terraria's jump to the PlayStation Vita is no less enthralling. After youre done customizing your sprite character, Terraria dumps you on the colorful surface of a randomly generated pixely world with nothing more than a handful of tools and the vague sense that youre meant to build stuff, explore the terrain, and battle monsters. The Vita version's updated tutorial does an excellent job of explaining the controls and laying down the core mechanics of gameplay in an effective, simple-to-understand way. This makes it easier to get into the groove of what makes this sandbox so great: freeform exploration and tinkering. That said, total newcomers will want to dip into the Terraria Wiki to guide you through the exhaustive list of crafting recipes and resource uses, since figuring out some of the trickier combinations remains unintuitive. Though there isnt any real story, and there are no epic quests to conquer, the strong fantasy trappings instill a desire to adventure nonetheless. Theres an abundance of magic, monsters, and mayhem waiting both on the surface and in the dark caverns below, and uncovering unexpected new prizes and perils is a big part of the charm. Virtually everything in the entire world is destructible, and breaking blocks lets you collect basic resources like stone, wood, and iron that can be used to make cool gear or build structures, but the real prizes are buried deep in the ground. There's something incredibly satisfying about hunting down and mining rare ore, building a forge to smelt it into metal bars, merging it with other scavenged components, then crafting it into new useful gear. On the Vita, navigating the complex crafting and inventory menus using the touch screen is far a superior experience to the clunky fiddling of the console versions. A few quick taps and swipes will get you to where you need to be, and simple drag-and-drop inventory management is intuitive. The ability to assign any four items to the left control pad for even faster swapping is also an excellent tweak that keeps you in the action rather than bogged down in menus. Given the small screen size, I appreciate that pinching the touch screen lets me zoom in and out of the world on a whim. It's helpful to pan out and see what's around, then dive back in for a close-up when it's time to dig and build. Hunting down the crucial resources needed to survive and craft even cooler gear requires an intrepid spirit. The rarest components are dropped when you slay various monsters or uncovered when you dig deeper into the subterranean underworld and its many different biomes, and for me, the drive to explore every nook and cranny of the landscape kicked in right away. But its important to temper your desire to set out exploring in hopes of amassing huge quantities of loot with the pressing need to build shelter and expand your spawn points home base. Life on the surface happens on a day/night cycle. Exploring topside during the daytime is safer  you can pick flowers, roam around, chop trees, and kill weak slimes that roam too close. Its also a perfect time to build houses that serve as shelter, because things get dicey when night falls. Zombie hordes and floating eyeball beasts come out in droves, forcing you to fight or flee. Thats less of an issue once you get a sturdy fortification started, so it lends a sense of urgency to the building. This village-development aspect is a clever addition. You can throw together bare-bones shacks or craft elaborate fortresses that tower upward into the heavens, but either way, you want to deck them out with enough crafted accouterments to lure NPCs to your village. These support characters can heal you, sell you items, and offer other helpful services. This offers some tangible incentives to spend time building, beyond the desire to lord over a pimped-out stronghold. However, the dark, foreboding underworld is where the real action is at. This is where Terrarias gameplay feels more like an old-school action-platformer, and where it really sinks its hooks into you. Digging for ore eventually uncovers sprawling caverns that are home to many varieties of creepy creatures. Giant slimes, skeletons, burrowing worms, and tougher beasties roam the dark, and they often come charging at you while youre excavating. A world map that fills in as you explore makes navigating easy, and shows the locations of different tunnels, biomes, resource pockets, and other important landmarks to help you keep your bearing. Watch our video review of the Xbox 360 and PS3 version above. Exploring is a lot fun on its own, yet theres a strong emphasis on combat thats really appealing. For one thing, stopping to battle monsters breaks up the monotony of digging, which can get tedious on its own. Theres an added risk-vs-reward element to combat, too: getting killed causes you to re-spawn on the surface with your gear intact, but youll leave a chunk of your precious coin stash behind. That is, unless you're playing on Difficult or Hardcore modes, which force you to drop all of your items on death and implement permadeath, respectively. The real impetus behind adventuring is driven by the insanely deep gear-crafting system. There are hundreds of different weapons and items to build, each with its own recipe. Though some equipment is more functional  like protective armor, grappling hooks that let you navigate with greater ease, and treasure chests for storing loot  most of the stuff designed for cleaving monsters into itty bits is just sheer badass. Magical boomerangs, laser pistols, spell books that shoot fireballs, light sabers, and ninja stars are just a handful of the crazier weapons you can craft. Hunting down the rare items you need to build all this cool stuff is obsession-forming. A few other cool nuances enhance the absorbing tasks of exploring, building, and battling away. Journey to the farther reaches of the surface world, and youll inevitably run into The Corruption  a teeming mass of demonic turf filled with extra danger and extra rewards. Youll also uncover demonic altars for forging special items that can be used to summon spectacular bosses with awesome names like Skeletron and Eater of Worlds. Terrarias multiplayer mode is a blast too, and it's graciously flexible and effortless to set up between online pals. The lack of an option to play with random strangers is the only bummer here  I'd love to be able to easily explore people's worlds. Cooperatively exploring and building with friends is even more enjoyable than going solo, and switching over to PvP mode for dueling shenanigans is equally fun and seamless. Pros Improved controlsDeep crafting systemHuge worlds Cons Unintuitive crafting combosLimited multiplayer Though on the surface it looks like just another me too indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecrafts success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying. Fresh elements  like an absurdly expansive crafting system, a broad scope of monsters to battle, and a slick retro 2D presentation  make it a stand out among the pack. Taking Terraria with you on-the-go puts an exciting spin on the absorbing formula, and the Vita version thankfully doesn't skimp on the goods. There's no depth sacrificed here. If anything, improved controls and amenities like the touch interface make a big difference over playing the PC or console versions.", "date": "Dec. 28, 2013,"}
