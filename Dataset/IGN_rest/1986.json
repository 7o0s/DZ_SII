My answer is generally, such a game doesnt exist, but the closest youll get is probably Fantasy Strike. Fantasy Strike is a fun, easy to play fighting game with simple controls, tight and strategic fighting mechanics, a well rounded cast of 12 unique fighters, and some wonderful innovations in the genre that I wish other, bigger franchises would take note of. Visually, its very bland and lacks its own unique personality, but if you look beyond that, youll find one of the most daringly different fighting games of the last decade  not to mention its free-to-play, has great netcode, and full crossplay support between PC, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Breaking the Rules Fantasy Strike throws the basic rules behind most fighting games out the window, instead writing its own with the goal of making things as intuitive and accessible as a traditional fighting game can possibly be. You cant crouch, which eliminates all high/low mix-ups; the life bars are broken up into segmented chunks of HP, so you always have a clear idea of how many more hits are needed to win or lose; your super meter fills up automatically; there are no complicated input commands; you can counter throws by just standing completely still. The list goes on and on, resulting in a very distinct flavor of a familiar whole. Fantasy Strike uses a three button fighting system with each character largely sharing the same basic input commands for each of their moves. While on the ground, every character has three light (A) attacks, one medium (B), one heavy (C), and one super. While in the air they also have one attack for each button along with an aerial specific super as well. This makes it very easy to jump between and learn new characters, which is great because online ranked play requires you to create a three person team. Every character in Fantasy Strike feels like they have something unbelievably powerful that only they can do Despite the similar movelists, these characters all play dramatically different from each other, even those within the same archetype. Jaina, for instance, is a zoner who can fill the field with projectiles, but can also be incredibly nasty up close with some very tricky cross ups and respectable damage. Argagarg on the other hand, despite also being a zoner, focuses on poisoning his opponent and utilizing his projectiles to push his adversaries away and keep the poison active. Every character in Fantasy Strike feels like they have something unbelievably powerful that only they can do, which makes the entire roster very fun to play and also satisfyingly challenging to play against. Accessible By Design Even beyond the simplified inputs, one other area of accessibility that Fantasy Strike absolutely excels at is using visual cues to tell you everything you need to know about the properties of a move. Youll never wonder why you got hit by something, or be confused as to how to counter a specific move. When enemies glow blue, they have armor; when they glow white, their attack is invulnerable; when they get you with a command grab, big bold letters appear that say Jumpable, letting you know that you could have jumped to avoid getting hit; when you see blue sparks after an attack is blocked, you have frame advantage; when you see red sparks after an attack is blocked, its punishable. Its all incredibly intuitive, and the stuff that isnt outright taught in its excellent intro tutorial is easy enough to pick up on with experience. There are so many design choices present to make things easy and accessible that you would think the depth of the gameplay would suffer as a result, but surprisingly, it doesnt. Fantasy Strike successfully manages to lower the skill floor of all of its characters without ever dropping the skill ceiling, and it does so not only through excellent design of its movesets and character archetypes, but also by giving players the right tools to understand those movesets and archetypes. Embedded within Fantasy Strike are excellent spotlight videos for each character that go over everything one would need to know in order to be competent with that character. These videos are short, comprehensive, and most importantly, theyre presented in a way that makes it very easy to understand complex concepts like set-ups, cross ups, frame traps, and more. Within just an hour or so, I already felt comfortable enough with a character to jump online and start having competitive matches. After a few of those, I was on my way to winning my first ranked mini-tournament. These kinds of tutorial videos are absolutely something that should be standard among future fighting games. There's no getting around Fantasy Strike's bland style As good as all of this is, theres no getting around Fantasy Strikes bland style. Its roster, while very mechanically interesting, are among the most boring character designs Ive played in a modern fighting game. Rook is just a stone golem with no distinguishing characteristics; Setsuki is a kunoichi with rainbow hair that feels randomly colored in with a paint bucket tool; and Grave is the prototypical Ryu-style character who just wants to improve and fight strong opponents, just to name a few. These boring looking fighters arent helped by a weak arcade mode that does very little to give them any much needed personality and is hampered by inconsistent voice acting throughout. Looks arent everything of course, but when the competition even among indie fighting games includes gorgeous options like Skullgirls, Under Night In-Birth, and Thems Fightin Herds, Fantasy Strikes isnt even in the same league on the audio/visual side. For the solo players, in addition to arcade mode, theres also a daily challenge mode, a standard survival mode, and an interesting twist on a Boss Rush mode that throws all concerns about character balance out the window by rewarding you for each victory with your choice of an incredibly overpowered perk after each fight. Whats great is that many of these power ups are specific to each character and designed to either cover their inherent weaknesses or ridiculously enhance their strengths. In one Boss Rush run, I had a Rook that could deal 6 damage off of a standard throw by just the third round, basically allowing him to one-hit KO a lower health enemy as soon as I got my hands on them. Its an amusing distraction, but not one I felt the need to come back to after a few runs. All For Free Fantasy Strikes actually been around since 2017 as a Steam Early Access game, but as of July 21, 2020 it became completely free to play with the full roster of 12 characters available immediately. Thats unprecedented in a genre where other free-to-play games lock most of their characters behind some sort of pay wall, and it truly makes Fantasy Strike the best entry point for newcomers interested in fighting games. You wont get access to the single-player modes like Arcade, Boss Rush, or Survival without paying at least $20 for the Core Version, but youll still be able to access Fantasy Strikes full suite of training modes, and most importantly, youll be able to play online in both casual and competitive playlists. However, if youre playing for free, you won't have access to local versus multiplayer, and you wont be able to start a private room with another person unless at least one of you owns a paid for version, which is a humongous bummer even in spite of all that Fantasy Strike offers for free. Instead of charging for characters, developer Sirlin Games has introduced a very unusual subscription service called Fantasy+ that gives players access to special Master level costumes that cant be purchased in the shop, XP boosts on all characters (which is just a show of how experienced you are with a character and opens up the Master costumes at level 20), and access to Replay Theater. Replay Theater is the star here, and it is actually a pretty fantastic innovation on how players are able to view recorded matches, and though it doesnt quite justify a $5 per month premium fee, it is a great perk for those who want to show support for the developers who are offering a substantial amount of value by keeping the whole roster free to play. Many fighting games have the ability to rewatch your own matches and replays of high level matches, but with Replay Theater, you can actually filter what you want to see based upon the rank of the players and the specific characters used in the match. You can even set the filter so you can watch only matches of one specific character vs another, which is super helpful if you find yourself having trouble with a particular matchup and want to see how high level players deal with it. Microtransaction Reaction In addition to Fantasy+ theres also a store within Fantasy Strike where you can purchase an in-game currency called gems with real money in order to buy skins, intro animations, victory animations, and other minor cosmetics. Gems can be purchased in $10 (1,000 gems), $25 (2800 gems), $40 (4,700 gems), $60 (7,500 gems), or $100 (13,500 gems) packages, with animations costing 350 gems and skins costing anywhere from 350 to 500 gems The 500 gem skins are fairly significant overhauls of a characters look. Theres one for Onimaru for instance that changes his look from being a generic samurai to a clearly Street Fighter inspired oni, while the 350 gem skins are mostly just recolors of the existing base skin. Overall its a fairly standard selection of cosmetics. $5 for a skin seems pretty pricey, however, especially considering most fighting games offer full characters as DLC for very close to the same price. Fantasy Strike is a shining example of a fighting game thats incredibly easy to play without sacrificing the mental chess and decision making that makes them so much fun. Its very rough around the edges, with a roster of twelve characters that are much more interesting mechanically than they are visually, and a few interesting, though ultimately shallow single player modes. The inability to set up a private match with friends who are also playing for free is a tough pill to swallow, but its value as a free-to-play fighting game cannot be overstated. This truly is the best entry point for those who want to dip their feet into a traditionally difficult genre  and those who stick around will find it stands up as a great fighting game in its own right too.", "date": "July 29, 2020,"}
