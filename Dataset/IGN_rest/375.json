Well damn, how awesome is Maeves storyline? It was already incredibly compelling, but things are now moving very fast, with her learning pretty much everything about her true nature  and now being upgraded in some significant ways. My one complaint here is the time skip between the last time we saw her and now. Maeve speaking to Lutz so openly was such a big moment in and of itself that it was jarring to begin this episode and realize that shed already come to learn a lot from him off-screen  so much so that she now was purposely goading a guest into killing her, so she could return to the lab and continue to gain more information. But what she saw and learned was amazing to behold. The sequence where Lutz walked her through the different levels and she saw how Westworld worked, from the building to the programming of the Hosts, was phenomenal  backed by a beautiful, stirring music by Ramin Djawadi (Update: which I didn't realize was an orchestral version of Radiohead's ~Motion Picture Soundtrack~!) Thandie Newton has done fantastic work all season, but this episode was a true standout for her, as she expertly played Maeve going through so much and processing so much. From the sad visual of Maeve freezing up when faced with the truth about how even her thoughts arent her own, to the barely contained emotions on her face seeing the other Hosts treated like objects, Newton was captivating here. Bernard and Elsies investigation into the data being sent out of Westworld also is moving quickly, as we learned Theresa was at least partially involved (presumably to give Delos more info than Ford is willing to offer) - but that she is apparently not the only one, as someone was also re-tasking older model hosts. Both Elsie going into that spooky old theater by herself and Bernard going to simultaneously meet with Theresa played out fairly predictably  it was easy to guess Elsie was trying to warn Bernard about Theresa as she kept calling him, while Elsie getting attacked by someone felt inevitable. To be fair, that didnt make it ineffective, as I found myself quite worried for Elsie, who has great blunt moments like telling Bernard, If you were gonna sell us out, you would have done it years ago. That being said, I think its safe to assume she was taken, not killed, or we would have seen more definitive evidence of her demise. A continuing question at this point is what the hell is going on with Arnold. The long-dead Westworld co-creator is being brought up left and right, as we got confirmation that little boy robot was based on Ford himself (but built by Arnold, along with re-creations of Fords entire family)  even as that boy informed Ford that Arnold had told him to kill his dog. Arnold certainly seems to be the likely suspect for much of the reprograming going on inside the park now, including Maeve, who it turned out had already been altered, before Lutz and Sylvester did anything to her. Hell, even Elise couldnt help but say Arnolds name before she was grabbed. At this point, Im dying to know how Arnold will be personified, given he seemingly could manifest in any number of ways in Westworld. On top of all that Teddys a freaking mass murderer now! Yes, it seems the whole Wyatt storyline had a lot more to it than just giving Teddy a target for his tragic backstory, but also now making him into someone who participated in the slaughter with his old mentor. Seeing this shows version of Kenny from South Park suddenly, calmly mow down a ton of men was suitably jarring, and MIBs line, You think you know someone, the perfect comical retort. Bullet points! -Teddy and the Man in Black are told there is trouble in Pariah, the town William and Dolores (who sit this episode out) were in in the last episode  which, yes, could mean theyre arriving right after but could still also be a misdirect made to make us think these events are happening simultaneously. -Loved the glimpse of an old, shut down Host in the background of the abandoned office Bernard went into who looked very much like Yul Brynners Gunslinger robot from the original Westworld movie. -The little boy robots face opening up was a freaky visual on its own, but when his eye blinked while his skin was split open? Awesome stuff. -Great to finally see Tessa Thompson (Creed, Thor: Ragnarok) make her debut as Delos representative Charlotte. And nice bait and switch where it seemed likely she wasn't just a tourist as she flirted with Sizemore - but rather than be a spy for a rival company, she was, essentially, a spy for Westworld's parent company. There were a couple of moments in this episode of Westworld that felt a bit clich, including Elsie inevitably being grabbed and Bernard finding out about Theresas duplicity. However, this was more than made up for by the fascinating material going on for characters like Teddy and Ford  and most especially Maeve, who is on one hell of a journey of self-discovery now. Were gonna have some fun indeed.", "date": "Nov. 8, 2016,"}
