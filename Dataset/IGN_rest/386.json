In that way Civilization VI looks familiar, but its loaded with some very smart and bold improvements that give it new levels of depth. Once I get absorbed into a campaign it becomes so engrossing its difficult to think about anything else. Under its colorful, cartography-inspired art style and varied, stirring music that swells to accent what youre doing and in what era youre doing it, Civilization VI is crammed with an almost overwhelming number of systems. Its got trade, its got religion, its got espionage, its got Great People, its got archeology, its got the kitchen sink. For the most part, thats awesome because there are so many chances to build out your nation in different ways to take advantage of opportunities on its randomly generated maps and pursue the different victory types, and its all baked in at the ground level so that things like trade routes dont feel tacked on and optional (they are, in fact, the only way to build roads in the early game). This feels like a Civ game thats already had two expansions. That can make the first few games feel overwhelming, even with the tutorials. The tutorials are good, but the amount of decisions youre prompted to make from the very beginning of a game that will have significant impact on your late-game success is intimidating. That said, as an experienced Civilization player I got up to speed relatively quickly and, on my second playthrough, was able to hold my own on King difficulty without understanding everything. I still feel like Im learning more and more with every game. A lot of depth emerges from the new city-building system. A lot of depth emerges from one of the key factors that distinguishes this Civilization from the five that came before it: the new city-building system, in which key buildings like markets, temples, and barracks that have traditionally been built in nearly every city to give them basic functionality have now been broken out into 11 types of districts (Commercial Hub, Holy Site, and Encampment, among others). Those districts must be placed on tiles within a citys borders, and the number of districts you can build is limited by the population of a city, so youre forced to specialize each citys function. You might have one city thats focused on generating science for researching new technology, another focused on creating wealth, and another that builds your military units with experience boosts  or maybe you go full military and build an Encampment in all of them. It creates a lot of possible paths. Whats more, Wonder buildings (which can only exist in one city in the world and grant big bonuses) also occupy tiles, and many are limited by geography because they must be placed next to a river or a mountain or other terrain, or they have prerequisite buildings you have to build first or adjacent to. All of this cuts down on previous games Wonder spam, where one high-production city could crank out wonders quickly, and forces you to build them around your more diverse empire. Its also great that Wonders are so large and visible on the map, and that they come with impressive in-game animations of their construction. Because were playing on randomized maps every time, effectively laying out your cities districts and Wonders is a challenging puzzle. There are loads of tradeoffs to consider, but the biggest is asking if youd be better off building a district or a Wonder or working the tile theyd occupy for food and production resources, potentially allowing your city to grow bigger in the late game. Those are decisions that always feel like they matter. The land-grab phase feels urgent and exciting. Also, in a reversal of Civilization Vs empire-wide happiness level system, in Civilization VI each citys happiness has reverted back to being individually determined, and is based on how many amenities it has available  happiness is created by luxury resources or happiness-generating buildings (plus a number of other factors). That means rapid empire expansion is back on the table because you dont need to worry about the founding of new cities having a major impact on the productivity and growth of your major ones, as long as youre settling in areas that have enough luxury resources to support them. In fact, settling as many new cities as possible feels all but mandatory if you want to be competitive, which makes the land-grab phase of the early- and mid-game eras feel urgent and exciting. Speaking of the mid game, the changes Firaxis has made to reduce unit clutter from that point on are extremely smart. The first problem in most Civilization games has been that at a certain point you (and all the AI players) get stuck with a dozen or so automated Worker units sitting around idling with no more city tiles to improve, which just makes turns take longer to calculate if you dont manually disband them. In Civilization VI, Workers (now called Builders) expire after theyve been used a few times  three, by default, but that can be expanded by government policies or wonders  theyre no longer hanging around doing nothing. And if you need a new one, theyre quick to build and affordable to immediately buy with gold. They cant be automated, either, which makes the decisions of where to spend their limited charges feel meaningful again as well. Secondly, when Civilization V switched from allowing you to stack military units onto a single tile (as had been the custom through Civilization IV) to limiting you to one military unit per tile it created a more tactical kind of combat, but also caused an enormous traffic jam when you built a large army. Civilization VI gets that under control by finding a great compromise between stacks and one-unit-per-tile: once you research certain technologies you can combine two and then three identical military units into a single, more powerful corps or army unit (not entirely dissimilar to Civilization IVs Warlords). Thus the number of military units taking up space and blocking paths in the late game is sharply reduced by a half or even two-thirds, if you choose to take advantage of it. AI armies are also reduced, which means they have fewer things to shuffle around on their turns. Those AI nations are each guided by one of the 20 available leaders, and each of them has agendas that guide their behavior. That gives diplomacy some much-needed transparency thats long been missing in Civilization games. Once youve established a relationship with a leader through cozying up or espionage, you can see why theyre happy or angry with you and what steps you might be able to take to change that. Egypts Cleopatra, for example, likes other civilizations who have strong armies, and Queen Victoria likes nations that started on the same continent as England. They also have a randomized second agenda, such as preferring countries that have a high population or hating those who have more money than they do, so theyre unpredictable in every new game. Its a big step toward demystifying their behavior. Some of these agendas are irrational, such as Queen Victoria disliking when you colonize a continent she has her eye on (theres no way to know which one) or German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa getting mad when you interact with City-States (which youd have to go out of your way not to do), so its basically impossible to not anger someone at some point when youre simply going about your businesses of taking over the world. But you can mostly balance those offenses out by establishing embassies, conducting trade, respecting treaties, or just being friendly. The one downside Ive encountered is that in order to see what their motivations are you first have to have a level of access with them, and if you meet a new country in the mid game that dislikes you for unknown reasons its very difficult to establish a good enough relationship to find out why they were angry in the first place. And theyre not entirely consistent  theyll sometimes go from seemingly friendly to aggressive, presumably because they saw an opportunity they couldnt resist. (To be fair Ive been guilty of that one myself.) And one time I saw what mustve been a bug, where an AI first hated me for having a small navy but then for a few turns thought I had a huge navy before realizing Id never built a single ship and going back to hating me. 12", "date": "Oct. 27, 2016,"}
