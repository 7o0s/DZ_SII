More like this is the third time Ive reviewed Saints Row 3, and the second in as many years after last Falls technically shaky Nintendo Switch port. I bring that up because it puts me in a pretty good position to confidently say that Saints Row The Third remains not only my favorite Saints game, but also still a decidedly fun one nearly a decade after it first came out. I just thought that if Volition was going to go to all the trouble of remastering this hilarious GTA satire for 4K systems, it wouldve done a little more to live up to the gracefully aging gameplay. Heres why you should play this game, if you havent yet. Saints Row 3, while comically over-the-top, was nevertheless the last Saints game to have one foot still planted in reality before number 4 went full Matrix and Mass Effect on us. That relatability laid the foundation for some of its most memorable moments in 2011, and those remain fantastic in 2020. There was jumping out of a helicopter and parachuting down to reclaim your gangs old rooftop penthouse to the tune of Kanye Wests Power. And no matter how many times I play it, Ill still have a big smile on my face while cruising around singing along to Sublimes classic 90s tune What I Got. Its progression is still smart, too; completing missions, activities, and daring driving earns you respect and money, which can be cashed in for upgrades like dual-wielded pistols, NPC gang members you can call in as backup during battles, and increasingly stupid weapons and vehicles. Even Saints 3s story  often a weak point in open-world jack-of-all-trades games like this  is worth seeing through. There are two equally funny endings that I guarantee you wont see coming. Saints Row 3 also layered a lot of fun extracurricular activities on top of the comic-book-meets-gang-warfare story. Mayhem, in which youre given a set amount of time and unlimited ammunition for certain weapons like grenades or a rocket launcher to cause as much property damage and destruction as possible, is still gleefully fun. And Im not sure any open-world games side quest or secondary activity has given me more joy than the self-destructive Insurance Fraud mode, which combines intentionally over-the-top video game physics with the sensibility of a Looney Tunes cartoon while challenging you to throw your limp body in front of moving vehicles. The goal: to cause as much pain to yourself as humanly possible in a few minutes. Its as enjoyable now as it was in 2011. New Paint I do wish Saints Row 3 had more going on in the remaster department. The fresh coat of paint slathered over the top of Steelport honestly isnt all that attractive. I played on PC, which is the only platform including the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro where the framerate can go above 30fps, and even on Ultra settings it didnt really inspire any awe. Yes, you can tell that the car models have been redone, the character models have been touched up, and the daytime lighting is better in general, but it doesnt look anywhere near as good as something made in 2020  and a good remaster should at least be plausible as a modern game. Rain looks especially bad, and one area where Saints 3 hasnt held up well is seeing the same male and female grunts shooting at you hundreds of times. We originally reviewed Saints Row: The Third in 2011, and heres what we had to say about Volition's open-world comedic-crime sandbox back then: Original Saints Row: The Third Verdict Saints Row: The Third gives the people what they want and drops us into an open world adult theme park where we can treat ourselves to delightful acts of bloodshed and perversion. It doesn't take itself too seriously and only asks that you don't, either.  Daemon Hatfield, November 11, 2011 Score: 8.5 If youre going to deliver a remaster of a game thats only nine years old, its got to look better than this  especially if its at the end of a console generation and not up to what the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro are capable of. Were staring down the barrel of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, and their games will make this mediocre update age incredibly quickly. Still, the game that lurks underneath has fundamentally held up very well, and will still be a good time for new players even if it wont live up to the rose-colored glasses view of the returning crew.", "date": "May 21, 2020,"}
