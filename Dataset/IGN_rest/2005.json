For one thing, most mobile controllers connect over Bluetooth, which introduces a bit of lag. Secondly, all these standalone controllers arent particularly portable and often require an extra mount to attach your phone to your gamepad of choice. Razer has something a little different in mind with its Kishi controller. This little accessory is designed to split apart, wrap itself any Android phone, and connect directly through the USB-C charging port. For $80, its the most universally compatible controller weve ever used to play mobile games, but the Razer Kishi still has a few kinks to work out. Razer Kishi  Design and Features When you pull the Razer Kishi out of the box it looks just like a pair of Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons attached to a Joy-Con grip. But as we mentioned before, the controller splits apart after you pull at the two tabs on the back of the peripheral. Once separated, the two halves are connected by an elastic band, which also houses wires to transfer all the inputs from the left-side analog stick and D-pad over to the right-hand portion of the controller that features the face buttons, second analog stick, and the USB-C connector. On the inside edge of both sides of the controller, youll find a pair of rubberized pockets thatll keep a grip on your phone while tension from the elastic band prevents it from slipping out. Theres also a plastic panel in the center of the elastic band with four nubs that lock the controller together when collapsed. When expanded these nubs serve to gingerly support your phone from the center, but I wish the tips were made of soft rubber to prevent any potential scratches. One other neat engineering trick is it has a pair of slits to channel the sound from your phones bottom-firing speakers. I wished they would have done something similar for the left side as most front-firing speakers get covered up by the ribbed rubber pocket. You also get a USB-C charging port pass through, but sadly this controller doesnt add a headphone jack, so youll have to resort to using a pair of Wireless headphones or Bluetooth earbuds. If youve ever used a GameVice controller before, youll probably find the Razer Kishi to be very similar. Im not saying that Razer has ripped off the design  rather its because the company teamed up with GameVice to develop the Kishi. The Razer Kishi can handle even the gargantuan Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra The Kishi is certified to work with any Razer Phone, Google Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy 8, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and any newer phones from either Google or Samsung. Beyond those confirmed devices, I found the Kishi was able to work with a variety of devices including the LG G8X ThinQ, Red Magic 5G, Red Magic 3S, Sony Xperia 1, and OnePlus 8 Pro. Thanks to that USB-C connection, any phone you plug into this controller will just recognize it. All thats required of your phone is to have a center-mounted USB-C Port, be smaller than 78.1 x 163.7 x 8.8mm, and run Android 8.0 Oreo or a newer version of the mobile OS. As for iOS devices, Razer plans on releasing an iPhone-compatible version of the Kishi later this summer. Razer Kishi  Gaming Once your phone is strapped in between either side of this controller, the whole setup feels surprisingly solid. The two halves of the Razer Kishi also split along an interesting S-shaped curve and this serves as a natural place for your fingers to grip onto. Its a good thing you can because the Kishis flat, disk-like shape isnt terribly ergonomic  though it helps with its portability. Overall the controls here feel mostly fine with the exception of the thumbsticks that could use slightly larger tops. The buttons press consistently and you get a large D-pad that feels just a touch on the mushy side. Meanwhile, the bumpers are great and while you can hear plastic scrape while pulling triggers, there is a nice bit of resistance. As for gaming, the Razer Kishi is fully compatible with all three major game streaming services currently available including GeForce Now, Microsoft xCloud, and Google Stadia. This is particularly great because having the controller plugged directly into the phone helps remove a few milliseconds of lag I would typically experience with a Bluetooth controller. When it comes to mobile gaming, the Razer Kishis compatibility is surprisingly spotty. Shadowrun Legends, Fortnite, and Asphalt 9: Legends work perfectly with the controller and the experience definitely adds the tactile feel of buttons and triggers Ive been missing on a touchscreen device. Oddly, Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG Mobile, the two other biggest games on smartphones just dont work with the Kishi. According to Razer, this is because its still working on implementing mapping support, wherein you can map your physical buttons to virtual buttons on your screen. Razer hasnt released a timeline on when the feature will roll out, but Im hoping its soon. Razer Kishi  Software The Razer Kishi has a companion app and its pretty much just an app launcher. Its most helpful feature is it can help you discover new games designed to work with the controller. Otherwise, when updates roll out for this peripheral, youll be able to download them and install them through the app. Purchasing Guide The Razer Kishi is available for $80 from the Razer Store. If youve been jealous of gaming phones and their dedicated controller accessories but couldnt think of buying one as your main device, the Razer Kishi is a great alternative. Its one of the better phone gaming peripherals in a while and its plug-and-play simplicity is wonderful. However, you should double-check if your favorite games are listed in the Kishi app before you splurge on this peripheral.", "date": "June 30, 2020,"}
