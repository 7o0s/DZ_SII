The series lost some groundand geek credwith last year's film-based Dark of the Moon, but with no Michael Bay influence in sight, the franchise has returned with a proper follow-up to what's widely considered the best game the toy license has ever seen. Rather than taking the quick-cash path and simply duplicating War's successful formula, though, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron retains its predecessor's core appeal while tweaking its template in some significant ways. The result is another solid entry that improves upon the game that spawned it, but also takes a small robot step backwards. In terms of presentation, storytelling, and production values, Fall of Cybertron trumps its older brother across the board. While it takes place on the battling bots' same war-ravaged home planet, its visuals feature far more detail and variety. Over the course of the campaign's 13 chapters, players are treated to sprawling, scarred battlefields, cloud-sitting cityscapes, creepy interior dwellings, ancient sand-choked ruins, and slime-covered subterranean settings. Sure, the overall style is still defined by sparking scrap heaps and rusty metal, but unlike War's same-y feeling levels, each of Fall's chapters pack plenty of visual surprises. The new focus on variety doesn't just paint a prettier Cybertron, but also makes it a more interesting place to explore. Where War allowed players to pick a character before entering each level, Fall sets them up with a specific Autobot or Decepticon at the start of every chapter; this might sound limiting, but it's allowed the developers to carefully craft each chapter around a specific heros abilities. So rather than simply barreling through each level from behind any old bot with a big-ass gun, players find themselves relying on Cliffjumper's cloaking ability to navigate a level built around stealth, bouncing around a virtual jungle gym with Jazz's grappling hook, and unleashing all kinds of hell in arena-style areas as Grimlock. Speaking of the gravelly voiced Dinobot, fans will be happy to know he makes far more than just a cameo. Grimlock, with his sword-and-shield-wielding form as well as his fire-spitting Jurassic state, is playable for a good 60-90 minutes of the campaign. The other new characters possess their fair share of fan-pleasing moments, too. It's fun to unleash Metroplex, Optimus' personal, remote-controlled Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robot, and harnessing your inner Godzilla behind the screen-clearing Bruticus is an absolute blast. No co-op? No worries. Optimus is bringing friends of his own. Because Fall of Cybertron's chapters have been thoughtfully built with specific Autobots and Decepticons in mind, their overall design feels a bit more scripted and linear than War for Cybertron's levels. Despite the more directed action, there's still ample opportunity to freely transform between robot and vehicle form and even customize each bots arsenals. Regardless of which Transformer you're usingor which side of the war theyre oncollected currency, unlocked weapons, and their purchased upgrades are shared between characters. For the more adventurous types, Cybertron offers audio logs, weapon blueprints, and Energon shards off the beaten path to extend your play time. Fall of Cybertron's narrative also benefits from its character-driven approach, breaking up the standard bot-blasting action with a number of stunning set pieces and scripted events. Additionally, the inclusion of those aforementioned cameo characters not only introduce creative new ways to crush robots like beer cans, but also support key plot points; Grimlock, for example, has garnered plenty of buzz for his over-the-top attacks, but his integral role in the overarching narrative actually outshines his ability to barbeque bad guys with his breath. Many objectives are also buoyed by a fantastic sense of urgency; whether frantically outrunning rising toxic waste as Jazz or attempting to halt a getaway transport as Swindle, there are more than a few time-based tasks capable of causing heart palpitations. Additionally, a few point-defending scenarios along the campaign path could teach any Horde-like mode a thing or two about getting players' trigger fingers and pulses pounding in unison. Regrettably, War's popular campaign co-op has been cut for Fall. Though justifiable from a plot perspective, those who prefer playing with friends might see this as a replayability-siphoning deal-breaker. Campaign co-op may be on the cutting room floor, but Fall does bring back the series' excellent Escalation mode. This Horde-like challenge tasks up to four players with fending off 15 swarms of increasingly pissed-off bots. More than just an opportunity to mindlessly unload on metallic menaces, Escalation injects plenty of team-based strategy by requiring players to pool resources to unlock arsenals and upgrade weapons. Couple this cerebral layer with thoughtfully designed maps, a quartet of character classes, and the constant challenge of striking the right strategic balance between vehicle and robot forms, and Escalation delivers the most rewarding live-as-long-as-you-can mode I've played in recent memory. Players who'd rather blast buddies to bits than watch their backs can dive into the game's robust suite of competitive online options. Fall of Cybertron's team deathmatch, conquest, capture the flag, and head hunter matches put a fresh, Transformers-flavored spin on familiar competitive formulas; while objectives and goals will seem commonplace to anyone who's played any number of Call of Duty clones, the ability to swap back and forth between bot and vehicle forms adds a strategic wrinkle no military shooter can compete with. Furthermore, because just about every weapon in Fall's arsenal makes other online shooter's most powerful hand-cannons look like peashooters, managing nuanced factors such as cool-down times and ammo capacities becomes more important than simply equipping the biggest damage dealer. Longtime fans of the toys-turned-titans will especially appreciate the crazy-deep character creation tool; as players level-up and earn points, they can spend their hard-earned Energon on their own creations, tweaking their personalized classes to their hearts content. CLOSING COMMENTS Campaign co-op is definitely missed, but Fall's superior single-player mode goes a long way to make up for it. Escalation raises the bar on the now-requisite survival mode, and competitive matchescomplemented by a strong character progression and customization systemdo a fine job supplementing tried-and-true online melees with Transfomers-specifc gameplay and style. Fall of Cybertron doesn't pack the same Oh my god, someone finally made a good Transformers game! punch as its predecessor, but it's an entirely worthy successor no Optimus Prime fan should pass up.
