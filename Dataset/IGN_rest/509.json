Between the targets sits a sprawling Moroccan marketplace and an angry mob baying for the bankers blood at the embassy gates. Time is of the essence, 47 is warned, and the city is reportedly about to explode. And yet that pressure fails to translate to the level itself. It feels underdone compared to the previous missions  especially the excellent Sapienza hit  and is the least convincing and least engaging level so far. There are no drastic revisions to the formula established by previous episodes here: you have to find your own path to executing two targets. Episode by episode, this new Hitman game is still building itself into the Hitman: Blood Money sequel Agent 47 fans have been craving for almost a decade. Unlike Paris (Episode 1) and Sapienza (Episode 2), however, Marrakesh is all sizzle and no sausage. Hitman is still building itself into the Hitman: Blood Money sequel Agent 47 fans have been craving for almost a decade.It gets off to a great start, as 47 emerges from a series of narrow alleyways into a bustling square packed with spice stores and rug merchants, but theres nowhere near as much meat to Marrakesh as there was to Sapienza. The embassy isnt very large, and neither is the school, and both feel phoned in. I expected the embassy in particular to be a hive of tension based on the looming riot outside, but inside its a basic and bland office space dotted with a smattering of indifferent NPCs. Beyond the key kill locations there are a few rooftop areas containing useful items, but thats about it. Compared to Sapienza, which felt ripped from a Bond movie, Marrakesh seems slightly more linear and less imaginative, with fewer forks in the road and fewer nooks and crannies to explore and exploit. There are some unique new disguises, but several of the kill opportunities are already rehashes. Weve already done the bomb in the TV crews camera, team. Worst of all, though, is the utterly horrific voice acting. I forgave it in Paris, and it bugged me in Sapienza, but here the sheer density of NPCs in Marrakesh and the abundance of dialogue make it a complete debacle. According to its constitution, Morocco has two official languages: Arabic and Berber (or Amazighe). The Constitution itself is penned in French, which is a second language for many Moroccans. And yet Im not convinced developer Io Interactive has actually assigned anyone to Google this. Almost everyone in Hitman's Marrakesh speaks with a native American accent.Almost everyone in Hitman's Marrakesh speaks with a native American accent. And its not just the tourists, its the local shopkeepers, and even the Moroccan army soldiers all sound like theyve just strolled out of Fort Bragg. In fact, the only non-American accent I found amongst the Moroccan military was that of my target, General Zaydan, who speaks with a refined British accent (equally boggling, especially since during one spectacularly confusing conversation about Zaydan I overheard between two soldiers revealed he'd graduated from West Point; the United States Military Academy in New York, which is in neither Morocco or Great Britain). What the actual hell is going on here? Surprisingly, it actually gets worse the closer to the Swedish embassy you get. The protest leader is a proud Moroccan youth who sounds like he made a wrong turn at Santa Monica and took the long way to Spring Break. Spoiler alert: nobody in the Swedish embassy speaks Swedish either, because of course they dont. Its amateur-hour stuff, and wholly at odds with the intelligent and patient puzzle-oriented gameplay the team has successfully baked into Hitman so far. This dud VO work is seriously undermining the globetrotting, exotic atmosphere Hitman is trying to create. Its a shame because, despite Marrakesh being a little more filler than killer, Im still having a lot of fun with the new Hitman. Exploiting and outsmarting largely predictable AI remains the order of the day, but I still glean a great deal of satisfaction from plotting out a perfect path to a coveted suit-only (no costumes), Silent Assassin playthrough. Pros Intelligent, patient gameplayReplay potential remains highBustling city Cons Horrific voice actingMap is less interesting Hitman Episode 3: Marrakesh doesnt reach the highs of the previous levels and suffers more than ever from the extremely superficial approach to voice acting. Its not a bad level, but its definitely one that Id be less inclined to return to than the others Ive played so far. It's the first time I've had to question Io's episodic approach: Over the course of a traditional game presented as a single package you may come across levels that dip in quality compared to the best ones, but you can always put those levels behind you and play the next. In the case of Hitman, we can only go back to the previous two. Marrakesh is what weve got for now, and its a slight step backwards.", "date": "June 4, 2016,"}
