Its truly pretty, with some stunning architecture. But if Farm 51's FPS wasn't so striking, its mediocrity wouldn't be quite so obvious: the sumptuous art design is like a light that illuminates the clichd level design and boring puzzles. The globe-trotting shooter already pales in comparison to its inspirations: it evokes Indiana Jones, Uncharted, Tomb Raider, and the Allan Quatermain books, but with all the skill and panache of hastily written school play. It's not witty enough to be a parody, nor is it not good enough to be a peer. Quatermain is more than an inspiration, though: the handily out-of-copyright adventurer provides the historical clout for a story of ancient ruins, Nazis, Russians, and mummies. You're James Lee Quatermain, a whipless and witless descendant of the adventurer, hired to lead an expedition to find the Heart of Atlantis. He raids temples in Egypt, the Arctic, and Mayan jungles, because the ancient people he's trotting after have split the artifact and left it all over the Earth. I don't have a problem with that sort of hokey set-up, it worked for Indy and Lara which means it can and has led to surprising and wonderful things, but everything you'd expect to happen to him in those settings does. Levers are pulled, mirrors realigned, and awful quips are tossed between James, his attractive female companion, Jen, and a German scientist who does exactly what you'd expect him to about halfway through the story. There's even a mine cart chase sequence. I'd accept this traipse through tropes if the shooting was up to snuff, but it's not. It's not that the guns aren't well-realised: the WW2-era bangsticks deploy bullets with maximum efficiency, but you might as well be shooting at a hanging sheet for all the fun they are to blast at: they no-sell the bullets before falling like cautious stuntmen. They're split into two groups: Nazis and mummies. The Nazis are cowards, and will crouch behind crates and take pot-shots. It's one of those games with functional cover built out of perfectly placed crates, so you can tell where every shooter is going to hide before a shot is fired. Ironically, its the undead that bring some life to the gunplay: mummies can only be killed by a blast of light from a torch followed up with a few bullets. The old one-two punch is a lot more satisfying than chipping the health off a German elbow poking out from behind a box. It's at its best when you're fighting both sides at the same time, because the mummies and the Aryans don't get along. You can get some fun out of blinding the Germans and watching the undead maul them, but those moments are few and far between, and you're usually just fighting the tactless mummies or the nous-free Nazis (and later Russians) in isolation. And though neither side puts up much of a fight, there were a few times where I faced tediously overwhelming numbers only to die just before the autosave kicked in. Those deaths were often cheap, with a few instakill traps getting me. The one time I dared to touch water also proved immediately and bafflingly fatal. Beautiful boredom. Of all the disappointments in Deadfall Adventures, it's the puzzle design that's the most galling. That's partly because of the striking art: when you see the tumbled columns, the shafts of light, the vine choked Mayan temples, it's not hard to imagine the multi-staged Tomb Raider-esque challenges that could fill them. But instead, about 50% of the puzzles are so simple they almost come pre-solved, relying heavily on the tired theme of lining up some icons and then hitting a switch. There are others involving mirrors and redirecting light beams that at least take into account the space you're in, and a few tricks in later levels that ask you to do some vaguely Doctor Jones-style flame dodges, but those are the exception. It's all levers and symbols, crammed into a small part of an otherwise elaborately constructed world. It's such a waste to see doors with more thought put into the unlocking animation than in the method of unlocking. Multiplayer is a ghost town. There are plenty of modes, with the usual mix of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture The Flag, joined by solo and team-based Artifact Hunts. Though there are no players, I can confirm that the animated backdrop of the lobby at least makes a nice screensaver. I'm not surprised that those people who've experienced the single-player didn't want to share the experiences with the wider world, but if you did buy it you might get some enjoyment out of Survival. Its a horde mode, and one that allows the players to set off traps and burn mummies together. Combo-ing might make up a little for the lame duck design, particularly one person leading the undead in front of a giant crushing device for the others to set-off. But even with rooms full of spiky traps, its unlikely to grab you for long. Its just too uninspired. Looks awfully familiar... Pros Very prettyDiverse locations Cons Tedious combatBoring puzzlesPoor acting and writing Call of Juarez: Gunslinger and Far Cry 3 immediately spring to mind as adventurous shooters you should play long before resorting to the desperate measure of playing Deadfall Adventures. It's an uninspired retread of good concepts, and an unfortunate visitor into a genre with some genuine giants. It might take you on a long trip across the globe to visit some attractive locations, but by the end the only temples I cared for were throbbing away in my head.", "date": "Nov. 28, 2013,"}
