I was therefore biologically hardwired to think helicopters were cool. Before Desert Strike became a Super Nintendo classic in my mind, it was a childhood obsession. The isometric shooter wasn't just about killing everything in the area, but rescuing POWs and MIA allies, too. There was a purpose (beyond the novelty of chopper combat) to strafing over an enemy base and scorching its soldiers. This is what kept me hooked and what's still burned into my brain. I missed the original Choplifter, the rescue game that undoubtedly inspired Desert Strike. It's nice to have Choplifter HD, then, to remind me that I'm a 23-year-old boy still hardwired to think helicopters are cool. Choplifter HD Launch Trailer Choplifter HD draws inspiration from highscore hunting arcade games, meanwhile adding new ideas to the ancient original's formula. The 2D side-scroller has a straightforward goal: rescue groups of people as fast as possible in the fewest number of pickups. Early on, as I learned the game's basics, the back-and-forth snatch-and-grab gameplay risked becoming an exhausting exercise. I'd fly to a marker, blast attacking infantry into a fine red paste, pick up stranded survivors, get back to base, and drop off my passengers. Repeat. As the context of each stage's events evolved, my fear of boredom by this unchanging structure vanished. Swiveling and strafing to slaughter enemies behind me or in the foreground kept combat exciting and complicated. Bigger choppers can carry larger loads but are more easily hit by homing missiles and harder to maneuver. Dying patients with ticking timers added a sudden panic to my pickups; I had to prioritize who I'd grab and when, which often inconvenienced my chopper's carrying capacity or limited fuel. Before long I found myself doing math to gauge how long it'd take me to get where I needed to be. Grade-school problem solving became the key to my success. This strategy didn't last forever -- it was one of many master plans. I was only ever comfortable with how I played Choplifter HD for a few 5-minute maps at a time. Having a particular plan in place didn't necessarily work when the next group of missions added new and unpredictable problems. Snipers would stun me, thus slowing my progress and leaving me vulnerable. Powering through AA traps and RPG sentries left me outgunned. I had to turn myself into a defensive powerhouse rather than a fearless forward-mover. Objectives seemed impossible until I had an epiphany that changed my play style. Yet again I found myself enamored by the ever-changing Choplifter HD. Choplifter HD Screenshots Failure, too, told me how interested I'd become. Death was draining, even if I'd only lost two or three minutes. You accomplish a lot in a short time playing Choplifter. The other side of this coin is that overcoming defeat isn't always the gratifying accomplishment it should be. Late in the campaign I hit a point where my skills weren't sufficient. The mission was even more low-key than the rest; all I had to do was fly from one end to the other -- no pickups, no problems. The enemy firepower along the way was overwhelming. Going on the offensive didn't work, and neither did hanging back and picking off big guns. Eventually I tried ignoring the opposition altogether, which still didn't work. My solution was to do chores. I had to backtrack through past missions and earn higher star ratings to unlock a better helicopter. Perfecting each mission requires a careful balance of speed, delicacy, and power, but sometimes I wondered if sweet piloting and machine-gun skills were enough. Such frustrations are rare in Choplifter HD because its constant concern is that you're having a good time. The cheesy voice acting and snappy pilot dialogue, complemented by the occasionally ridiculous zombie outbreak, gives Choplifter a welcome funny bone to its Serious Business gameplay. This is an arcade game dedicated to arcade ways, and the allure of higher scores and faster runs will keep leaderboard hounds coming back for a good while. CLOSING COMMENTS Choplifter HD is an ace experience for bite-sized sessions and marathons alike. The goofy sense of humor, varied missions, and simple yet evolving gameplay style is a winning combination. It doesn't hold the gripping, satisfying appeal of Trials HD, Pinball FX, or Geometry Wars, but Choplifter HD is a great distraction from your usual addictions. IGN RATINGS FOR THE CHOPLIFTER HD (X360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 OVERALL Great (out of 10) The only notable feature unique to the PC version of Choplifter HD is its spotty mouse controls. I preferred the precision of an Xbox game pad to my mouse, as the aiming is not only tuned better for it, but circular within the game as well. My mouse aiming was jittery and unreliable, which made hairy situations impossible. With a controller, Choplifter HD is an ace experience for bite-sized sessions and marathons alike. The goofy sense of humor, varied missions, and simple yet evolving gameplay style is a winning combination. It doesn't hold the gripping, satisfying appeal of Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, or Super Meat Boy, but Choplifter HD is a great distraction from your usual addictions.", "date": "Jan. 9, 2012,"}
