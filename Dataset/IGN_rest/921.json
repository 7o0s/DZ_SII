With Xrd (pronounced Ex Ard, and your guess is as good as mine), Guilty Gear takes a cue from Street Fighter 4 and Killer Instinct in pulling the series closer to its roots, and its incredibly unique characters and rich combat will test fight fans abilities in incredibly rewarding ways. One of the most noticeable elements of Guilty Gear Xrd is its colorful, imaginative character design. Guilty Gear Xrds protagonists are a weird, interesting, and often amusing cast of misfits; a steady breath of fresh air compared to the karate guys and ninja gals that pad many fighting game rosters. Each member of Guilty Gear Xrds roster is wholly distinct in their core mechanics and the way they are played. While Sol and Ky feel vaguely like Ken and Ryu, it is here that familiar ground begins to fade away, replaced by sheer insanity in the form of projectiles from all angles, teleporting minions, and levitating sword traps. Warriors like Zato-1 can use his ally, Eddie, to attack an enemy from both sides, or to feign an offensive maneuver. Chipp can use his speed and his ability to teleport to confuse his opponents and break through their defenses. Theres a character to suit every style, and no two feel alike. If youre new to games like Guilty Gear, Xrd is packed with loads of helpful tutorials and challenge modes to ease you into the action. The tutorials are impressive in their depth, covering all the basics before detailing advanced concepts like mix-ups, zoning and space control, and more. The challenge modes introduce each characters unique special moves and teach a broad mix of combos, covering a range of options including standard bread and butter combos, anti-air punishes, and counter-hit combos. These instructional modes teach not only entry-level mechanics unique to Guilty Gear Xrd, they also impart knowledge of fundamental concepts present in most two-dimensional fighting games. With them, Guilty Gear Xrd does an admirable job of making it all accessible not only for those of us making the jump from other fighting games, but for those checking the genre out for the very first time. Rest assured, however, that despite its commendable approach to newbies, Guilty Gear Xrd is a game whose learning curve ramps from gentle slope to sheer brick wall seemingly in the blink of an eye. This is an incredibly complex and technical battleground populated by some of the most imaginative and downright bizarre protagonists in any game, anywhere. It will push your dexterity and reactions, and reward your patience. Memorizing basic combos opens the door to learn exponentially more difficult ones incorporating mid-air dashes, double jumps, counter hits, and more. Learning new ways to unleash the offensive potential of my character left me with a sense of satisfaction; taking that knowledge into an actual match and executing it correctly imparted a sense of pride. While Xrd will feel immediately familiar to long-time Guilty Gear fans, a surprising amount has changed. The Roman Cancel system returns in expanded form, allowing players to cancel out of virtually any attack animation, whether it made contact with the opponent or not - a first for the Guilty Gear series. Dust Attacks, which launch your target far into the air to be juggled, have also been expanded upon, with Xrd implementing a dashing follow-up which opens all new combo options to utilize against enemies in the corner. Then theres the Blitz Shield, a powerful new defensive tool that can quickly reverse the momentum of a match, giving you breathing room against an especially aggressive opponent. Xrd has enough new features and mechanics to feel like a true sequel, while excellently retaining many of the classic elements that impart the good old feeling of a Guilty Gear game. Pros Creative charactersEasy to approach, difficult to masterVibrant graphicsExcellent soundtrack Cons Poorly organized network options Guilty Gear Xrd has enough wacky characters and well-crafted tutorials to be interesting for novices, but its those of us seeking a challenge that will find the most to love here. The online experience is a little rough, but its wildly diverse cast, and its dynamic, offense-oriented combat system makes Guilty Gear Xrd a triumphant, long-awaited return for this venerable fighting game franchise.", "date": "Dec. 17, 2014,"}
