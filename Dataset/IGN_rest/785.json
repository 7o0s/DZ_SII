On paper it's a sure-fire winner: take Magicka, with its comical little wizards and huge number of elemental spell combos and counterspells, add team-based multiplayer, and make it free-to-play in a fair and appealing way. So why is the reality so frequently lackluster? It remains a fun game, because theres something inherently enjoyable about that skill-based Magicka formula, but Wizard Wars shows how a poorly thought-out MOBA-inspired design can suck the magic out of a game. ] Developer Paradox North hasnt done Wizard Wars any favors in saddling it with a surprisingly crude and unstable client. Wizard Wars may bring back some unwelcome memories of Magicka 1s famously rocky co-op: half my attempts to join a session have ended in crashes or matchmaking failures. I've sat in a game lobby for several minutes, watching fellow players flicker in and out, resetting the countdown timer each time they reconnect. When a game ends, you get a fleeting glance at the score screen before ~CONNECTION LOST~ pops-up and you're dumped back to the main menu. Or the desktop, depending on how Wizard Wars is feeling that day. It's not game-killingly bad. Most of the time I'm able to find a match within a few minutes of sitting down (give or take a few restarts), and once I'm in, I'll almost certainly get to play it through to the end. But there are also times when either matchmaking is broken or there is practically nobody online playing  even in the week following the official launch. Either seems plausible, but it means that Wizard Wars is a game that I always approach with the mindset of ~I'll try to play,~ rather than ~I'm going to play.~ Once you get into a match, things are much more stable. The trouble is that even when Wizard Wars is on its best technical behavior, you're playing a MOBA version of Magicka where the MOBA and the Magicka aspects don't complement each other so much as just exist alongside each other. Of Wizard Wars' three game modes, Wizard Warfare is the clear winner. It's a control-point-based spawn-ticket game where the first team to run out of respawns, or to be locked out of all the spawn points, loses the game. It's fast-paced, dynamic, and progresses to a swift endgame. There are several different maps, each one has slightly different dynamics that allow for sneak attacks and rush strategies. The one-on-one Wizard Duel probably gives you purest magical competition. There's a couple teleporters to allow players to maneuver, but it really comes down to casting spells and blocks more effectively that your opponent. On the other hand, the distance is so compressed that it starts to feel a little random. Whoever gets a little behind on hit points is easy prey for spammed melee attacks, and wizard melees always felt a little anticlimactic to me. But most of the time, and especially in the other game modes, victory is a matter of who proves to be the better wizard. You can queue up to three spells, combining different effects to make new spells, and then choosing how you want to cast them. It's all as enjoyable as ever, though a bit overwhelming at the start. With time, however, I took great satisfaction in casting protective wards on my character based on what spells other players were favoring (giving myself wards against Death and Fire magic, for instance, when I saw players making use of fiery beams of Death magic). Knowing what spells will be effective against which defenses, and how to deploy shields and traps of your own to defend yourself, gives Wizard Wars a bit of the feeling of a fighting game. That works well in Wizard War and the Duels, but the MOBA-style Soul Harvest game mode ends up being a misfire because it shoehorns Magicka gameplay into a drawn-out format that doesnt suit it. Since Magicka wizards don't level up or get more powerful as the game goes on, there is nothing to create an endgame. The two teams merely cycle around creep camps, slaughtering the same groups of mindless monsters, until they bring down each other's defenses and can destroy the other team's effigy. Fighting other players is almost a waste of time, especially since the respawn timers never change. In fact, if you win a big teamfight near the end of a game, it becomes harder to finish them off because your opponents instantly respawn at their base, which means they'll be waiting for you when you get there. When you have a MOBA where you're telling your team not to fight other players because winning will cost you the game, something has gone awry. The odds of having a fair game are also pretty small, unfortunately. Whether it's because of the server instability issues that I experienced in the client, or because Wizard Wars does nothing to discourage people from abandoning games or being abusive (there's no ~report player~ option), most games I've played have seen the 4v4 erode into a 4v3, or even a 4v2 or 3v2. That's a hard blow in a Soul Harvest game, which depends entirely on team's abilities to spread out across the map to farm for souls. It's stuff like this that really hurts Wizard Wars as a competitive game. Not being able to report players is infuriating in a MOBA that allows friendly fire. One of my first games had a player on my team running around killing everyone in his path, whether a friendly or not, and it cost us the game after 30 or 40 minutes of misery. The griefer was the second-highest scoring player. Any online competitive game needs a way to deal with people like that. Wizard Wars doesn't have one. Since Magicka doesn't really have distinct characters (everyone is a faceless robed figure with access to the same set of spells) it's metagame elements take the place of traditional MOBA class and character distinctions. You can buy (with real money or in-game gold) items and equipment that provide special bonuses and penalties. You also gain experience and unlock masteries, which give you access to special equipment and special, limited-use powers (think ~ultimates~ in other MOBAs). So it's important to play to your strengths: I favor Death magic, so my special robe, staff, and underpants (hey, this is Magicka) all give me Death magic bonuses, but at the expense of penalties to Fire. So Fire has basically vanished from my repertoire while Death is a part of almost every spell combo I use. However, it's harder to approach other players the same way. You can see their bonuses before a match starts but, once you're in-game, who is going to remember that the green wizard with the chainmail has a healing bonus and extra HP while the guy in the ninja robes has wait, I forgot what the ninja robe does. See what I mean? Finally, there is the store where you can buy things with real money or currency earned during battle. As you play, you get treasure chests that have to be unlocked with keys (similar to Dota 2s system). You don't know what's in the chest, but you do know how rare it is, so there's always a temptation to go get some keys when you're sitting on particularly rare loot. You can also just buy some equipment outright. Yet I never felt like I was getting the hard sell. Wizard Wars isn't a poorer experience with basic gear, and fundamentally it's the same game no matter what you're using in battle. Which is, of course, Wizard Wars' biggest problem. As I said at the start, there is something fundamentally enjoyable about Magicka, and the same is true of Wizard Wars. Magicka has always been a lighter, sillier kind of game about semi-competent wizards running around blowing themselves and others to pieces. However, Wizard Wars' conservative approach to adapting Magicka to the MOBA template makes for a game that's long on repetition and short on tactical depth. Pros Wizard battling is greatColorful graphics and art Cons No community policingUnstable servers & clientShallow MOBA elements Magicka: Wizard Wars is a great platform for PvP wizardry, but it makes for a thin MOBA. It's still enjoyable when you find yourself in a good game, but a shoddy server situation and nonexistent community policing makes those way too rare.", "date": "May 6, 2015, 1"}
