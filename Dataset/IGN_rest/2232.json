We've already reviewed the 2060 Super and 2070 Super, but the RTX 2080 Super was pushed back a bit, and now it's finally here. Nvidia has given the RTX 2080 Super faster memory and a few more CUDA cores while leaving the price exactly the same at $699, so it's kind of a free upgrade of sorts. The RTX 2080 Ti is untouched, for now, and remains at the top of Nvidia's product stack at $1,200 with the 2080 Super slotting in below it for $500 less. GeForce RTX 2080 Super  Design and Features Here are the big changes from the RTX 2080; it has 4.3 percent more CUDA cores (2,904 -> 3,072), eight more texture units, and faster memory, going with 15.5Gb/s GDDR6 versus 14Gb/s memory on the previous model. It has the same ~8 Gigaray~ performance as the previous 2080 when it comes to ray tracing, the same memory, and higher clock speeds. TDP has increased from 225w to 250w. Here's how it compares to similar GPUs: Overall this is a very mild spec bump, especially compared to the treatment the 2070 and 2060 received. It's a bit odd since the RTX 2080 doesn't have any real competition. It's a bit similar to when Nvidia released a ~new~ version of the GTX 1060 with faster memory, and nobody really cared about it since the performance bump was so tiny. The main difference between this newer version is that faster memory, so it seems like the only situations where this GPU will really be faster than its predecessor is in games where that was an issue. Nvidia claims this GPU is faster than a Titan XP, which was the Pascal Titan card that slightly eclipsed the legendary GTX 1080 Ti. Like the previous Super cards, it now has a shiny metallic surface, which looks really slick, but this mirrored surface lies face-down when installed in my gaming PC so nobody will see it, which is a shame. The metallic backplate is still here too, and it looks as good as ever and also contributes to this GPU's premium look and feel. This looks like a high-end GPU no doubt, and as I've said before, Nvidia did a really good job with its ~reference design~ for the Turing GPUs. It's in an entirely different universe compared to the loud, plastic blower designs AMD just foisted on the gaming public with its RX 5700 XT and vanilla 5700 GPUs. Hopefully the AIBs will correct that foible. So basically, there's not a huge change for the Super variant of this card, as it seems like the least ~super-d~ of the bunch. There's also no telling whether Nvidia will release a 2080 Ti Super because they certainly don't need to. They didn't even need to release this GPU, honestly. Just like the rest of the high-end RTX cards, the 2080 Super has three DisplayPorts, one HDMI port, and one USB Type-C port for VR. It has a TDP of 250w like the 2080 Ti and uses an eight-pin and six-pin connector. It also comes with NVLink connectors in case you want to run two of them, if anyone does that anymore. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super  Benchmarks and Overclocking To test the RTX 2080 Super I tossed it into a brand-new GPU test bench, which was upgraded due to the untimely death of our previous Skylake platform. The new rig consists of a Core i5-9600K CPU, an MSI Z390 motherboard, Corsair PSU, 16GB of Corsair memory, and a SanDisk SSD. I ran all the tests at the highest settings available for each game without anti-aliasing, running DX11 by default. Starting at 4K resolution, there is almost no difference between the Super variant and the OG 2080. There is a bump of about 5 percent in the Witcher, but in the rest of the games, it's too close to declare one card faster than the other. This is a bit of a disappointment, especially if you thought the 2080 Super was going to be a reborn 4K beast of a GPU or that it would be a lot closer to the RTX 2080 Ti. Nope; it's pretty much the same as the regular 2080. Of course, the RTX 2080 Ti is still way out in front, as expected given its $500 price difference. All that said, Nvidia hasn't increased the price of this GPU at all, so there's not anything to officially complain about as they're not price gouging here. It's possible the Super card might be significantly faster on a different game that I didn't test, but with the games I tested, there was almost no difference between the Super version and the regular version. It's faster across the board than the GTX 1080 Ti, however. At 2560 x 1440 things are looking a little better for the RTX 2080, as it's able to crank out really high framerates in most titles, except for Metro's brutal benchmark. And once again, depending on the game we see between five and eight percent uplift, but on some games, there's no difference between the two GPUs at all. At 1080p the situation is pretty much the same as 4K, except there's pretty clearly some CPU bottlenecking going on. Also, I doubt anyone who buys this GPU is running at 1080p. Still, I figured people would be curious so there are the numbers. There's not much difference between the original RTX 2080 except in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Finally, when it comes to overclocking the RTX 2080 Super performed admirably. Running Heaven 4.0 and nudging the offset ever-so-slightly until things went sideways, I was able to hit a maximum stable clock of 2025MHz. Even at these high clocks the GPU only got a mildly toasty 76C, which is impressive given the recent tests of AMD's card, which run hotter and louder than Nvidia's Turing cards. If you don't want to manually overclock, and just let the card run on its own, my sample settled down to a pretty high 1890Mhz, which is over spec for this GPU. The RTX 2080 Super is by no means a bad GPU or a terrible deal, but the performance bump compared to the RTX 2080 ranges from mild to non-existent in some games. Thank goodness Nvidia didn't raise the price otherwise this would be a bad launch for team green. Overall it's still a great GPU though, in that it's very powerful and runs silent and cool. Still, I think people expected more from this GPU based on the previous Super variants.", "date": "July 23, 2019,"}
