It is a genuinely amazing package that now includes six of Microsofts classic single-player and co-op campaigns and legendary multiplayer modes, at long last free of any red-flag technical caveats. 343 Industries deserves a ton of credit for sticking with it after a notoriously bad launch and completing the long-term renovation of the house while its occupants lived (and played) inside. Its admittedly a bit later than Id anticipated, but the love letter to Master Chief has finally been delivered. Crucially, matchmaking just works. Ive played around 30 rounds in the past week with no fuss, no drops, no lag, and no BS. As a longtime fan, its wonderful that MCCs interface lets you make awesomely specific game mode requests. Want Big Team Battle in Halo 1? Youve got it. Want SWAT in Halo 2 or Halo 2 Anniversary? Done. Are you open to any of the games as long as you get an Oddball match? Ask, and ye shall receive. I searched my own Halo-fan heart for the most obscure scenarios I could think of and was obliged every single time. Even Firefight has been imported (from Reach) and its still a blast; its no wonder it helped fellow Xbox heavyweight Gears of War set off a wave of cooperative PvE multiplayer modes thats still going strong today. Granted, I did often have to wait, sometimes for up to three minutes. Even though The Master Chief Collection is available to everybody on Xbox Game Pass and the community is healthy, this isnt quite like the Halo 2/Halo 3 heyday where everybody and their mother was playing and you could find a game in seconds. But in every single instance, I always got what I wanted. And when the rounds actually started, they were buttery smooth every single time  even in Halo 1, which was never designed for online play. Furthermore, quality-of-life features such as a Modern Controls option, customizable and highly specific thumbstick dead zone settings, a text chat window, and a bump to 4K and a now-rock-solid 60fps on the Xbox One X highlight how Master Chief Collection feels like a fresh, modern, living entity rather than just a five-year-old package of even older ports held together with Scotch tape and rubber bands. Ryan's Ranking of the Halo Games (Overall, Campaign + Multiplayer) Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Halo 3 Halo 3: ODST Halo 4 Halo Reach Halo 5: Guardians What's your favorite? A quick word on Halo Reach, as its the most recent addition to MCC and the first part of launching the whole package on PC. In short, for a nine-year-old game, it still looks quite good after its 4K cleanup on both Xbox One and PC, and it controls beautifully. 343s first PC game feels a lot more natural on mouse and keyboard than when Gearbox brought Halo 1 to PC back in 2003, and offers PC-centric customization options like FOV adjustments. Audio issues are a bit wonky right now, though, with sound levels for various elements being too loud or too soft, but its more of an annoyance. If the rest of the Master Chief Collections PC ports are up to this standard, thatll be excellent news. All of the previously included campaigns have aged gracefully, too. Halo 4 remains underappreciated, and with its 4K/60fps enhancement it still looks like a recent game on Xbox One X. Halo 3, ODST (also new since MCCs original launch), and Reach are largely unchanged outside of the resolution and framerate bump, and even Combat Evolved looks surprisingly clean, image quality-wise, for an almost 20-year-old game. Its a classic for a reason. Halo 2s Anniversary treatment, meanwhile  which enhanced both the campaign and a select group of multiplayer maps (everythings available, though most of it hasnt gotten the facelift) is holding up nicely. Heres what I said about it in my 2014 review, all of which remains true today: I jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges  I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, theyre hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I dont agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversarys parts  most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second  trumps its minor annoyances. About My Original Review This one has always bothered me. See, I got my original review of 2014s Halo: The Master Chief Collection wrong. I held it for a few days after launch at the time, hoping 343 would patch up the then-four-game collections catastrophic matchmaking and connectivity issues, and then I put a 9.0 on it on the strength of its four fantastic campaigns and the faith that the multiplayer issues would be resolved soon enough. As it turned out, of course, The Master Chief Collection didnt deserve the benefit of the doubt. What shouldve been a dream package for Halo fans was instead a nightmare on the multiplayer side. And for our part, we learned an important lesson and soon began making more use of reviews in progress for server-dependant games in order to help prevent this from happening again. Fast-forward five years and a lot has changed. Xbox Game Pass is a thing now, and any subscriber gets full access to MCC. The Xbox One X also exists, and playing MCC on it gives you 4K resolution. Even better, the collection has grown to six games, adding Halo 3: ODST and, most recently, Halo Reach (including Firefight mode). The latter is also now available on PC  via Steam, no less!  and serves as the starting point for bringing the whole shebang faithfully to Windows, game by game, between now and Halo Infinites launch in Fall 2020. The Master Chief Collection makes good on most of its promises. It packs in four full games worth of single-player and co-op action, all spruced up and running better than ever before. It saddens me that, because of its early online multiplayer problems, what shouldve been a celebration of the return of Halos old-school multiplayer greatness is currently an exercise in frustration. Right now we can only sit back and wait for Microsoft to fix its servers and party problems, and until then the greatness of revived and enhanced Halo 2 multiplayer is still an unfulfilled promise. Still, great games like this should never die. This collection delivers more than a huge Halo fan like myself could have reasonably imagined and, even with its (hopefully temporary) online issues, it packs an insane amount of first-person shooter greatness onto one disc. Heres to reliving old memories and creating new ones, because maybe in 10 years from now, this Master Chief Collection will mean to some of you what Halo 2 meant to me a decade ago.", "date": "Dec. 14, 2019,"}
