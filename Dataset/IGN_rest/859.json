There I am, minding my own business as I mosey down a typical dark, wooded pathway, when suddenly boulders start falling down toward my head like Louisiana rain. Luckily I survive. But barely has the dust cleared before I hear one of the morons asking his buddies if I'm still alive, and after all I've been through  after goblin ambushes, plague-spitting rats, and grumpy merchants  it's just too much to handle. I jump up toward them, prepared to teach them a lesson with the business end of my axe, and you know what? I do. Acting out this scenario, which sprung from a the hand dealt to me in a virtual collectable card game, in real-time action gave me more enjoyment than I would ordinarily have gotten out of this kind of simple attack-and-counter combat. It's a competent collectible card game on one level, yes, but it's also an action-RPG with little sprinkles of choose-your-own-adventure stylings thrown in for good measure. The key triumph of Hand of Fate is that, despite some complications with the action, it manages to juggle such motley components without dropping and shattering them and the fun. It certainly doesn't hurt that this world oozes with personality, created by presenting a game within a game. My in-game character spends all of my sessions seated across a game table from a guy who looks like Richard the Warlock from the LFG webcomic, watching as he throws down cards with attractive art that draws obvious inspiration from Renaissance woodcuts. He's there for the duration, and it's a good thing that he's likable despite a faint air of menace. Always quick to deliver a dour quip in a sonorous voice (~For eons I have waited for an more appropriate player; it seems there are more eons ahead,~ as he says during a lull), he plays less like a Magic: The Gathering deckmaster and more like a tarot reader, revealing my fortune in familiar spreads like the Celtic Cross. In a sense, he is: his face-down placement of the cards resembles the rough outlines of a dungeon map, and progression hinges on moving a golden gamepiece from card to card, turn by turn. It sounds a tad complex on paper, but it's easy to learn the rules and quirks just by playing. It's crafted so well that, early on, it does more to recapture the open-ended nature of old pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons sessions than games that bury you under arcane stats and scripted scenarios. At the same time, it usually works so well in part because it's not completely random. My customized deck determines the possibilities of each level, and it's stuffed with cards for both weapons and encounters that I've won from tokens awarded after victories in the roughly 10-hour story mode. Early on I preferred the Helpful Priest card, which grants blessings if you give the poor sap half your food (the resource needed to make the jump from card to card). At other times I might uncover the Winding Trail, which might toss me into real-time battle for the chance to win access to one of the weapons I'd woven into my deck. It's a setup that would quickly grow boring and predictable if left alone, but Hand of Fate wisely complicates things by letting the dealer tossing in curses that sap life or food, or, in his better moods, friendly priests that can undo the damage. If there's a problem, it's that he's a tad too generous for the first few hours, as food replenishes quickly enough to make failure a near-impossibility. True, the Rock Fall described above originated from his cards, and it could have ended in death had I not drawn a ~Success~ card from the four cards he slapped down in response. And then there's the combat, which occurs when I reveal a card for, say, Goblins, and the dealer draws a numbered card specifying how many goblins I fight. The system smartly relies on risks for rewards. You start off with shabby gear with each ~level,~ but opportunities to pick up better stuff continually present themselves depending on how you've structured your deck. Throw a ~Embertown Hero~ encounter card in your deck, for instance, and your travels might lead you to a dying knight who offers to give you that godly frost sword you stuffed in your deck if you agree to kill some random enemies for him. In such extended playthroughs, it's perhaps inevitable that the dull pangs of repetition set in, likely because Hand of Fates component features are relatively simple despite their depth when mashed together. On the bright side, I found that stepping away from the game for a few hours was enough to rekindle my interest. Usually I found myself more bothered by technical issues, such as the way the dealer's shuffling animation bogs the Xbox One down to a crawl or how the music and the dealer's voice often cut out on the PC version. Of the two I sampled, the Xbox One version seems far more stable. Pros Great CCG and action mixEndless modeThoughtful deck-building Cons Glitches and frame rate issuesSimple combat Hand of Fate takes familiar elements from collectible card games, action RPGs, and choose-your-own adventure games and jumbles them all together to create an experience that generally feels unique and fun. Isolated technical glitches, an overly generous dealer, and simple combat dampen some of the fun, but the novelty of the design is usually strong enough to pull up the slack.", "date": "Feb. 21, 2015,"}
