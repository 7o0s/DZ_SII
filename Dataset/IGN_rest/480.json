Its mix of Dark Souls-style action and roguelike-style randomized dungeons is meant to be replayed over and over, but the hard truth is that the procedural differences dont add the kind of variety from run to run thats needed to draw me in again and again. You and up to three friends are adventurers from wherever, set atop the tip of an ancient, atmospheric pyramid with one goal: work your way down to the bottom and find out what lies below. Each step down brings a new, larger, procedurally randomized level full of enemies, rarer weapons and armor sets, and gems to be spent on crafting materials, potions, equipment, blessings, and everything else an adventurer needs. Its an exciting premise for dungeon-crawling diehards, especially when taking it all in through the handsome, minimalistic, low-polygonal style for the first time. Outside the large mural depicting the control scheme, nothing in Necropolis carries meaningful information like statistics or instructions, which means youre left to trial and error (or an external wiki) to figure out what everything does. On top of this is a sarcastic narrator who laughs at your plight, spearheading the overall goofy tone and rapidfire dungeon-fantasy cliches. All this is fine at first, because every death forces you to restart from the beginning with next to nothing, and that gives you plenty of chances to learn the basics as you build and rebuild your hero. Those early repeated attempts also did a good job of gradually exposing Necropolis intentionally vague story in a way you wouldnt see on a single linear run. My second attempt to reach the heart of the dungeon revealed little details Id missed or hadnt seen the time before, like the treasure-laden secret passages that are easily missed if you dont know what to look for. But the pool of rooms, enemies, and secrets the level generator draws from isnt as deep as Necropolis needs it to be in order to stay fresh for long, which quickly introduces the feeling of diminishing returns with each trip back to the tip of the pyramid. Different configurations of the same hallways, rooms, and landmarks and slight variations on the dozen or so enemy types roam the halls in different combinations, but by my fourth attempt I felt as though I had seen everything the Necropolis had to offer. At that point I was able to conquer the dungeon on that run in about four hours. Necropolis is strongest in combat, which naturally makes up the vast majority of its moment-to-moment gameplay. Its combat controls handle similarly to (but arent quite as tight or frame-based as) Dark Souls, providing a block, parry, and dodge to avoid the elemental attacks and projectiles from hordes of monsters, clockwork creatures, and undead. And youll need that, because these enemies constantly spawn throughout each level  including areas youve already cleared and directly behind you to a degree that sometimes becomes obnoxious. Its easy-to-grasp attacks tap into the stamina bar to chain combos of light and heavy attacks, culminating in explosive charged attacks that change depending on which of the dozens of weapons youre currently wielding. For example, charging a light attack with a sword sends you whirling toward an enemy while a charged heavy attack with a staff smashes the ground with elemental destruction. These attacks punctuate the combat and are immensely satisfying when you use one to level an entire mob of pursuing minions with well-timed execution. In fact, I found this tactic in particular to be almost too effective in clearing entire rooms of enemies at once, while those too big to destroyed in this way could be handled deftly by dodging circles and striking from behind. It would be easy to settle into this monotonous hack-and-slash pattern, but Necropolis smart exhaustion system prevents you from plowing through its depths with ease by continuously reducing your maximum stamina as you progress through the dungeon, stealing large chunks of your stamina bar with every charged power attack. Eventually, exhaustion sets in and your paralyzingly small stamina pool cripples your damage output. Its a thoughtful twist to the familiar action combat that forces breaks to craft and eat food in order to recover. Necropolis crafting is simple but hearty. You pick up chunks of flesh, crystals, bones, or whatever, and whip up recipes for lifesaving rations, potions, and bombs. The catch is you know almost no recipes at first  a few types of rations, a potion or two  and must buy the rest from the few vendors scattered throughout each level of the dungeon on each run. Here, too, the potion descriptions are missing statistics, but their effects are much more obvious: a Potion of Vigor restores health and stamina, a fire bomb explodes in flame when you throw it, and an Iron Ration is better than a Standard Ration, which is better than Rotten Food, and so on. But there are much more intuitive consumables that makes you invincible, invisible, incredibly fast, tough as stone, hit like a truck, and so on. Learning each recipe unlocks another tool, but I regularly found myself only buying a half dozen of the more crucial ones in any given playthrough  like the best food recipes. This was disappointing to me, since crafting is such a dynamic portion of Necropolis that you could get by with just the basics, and I was never tested enough to need to dip into the more fanciful vials. Playing games with friends almost always makes them better, and Necropolis is no exception to that rule. Though the quicker pace of chewing through enemies as a team and the sharing of wealth lessens the atmospheric, learn-as-you-go tone for the sake of trying to get your share of the treasure and monster-slaying before its grabbed by your friends, thats more than made up for by moments when you can lead a pack of monsters into your partner so they can annihilate them in one massive strike. There are no real tag-team attacks or ability synergies in the system, though, which feels like a missed co-opportunity. Whats really unusual about Necropolis as a roguelike-style game is that you and your friends can revive each other if someone is killed, and only a full party wipe will send you back to the start. That safety net strangely really takes the fangs out of the Necropolis; when permanent death is the greatest threat in the dungeon, and the marquee feature of the experience effectively removes that danger, theres a conflict at the core. On the other hand, Necropolis somewhat compensates through the inclusion of friendly fire. So while your friends can save you from death, theyre also likely to kill you more often than the creatures roaming the halls  which works out because so much of the danger is sapped from multiple players tearing through the halls like wrecking balls. Admittedly, the understanding needed to be successful in the dungeon can take some time to foster since Necropolis goes out of its way to be as minimalist as possible when it comes to explaining how its systems work  like why youre losing stamina for seemingly every reason. Theres little help to be found in item descriptions other than silly fantasy tropes and clever humor. The Demonic Armor, for instance, simply states, Demons are extremely useful for many things, apparently, including as sewing materials. Funny? Yes. Informative? No. This dedication to cheeky vagueness and lack of statistics or clear instructions means Im still questioning what certain items, armor sets, and weapons are supposed to do, if anything. The Demonic Armor is the rare exception, because its boost to your max HP is visually represented on your hitpoint bar  so, mystery solved. But even after 15 hours spent fighting my way through dungeons there are many more weapons, armor sets, and items Ive since given up on understanding. The worst offenders are the codexes, which are unlockable books that add fun, useful, or strategic modifiers to your character when equipped. Theyre one of the only types of item that persist through death in Necropolis, and can be a huge boon  but true to form, they are incredibly nebulously described. One codex, called Vampirism Is Your Friend, touts the description, Drink your way to a healthier you. Blood is the answer youre looking for!  which is pretty straightforward: you can restore your health by damaging enemies. Other codexes, such as Half the Fun of Falling Is Missing the Ground, is less intuitive: In section one, we look at the fall. Where are you falling (an abyss, a fiery chasm, into some beast)? In this, you find the key. Even after taking some leaps of faith that ended poorly, I have no idea what this means. Its frustrating to be unable to make full use of these hard-earned items, because theyre the most compelling of only two reasons to replay Necropolis. The other being collectible skins that do nothing except change the color of your character's outfit. Even together, though, theyre not enough to provide as much variety as is needed to make more than a few runs through Necropolis lightly randomized dungeons interesting and unpredictable. The real surprise elements in Necropolis are the occasional bugs. In one instance, I clipped through a wall. In another, I fell through the floor and down to the next level -- which actually netted me an achievement for descending a level without using the elevator. The most regular being a vendor bug that incorrectly described the items for sale as items from my personal inventory, preventing me from buying anything. These issues never fully broke Necropolis for me, but took their toll all the same. Necropolis pulls many ideas together to ultimately deliver a satisfactory, short dungeon-diving experience thats best enjoyed with friends. Some of its ideas conflict with each other (such as permadeath and teammate revival), its procedural generation doesnt offer much in the way of replayability, and its intentional vagueness can be frustrating, but its good for at least a few monster-smashing runs before it gets old thanks to enjoyable combat mechanics, cheeky humor, and the promise of mystery.", "date": "July 15, 2016,"}
