It has a plethora of things to do and a variety of ways to do them, and features some lovely graphics and catchy tunes. Those charms are slightly tarnished by the paper-thin plot, uneven pacing, and an under-utilized monarchy system, but even with a few smudges on its noble crown, Rune Factory 4 rules. The story is fairly straightforward. As a hero (or heroine) you literally drop into the small town of Selphia after a scuffle on an airship leaves with you with amnesia, where youre mistaken for royalty and asked to rule the town and help turn it into a popular tourist destination. Without any real reason to say no, your hero proceeds to spend their time doing some serious multitasking. Rune Factory 4 Special for Switch Update by Casey DeFreitas, February 25, 2020 Rune Factory 4 Special for the Nintendo Switch is an upgraded remaster of the original 3DS game with noticeably better graphics and some new content. You can watch the trailer for Rune Factory 4 Special below for a feel of the graphics and gameplay. Rune Factory 4 was, as noted by the original reviewer, already a great game, which Im happy to agree with after playing around 14 hours of Special. Id actually praise Rune Factory 4 Special even more, as it mashes together just about every genre and mechanic I love in games  things like monster taming, dungeon exploring, RPG skill progression, relationship building, and a whole, whole lot more. Whether its harvesting the perfect turnip, taming the best monster, crafting the best gear, or marrying the most beautiful waifu or husbando, there are so many things to do in Rune Factory 4 Special its nearly impossible to focus on just one. For a 3DS game, Rune Factory 4 Special looks pretty good on the Switch. Everything from the anime character portraits to the character models and backgrounds have obviously been greatly improved. Besides the graphics update, there are new features and content. A seemingly small improvement is the expanded save slots, which is always welcome for RPGs like this one for those who may want to save scum (guilty) or those who like having different games going at once. Also available from the outset in the main menu is the option Another Episode, but I dont recommend looking at these short voice dramas illustrated by comics until after you complete the main story. Though more will be available for download at a later date, only Ventuswills is viewable at the moment anyway. Theres also a new difficulty mode for veteran Rune Factory players, called Hell: For the greatest challenge, and a brand-new Newlywed Mode thats unlocked once you marry one of the 12 bachelors/bachelorettes (six of each). There are some new cutscenes, and some of the existing cutscenes have been improved upon from the original, too. For example, during the field tutorial on the 3DS, the environment is replaced by a flat blue color; in Rune Factory 4 Special, the environment persists. Also, a quick hint: to get things moving quickly in Rune Factory 4 Special, take the exit south of town to start fighting monsters and progressing the story. You can ask Forte to join you, and if you get in too deep, you can press ZR to fast travel to the entrance, and then again to go back to your room, whenever you want. Multitasking is definitely the key word here, because there's a lot to do in Rune Factory 4. Activities include fishing, farming, cooking, crafting, exploring dungeons, running a store, fighting and taming monsters, (deep breath) issuing orders, running errands, participating in festivals, and wooing one of Selphia's eligible bachelors or bachelorettes. Keep in mind that almost all of these things cost you Rune energy (the Rune Factory equivalent of magic points), so you'll not only have to manage your time carefully, youll also have to ensure you don't overexert yourself. A little exhaustion is well worth it though, as doing multiple tasks in the space of a single day is incredibly rewarding. The Rune Factory series is a spin-off of Harvest Moon, so its no surprise that one of the most enjoyable tasks in Rune Factory 4 is farming. Besides tilling the land, planting seeds, watering crops and harvesting them at the right time, you can also inspect the quality of the soil and use items to protect your fields from damaging storms. Once youve reaped what youve sown, you can then sell your bounty for money, or turn veggies into tasty dishes that can be consumed for energy or given to one of the townspeople to improve your friendship with them. Its an involved process that can get repetitive at times, but it ultimately proves rewarding when the cash and compliments from NPCs start rolling in. Combat is also rewarding, with fast-paced action and easy-to-understand mechanics that allow you to equip weapons, spells and abilities by simply mapping them to one of four assigned slots (the X, Y, RY and RX buttons). You can also swap them out at any time by opening up the in-game menu with a quick press of the left shoulder button. This is an especially handy feature when you need to change your strategy on the fly, which happens a lot since Rune Factory 4 features some pretty tough enemies. But dont worry, you wont always have to fight them. Like previous Rune Factory games, almost all the monsters you encounter are tamable. All you have to do is figure out the right food or items to give them (which requires a bit of trial and error). Once youve made a new friend, you can order them to follow you into battle or send them home, where theyll help out with the farmwork. Some even produce useful items that you can craft things from, so its worth making a few furry friends. Farming and fighting are great, but the best part of Rune Factory 4 is its surprisingly in-depth romances. There are six eligible bachelors or bachelorettes in town for you to choose from, each with their own likes, dislikes and background story. All have wonderfully quirky personalities (thanks to XSEEDs excellent localization and some fantastic voice acting), which makes pursuing residents an addictive past-time. After youve captured a persons heart, you can go on dates and attend festivals together, and even marry and start a family. Its fantastic fun. What isn't very fun is the responsibility of being royalty, which is all busywork and no pageantry or amusing abuses of power. You'd think issuing orders from on high would be a blast, but Rune Factory 4 refuses to let you use your accumulated Prince/Princess points (awarded for doing various tasks) for anything other than expanding the town to attract tourists or improving your personal property, making the whole sovereign thing a bit of a bore. Its true that you can at least assign farm work to your pets, but most of the time you'll be running around doing errands like a commoner instead of enjoying your royal prerogative to delegate these menial tasks to the lowly peasants beneath you. This makes the monarchy system feel like a wasted opportunity, which is a shame because given a little more imagination, it could have been something special. Some Rune Factory fans might not mind being a powerless figurehead, but they may be frustrated by some initial foot-dragging. The obligatory 10-hour tutorial is a real chore to get through, only somewhat helped by a Request Box full of tasks that pass the time until something interesting happens. And you'll be waiting a long time for something interesting to happen, since the story doesn't really get going until the second half of the campaign, and even then it falls a little flat. Luckily theres so much to do that the sluggish pacing and gauzy story can be forgiven. As previously mentioned, the fun doesnt stop and at just farming and fighting. You can walk to the nearest body of water and fish for food, make clothes, armor and weapons that will raise your stats in battle, and participate in goofy festivals like sheering a giant sheep or catching squid. You can even plant your very own dungeon and explore it (which yields rare items). Pros Fun gameplayLots to doGreat romance system Cons Bland storyWeak monarchy system With dozens of hours of gameplay (and the option of playing well after the story ends) Rune Factory 4 is definitely a good time. Just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means. You'll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else, but at least you can do so with a smile on your face.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2020,"}
