But its not worth flipping through page upon page of wretched jokes, schoolyard insults, and lame attempts at edginess in order to find said decent game. Drawn to Death is simply a mess that cant provide a single good reason to give it a deeper reading. Theres nothing inherently wrong with the concept of a game that springs to life from the pages of an angsty but creative teenagers notebook doodlings. Every time you launch Drawn to Death you get a view of this characters classroom, stodgy teacher droning on in front and cute girl glancing back and smiling, before he looks down at his notebook and the main menu appears. Drawn to Death just doesn't feel good to play.The overall aesthetic draws equally from Paper Mario, the 2009 Wii game MadWorld, and 90s skateboard decks, and surprisingly its Drawn to Deaths strongest feature. Menus, characters, levels, weapons, explosions, and everything else, resemble scribbles done in ballpoint pen  and while that sounds like it should be a disaster, it actually works on the screen. Characters somehow pop against backgrounds on maps that look like folded paper, and combat rarely gets too chaotic to follow (although that can also be partially attributed to the paltry limit of four players per match, which is arguably not a good trade-off). Its all downhill from there, though. Drawn to Death features a handful of intricate maps and creative modes, a half dozen deceptively complex characters, and a large variety of weapons that are admittedly fun to experiment with. Theres a shotgun, for example, that can sprout ax blades if you pull the trigger with precise timing, and a coffin that catapults corpses, which you reload by literally yanking a new one out of the dirt. Horribly unbalanced.That sounds great on paper, but Drawn to Death just doesnt feel good to play. You move sluggishly and float through the air like a sheet of paper drifting on a light breeze, and the time-to-kill  the average length of time it takes to kill an opponent  is absurdly long. Everyone has way too much health, and as a result almost every weapon feels as dinky as a paperclip slingshot. Theres not even splitscreen multiplayer, which a game with a four-player limit definitely should be able to support. Perhaps worst of all is the fact that theres no way to remap controls; jumping is mapped to X, and theres no way to switch to a bumper-jumper style. In a game that clearly wants you to spend more time floating and double-jumping through the air than on the ground, requiring you to take your thumb off the aiming stick to jump is unforgivable. Drawn to Death is also horribly unbalanced. There are a few weapons  like the Russian Jackhammer and the Star Laser 3000  that easily outperform everything else. Likewise with the character roster; each of the six avatars available at launch has a sizeable arsenal of unique moves, abilities, and special attacks, and some are just garbage compared with others. Alan, a seemingly pedophiliac teddy bear with a chainsaw, automatically regenerates health, turns invisible at will, and has powerful special attacks. Meanwhile, Johnny Savage, a guitar-wielding cockney punk, is basically useless because his unique abilities  a ground-slam and guitar attacks  require far too much precision to be reliable. That level of blatant disparity is a bad look for this type of game. A host of bugs and network problems certainly don't help.Each character has a set of pros and cons when facing others; one specific characters melee might do extra damage against another specific character, but one of their abilities might be negated by a different character. These match-ups come off as mostly arbitrary, something you have to memorize instead of being able to understand them intuitively. A comparable but better game, such as Overwatch, achieves the same thing organically and through common sense; The high-flying Pharah is strong against the close-range Symmetra not because of some numbers game but because Pharah is usually out of range of Symmetras gun. A host of bugs and network problems certainly dont help. In some matches opponents will wind up somehow floating out in the single-ruled lines of nothingness above the map, able to gleefully snipe you with no chance of reprisal. Other times foes simply wont take any damage from your weapons. Buttons often seem unresponsive, sometimes requiring multiple presses just to switch weapons. And the interface during matches could use some serious work, as its currently too hard to tell how much ammo you have left or when your abilities cooldowns are up. Sophomoric and crass.A lot of these issues, from balance to bugs, can be patched, and hopefully will be if Drawn to Death can attract a loyal audience  and one willing to spend money on its microtransactions to earn new character skins and taunts or unlock all the guns immediately (which I never felt the need to do). But its tone is so incredibly hostile  so needlessly mean-spirited  that many players will likely shut it down for good without getting much farther than the tutorial. Sends the same handful of taunts and insults your way multiple times per match.Drawn to Death isnt just sophomoric or crass  theres nothing wrong with some South Park-style shock humor. The real problem is the constant and unending barrage of discouraging abuse it hurls your way at every possible opportunity. Within the space it takes to complete the tutorial youll be fully aware of how ugly, stupid, unskilled, and utterly worthless its characters think you are  not to mention what a good French kisser your mom is  and Drawn to Death will never, ever let you forget it. You died, the cartoon frog mentor says if you die during the tutorial, and Im genuinely sad. Im not surprised, mind you, because I think youre stupid. But I am sad. Its as if developer The Bartlet Jones Supernatural Detective Agency has taken the kind of in-game chat awfulness that makes so many of us take off our headsets and mute everybody when playing online, and made it part of the game itself. It doesnt even mix things up, sending the same handful of taunts and insults your way multiple times every single match. You can head into the options menu to turn off the horrendous narrator voice that interjects several times per match with bizarre non-sequiturs that seem to channel creator David Jaffes own stream-of-consciousness rants about the video game industry. But theres no off switch for the scant handful of endlessly repeating lines of dialogue your characters hatefully spew dozens of times per match. All of this is really a massive shame. Despite all its flaws as a shooter theres some depth and rewarding complexity in Drawn to Death, if you take the time to read between the lines. Unfortunately, it cant help taking a dump on the page and shoving your face in it every time you try. With a look this distinctive, Drawn to Death could have hit the ground running. But as a decent shooter it merely limps, thanks to a number of unfortunate design choices, a lack of options, and rampant bugs. Intricate levels, varied weapons and unique characters may have looked good on paper, but any positives Drawn to Death has get scribbled over and obscured by the constant barrage of un-funny abuse it insists on endlessly spewing in your face.", "date": "April 8, 2017,"}
