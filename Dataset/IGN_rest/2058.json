You kind of have to be to carry a torch for Panzer Dragoon, a 25-year-old cult classic 3D shoot-em-up series where people ride dragons like fighter jets, dodging and weaving past giant creatures and shooting down airships. That context is important when looking at Panzer Dragoon: Remake, the new visually heightened version of the 1995 original with modernized control options and reimagined environments that bring the world to life in new ways. The shooting, flying, and the enemies you face remain mostly preserved, though, which means Panzer Dragoon: Remake feels like an experience rooted in 1995, including the limitations and old-school frustrations native to the time. Panzer Dragoons story is window dressing. You play as a man who, by chance, finds himself creating a psychic link with a blue dragon and chasing down another guy riding a black dragon. If you read a wiki or find some story related-materials from when Sega originally put out theres a lot of lore about the world and whats going on, but very little of it actually makes its way on screen. Its not really needed, though, because Panzer Dragoon is a 3D on-rails shooter campaign that lasts for less than two hours. You control the dragon, dodging and weaving around the screen to avoid projectiles, while shooting enemies with your laser, which has you fire rapidly or pressing and holding shoot to lock onto multiple targets. Both weapons are important: Lock-on shots make it easy to grab and take down a few targets at once, but you cant use it to shoot down enemy projectiles. Finding the rhythm of switching between offensive and defensive shooting creates a rapidly rising and falling tension as waves of enemies ebb and flow. The rhythm of switching between offensive and defensive shooting creates tension.Plus, while you automatically fly forward, you need to keep your head on a swivel  almost literally, because you have to manually turn the camera. You have a radar, which will let you know when enemies get within attack range as they approach from four directions, but they will get the drop on you if you arent vigilant. While very few enemies can do significant damage off a single blow it is very easy to get overwhelmed by multiple attackers if you miss a few shots or take too long clearing the screen. It can get a little frustrating, especially if, like me, your first instinct is to dodge an oncoming attack rather than shoot it. Missing a shot leads to taking a hit, but a wrong move can have larger consequences, especially when youre surrounded. Youll want to look around though, especially if you played the original Saturn version and want to appreciate the improvements. Panzer Dragoon: Remake completely reimagines all seven levels, building out the environments and adding lots and lots of additional detail. In the original 1995 version, the first level features scattered stone columns sticking out of otherwise undisturbed water to symbolize a flooded ruin. In Remake, the flooded ruin has been fully realized, with broken buildings jutting out of craggy rocks. Every crack and crevice of all seven levels has received similar treatment, expanding upon the environments the Saturn could produce to create a series of fully formed spaces. The action itself is all true to the original Panzer Dragoon.While the levels look much different, the action itself is all true to the original Panzer Dragoon. Key moments, like the building crashing down on you before the first boss are still here, and feel more like the impressive events they were probably supposed to be. If you have strong memories of specific points from the original Panzer Dragoon, I imagine itll be a kick to see them play out on the screen in a way you had to imagine in 1995. That said, I dont want to overstate things. Its really cool how much has changed and how those changes feel organic, but the art itself isnt especially impressive. The designs of the dragons and enemies are detailed and interesting but feel generic without enough story to anchor them. Also, while the gameplay remains unchanged for the most part, there is at least one new mechanical feature: a modern control scheme option. The original controls are still the default in Remake, but they sync moving and shooting on the left analog stick. With these controls, it can take a long time to push the dragon to a far corner of the screen, which can make it difficult to dodge attacks. The new control option separates aiming and shooting, which increases your mobility and may feel more like a modern game, I found that it didnt help my maneuverability as much as Id hoped when it comes to dodging incoming fire. Yes, I did say it's less than two hours long.But yes, I did say its less than two hours long. Closer to one, in fact. Thats because even though Panzer Dragoon was made for the Sega Saturn its built like an arcade game: you have two shots to fly and shoot your way through its seven levels. You can earn extra lives or credits at the end of each level, depending on your performance; specifically, your accuracy, how many enemies you shot down, and how many got away. Theres no mid-level checkpointing, but if you have a credit you can restart the level you died on. If you dont, its game over and youre back to the beginning. The campaign is short  I finished my first run on normal difficulty in about 70 minutes  but that doesnt take the sting out of getting to the last level and losing all your progress. Then again, once you do finish it, there isnt much more to do except replay it on hard mode, which is more taxing but not necessarily more satisfying. Without a leaderboard or any means of memorializing your best runs, theres little reason to go back more than once or twice. Panzer Dragoon: Remake is a cool window back to a neat little corner of video game history. With modernized graphics acting as rose-tinted glasses to make it more visually pleasing than the 1995 original, this is a neat little arcade shooter that keeps things exciting for an hour or two. Its just enough to make me wish that the developers had gone a little farther and built this remake up with more levels or, maybe, gambled on a fully modernized take on the originals simple concept.", "date": "April 1, 2020,"}
