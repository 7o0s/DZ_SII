This part covers the entirety of the campaign  be sure to check out the multiplayer and overall reviews soon. A Previously on Gears recap video kicks off Gears 5, and apart from the much-appreciated refresher, it quickly reminded me, Oh yeah, I love these characters. This time around JD, Kait, and Del continue to try and beat back the mutated-Locust Swarm, but this new adventure stands out thanks to some clever moment-to-moment gameplay upgrades and a heavy dose of character-driven story that puts the future of the franchise on an unexpected path. Gears 5s impressive campaign is conclusive evidence that, at least for now, its these meatheads, not Halos Spartan super soldiers, that star in the most endearing first-party stories on Xbox. Marcus Fenix, bless his curmudgeonly old heart, has now fully embraced his Papa Marcus role, and Im so glad hes along for the ride in Gears 5 as Kait tries to unravel the mystery of her past. Though this is unequivocally Kaits story, with actress Laura Bailey turning in a commanding performance in the lead role, its actually Marcus who gets the single best line of dialogue (youll know it when you hear it). Long may we be blessed with voice actor John DiMaggios growling rage. But Del, too, has a much bigger part to play this time around, and both developer The Coalition and actor Eugene Byrd do an outstanding job of bringing him to life. The actors performances are all vital to Gears 5, because this campaign is packed full of story. Youll have plenty of welcome controller-down time between the action to follow along with whats happening in this world of destroyed beauty. Gears 5 plumbs the depths of not only the lead characters themselves, but also the larger Gears universes history of war. We see them struggle to justify terrible acts in the face of even worse choices, and were forced to wonder if the ends really do justify the means. Gears 5's Jack of All Trades Gearss third-person action has evolved slowly but steadily from one entry to the next, and in Gears 5 the bulk of whats new flows through Jack, your handy floating robot companion. He can now snag weapons from the battlefield for you and unlock safes, among other actions, and youll earn new abilities for him to use in combat, such as flash-blinding your foes, reviving you and your allies when youre down, cloaking you, and more. Upgrade components are littered across the world, so you can decide to hyper-specialize in a few areas or have a little bit of every ability. I appreciated the extra tactical layers he offered, and while I did vary my selected Jack ability depending on the situation, I was particularly thankful for the healing power of Stim in the latter part of the campaign, which saved me from dying more than once. But Jack aside, boy oh boy does Gears combat still feel good. This may be the only series where Im always happy to have the default weapon  the trusty Lancer  in my loadout at all times, just in case I get a chance to chainsaw a bad guy in half. The Overkill shotgun returns from Gears of War 4 and packs a potent punch, while classics like the Sniper Rifle, Boomshot, and Mulcher are still around to satisfyingly chew your foes into little fleshy chunks. New weapons like the Claw manage to feel unique but fit right in, too; Gears 5 does a tremendous job of balancing the old toys with new ones. Also new is Gears 5s open structure of its middle two acts. Youll roam the area on your wind-powered Skiff, free to tackle optional secondary objectives that vary in duration and challenge. Usually your reward is Jack upgrades, so theyre very worth doing. This is a nice change of pace for Gears, just like it was for God of War last year -- whos to say whether that was by intention or coincidence, but the fact that the first of these sections is set in a frozen tundra only makes it harder to ignore the similarity). Multiple varied boss fights also help Gears 5 feel fresh throughout. Waiting for Kait Though Gears 5s campaign has plenty of meat on the bone, clocking in at around 10-12 hours, it ends somewhat abruptly. Perhaps thats because its the first mainline Gears that doesnt follow a linear five-act structure, but its mostly because it doesnt offer any gameplay resolution after answering Kaits questions about her past. No, thats saved for the jumping-off point for the inevitable Gears 6. I cant help but compare it to the end of Halo 2, though the cutoff is not nearly as egregious here. Meanwhile, the graphics of Gears 5 may no longer be a jaw-dropping showpiece unrivaled in the rest of gaming, but that doesnt mean it isnt pretty. For starters, the jump to 4K and 60fps for the campaign on Xbox One X feels really good, aside from a few minor hitches here and there. And the use of atmospheric lighting  both in the world and on our heroes armor  once again gives Gears a unique and gorgeous visual signature. Gears of War may have initially thrived because it refined and helped revive the third-person cover shooter, but it has survived for a much less obvious reason: it has heart. From Doms search for his wife Maria in the first two games to the breaking of a bond in Gears of War 3 to the passing of the torch to a new generation of Gears the last time out, this series matters because its characters make you care. Gears 5 is no different, and the consequences from your actions here  along with its welcome gameplay improvements  will affect both this and future games in a way Im eager to see.", "date": "Sept. 4, 2019,"}
