Capcoms horror doesn't frighten, but as an action-adventure its elevated by this occasional synergy, and the excellent bonus Raid mode. Revelations 2s four episodes dance between two timelines, each with its own pair of characters, to weave together a mystery that kept me hooked right up until its finale. In one, reliably endearing Claire Redfield and tude-filled Moira Burton - who I also liked, despite her tendency to swear for the sake of swearing - are two unlikely friends, thrust together by an evil overseer who is keeping them captive for reasons unknown. Resident Evil fan-favourite Barry Burton is back in the second timeline, joined by mysterious newcomer Natalia, a little girl whose memory harbors half-remembered secrets. Each episode manages to keep its cards close enough to its chest that I was compelled to play the next one  perhaps the only justification for Revelations 2s four-episode structure  and theres a humour in the characters that I found refreshing. Pairing off these characters does more than serve the story, though, as your companions are legitimately useful in ways that make gameplay more interesting. Moiras flashlight is used to blind enemies and find hidden objects for Claire, and Natalia can see enemy weakpoints and crawl through tiny spaces where Barry cant fit. Revelations 2 is at its best when it makes us use all these skills at once. Its most satisfying moments involve switching between characters on the fly - or shrieking instructions at your partner if playing in split-screen or online co-op - in order to make it through particularly tricky or dangerous areas. Both Natalia and Moira are physically underpowered, too, which can lend to a sense of hysteria. Theres a thrilling section in Episode 3, for example, where Moira and Claire must escape an enemy-filled building by working together against the clock. Moira cant defend herself against giant enemies, so youve either got to make a run for it or youve got to switch to Claire and pump bullets into them from afar. I would have liked to have seen more of this kind of co-op play across the board, but unfortunately Revelations 2s biggest sin is its boring corridor environments.Theres a significant lack of environmental detail here - unbreakable crates is as spicy as it generally gets - and its crumbling interiors are painted in far less than 50 shades of grey. Equally unimaginative enemies roam them. While there are a handful that stand out - Claire faces off against a deliciously gross monster at the end of episode 3, while the final boss will likely inspire fan-art - most enemies are generic shamblers or walking pustules with glowing red spots. In 2015, these monsters arent only played out - theyre simply not scary. Fortunately, traditional Resident Evil puzzles do eventually spice things up, after a conspicuous absence in the first few episodes. Episode 3 introduces some classic brain-benders, including one that involves Barry and Natalia working together to move a box from one end of a level to another. Its all nonsense, of course - the justification is that the giant box is an outdoor power source - but it incorporates some clever level design and provides a nice break from the running and gunning. Theres far more consistency outside the main campaign. The Raid minigame is a highlight, played either solo or co-op. Raid mode challenges you to clear out a huge number of shooting galleries under the recommended level without healing yourself, offering bragging rights and unlockable characters as a reward. At 130 medals down, Ive only scratched the surface, yet Im compelled to continue: Raid offers real longevity outside of the main campaign. Pros Pulpy mysteryOccasional co-op brillianceRaid mode Cons oring environmentsOverused enemies Resident Evil Revelations 2s pulpy story, occasionally brilliant co-op gameplay, and excellent Raid mode balances out its dull environments and overused enemies. While I would have liked Capcom to have aimed higher, this is a mostly enjoyable horror experience, albeit an unmemorable one.", "date": "March 20, 2015"}
