Thats hardly a surprise given its glasses-free stereoscopic 3D only offers an extremely narrow sweet spot of vision; shift your head too far or tilt your hands, and you go from immersive 3D depth to a drunkards double-vision. All that has changed with the New Nintendo 3DS. Over the past three years of gaming on the original 3DS, I rarely bothered to turn on the 3D functionality. In the past week that Ive spent with the New 3DS, Ive yet to turn it off. Keeping Your Head in the Game Thanks to the new head-tracking camera and infrared sensor found above the main screen of the new devices, the sweet spot for 3D has widened considerably to allow for ample head movement. This improvement is especially useful if you often game while on the go; the constant swaying and occasional jolt of my morning train commute has only very occasionally shattered the New 3DSs stereoscopic spell, and even then, the system quickly adjusts and snaps back into focus. Similarly, games that use the systems gyroscope for motion-based controls (such as the bow and arrow mechanic in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D) can now be enjoyed in a stabilised 3D mode, no matter how exaggerated your movements are. So superb is this revamped 3D mode that Ive revelled in replaying games that I originally completed either entirely in two dimensions or with only isolated uses of the 3D. Luigis Mansion: Dark Moon, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and Star Fox 64 3D are just a handful of games that Ive finally begun enjoying exactly as the developers intended them; these familiar experiences suddenly seem fresh. Of course, both versions of the New 3DS feature the same screen resolutions as their predecessors (albeit with slightly richer contrast), so if you were previously deterred from using 3D because it halves an already sub-HD pixel count, then your stance is unlikely to change with the updated systems. (Though, pixel counters and Nintendo fans are rarely one and the same.) Circle Pad Pros (and Cons) Beyond the substantially improved 3D capability, the New 3DS features a number of other hardware changes. Some of these are small yet logical tweaks: the volume slider now resides at the left of the top screen, making it easier to reach with your left index finger; the start and select buttons have been shifted to the bottom right to give your right thumb easier access; and the dedicated wi-fi switch has been nixed in favour of a software-based setting in the systems home menu. Elsewhere the cartridge port, power button and stylus slot have each been moved to the bottom edge of the system, and the headphone out shifted slightly to the middle. Of more importance is the addition of the ZR and ZL shoulder buttons and the C-stick, which replicate the Circle Pad Pro peripherals controls. This attachment for the original 3DS was a good idea in theory, but its jeans pocket-busting size and ugly, lopsided design left a lot to be desired. Did we mention it was ugly? By transplanting all of the ill-fated attachments inputs onto the New 3DS, Nintendos handheld now offers more control without any additional bulk. There have been some compromises made, though. While all of the back catalogue games that supported the Circle Pad Pro (like Kid Icarus Uprising and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate) automatically work with the extra shoulder buttons and C-stick, these added inputs dont all feel as good as they did before. While the ZR and ZL buttons are placed comfortably under your index fingertips and allow for a more sophisticated suite of controls, the C-stick itself feels like a slightly inferior replacement for the circle pad found on the original peripheral. Resembling a rubber trackpoint nub from a ThinkPad laptop, the C-stick is sensitive enough to provide deft Y-axis movements for camera controls and the like, but the more I used it, the more its rigid design and small surface area began to feel uncomfortable under my thumb. It simply doesnt offer the grip or the sliding movement radius of the circle pad. Ultimately the C-stick is great for simple inputs like charging your Smash Attack in Super Smash Bros, and good enough for the sporadic camera and aiming movement in third-person games like Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D, but Im less keen to play anything that demands a more constant use of the C-stick, such as a first-person shooter. (On the upside, Im sure Im not the only one hoping that these control additions pave the way for the Gamecubes back catalogue to finally arrive on the Virtual Console.) Now Youre Playing With Power The New 3DS enhancements arent all visible; Nintendo has also beefed up its new systems with additional processing power under the hood. (Although in typical Nintendo fashion, there arent any official specs to show the difference in raw numbers.) Xenoblade Chronicles, the first game to take advantage of this hardware upgrade, isnt set for release until some time in 2015, so its not currently possible to test how much of a boost this new chip will provide in terms of the systems graphical capabilities. What is evident already, however, is how much faster the New 3DS performs basic system operations. In a side-by-side comparison with the old 3DS, it fast becomes clear just how much speedier the new system is. Games start up substantially quicker: Super Smash Bros booted to its title screen in just 15 seconds on the New 3DS, greatly reduced from the 30 seconds on the old 3DS. Youll notice that reduction in loading time when accessing the eShop, too, though browsing the systems online store still lags behind the shopping experience on your average smartphone. Face Off Speaking of side-by-side comparisons -- the New 3DS once again comes in both standard and XL editions. As with the previous versions of each system, the choice between them largely comes down to personal preference; the New 3DS favors portability, while paying a little extra for the larger screens of the New 3DS XL also means added bulk. The decision may be tougher for some this time around, however, due to the support of customisable faceplates on the smaller system, and their absence from the larger. The front plates lever off using the stylus, the rear ones require a screwdriver. Why Nintendo decided to give one version of its handheld a customisable aesthetic and not the other is unclear. This could just be a matter of giving the smaller New 3DS its own unique feature to balance out that of the 3DS XLs larger screens, but speaking as a devoted 3DS XL owner, I have to admit to feeling envious of the added personality afforded to the standard system. With 20 different faceplates available as of the systems Australian launch, itd certainly be nice to have the option of applying one of those sets to a New 3DS XL purchase. (The wooden Super Mario faceplate set is particularly striking, even if it does come at more than double the sticker price of the more basic covers.) Its possible, though, Ill have little to worry about in the future; though I assume faceplates will take off with younger gamers in particular, these accessories could just as easily end up in the bargain bin faster than you can say Limited Edition Perfect Dark Zero Xbox 360 faceplate. Extra Charge The New 3DS is pretty light on as far as supplied accessories go--neither version comes bundled with an AC adapter or USB cable for charging. This might not be a huge deal if youre upgrading from an older 3DS, since the charging port is the same and you can use your existing cable. (Incidentally, if youre wondering, actual battery life and charging times for each system is comparable to that of their respective predecessors.) If this is your only Nintendo 3DS, though, youre going to have to fork out extra cash for these necessary accessories. Similarly, the switch from standard SD cards to Micro SD cards for system memory means any existing memory cards you have will no longer be compatible. Pros 3D mode is excellentMore power under the hoodMore sophisticated controls Cons C-stick feels inferior to the circle padNo customisable faceplates for the XL While 2013s 2DS may have seemed like Nintendos admission that glasses-free 3D was a mere fad, the New 3DS sees stereoscopic vision regain its focus. Playing games in 3D is now finally the optimal way to experience Nintendos handheld, as it always should have been. Even despite the minor gripes I have about the C-stick, the additional controls and increased processing power set the system up nicely for the future, and if youre late to the 3DS party, youve got a back catalogue that features not just some of the best handheld games in recent years, but some of the best games full stop. For traditional gaming on the go, the New 3DS really cant be beat.", "date": "Feb. 13, 2015,"}
