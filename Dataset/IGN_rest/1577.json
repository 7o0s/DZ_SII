Where Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest enjoy a following as devoted outside of their home country as they do within, Tales fanaticism is much rarer in America, and rarer still in Europe. (Except, inexplicably, in France, where it's super popular.) Tales of the Abyss was first released on the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in North America, and never made it any further abroad than that. If you're in Europe, where the game is already out, this 3DS remake of Tales of the Abyss is quite probably the first chance you'll have had to play it. That instantly makes it a lot more interesting for you. Thing is, though, it's six years old, and subscribes to most (if not all) of the irritating conventions that could make Japanese RPGs of the last decade feel like hard work. Don't come to Tales of the Abyss expecting a remake: the reality is much closer to a port. The story follows red-haired, teenaged, aristocratic, amnesiac Luke Fon Fabre on his journey from total obnoxious jerk to slightly less of an obnoxious jerk, helped along the way by a cast of considerably more likeable supporting characters. It's very heavy on the fantasy jargon, which you have to be prepared to either ignore or swallow if you want to enjoy the story for what it is. It's fast-paced for its genre, with a lively flow of new party members and locations that helps to keep your interest even when the characters are rabbiting on about seventh fonon resonance and the civil tensions between Kimlasca-Lanvaldear and Malkuth. Decent gameplay, but nothing exceptional. The majority of the vast amount of dialogue is competently voiced by an American cast, which is very impressive on a handheld, and nothing has had to be cut from the PS2 version to fit it on that tiny cart. Less impressive is the 3D implementation; this wasn't a game designed for depth of field, and the character models and cartoonish cel-shaded art style really don't suit it. After the first few experimental hours I ended up playing entirely in 2D to save myself wincing at the game's attempts at 3D presentation. Tales of the Abyss was forward-thinking for its time, which helps it feel reasonably fresh today. The combat system, particularly, stands up well  it's a real-time, action-heavy system from a side-on perspective. You have an attack, a block and a skill button, and you can modify your actions by pulling the analogue in different directions when you hit A, B or Y. Both active and passive skills open up gradually as you gain battle experience  you'll suddenly be able to dodge, for instance, or use different airborne attacks. The way that characters' abilities develop and unlock is controlled by the Capacity Core that you equip them with  give them a strength-focussed Capacity Core, for instance, and battle skills will level up quicker. The AI is generally really good in battle. Your allies know when you heal you, when to stay out of the way and when to attack, and you can modify their behaviour in the character menu. Don't expect the game to actually explain any of this by itself, though. You have to do a lot of digging around in menus to discover that you've even acquired some new skills, let alone figure out what they actually do. This is the game's main weakness: it expects you to be interested enough to find everything out on your own, and though it's nice not to be spoon-fed, some direction would be helpful. Luke and company. It's also nice that Tales of the Abyss doesn't bombard you with incidental story detail and long, long cutscenes too often, hiding most of its background details in optional skits  animated conversations between main characters that crop up every five or ten minutes. A prompt in the bottom left of the screen lets you know when one of these is available, and if you don't want to spend two minutes watching it, you don't have to. If you like the detail, though, it's disappointing to find that these scenes still aren't voiced. After getting used to hearing characters talk, it's jarring to suddenly be thrown into a silent movie. Alongside those forward-thinking elements, though, Tales of the Abyss subscribes to a lot of the less well-loved aspects of the genre. For instance, although the story has enough happening to keep you interested once it gets into its stride, there are things about it that are both cliched and annoying, including a squeaky-voiced cute animal-thing that talks at a pitch that's probably high enough to confuse dogs. The main character, Luke, is also unbearable at the beginning, and although he does improve, it's the most basic and unambitious kind of character development. Lastly, it's too long, a fault that's endemic in this series - the story starts to falter long before its conclusion, although in such a long game (45+ hours) that's almost inevitable. Its saving grace is the art style and world design, which both live up to the series' high artistic and animation standards. Unfortunately, Tales of the Abyss serves as a reminder that the Japanese RPG has been stuck in a creative rut for a long time now  the fact that it doesn't feel all that different from many modern examples of the genre is actually a bit depressing. Having fallen in love with games like Xenoblade Chronicles and Dragon Quest IX in the past few years, it's difficult to return to this complex world of menus and jargon without a bit of reluctance. CLOSING COMMENTS Its impressive that Namco-Bandai has managed to port a full-sized, voice-acted Japanese RPG to the 3DS without sacrificing any of the content from the PlayStation 2 version. But its also a six-year-old game that hasnt aged well in all respects, and if youre a North American Tales fan, its likely to be one youve played before. Like all the Tales games, this is a charmer, but it probably wont be long before its outdone by a game thats actually been made for the platform. IGN RATINGS FOR TALES OF THE ABYSS Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 Presentation The art style hasnt aged, and its still a very pleasant world to look at  but the 3D implementation is downright bad. 7.5 Graphics Its impressive that it doesnt look notably worse than it did on the PS2, but again, it wasnt made for 3D. 8.0 Sound Its mostly voiced, and the cast does a good job. The music, meanwhile, is up to the standard youd expect. 7.0 Gameplay A great battle system means that the game still feels fresh, if unexceptional. 7.0 Lasting Appeal Its a long adventure that will give you a good 45 hours or so if you get into it, but the story may fail to capture your imagination. 7.0 OVERALL Good (out of 10) Its impressive that Namco-Bandai has managed to port a full-sized, voice-acted Japanese RPG to the 3DS without sacrificing any of the content from the PlayStation 2 version. But its also a six-year-old game that hasnt aged well in all respects, and if youre a North American Tales fan, its likely to be one youve played before.
