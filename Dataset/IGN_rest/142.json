Its serious, sensible, structured, and  unlike Sonys previous first-party racing game, DriveClub  its been reliable since launch. Its also supremely good-looking, well-presented, and handles great. However, the hard pivot to an online-focused racing sim has seen it lose a slab of its single-player mode, it lacks meaningful weather effects, and its garage and track selection is startlingly stingy next to the competition. That PvP online environment, or Sport Mode as its dubbed, is where developer Polyphony Digital has gambled all its chips. The good news is that it has indeed created a sturdy online racing venue. Sport Mode is spread across a trio of rotating daily races  its generally one every 20 minutes, rotating hourly  as well as scheduled championships (though those are yet to begin, with the first one scheduled for November 3). In terms of the daily events, all you need to do is sign up for the race, spend the remaining time qualifying, and GT Sport will seed you into an event against a full grid of human opponents. Its simple stuff, but the scheduled nature of it has meant Im almost always racing in full lobbies against 20+ other people. When the event is on a suitable track Ive had some decent, fair races so far, only occasionally marred by lapped players trying to cannon into me like pissed-off Sebastian Vettels. Thats an issue GT Sport attempts to solve with its Sportsmanship Rating  which is listed beside your PSN ID for all racers to see  and should eventually see me placed out of reach of these dangerous hooligan players. More or less a direct lift of iRacings safety rating, GT Sports Sportsmanship Rating rewards clean sectors, fair overtakes, and respectful racing. Crash into others and it will sink. All this happens on-screen in real-time so theres a very obvious and instant punishment for messing up and making contact. The system is less than perfect  both drivers in a collision are penalised regardless of who is at fault, for instance  but my rating is still improving after every race overall. Well, except for any events on the tiny, chaotic Northern Isle Speedway; its a (very) short oval that has turned into an absolute melee every time Ive tried it, despite the best efforts of everyone involved. It can be lapped in around 13 seconds in a GT3 car, and starting at the front of the grid Ive found myself lapping backmarkers after the first lap. Its just a mess of spinning, crashing, ghosted cars. Its been hell on my Sportsmanship Rating because its impossible not to have multiple people hit you on such a tiny course. Arcade Mode is the only part of GT Sport that works offline.All of that requires an internet connection; if you dont want to or cant race online, Arcade Mode is all thats left. This is where the impressive PlayStation VR functionality sits too  its limited to one-on-one battles against the AI, but with a wheel, its a terrific entry-level advertisement for just how immersive VR can be. Importantly, the view is very stable and far superior to DriveClub VR, which simulated head tilting and seemed determined to summon up a breakfast barf. Track resolution takes a walloping at distance, but close up things look very nice. I particularly like how the HUD is holographically integrated into the cabin, and little touches like how my in-game driver would slightly drop a shoulder to cater for me leaning to one side in real life didnt go unnoticed. To reiterate, Arcade Mode is the only part of GT Sport that works offline  you cant do driving tests, buy cars, take pictures in the eye-catching photo mode, or even save progress unless youre connected to the PSN. If you cant connect regularly, you probably shouldnt be even considering GT Sport. GT Sport has just a quarter of the tracks of its two big rivals this year.But if youre happy to commit to remaining online, my advice is to try Sport mode. Im absolutely not an esports guy and Ive warmed to it nonetheless. I think what Im enjoying most about the online racing is the anticipation and excitement that comes from committing myself to a scheduled block of organised qualifying and racing. But, other than cultivating my Sportsmanship Rating and Driver Rating (a second metric tracking your speed and success, basically), I do wonder if theres enough content in Sport Mode to give it stamina. Right now, its just a trio of random races set to rotate through a handful of car classes and a pretty narrow buffet of circuits, although they havent changed for a number of days. I dont know that Ill want to race the same track several times a day for several days in a row. The lack of content is a real drag. With only 17 total locations and 40 tracks (including reverse tracks), GT Sport has just a quarter of the tracks of its two big rivals this year, which means dj vu set in pretty fast. Sadly, there are only six real-world tracks in GT Sport (although Polyphony has spread them out across the globe, so North America, South America, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Australia are each represented with one track each). These real-world tracks (Willow Springs, Interlagos, Nrburgring, Brands Hatch, Suzuka, and Bathurst) are the best in GT Sports catalog. With no dynamic weather or lighting they dont feel alive in the same way as the tracks do in F1 2016, Project CARS 2, or even Forza Motorsport 7  particularly the way the tracks in those three racers become saturated and dry up  but they do boast small, quaint touches like properly animated flag marshals. And the pre-baked time-of-day options look good, too. The remaining 11 fictional locations vary significantly in quality. Dragon Trail has some fun sections and an amazing backdrop; it feels unrealistically wide at times but the extra space helps facilitate slightly cleaner racing. The Tokyo freeway track is at the other end of the spectrum; it looks truly convincing as a stretch of real public road, but its super narrow and not particularly conducive to clean racing. Its strange Polyphony didnt tap into its past and resurrect series staples like Grand Valley, or Autumn Ring, or Seattle. Three rally tracks are included (six if you count the reverse layouts), but they feel like relics compared to the much better off road and rallycross experiences in Dirt 4 and Project CARS 2. Here in GT Sport its still a bit like driving on ice; like Im skating across the surface. The car list is disappointing, too, especially as the 160-car figure becomes much less impressive under scrutiny. Most of the 33 represented manufacturers have a single model included two to five times, each pre-prepared for several of GT Sports racing classes. Sure, theyre technically different cars  with their own aero parts and performance characteristics  but they certainly dont do much for variety. The worst offenders are the pretend road-legal homologated versions of GT Sports race cars. The car list is disappointing, too, especially as the 160-car figure becomes much less impressive under scrutiny.Then there are the Vision GT fantasy models  there are about 30 of those  which, to me, often feel like the automotive equivalent of those weird couture fashion shows where all the models are wearing bath mats, bin bags, and bits of fruit and straw: Too over the top. I know a lot of people like this sort of wild and futuristic stuff, but personally Ive got no attachment to these things, especially in lieu of real racing cars. They look completely incongruous pitted against normal, modern LMP1 cars, too. Their presence only serves to highlight big holes in the lineup. I mean, wheres the retro stuff? The vintage open-wheelers or classic prototypes? Group A, Group C, Group 5, or GT1? GT Sports main competitors this year have all these classes, and more. Hell, its own intro movie is dedicated to gazing back at these past icons and yet, with one exception, the oldest car in GT Sport is from 2009. That exception is a lone 1987 Quattro, which sticks out like a polar bear at a penguin bar mitzvah as the single retro ride in the whole collection. The retort here is usually something about quality over quantity but, even though the level of detail in GT Sports vehicles is astonishing, its not as if the cars the competition is producing are sketched in crayon. Polyphony has added a good livery editor to create authentic-looking race cars, but the traditional part-replacement system has been ditched for a more superficial upgrade bar. This feels like a particularly strange shift for GT to make after 20 years but, considering online racing is the key focus here and Sport Mode applies Balance of Performance to all cars participating anyway, the old upgrade system would have been largely undermined. Still, I suspect its going to be hard for some people to reconcile these sorts of changes with GT Sports more idiosyncratic indulgences. Like, we couldnt get a single returning original GT track, but we did get a special showroom for a watch manufacturer. Yes, it harms no-one, and I know TAG has a firm association with motor racing, but its a weird thing to prioritise when, say, player flag icons are still determined by the nationality of ones PSN account and not ones actual nationality. Same goes for the oddball slideshow that allows us to sync up key moments in car culture with a real scattergun spray of world events, like the election of Stalin and the release of Bjrks first solo album. In many ways, GT Sport is the most polished Gran Turismo game in over a decade. It looks great, feels great, and whats here has been carefully and well executed. However, while I can forgive the sprinkling of eccentric nonsense, the lack of car and track content really hurts, and the online-only nature of the vast majority of it is worrying. Overall it just isnt as complete as its key competitors.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2017,"}
