No Mans Sky, by contrast, is a huge collection of parts that cant find that harmony. To its credit, a few work brilliantly - specifically the unheard of scale and scope of its procedurally generated sci-fi universe and often striking interplanetary exploration. But too many other systems are badly designed and repetitive, from its basic and dull combat to its toothless survival systems, and from its unwieldy interface to its lifeless alien races. No Mans Sky reached for the stars, but its reach exceeded its grasp by light years. The vague, barely-there story starts each of us on a random planet (one of a claimed 18 quintillion) with a broken spaceship and the sci-fi equivalent of Minecrafts pickaxe: a laser beam that slowly vacuums up a planets resources for you to feed into typical, simplistic crafting recipes. At first, I was struck by the impressive world around me, which in this particular case was lush with colorful plant and animal life straight out of a Dr. Seuss book and rolling purple hills dotted with pillars of minerals. I named it Stapletons Landing and uploaded it to the server  though Ill probably never see it again, another player might one day stumble across it and wonder who I was. (Thats the extent of No Mans Skys multiplayer interaction in every reported test to date  even people who have gone to the same place at the same time havent been able to see each other.) Other worlds Ive visited since have run the gamut between similarly exotic and as barren and desolate as Mars or the moon, with interesting features ranging from labyrinthine caves to impossibly floating islands and otherworldly rock formations. Landing on a new planet is usually an impressive high point, because visual variety is No Mans Skys strong suit. However, when you start moving around some of that beauty is lost. Because the draw distance for high-detail models is so short youll constantly see objects phase in and out with a distracting dithering effect, and the frame rate frequently dips below the 30 it shoots for. Especially when flying fast and low over a planet  as you do frequently when hunting for rare resources  the pop-in is tough to look past. So are the crashes, of which Ive experienced about a half dozen so far. But then you get in your ship and fly straight up off the surface and clear the atmosphere of a planet directly into space, then zip over to a neighboring world and land on its surface without any loading, and its hard not to be impressed. Thats an experience Ive always wanted in games, and No Mans Sky pulls it off. Its a great moment of glory, and one thats badly needed as virtually everything between those moments is a repetitive, frustrating, and confusing slog. While the tutorial is sufficient to get you up and running with your handy jetpack, basic crafting skills, and a working spaceship capable of interstellar jumps toward the goal of reaching the center of the galaxy, theres a huge amount of important information it never introduces you to. Things as fundamental as how to switch your multitool from mining mode to combat mode and back to more nuanced things like how ship upgrades depend heavily on placement to function best arent addressed at all. In general, No Mans Sky does a poor job of teaching you how to play, so you should expect to lean heavily on external guides if you dont want to waste time figuring out its opaque systems for yourself. Most of the moment-to-moment gameplay in No Mans Sky is a typical and dull resource-harvesting grind, running from pile to pile and hoovering up minerals and elements like iron, nickel, and plutonium. Theres nothing inherently wrong with resource harvesting, mind you - many great games are built on top of it. The issue here is that No Mans Sky doesnt do anything interesting with that foundation to distinguish it from the last game in which you harvested resources and combined them into other things, and so its unremarkable. As always in this genre theres a compulsive collectors urge that drives me to spend time meticulously gathering stuff, but its still a chore; and the way tiny bits of material defy gravity and hang in the air after youve destroyed the parts that were holding it up instead of falling into an easily targetable pile make trying to get all of it an annoying chore. In a game with so much inventory management, the experience of actually managing it is important to get right  and No Mans Sky botches it with a clumsy cursor-driven interface. Using the thumbsticks to navigate your cursor over the grids of your three different inventory screens (for your suit, your ship, and your multitool) just feels like the wrong tool for the job, especially since it doesnt snap into position and can often land right in the middle of two options. Bafflingly, the cursor is even used to select between two dialogue options; if I were challenged to come up with a more frustrating and less efficient way of choosing between two options with a gamepad thumbstick, I would be hard-pressed to make a worse one. Speaking of poor control, the galactic map where you choose which solar system to visit next is also a pain point. Getting the hang of selecting the star I wanted to go to took some effort, and even after dozens of jumps it doesnt always move in the direction Im expecting. But, since theres almost never any indication of what a given star system will contain before you get there, it doesnt really make a huge difference which one you go to. The choice is completely uninformed, and therefore meaningless. Mining and exploring is sometimes interrupted by combat when the temperamental Sentinel drones that apparently guard everything in the universe with varying degrees of zeal decide youve crossed their arbitrary lines. That combat experience is pretty miserable; most of the targets youre shooting at are small floating drones, so No Mans Skys aggressive auto-aim means you only have to get the crosshairs on them for a second, then just point in their general direction to finish them off. Its as bland as can be. The craftable modifiers you can attach to your weapon to change it from a submachine gun-style attack to a shotgun or burst rifle are more hindrance than help, since those modes break auto-aim frequently and force you to retarget these small flying things to establish it again. For some reason you can also make bolts reflect off of objects, which seems exceptionally useless because theres no way youre ever going to hit something with a reflected shot in an outdoor environment. Im sure there are more upgrades out there, but Ill be surprised if any of them can make this basic, uninteresting shooting feel fun. 12", "date": "Aug. 14, 2016,"}
