But because Microsoft changed their entire voice chat protocol for the new Xbox as well as the type of headset port on the controller, Astro Gaming's had to make a special version of their most well-known cans. At first glance, the A40 + MixAmp M80 headset appears to be an elegant variant of the much beloved A40 line. The headset is the same comfortable, lightweight, well-constructed, nicely padded unit that Astro has offered for years (if it aint broke, dont fix it!). The integrated microphone arm easily flips up and out of the way when you dont need it (or detaches altogether). And the mini M80 MixAmpa device that's a fraction of the size of the standard A40 MixAmpis as plug-and-play as it gets. Just snap it into the controllers only port and youre all set. The M80 MixAmp is also extremely easy and intuitive to use, with a large volume knob, mute button, equalizer, and voice/game sound balance buttons right within thumbs reach. But sadly, the experience of using the A40+MixAmp M80 begins to go south as soon as you turn on your Xbox One. Most notably, the Xbox One A40s suffer from short, intermittent audio dropouts. Theyre extremely brief (one second or less), but theyre eminently noticeable and decidedly annoying. After experimentation (read: jiggling the wire a lot), the issue seems to lie with the ribbon-thin, cheap-feeling audio cable that connects the A40 to the M80. Its a fixed wire, so theres no swapping it out for a heavier-duty one. And no matter how still I tried to sit, I couldnt avoid the sound-dropping problem. For what it's worth, the firmware for the controller and headset I used are the latest versions, and I also tried two different headsetsbut the issue cropped up in those units, too. Furthermore, while theres nothing explicitly wrong with the audio quality otherwisethe stereo is crisp and cleanit lacks the deep bass and rich surround-sound audio of the standard A40s, which Ive used for years. It turns out that the Xbox One A40s arent Dolby Headphone capable. This is a stereo headset, transmitting sound wirelessly to the M80 via the gamepad. Laudably, though, this set sports crystal clear chat audio on both ends, making multiplayer strategy sessions sound great. To be fair, nothing on the box claims the A40 + M80 is Dolby-capable, and it is $50 cheaper than the PS4/PS3/Xbox 360 A40 models (which are Dolby headsets)but because this unit carries the A40 name, it creates a reasonable expectation for those familiar with Astro Gaming's products that youre getting a Dolby set. Perhaps a different model number designation wouldve helped. Pros ComfortablePlug-and-play setup Cons Intermittent audio dropsA40 name but no surround soundSteep price tag Ultimately, when considering the issues with game audio transmission and its $200 price tag, the A40 + M80 ends up being woefully disappointing. Its price tag seems steep for stereo headphones, particularly due to the unavoidable sound drops that appear to be tied to an underperforming, unreplaceable connector cable between the M80 and the A40. Id be more than willing to pay another $50 or so for a proper Dolby-dealin, designed-for-Xbox-One A40 with more reliable audio quality, but as it stands, I cannot in good faith recommend this particular headset. Instead, you're better off using a pair of standard A40s with Microsofts chat adapter.", "date": "April 27, 2015"}
