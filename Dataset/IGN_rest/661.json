Everything from Prince of Persia to Duke Nukem to Commander Keen were executed swiftly from a C: prompt. Those pixelated graphics were a joy to see, and I grew to truly appreciate and value gameplay over graphics. Among those great games I remember enjoying my first ever point-and-click adventure in the form of Lucasarts Day of the Tentacle. The game unlocked a hidden passion for other games in the genre, so I quickly moved on to play Grim Fandango, Sam & Max, Full Throttle, Monkey Island, and many more. Theres something entertaining about point and click adventures, and my only recent foray back into this genre was with Tim Schafers Broken Age. Which is probably why I have a soft spot for Read Only Memories, a brave new title from developer MidBoss. The games pixelated aesthetic is instantly charming, but pretty pixels arent the only thing you need to love about this game. It first appeared on Kickstarter last year, raising a total of $64,378 in funding before moving on to the games development. Set in Neo-San Francisco in the year 2064, the world has come to rely on the use of ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Manager), intelligent robots that help us in our daily routines. You play as a journalist going about your rather average life when one night your apartment is broken into by a small robot named Turing. Turing has come to you as their creator Hayden, who is a close friend of yours, has gone missing. While your initial reaction to Turing is one of surprise and suspicion, as the game progresses you learn more about their character and why they chose you to help them (according to Turing, statistically you were the most likely to be willing to help out). What makes Turing different however, is that hes the worlds first sapient machine, something that Hayden was working on religiously before he disappeared. In addition to ROMs being part of everyday life, technology has also made huge advancements, allowing human beings to augment various aspects of their body with tech. These hybrids are a common scene in society, however their appearance is not always welcomed by other humans, and protests between both groups are a common sight in the city. Your journey through Neo-SF will introduce you to a variety of interesting characters, all of which have their own agendas and may sometimes choose not to help you unless they get something in return. Some characters are friends of Hayden as well, and are more than willing to help out. Others are a lot tougher to crack and will need plenty of delicate negotiation before they trust you. Whats impressive about all of the characters is that they truly are different from each other  theres no carbon-copy NPC template being used here; each character has their own unique script and interactions, and some of your conversations can become incredibly amusing. Navigating through the game is quite easy  you hop around to various areas of Neo-SF using a handy map of the city, and once you reach your destination youre presented with a specific scene with characters or objects to interact with. Certain scenes can be panned around to explore other areas, and generally its a good idea to go poking around everywhere you can for clues and hidden objects. You can look, touch, speak, or use an inventory item with anything that is interactive, and actions that cant be performed are often met with unique (and hilarious) lines of text. And trust me, youre going to want to interact with EVERYTHING you come across, just to see what happens. The journey to find Hayden is occasionally peppered with mini-puzzles, which helps to add a bit of variety to the gameplay. Whether its trying to track down rogue teenagers by changing the traffic lights, hacking into a terminal with a cryptic code, or helping a back-alley rapper with his lyrical choices, these occasional puzzles are certainly a welcome break from the plenty of reading youre going to have to be doing on-screen since theres no spoken dialogue. But despite the lack of spoken dialogue during gameplay, it still manages to captivate you with its strong writing and storyline. While I initially considered Read Only Memories to be a light-hearted point-and-click game, it soon unravels subplots of murder, friendship, and betrayal. Visually the games presentation has plenty of bold colors throughout, and while the text can occasionally be a bit difficult to read as its also presented in the same visual style, theres plenty to look at and explore in each scene. The fantastic electronic soundtrack also ties excellently into the game, so overall its a fluid presentation of a very digitized future. Read Only Memories includes a varied roster of characters, but what I found the most interesting was how the game subtly introduces (and even educates) players on the use of pronouns when addressing several characters in the game. In fact, youre asked by the game to input your own name and your preferred pronoun, by which you will be addressed throughout the game. In my entire gaming history I have always been asked for things like name, gender, and class  but never for which pronoun I prefer. Your little robotic sidekick Turing finds gender a fascinating subject, since their gender isnt something they have spent a lot of time thinking about, and this is something you end up discussing for a while later on in the game. In fact, its questions and thoughts like these that makes Turing stand out in the game. Of course, theyre with you pretty much wherever you go, but Turings search for their creator is akin to a child searching for their parent, and its a quest that you want to solve as quickly as possible. As the game unfolds across all six chapters, youll notice a gradual change in Turings personality, and after certain events unfold in the game, youll see Turning express a range of emotions that make them almosthuman. Pros Great dialogueFantastic art styleInteresting storyline Cons Text size font should be improved slightly Read Only Memories is a fun little game to play, and the combination of interesting characters, storyline, dialogue, and a robot sidekick that just wont quit, will make you wish this game went beyond just six chapters. The game is currently available on PC and Mac, but I would love for it to hit iOS as this would be a great game to play comfortably on your iPad.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2015,"}
