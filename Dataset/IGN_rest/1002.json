He's the lone goblin in a world crawling with crooked humans and elves that look like sleepy cousins of Avatar's na'vi, and his small stature means the big guys can usually take him out with a single punch. Styx: Master of Shadows itself isn't much different. It's the kind of game whose very existence might go unnoticed by those who only follow the heavyweights, but the power of some of its features could surprise those who judge it by its all-too-visible flaws. It's a rare stealth game that takes its label seriously, and it's worth seeking out if you're weary of today's assassins with a fondness for open street brawls. Developer Cyanide knows the strength of its main character well; we first saw him back in 2012's flawed but ambitious Of Orcs and Men, where he shared the stage with an anger-prone advocate of orcish civil rights. It doesn't hurt that Styx is a likable sort; his predilection for well-timed F-bombs and exemplary voice work allow him to carry weak scenes that might have tripped up the whole story in less-capable hands. He finds human friends as he scrambles through the pleasingly vertical levels of the Tower of Akenash - an elaborate structure surrounding a world tree that's being harvested for its sap - but they mainly exist as foils to better showcase his wit and snark. The graphics aren't advanced, and most of the time our garrulous goblin tiptoes through textures that look as though they took a wrong turn half a decade ago. But Master of Shadows uses the dark Fable-style art to good effect in most settings, and the low demands means it's generally possible to maintain high framerates at the best settings even on weaker PCs. Styx clings to its stealth focus as tightly as an assassin wears his mask - one slip, and the whole gig threatens to dissolve into chaos. That's a good thing. Styx is at his best when he's focused on the business of not being seen; when he's hiding in bins and slinking through suspiciously goblin-sized ducts dotting the six stages ahead of him. He's in his element among the shadows crowding the bleak prisons and sewers of the tower, and Master of Shadows wisely encourages interacting with the environment to cup out candle flames or using well-placed spitballs crafted from sand to extinguish them from afar. All the while, he sneaks behind the guards and researchers populating the sprawling complex, either muffle-killing them so as not to arouse suspicion or driving his dagger through them in hastier (and noisier) moments. That's enough to make Styx a stealth game worth noticing, and it works so well that the option to vomit out a clone to distract guards and flip distant switches usually feels like an unnecessary contrivance. Far more worrisome are the controls and edge detection, which turn what should be the simple act of dropping down to hold onto a ledge into a labor worthy of Hercules. Sometimes Styx will simply jump down, usually into plain sight of guards who leap at the chance to test the sharpness of their blades. At other times, he finds that ledges he jumps toward can't be grabbed at all, thus negating 15 minutes' worth of careful sneaking. I learned in time to live with such issues, partly because the enormous levels mean that there's almost always another route to an objective, and much of the joy of playing lies in this exploration and picking up the collectible coins scattered about. But our little green friend never fully deviates from this same pattern across roughly 15 hours of play, and thus the dull pangs of repetition inevitably crept in once I became accustomed to Styx's rhythms. Cyanide generally manages to keep it at bay through the challenges of its attentions to realism, such as the tendency of shadows to merely conceal rather than render Styx fully invisible. (In this, it distinguishes itself as more hardcore than 1998's Thief.) Everywhere Styx piles on tension with its acceptable AI soldiers, who patrol a tad too predictably but grow nail-bitingly suspicious of the goblin's pitter-patter across stone floors and Styx's tendency to bump into chairs and brooms. Styx eventually unlocks abilities that let him, say, more more quietly or perform aerial assaults, but they never quite manage to outweigh the core game of sneaking and strangling. The approach works so well because our goblin is alone in a world where humans appear to be the size of cave trolls, and getting caught almost always means death. (On the hardcore Goblin mode, its one hit and splat - Styx goes down to cross the river for which he's named.) It's a smart design that lends meaning to the need for stealth, as do the infrequent checkpoints that force you to get your thief on right the first time. (Thankfully, the option to save at any point eases some of the pain for those unwilling to endure such trials all over again.) But getting caught is the least of Styx's troubles; far more dangerous is the quick-time event he's locked into when an enemy finds him and prepares to skewer him. To event itself isn't so bad, as you simply press a button on the gamepad or keyboard to parry strikes at the right time before triggering an option to kill. The problem is that surrounding enemies can continue to slice at Styx and throw knives at him while he's stuck in the combat animation. Inevitably, he dies. I get that Styx isn't supposed to get caught in the first place, but such an inescapable trap feels cheap and forced. It's a credit to the work that Cyanide has done here that those duels never fully ruin the experience. You'll need them. This is a game that's all about seizing the right opportunity at the right moment, leaving little room for effort, and it satisfies an itch for hardcore stealth that goes all too often unscratched these days. Pros Brutal, tense stealthMassive levels Cons Poor edge detectionAnnoying quicktime combatWeak graphics Styx may stumble in its quicktime combat and its spotty edge detection, but it makes up for most of its flaws with challenging stealth action across massives levels. It's not a pretty game by the standards of the current generation, but its presentation thrives on the snark and sailor-speak of its memorable title character. At $30, it's a steal even Styx himself could appreciate.", "date": "Oct. 15, 2014,"}
