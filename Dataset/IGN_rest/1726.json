Part 1 premiered on Feb 9, 2023, and Part 2 will arrive on March 9, 2023.I am always giddy whenever theres a new season of Netflixs You. Its an unhinged, unpredictable, very unserious show that has me sadistically curious to see just how much more delusional Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) can become in pursuit of a womans love and place in her life, and what bodies hell leave in his wake this time. What dangerous, outrageous thing will he do to protect her? Season 4 provides us with another great round of all of that and more, giving Joe a complex new situation that challenges his sense of duty, while still telling a story thats a bloody good time.Season 3 ended with Joe faking his death so he could follow Marienne (Tati Gabrielle) to Paris, but season 4 takes a sharp right, sends Joe to London, and makes him an unsuspecting Hercule Poirot in the middle of an Agatha Christie murder mystery with an overt eat the rich slant. Definitely not what anyone was expecting, but its an exciting direction that puts Joe in a new and complex position that will test his patience and restraint. Whereas hes had to simply survive among the New York Peach Salingers, the Los Angeles Quinns, and the mommy bloggers of Madre Linda, he now has to thrive among the generational wealth and status of London society  a culture of classism that has been bred for centuries and beyond American understanding. Here, the murder-mystery genre conventions efficiently enrich Yous own tradition of non-linear storytelling. I often convince people to watch You by emphasizing just how fun it is, for a show about a man who sees obsessively stalking women and murdering people who stand in his way as a misguided gambit to insert himself into their life like a hornier, post-modern Dexter (the show, and also the character) who doesnt understand that hes not a good person. Yet Yous pacing and shocking reveals have always been its true secret weapons for keeping us captivated so far. This is why the decision to split the fourth season into two five-episode parts, released one month apart, may be frustrating for eager fans  especially with how Part 1 ends on a good old-fashioned mid-season cliffhanger  but as someone who also had to wait a few weeks to see Part 2, it does make the case for why this break is necessary. Trust me: the impact is worth it when Part 2 picks up after the dust has more or less settled. Trust me: the impact is worth it when Part 2 picks up after the dust has more or less settled.On a different show, Part 1 and Part 2 wouldve been two solid, if short, back-to-back seasons, fully fleshing out supporting characters and extending the mystery. You keeps inconsequential characters simple and out of the way, which isnt a problem for this genre  and when our detective has to eliminate suspects quickly. Tilly Keeper and Lukas Gage join the cast as a rocky couple who play a secondary role in this season, and Keeper sparkles as the sweetly nave Phoebe while Gage portrays failing American crypto-bro Adam with an easy bliss. Their story mainly exists to color Joes priorities as he pursues his new object of desire, Kate (Charlotte Ritchie), but there seems to be missing information that leads to jarring and implausible shifts in their characters. Its not a big thing, since these lovebirds dont factor in too much with Joes interests, but their inconsistency rubbed me the wrong way after we get an understanding of their motives and how they interact.What We Said About You Season 3Some viewers want to see good people doing good things. Others want to see the worst of the worst  truly despicable people wallowing in their destruction. You has always done the latter well, and it continues to do so with Season 3. Joe and Love, seemingly perfect for each other before, have become something so disgusting and revulsive that you cant look away from the disaster. - Brittany Vincent, October 22, 2021Score: 7Read the full You Season 3 reviewYou is good at upping the ante of dynamic complexity with each season, with Joe as the evolving (devolving?) constant from season to season. Were now four seasons into a show that takes on an almost entirely new supporting cast every year and Badgley is consistently able to hold it down as the straight man to the bigger characters. Hes great at subtly reacting and giving his scene partners something to bounce off of, knowing that his wry narration supplements that performance. Under a new identity as a professor, Joes made a quiet life for himself discussing American literature with young minds at a local college. Hes particularly good-natured with one of his students, the jaded Nadia (Amy-Leigh Hickman), whos playing the younger sibling role to Joe, reminiscent of his relationship with Paco from season 1 and Ellie from season 2. Ed Speelers plays the mayoral hopeful Rhys Montrose with an easy balance of cheekiness and tough love that disarms a desperate Joe looking for redemption.It's new for Joe  and new for us  to see that he may actually have a mature match that accepts his past.For Kate, the no-nonsense gallerist, surviving girlfriend of the Eat the Rich Killers first victim, and daughter of the insanely powerful Tom Lockwood (played by someone whose reveal delighted me as much as John Stamos casting in season one did). Joe finds something with her that inspires actual consideration and something other than pure obsession. Ritchie portrays Kates immediate distrust of Joe with the emotional flexibility of a wall, and at first I worried that the chemistry wouldnt be there, even if early on she demonstrates that she can   la the Hot Priest from Fleabag  cut through Joes pensive narration to be present. But as Joe and Kates individual wariness of each other transformed effortlessly into warmth, I can only say kudos to Badgley and Ritchies acting. Its new for Joe  and new for us  to see that he may actually have a mature match that accepts his past. Overall, these relationships coax out Joes vulnerability and actually makes it seem like he is doing something right in his life for once.Penn Badgley carries Joes accumulated weariness from stalking, stabbing, and hacking so naturally in his physicality and presence this season. Hes tired and not looking for any trouble, and there is a lightness to him (after literally burning everything down and fleeing the country last season) that is more controlled, mature, and open. Yet when things dont go his way, were reminded of the controlled rage that resides deep inside Joe, never fully gone. This season gives Badgley a lot to work with and great scene partners to bounce off, giving a truly complex performance that reflects on his past, his failed romances, his traumas, and what is next for him. Just like Joe Goldberg himself, Netflixs You is able to reinvent itself in little ways to keep things fresh season after season while still staying true to its storytelling thumbprint, year after year. Supplemented this season by side-stepping into the murder-mystery genre, You effectively uses a split season in order to pull off some truly shocking reveals. Though it handles most of its complex storylines with ease, there are one or two instances that take us out of the breakneck pace its 10 episodes are trying to maintain, but it quickly recovers. Penn Badgley remains scary good as Joe Goldberg, bouncing off his wildly talented castmates who are able to disarm and challenge Joe into really looking at who he is and what he has become.", "date": "Feb. 11, 2023,"}
