Not having a cord tethering you down while you kick back on the couch to play your favorite game is a pleasure of its own. However, with the next-generation consoles, using a wireless headset is not entirely possible - unless you want to give up voice communication which is a bit of a handicap in online games. This is where Turtle Beach has been toiling away with its brand new premium lineup of headsets. The Elite 800, which we had the pleasure of (or the lack of) testing a couple of weeks back, offered a truly wireless experience for both the PS4 and Xbox One along with features like DTS 7.1 surround sound and Bluetooth. Just somewhere along that premium lineup is the Stealth 500X, an Xbox One headset that aims to give you the same wireless experience and sound features without the need for any clunky attachments (I am looking at you, Xbox One Sound adapter). Design Unlike the Elite 800, Turtle Beach has sought to play it safe with the Stealth 500X. It looks, feels and behaves like the many headsets Turtle Beach has produced over the years. And while there is nothing wrong with that, one would expect a little more from a $229 headset. That said, the 500X is still remarkably well-built with not a creak, loose parts or poor construction to be found. It resembles the XO Seven that I reviewed recently, with a subdued matte black finish and bright green stripes running across its 50mm drivers. Both the ear cups of the headset are fitted with an assortment of buttons, with the surround and preset buttons on the right, and the mic and volume controls on the left. What many players will appreciate is the separate volume controls for game and chat, which allows them to tune the volume levels to their liking. The 500X also supports mic monitoring, and though it hardly is a novel feature, it is a welcome addition for online gamers. Mic monitoring enables you to listen to your own voice from within the headset, so that you can safely smack talk without the rest of the house hearing it. The headset has two levels of mic monitoring - low and high, with an option to turn it off entirely. The Stealth 500X comes with foam and mesh padding (instead of pleather) which Turtle Beach claims is engineered to run cooler on your head and breathe better. I must admit that I am not a huge fan of mesh padding as they irritate my ears quite a bit and are usually extremely uncomfortable. The Stealth 500X is a different story however - after the initial hour or two of breaking-in, the headset became comfortable and fitted snugly around my head. I have played the entirety of The Walking Dead Season 2 with these on, and watched a plethora of movies and YouTube clips as well, and I never felt the need to put them off. When it comes to setting up the Stealth 500X, its a simple two-step process requiring very little technical know-how. All you need to do is plug in the wireless receiver to the Xbox Ones USB port, run an optical cable from the receiver to the console, and you are done. You will need to follow a set of instructions on setting up the Xbox One for optimal sound, which the included Quick Reference guide runs you by. While the Stealth 500X is marketed towards the Xbox One, and it is indeed only fully compatible with that system, it does allow you to run the good ol 3.5mm cable to any device that supports it. This includes your smartphone and music player, and even the PlayStation 4, although the headset will run on stereo mode, and the mic and volume controls will cease to work. However, the Stealth 500X can still be used with the PS4 online (complete with mic monitoring and all) if you turn on the mic before plugging it in into the DualShock 4. Performance Like the Elite 800, the Stealth 500X too features DTS Headphone:X virtual 7.1 surround sound feature, and a range of surround modes and presets to choose from. There are four modes to cycle through: Game, Movie, Music and Stereo. Each mode holds four presets which are tuned for specific needs and genres. For example, the Game mode features built-in presets for shooters, racing and sports along with the signature sound preset which has been optimized for the best overall experience. Similarly, the Movie mode has its own presets for action or horror, while the Music mode can be tuned for stadium, acoustic and dance. You can also use the Stealth 500X in stereo mode, which does away with any sound processing and allows you to tweak the bass or treble (or both) using the predefined presets. If you are unhappy with the default presets, you can choose to download new ones provided by Turtle Beach themselves. Using the Ear Force Audio Hub for Windows (the app is not available for Mac, at the time of writing) you can add or remove presets from each surround mode. For example, if you want greater emphasis on footsteps in online games, you can simply download the Footstep Focus preset that amplifies the finer details in the sound. Turtle Beach also provides presets for specific games like GTA V, Destiny, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and more, each changing the sound in a way to best present the games audio. Some of the presets certainly do work very well - I extensively tried the Destiny preset and was impressed how it expanded the sound and added more punch to the sound effects. The Ear Force Audio Hub can also be used to update the receiver and the headset, and in fact has an update ready when you plug it in. The update is apparently essential for optimal sound so make sure it is applied before you start using it. Cycling through these modes and presets are represented with an archaic series of beeps and boops which can be a bit confusing when you first start using the headset. Even after two weeks of operation, I was still confused if I had selected surround mode two or three - its just not my instinct to count the series of beeps after I make a change. The Elite 800 had a much better system to present this, where a voice would say exactly which surround mode or preset I had selected. Even though the 500X is a cheaper option than the Elite 800, it still is premiumly priced and I wish Turtle Beach had included the voice guidance to make navigation around the headset a bit more intuitive. In terms of performance, the Stealth 500X is an allround fantastic headset. It does away with the hollow sound effects and distorted audio of the Elite 800 and delivers a tight, well-executed aural experience. It isnt too bass-y, so certain types of music may not ,ome alive so to speak but listening to Animals by Martin Garrix was still quite pleasant and enjoyable. Of course, the Stealth 500X is built for gaming and thats where it truly shines. I was impressed how the headset performed in the Halo 5 beta, giving off a surprisingly accurate surround sound experience where I could gauge how far the dangerous thumps of the DMR were going off, and on what level the clanks of the approaching enemy spartan armor were coming from. Even on the PS4 (connected through the optical cable), games like Destiny and Call of Duty Advanced Warfare performed exceedingly well, with the customized presets for those games heightening the overall experience further. For online gaming, the Stealth 500X has a very capable mic that gives clean, distortion-free voice capability. The mic monitoring works great too, as I could hear myself absolutely perfectly and never had to shout out my words. Below is a short sample of me recording a passage from Alice in the Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. It was recorded on an app on my Nexus 5 using the 3.5mm cable: Pros Great build and ergonomicsSurround modes work extremely wellFantastic audio experienceTruly wireless on the Xbox One Cons Preset switching is made through a confusing series of high/low beepsManaging presets and updates requires a Windows PC If you need a completely wireless experience on the Xbox One, there arent a lot of choices. But Turtle Beach hasnt taken that position for granted, either. The Ear Force Stealth 500X is an extremely capable device with great build quality, comfort, and sound that makes every dollar spent on it count. The bullet-point DTS Headphone:X virtual surround sound works great as well, with each surround mode and preset changing the sound in dramatic ways to better present the game and the genre it is being used for - although I wish navigating around these options were a lot more intuitive. It may not be as feature packed as its more expensive sibling, the Elite 800, but for $229, although still extremely steep, the Stealth 500X is easily recommendable if you have the cash to spare.", "date": "Jan. 4, 2015,"}
