Magnetix is a simple puzzle game based on the laws of attraction. No Im not talking about dating, Im talking about magnetic attraction. The first iOS game from Adelaide-based gaming studio Piata Games, Magnetix is a straightforward game that can really test your patience. You touch and hold a glowing orb, and need to navigate it from one side of the screen to the other. Deliciously simple yet often excruciatingly difficult. While your enemies look like something youd only find in a Petri dish, they love following you around, so as soon as you come near them, they get pulled towards you. Larger enemies can be lured around the screen with ease, but the smaller enemies in the later levels are much quicker and less likely to give up that easily. Did we like it? I have to sheepishly admit that Im only at level 2.1, even though Ive been playing the game as much as I can to try and progress further. While the initial levels are great for explaining the games mechanics, the game quickly takes off the training wheels and lets you flounder in the astral goop as enemies merrily head towards you. I can only imagine what the later levels are like which make you collect mandatory coins in order to open the levels exit. Magnetix relies on a simple game mechanic that never seems to get boring no matter how many times you swear at your iPad. Should you buy it? Its certainly a complete distraction from whatever it was that you were doing, and can certainly frustrate even the most zen players. At a paltry $0.99 its hardly going to break your wallet, and words cannot describe the immense amount of glee youll experience when you watch your friends trying to finish a level over and over again. CLOSING COMMENTS Magnetix is a very simple game to learn but is certainly challenging to master. The game quickly scales up in difficulty after the initial levels, so be prepared for plenty of long hours trying to finish certain levels. Its a cute little game that take a simple gameplay concept and executes it well.
