After dipping my toe in with the standard soldier Oscar Mike, the literally lumbering Montana made for a natural progression. Before you know it, I was moving onto stranger selections like the melee-focused human-demon hybrid Shayne & Aurox. What gives each of their ability sets depth and diversity beyond the initial character choice is that you begin every new excursion at level one and progress through 10 upgrade choices in the course of a single session, with the twist that you have to choose the upgrades on the fly, like in a MOBA. One of the weirder characters I took a liking to was the multi-limbed magician Orendi. While her magical skills are fun to use at level 1, I liked having spur-of-the-moment choices to bolster them. Would the up-close Nullify attack work better if it automatically launched Orendi out of range of an enemys retaliatory attacks, or if it immediately recharged her shield so she could take that hit instead? Would her damaging Shadowfire Pillar cause more devastation with a wider range or if a second, less-powerful pillar could be immediately deployed afterward? With Oscar Mike, you can end up with a precision-focused fighter with sniper-scope and laser-strike upgrades or take more of a spray-and-pray approach by using a laser sight on your rifle and a wider bombardment strike as upgrade alternatives. When a team is in desperate need of revives and an extra gun, weird choices like whether Montana's health regenerates faster as his chaingun is heating up or cooling down can become abnormally stressful. It's a sensation I've rarely encountered with shooter campaigns, and I have to say, I liked the extra tactical level added to these frantic battles on top of the unique feel it gave to each character. The Campaign Trail Battleborn's seven-hour campaign lives and dies by the quality of its eight stages, which are mostly repetitive with the exception of some standout moments. Each one is essentially continuous waves of samey enemies broken up with more creative boss battles and/or base-defense sequences. Using currency (called shards) you collect on each map, you also have to purchase turrets and bots to aid in your attack against giant mechs or base defense, which adds an interesting layer of resource management. This is a Gearbox game, so of course the makers of Borderlands couldnt resist adding loot as well, though in this case you earn new gear in between battles. While Battleborn's loot carries over from match to match, the bonuses you get out of it aren't as high-impact as the in-match leveling system. They still do a good job of adding to the intensity of the combat, though. Most loot items (earned after campaign levels and multiplayer matches, but also purchasable with points you earn in every mode) are stat bonuses that you can put into a three-item loadout and apply to your character over the course of a stage, provided you have the shards to activate them. Giving the shards a second use outside of activating deployable allies makes for a nice pull between using shards for the immediate good of your team with turrets and bots or being slightly greedy to upgrade your character's speed, firepower, or health regeneration. With all of that action, the actual story Battleborn is trying to tell becomes background noise. Its all disembodied voices talking to each other from portraits in the corners of the screen, and since you rarely exposition-spouting NPC characters in the flesh, it never means much. It doesn't help that with a story about warring factions uniting to save the one remaining hospitable planet against a galaxy-conquering force, everyone seems to be hyper and full of jokes when you'd expect most folks to treat the scenario seriously. As a result, I never felt any sense of urgency during the campaign. The visual style, humor, and development team force comparisons to the Borderlands series, but Battleborn's plot and tone never quite reaches those same endearing heights. While there are some rare chuckleworthy lines and the animated intro and ending gave me fond flashbacks to Aeon Flux, the overall storytelling didn't land as much as I expected it to. Some stages, like the opening salvo through an arctic base, a trap-filled ruin where one wrong move means death, and the final, frantic stage are the kind of co-op experiences I'll gladly return to with friends to grind and unlock new characters. However, others that required multiple back-and-forth runs to defend bases are one-and-done for me, especially since a destroyed base means repeating the entirety of a 40-minute level. Losing a campaign level because the shared lives pool was depleted is fair and something that's a culmination of futility; having half an hour of progress flushed away because you took your eye off a defense point for a few seconds can feel unfair. Keep in mind that this is the style of game that, while the entirety of the campaign can be tackled on a solo basis, is really not built to played alone. Without any partners to revive you, the amount of extra lives is depleted much quicker; but even worse is that some levels seem nigh-impossible with certain hero types. I wouldn't be foolhardy enough to attempt to solo a level with the healing-focused Miko and his piddling knives, but there are less-intuitive traps like taking the strong swordsman Rath and his grounded attacks and finding them all but useless against a spider mech that then grows a floating head. Fortunately I was with a team at the time, but the prospect of using his meager projectile special attack and jumping while flailing his sword like a madman would have made the battle a lost cause. Clash of the Battleborn Where the campaign feels familiar and soulless, there's a lot of imagination on display in the three PvP modes. Capture is a familiar domination-style mode good for fast action. Incursion is kind of a condensed version of Battleborn's campaign that smartly avoids those overly long battles as you enter the opposition's territory to take down their mechs with your own firepower and any robot minions you may have purchased. Where the campaign feels familiar and soulless, there's a lot of imagination on display in the three PvP modes. The third mode, Meltdown, is Battleborn's well-meaning but ultimately flawed mixture of MOBA and arena FPS gameplay. The big issue is that Battleborn's first-person perspective means the action is too close and the map overlay is too small to keep track of any nearby deployables and enemy locations on top of keeping your head on straight regarding your own health, level, and currency to purchase said deployables. Also, while it would have been nice to pit these diverse heroes against each other in more straightforward modes like Team Deathmatch or free-for-all, there isnt one to be found. The last thing that bothered me was that while all the maps are well tailored to fit each mode, they're all lacking in substantial indoor locales where the melee-focused characters can thrive. Even though multiplayer maps and modes are scarce, at least they're all instantly available  unlike the hero roster, which left me wanting access to more characters earlier. At the outset, the seven heroes to choose from are a bit paltry, especially when three are the standard gun-toting soldier types that dont do a great job of showcasing the diversity of the larger cast. The entirety of the seven-hour campaign will net you four more, and it'll take another two or three hours to start unlock characters via multiplayer or by generally leveling up your overall profile. It's made for a pretty thin cast of characters in multiplayer matches during the opening week of Battleborn's release, but I hope the modes are still active when players start earning the higher-level characters. With well over a dozen hours with Battleborn I've only earned access to roughly half of the cast, which doesn't feel enough for the effort Ive put in. On the bright side, it keeps me driven to progress, albeit slowly. I'm a bit more flummoxed about the customization options that come with more specialized work. You can unlock new outfits and taunts for Battleborn's heroes by either leveling up that specific character or by completing specific tasks (like successfully using a particular skill or winning a number of multiplayer matches) but they're all viewable in the character information menu and most just amount to a different colored character instead of interesting new outfits you'd see in the likes of Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare. Pros Fantastic HeroesExciting Leveling SystemSome Fun Stages Cons Repetitive CampaignUnderwhelming Story The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, theres no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process. I'll return to the half of the campaign that doesnt feel unfair and repetitive and enjoy two thirds of the scant multiplayer modes, but I can't help but feel Battleborn still has a lot of room to grow.", "date": "May 7, 2016, 1"}
