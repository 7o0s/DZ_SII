Ski Safari's premise would be terrifying if it weren't presented in such a cute way: help hapless skier Sven descend as far down an endless mountain as possible, before the never-ending avalanche catches him. The title is a simple one-button experience similar to Jetpack Joyride or Tiny Wings - tap the touch screen to jump over obstacles, and hold to perform a mid-air backflip to earn literal style points. Along the way gamers can hitch a ride on animal helpers like yetis, eagles and penguins, each with their own characteristics. Did we like it? Ski Safari doesn't stray far from the path established by previous popular endless runners. A strong list of meta-goals like performing 10 backflips in one run or staying on a Yeti for 2000m gives gamers a good reason to come back for just one more run. The game will be a bit too easy and each session will last a little too long for experienced gamers, but it's easy to see why the title has already become such a hit with the masses. It's tough not to smile when hitching a ride on a penguin at the last moment to avoid being swallowed up by the ever-gaining avalanche. Should you buy it? Ski Safari is more casual and less skill-based than Jetpack Joyride or Tiny Wings, but it's a perfect choice for any gamer looking for a quick $0.99 distraction that has tired of previous endless runners. As the App Store continues to fill with more and more sophisticated gaming options (even Angry Birds Space gets very challenging), Ski Safari offers up a nice way to turn off your brain and experience a fun & polished mountain descent. CLOSING COMMENTS Ski Safari is unlikely to become the iPhone's next long-term mega-hit  it lacks that immediate need for twitch reaction that makes great endless runners so fiendishly addictive. Regardless, I still had a lot of fun jumping off ramps for huge air, lazily performing a triple backflips, and using my Yeti brethren to my advantage.
