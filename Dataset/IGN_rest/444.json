We'll bring you the complete review once we've had the chance to properly test the online aspects of the game on live servers. Last year, I said that PES 2016 might well be the best football game ever made. I also said that think it was too early to say that with absolute confidence; that it would be some time before its standing could be properly measured. Over months of play, a few small cracks appeared in the faade  nothing that could convince me that this wasnt the finest simulation of the beautiful game Id played in quite some time, but enough to make me wonder if Id been a little too generous in my early assessment. So its with no small amount of trepidation that I say this: PES 2017 is better. Let me qualify that by saying Im talking purely about its merits as a single-player and local multiplayer game. At the time of writing, Konami hasnt switched on its servers, and Ive been unable to test any of its online features. Thats a substantial part of any competitive game, and thats why this is a review in progress. Hopefully, the situation will change in the coming days and Ill be able to bring you a full review with a score. For the time being, I can only talk about how it plays offline. It demonstrates a commitment to the basics of the game. As with last year, PES 2017 the kind of game that benefits from a host of incremental improvements that have a collectively beneficial effect. These are the kind of tweaks that its hard to talk about on the back of a games box or its online store page, but it demonstrates a commitment to the basics of the game that goes beyond adding features for the sake of having something that can be easily promoted with a flashy name. For me, the pace seems just a shade more measured than last year. That doesnt mean its sluggish, by any means  passing, for example, is as responsive as it was last year. But, together with the adjustments to defensive AI, I found myself having to be a little more patient and methodical in breaking down opponents. You can still play more quick and direct football, as long as youre set up to do so, but by and large you have to work a little harder for your openings. I think its still a little too hard for pacey players to get clear of opponents they should be able to have on toast, but there is a tangible difference with the quickest of the quick  youll notice the difference when controlling the likes of Pierre Emerick Aubameyang or Leroy Sane. Further efforts have been made to distinguish individual players, and the playing styles of the games biggest stars are instantly recognisable, from Antoine Griezmanns speed of thought and feet to the flashy technique of Neymar who can also remove his shirt in a unique goal celebration (for which hell rightly be booked). I found myself winning the ball back after conceding possession a little more often. Elsewhere, the recovery time after losing the ball seems to have been shortened; certainly, I found myself winning the ball back after conceding possession a little more often. Collisions, too, now feel more authentic  I no longer experienced that strange phenomenon whereby two players would occasionally come together and then both suddenly bounce off in opposite directions. Youll still encounter the occasional bit of weirdness, but thats true of almost any game with so many variables and moving parts, and such oddities are relatively scarce. This years goalkeepers are one feature Konami really should be shouting about. They will make mistakes, yes, but theyre more convincingly human ones rather than the kind of blunder you can predict before it happens. Theyll rarely drop the more straightforward catches, and will more frequently hold onto softer shots rather than spill them into the path of onrushing strikers. The best stoppers will react quicker to deflections, too  perfectly illustrated during one game where a fortunate ricochet forced David de Gea to change direction, twisting to shovel the ball out for a corner. Later, he acrobatically flung himself across his goal to tip away a thunderous 20-yard half-volley from Fernandinho  a moment that also served to highlight how good the shooting feels. Long-range strikes wont always find the top corner, but the connections you make when the ball sits up perfectly feel crisp and clean. Konami has made a change that might upset a few of the purists. The same could be said of the passing, but thats always been a PES strength. But this year, Konami has made a change that might upset a few of the purists. Essentially, its a system that will, under the right set of circumstances, gently massage the trajectory of a pass to pinpoint precision. It depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the passer, the space in which they find themselves, and the position of the receiver relative to their markers. Once or twice, it felt to me like defenders had slowed up slightly to allow a runner to receive a ball on his instep and burst clear. But for the most part, its handled expertly, convincing you that you were wholly responsible for that perfect clipped through-ball. You found the right moment and the right type of pass, sure, but it was Konamis invisible guiding hand that changed a good ball into a thing of beauty. It handles the uglier moments well, too - though its slightly ironic that jostling at corners should be more noticeable at a time when referees have been told to clamp down on pushing and shirt-pulling in the box. Goalmouth scrambles feel frantic and faintly comical, just as they should, while AI opponents concede more fouls  one of my favourites saw Raheem Sterling pull off a sharp turn on the edge of the box and the defenders trailing leg hooked his right foot. Free-kicks are still a relatively infrequent occurrence, but youll rarely go through a game without a handful of fouls, and if the ref blows, it rarely feels like hes being too fussy. Replays will always highlight when you stepped in and got more man than ball with a standing challenge. The flipside of the coin is that they wont penalise you as often for clean sliding tackles, no matter how loudly the crowd roars. And when the whistle does go, youll find set-pieces are more flexible, with a welcome ability to tinker with a variety of dead-ball strategies. Given how close it gets to the sport in both look and feel, the moments where it falls short feel all the more jarring. The commentary from Peter Drury and Jim Beglin feels much more fluid and organic, yet obviously canned soundbites from previous years remain, and there are still too few comments for individual players - if I hear And the lead is three! or That is classic Kun Aguero! again, itll be too soon. And in a game where so much attention has been paid to animation, its odd to find players looking so robotic when anticipating a throw-in. The lack of licences is an obvious drawback that persists and may never be resolved  at least not for the foreseeable future  but while its something weve all grown to expect from PES, its disappointing to see the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus unable to use their real names. Still, with continued support for option files, thats a fixable problem in a game that otherwise doesnt have much to remedy. I hope PES 2017s online component has been treated with similar care to the offline game, and by the end of the week, the answer should become clearer. For the time being, anyone who owns two controllers and can lean upon a regularly available friend or family member to play against can probably start getting excited. FIFAs new story mode might be the most headline-grabbing feature of either game this year, but its clear Konami is in no mood to relinquish its title as king of the virtual pitch. We haven't yet been able to test PES 2017 online yet, so this review remains in progress. But if I had to score it now based solely on offline play, I'd give it a 9.5 for Amazing. Check back soon for the final review.", "date": "Sept. 13, 2016"}
