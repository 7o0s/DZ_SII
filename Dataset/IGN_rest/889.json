Kirbys Return to Dream Land has been solidly in the former camp since its original release on Wii in 2011, making its Deluxe rerelease on Switch recognizable in more ways than one. Strong platforming fundamentals, creative late-game level design, and some worthwhile new content still make it worth revisiting, but its a more appealing package for newcomers than those who have already gone on the original adventure. Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) - Neon Blue/Neon Red Int'l Version . . 1,218.00 View on Amazon  Like those aforementioned traditional Kirby platformers, the first few worlds in Kirbys Return to Dreamland Deluxe are so remarkably unchallenging that they strip away any sense of resistance and, frankly, fun to be had. Flashy Super Abilities, which allow Kirby to do things like roll enemies up into a giant snowball or slash a massive sword across the screen, often start as almost automated sections that require very little player input. Its important to have games that welcome newcomers, but it takes at least a couple of hours before this adventure begins to feel even remotely interesting, regardless of if youre playing solo or with friends. However, once you reach that latter half of the campaign, Return to Dream Land begins to reveal what its really about. The platforming stages start relying upon Kirbys copy abilities more heavily, like using the Water ability to skim across fiery blocks, or the Jump ability to soar to new heights by letting him leap vertically and knock enemies out of his way. And it does all of this while throwing increasingly difficult challenges in your path, whether those are (often repetitive) mini bosses fighting you on screens with pitfalls and other dangers in the way, or platforming challenges that have you escaping a wall of death with creative obstacles to scurry around. What We Said About Kirbys Return to Dream Land (2011) Kirby is not necessarily for you or me, but for our children, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. It is a whimsical, charming adventure that has clearly been designed for a younger audience first and others second. That's not a bad thing, but it does come with limitations. It's a little frustrating that Nintendo couldn't have aimed for both audiences at the same time, and I know when I was a kid I would have killed for the harder challenge, but you can only fault the game so much for that. - Richard George, October 24, 2011 Score: 7.5 Read the full Kirbys Return to Dream Land review The final stretch of Return to Dream Land, in particular, feels like the original developers were able to let loose with a relatively challenging (but never frustrating) conclusion thats filled with creative levels and enemies alike. The finale in particular is a wild ride, standing tall with surprising twists and genuine challenge. In all, it took me about six hours to float through the main story of Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and over half of that runtime felt well worth the journey. There's plenty of fun to be had just goofing around levels with a few friends. Then theres the multiplayer of it all. Up to three friends can hop in and out locally at any point. Theyll play as either Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee, who essentially take on one distinct copy ability apiece (Sword, Hammer, and Spear, respectively) and can stack on top of each other or be carried across stages. Playing with this many players blunts some of the finer details of the level design, as it quickly becomes a chaotic game of trying to quickly clear enemies and get to the goal first  a section where you are supposed to time your movements to avoid boulders can quickly just become run through the boulders and hope someone gets to the other side. Boss patterns can also essentially be ignored as each character pummels the enemy to oblivion. Stages in general feel designed specifically around single-player, but still work with a bigger group if thats how you choose to play. However, like similar multiplayer platformers, theres plenty of fun to be had just goofing around levels with a few friends. The multiplayer is probably best served as a sort of guardian mode where you can have a less experienced player tag along and play with you, giving Return to Dream Land yet another way to welcome newcomers. A Welcome Return So thats the original Return to Dream Land, but what the heck is new to this Deluxe version? The most obvious improvement is the graphical overhaul  outside of 2022s Kirby and the Forgotten Land, this is easily the best Kirby has ever looked, with character models, environments, cutscenes, and everything else looking remarkably improved over the 2011 Wii original. Its also filled to the brim with charm and small details, like cowboy Kirby walking with a bit of a strut when hes using the Whip ability. New abilities fit in so well that I would have just assumed they were always there. Then there are a few additions to the adventure itself. Three new abilities have been added for Kirby to wreak havoc with: Sand, Mecha, and Festival. Sand allows Kirby to form flurries into objects like sand castles and fists to smack opponents around with. The Mecha ability lets Kirby fly around the screen quickly, shoot off lasers, drop deadly mines, and fire rockets at foes above  its probably the most powerful copy ability in Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and my personal favorite. Theyve also brought the Festival ability over from Star Allies, which turns enemies on screen into point stars and health-recovering food items. They fit in so well that had I not known any better, I would have just assumed they were always in the original release as well. In line with Return to Dream Land being an entry-level platformer, Deluxe also adds an easy mode called Helper Magolor. This character from another planet tosses Kirby helpful items (including health-doubling potions) and saves him when he falls into bottomless pits. While most people probably wont need this mode turned on, its a great option for new or young gamers to help get their feet wet. Magalor Magic Speaking of Magolor, hes the star of Deluxes single biggest addition  Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler. In this roughly two-hour mini adventure, you control an interplanetary character, who begins by being stripped of all of his powers,  la Metroid. But through collecting magic points across brand-new stages, you can purchase increasingly powerful abilities, like bombs you can gleefully rain down upon your enemies. Kirby's signature ability to copy powers is missed in this mode. This mode starts a bit slow, with Magolor being intentionally sluggish and relatively weak, but by the end of the journey he can become a downright powerhouse. The stages themselves are about the same quality as whats seen in the main game, with challenge levels available to unlock if youve already purchased their corresponding abilities. Kirbys signature ability to copy powers is missed in this mode, but its fun to get a taste of what a Kirby-style platformer that unfolds with more progression would play like. True to its name, the Magolor Epilogue can only be played after the main story is finished. Narratively this makes sense, though lets be honest: nothing in a Kirby games story is particularly groundbreaking, and not letting returning players jump right into it feels a little unnecessary. Along those lines, Deluxe includes the originals Extra Mode, which is a much more difficult version of the main story that gives Kirby less health, adds more enemies to deal with, gives bosses more challenging forms, and more. However, it also cannot be accessed until after the main mode is finished, which seems silly for a Deluxe version that plays almost identically to the original. Let's be honest: nothing in a Kirby game's story is particularly groundbreaking. Theres also Arena Mode, which similarly unlocks following the main story as a boss rush of sorts to further test your skills. While those certainly pad out the overall play time, I would have preferred access to them right off the bat. New to the package is Merry Magoland, a theme park filled with sub-games that put you against other players. In the original Wii version, Magolors ship (the Lor Starcutter) housed several of these minigames, but now they also exist in this colorful area, and there are two new minigames to play around with in addition to the original eight. The minigames themselves are well-made but relatively shallow, reminding me of the time I spent playing Pokemon Stadiums minigames with my friends as a kid. They range from the star-throwing Ninja Dojo, where you try to hit moving targets either using button presses or motion-controlled throws with their Joy-Con, to the classic Samurai Kirby, a dueling minigame where each player attempts to slice as quickly as possible when prompted. They can all be played through in about half an hour and dont add a huge amount of value to the package, but earning cosmetic masks through Magoland and playing with them in the main game can be a fun diversion. Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe takes a fun but straightforward Wii platformer, freshens it up visually, and adds a new mini adventure to pad out its otherwise relatively short campaign. Kirbys journey across Planet Popstar starts as a slow, overly easy drudge. But once the difficulty picks up and the stages become more creative, this platformer shines through to its over-the-top conclusion  even if that conclusion comes far too soon. The Magolor Epilogue is also a welcome addition that stands on its own as another brief but worthwhile story. Return to Dream Land certainly isnt Kirbys best or most creative outing, but if you havent already played it on Wii, the Deluxe version is the ideal way to see what a traditional Kirby game is all about.", "date": "Feb. 22, 2023,"}
