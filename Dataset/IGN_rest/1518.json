Its old-school action mechanics invoke the games of yore, while its beautiful backgrounds, monsters and cutscenes impress the eye. And PlayStation Vita doesn't yet have a game quite like this, something that fans of PS3's PlayStation Network have with throwbacks like Mega Man 9 and 10, BloodRayne: Betrayal or Bionic Commando Rearmed. Unfortunately, procedural havoc brings Sumioni to its knees, sucks much of the fun out of the adventure and makes playing it feel like a chore. Its developer, Acquire -- best-known for the Tenchu franchise, as well as Way of the Samurai and Shinobido -- stumbled upon something that could have been enjoyable. But the game's novel approach succumbs to poor design and simply doesn't pan out in the end. In Sumioni, players assume the role of the demonic Agura, an ~Inkdemon~ summoned to save Japan from certain doom. Controlling Agura is straight-forward enough; use the left analog stick or directional pad to move him around, X to jump and Square to slash with his trusty bisento. Special button combinations can be utilized during the heat of battle to execute more powerful moves, though players will rely almost entirely on their basic attack to deal the brunt of their damage. Things get a little more interesting with Sumioni's combat when you take into account your ability to draw lines on the Vita's screen to create platforms. Doing so consumes ink, which can be refilled by finding ink vials in the environment or by vigorously rubbing the Vita's back touch bad. Furthermore, ever-helpful ~Ink Gods~ can be summoned by drawing certain designs on the screen when prompted to do so. Lines you draw can even be transformed into hazardous fire and turned on your enemies, though doing so will whittle down your ink supply quickly. An undeniably beautiful game. All of this combined makes for something far less trite and mundane than your typical side-scrolling action game. But the way Sumioni has you tackle stages -- and the repetitive and uninspired nature of those stages and the enemies therein -- will quickly overshadow the fun you may initially have. And that's truly a shame, because games more often fail for lacking mechanical soundness, which isn't Sumioni's problem. Sumioni consists of 30 individual stages along six separate tracks. These stages co-mingle along the tracks; exploring various permutations of levels allows you to unlock one of the game's six endings. Cleverly enough, players will have to earn perfect three star ratings on stages which branch off into multiple locations, allowing for a deeper delve into the game's later levels. By getting through any given stage as quickly as possible while taking as little damage as you can, you'll work your way lower and lower into the in-game map, gaining access to the harder-to-achieve endings protected by increasingly powerful foes. A boss battle. If this sounds like a good idea, that's because it is. But Sumioni's execution is decidedly lazy. The stages, enemies and even bosses all blur together. Everything reeks of a complete lack of inspiration. After working through the same types of stages over and over again with the same enemies and boss types with very little variety sprinkled in, you will simply lack the will to see things through to the end. The fact that these stages are exceptionally short doesn't make things any better; you could conceivably earn the game's first ending in mere minutes. Four hours in, I unlocked four endings, with trial, error and an undeniable gluttony for punishment the only reason it took half that long. Sumioni's interface doesn't make things any better. It will incessantly prompt you to save your game, you won't be able to navigate menus with the buttons, and for a title that requires you to achieve perfect ratings to move on to better levels, it certainly makes going back to previous stages as obnoxious and unfriendly as possible. You can't go back to stages at will; you have to start at the same beginning stage over and over again and hope you get the ratings you need. If you don't, you'll need to hope you didn't save earlier so you can go back to where you need to be, or you'll need to somehow conjure up the will to do it all again. This system is inherently broken and unfun, making it hard to believe that a stage select screen could have solved all of those problems. CLOSING COMMENTS I saw Sumioni through four of its six endings, and I had enough. Its a shame, too, because if Sumioni tried to do less and presented a more linear and coherent gameplay experience, it would have been a much better game. You dont hear that every day, but in Sumionis case, its true. Its clever premise is really nothing more than a series of annoying bottlenecks for the gamer, and with so little in terms of in-game diversity, no reasons exist to actually see and do everything unless youre a dedicated completionist or Trophy hunter. PlayStation gamers certainly appreciate Acquires early attempts to bring games to the Vita, and while Sumioni isnt as big of a miss as its other Vita title -- Shinobido 2 -- its not a game worth recommending, either. If youve got $20 burning a hole in your pocket, the PlayStation Network already offers Vita players far better alternatives. IGN RATINGS FOR SUMIONI: DEMON ARTS (VITA) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 4.0 Presentation Annoying touch-only menus and a cumbersome stage system (admittedly predicated on something far more solid) obliterate the awesome tone set by the artsy cutscenes. 8.0 Graphics You cant deny that Sumioni is a pretty game, although just about everything you see becomes overused and redundant before long. 6.0 Sound Repetitive music and sound effects dont necessarily feel out of place in an old-school romp like this. 5.0 Gameplay Mechanics dont bring Sumioni down. Messy procedure most certainly does, marring the games otherwise fluid feel. 4.0 Lasting Appeal Trophy hunters may want to see things through, but youll likely be brought to your knees long before you see the games six endings. 5.5 OVERALL Mediocre (out of 10)", "date": "March 23, 2012"}
