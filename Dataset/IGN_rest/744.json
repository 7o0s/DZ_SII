Masters of Sex returned for its third season with ~Parliament of Owls,~ an episode that featured an even larger time leap forward than the three year jump contained in the middle of Season 2. This time we careened from '61 to '65 and caught up with Bill and Virginia as they presented their finished book to a room full of critics - while also flashing back to four months previous when the two of them and Libby, and all their assorted children, ~relaxed~ at a lake house. So structurally, the show's still wobbly. Masters of Sex is a series with outstanding performances, but a needlessly shaky layout. Granted, it's trying to cover actual history and isn't a retro-show like Mad Men that didn't have to include anything creator/writer Matthew Weiner didn't want to. Still, time jumps like this can work to sharply sever a show from its former self. From what's been built up before it. There's a ~reboot~ feeling that comes with each one and that can become too much if done too often. Granted, I will say that a time leap at the top of a season like this one is a bit more acceptable than one in the center of a season. It's still jarring to see Henry and Tessa grown up and old enough to, respectively, be having sex or be doing things sexually inappropriate (funny to see Isabelle Fuhrman displaying shades of her role in Orphan though). That being said, there was a lot of good in the premiere. Most notably, the sheer emotional damage done by Bill and Virginia's ongoing affair. Man, how sad was it to see Libby still toiling away in this loveless marriage? Just resigned to be a pill-popping empty shell/third wheel. And how cruel of both Virginia and Bill, our heroes essentially, to keep this going on for so long without the courtesy of honesty. Look how it's carved up Libby. Look what it's done to Tessa and Henry, who now harbor varying levels of resentment and act out in shocking ways (drunken advances, army aspirations). And then there's young John, who's all-but ignored by Bill. Bill, who's still an icy demon around children and is slowly crushing his son as an emotionally absent father. So while the end of the episode wound up presenting Bill and Virginia with validation regarding their work (a nice turn there by Eric Lange's character, whose scrutiny of the findings was only due to him realizing how important and game-changing they were), their new integrated family unit (where Bill was even asked to talk to Tessa about sex) provided plenty of messy drama. All due to the fact that the two of them have decided to push through their lie as hard as they can in order to come out on the other side with the best of both worlds. And it hurt to watch. Of course, having skipped over so much, we're left to only imagine Libby's assorted breakdowns over the years. Here, she was just defeated. Her talk with Virginia at the end, where she basically let her know that she's known about the affair for years, was still heartbreaking though. As were the ways she looked at Virginia as the true mother of the combined household while she felt more and more like the outsider. Libby mentions that ~a heart can only be broken so many times,~ as to imply all the off-screen times she's been in pain, right before she kissed Virginia and mentioned wondering what it might feel like to be with her. And that, I assume, is that. If history's our guide, Libby's set to remain a shadow of her happy self until she and Bill divorce in '71. Despite, however, causing irreparable emotional damage to everyone within their orbit, everything's coming up roses for Bill and Virginia. Their strained support system will continue to carry the weight of their lie on its shoulders as their work gets prepped for its public debut. The reveal that Virginia's pregnant right at the end could work to upend all of this since Bill's not fond of any children, thought I'm more curious to see how Libby eventually reacts. Might she have found her final straw already or could this be it?
