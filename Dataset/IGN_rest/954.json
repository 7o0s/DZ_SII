Experiencing this classic role-playing game again in beautified 3D was truly a nostalgic trip, from the cute friendship-themed plot to the touching end-credits sequence. However, as a remake, it does represent a big missed opportunity to fix several significant balance issues and mechanical problems  the difficulty I had going back after playing the much more modern Pokmon X shows how far Pokmon games have come in 12 years. For the uninitiated, Ruby and Sapphire were the third installments in the Pokmon RPG series and the best-selling Game Boy Advance games of all time. They follow the tried-and-true Pokmon model of journeying to catch new monsters, challenging eight boss-like Gyms, and eventually fighting the Elite Four trainers and the Champion. Like most other Pokmon games they also put you at odds with a villainous team of Pokmon trainers, in this instance Team Magma for Ruby and Team Aqua for Sapphire, who want to use legendary Pokmon to forever change the region of Hoenn, where the games are set. Now theyre the first of the earlier games to receive the 3D treatment. Generation III was a big change from the first two for many reasons, most notably the introduction of Abilities (attributes that add advantages to battle, among other things), Natures (which affect how stats develop) and double battles (using two Pokmon at once was unheard of back in the day). Different areas had their own weather patterns, and the region contained varied topography, from a desert to a volcano to sandy beaches. In 2002 I reveled in the newness and feel of having an untouched world to explore, and that sense of wonder carries over in Omega and Alpha. The scenery is rich, the adorable characters are even more adorable (especially little Wally!), and theres more to many of the cities than there was before. I walked into Mauville City for the first time while playing Alpha and didnt even recognize it. In the original games it was comparatively small and boasted only the bike shop and the Game Corner, but now its like a smaller Lumiose City from X and Y: full of little shops and tons of NPCs to chat with. I actually got lost in Mauville City more than once, and had a lot of fun rediscovering something I thought I knew well. Alpha and Omega also bear some resemblance to X and Y in that certain app-like features  Pokmon Amie, Super Training, the Player Search System  have all been integrated as part of the PokNav Plus. The interface is overcrowded as a result and really cumbersome, but the online apps are welcome additions (especially Wonder Trade) Its the new Pokmon search app, the DexNav, that is perhaps the most interesting addition for Pokphiles. Every so often, a wild Pokmon will peek its ears or tail out of the tall grass (or sand or water), and DexNav will alert you to things like the Pokmons level, ability, and even rare moves it might have. I found two Poochyena this way: a female with Ice Fang and a male with Poison Fang, two egg moves that you can usually only get by carefully breeding. Easy-access breeding material! The app has the potential to help EV trainers as well, since you can see what Pokmon youll face before you battle it, and in that regard it provides another alternative to Super Training aside from traditional, less-accessible methods. Theres also an updated Berry map, first introduced in Gen IV, which is a serious help to anyone who needs Berries for competitive battle... or even Pokblocks! Remember Pokblocks? They help your Pokmon up their beauty or cuteness or what have you for Contests, which are of course a part of Alpha and Omega. These Pokmon talent shows have a Japanese pop-idol feel this time, which makes it all seem more modern and updated. Playing as the female trainer, I was literally and figuratively taken under the wing of number-one Contest star Lisia and her Altaria, Ali. Lisia is absolutely adorable, but the best part of Contests for me is undoubtedly the Cosplay Pikachu you receive after winning your first one. Change Pikachus outfit according to the five Contest attributes and Pikachu gets a different move! I might just be a super nerd, but its the best thing since Surfing Pikachu. Really, all the tweaks of original Hoenn features are improvements. Unfortunately, there are still a few big flaws that werent addressed, and theyre even more noticeable in light of more recent Pokmon RPGs. My least favorite part of every Pokmon game is the unnecessary inclusion of too many Hidden Moves, commonly referred to as HMs, which you must teach to your Pokmon in order to progress through the region and arent so easily unlearned. Anything more than Surf and Fly is too much, as far as Im concerned, and Hoenn is one of the worst HM offenders. Alpha and Omega dropped Flash for a total of seven HMs this time around  and in the late-game you can summon Latias or Latios to fly you places, which means you wont need a Pokmon in your team with Fly  but compared to X and Ys five HMs, its obvious why the decision was made to pare them back in subsequent games. Secret Power factors into this too. It isnt an HM, but it is another move that interacts with the overworld and is necessary for building Super Secret Bases. Maybe Im just stingy with what moves I teach my Pokmon, but I wish I didnt need a move at all to check out potential bases during my travels. That aside, having a home base I could decorate in 3D was a lot of fun, and sharing via StreetPass or setting it up for other players to fight through as a mini-Gym are both neat touches. Its not a new complaint, but Hoenn is still imbalanced type-wise, heavily favoring water. Its especially noticeable in Alpha Sapphire, in which Team Aqua (the villains of the piece) use a lot of water types. It feels like there are water Pokmon in nearly every battle, and I have an overleveled Pikachu to show for it. You also have to navigate many bodies of water, since much of the late-game involves the HMs Surf and Dive to get from place to place. Diving was really neat back in 2002 when it was new, but I found it incredibly tedious in Alpha and Omega  an obvious example of how superfluous some HMs are. The water itself is absolutely gorgeous with the new graphics and details, though. One of my favorite parts of the entire adventure was splashing through puddles that reflected the starry skies at night, and even diving was made better by seeing a school of Luvdisc swimming by. Building my Super Secret Base on the rainy Route 119 had an extra-comfy, drinking-tea-on-a-rainy-day feel. Everything in Hoenn, water or not, is either delightfully cute or strikingly beautiful, and I enjoyed seeing the entire region anew  despite the tediousness associated with navigating all that pretty water. Pros Gorgeous detailsPost-game contentSome smart updates Cons Too much waterToo many HMs As a 3D remake, Pokmon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby do a fantastic job of reintroducing Hoenn. Little details, like characters turning their heads to look as you pass or flocks of Wingulls flying overhead, make the region really come to life, and small updates and tweaks help make the journey smoother. Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokmon and often dull navigation of their habitats. The added online features could help mitigate some of the type imbalances  Im a huge fan of Wonder Trade  and there are even a few post-game surprises to encourage you to keep training well beyond the 25-hour main story.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2014,"}
