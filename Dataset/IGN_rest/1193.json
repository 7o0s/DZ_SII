But surprisingly, and rather disappointingly, seeing it in action as a match unfolds is an altogether mundane reality of forgettable-looking characters and middling art direction. But just past this sheenless wrapping, in the guts of its combat engine, there lies a responsive, diverse fighting game that manages to feel different from its contemporaries without resorting to gimmickry or over-the-top spectacle. Aquapazza begins to distinguish itself admirably right on the character select screen, where its unique spin on team building becomes apparent. You only have direct control of one character, which you choose from one pool, and then you select an assist character from an entirely separate pool. Each assist character has two attacks, and varying cool-down times govern how frequently you can call them. Initially it smacks of a watered-down take on VS fighters like Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, but once you start applying it in battle, it proves to be much more. Since space is vertically confined to one screen like in more traditional fighters, the areas your assist can control - and how frequently they can control them - becomes a vital part of how you play your main character. Rush-down oriented characters like Konomi and Chizuru benefit greatly from having Satsuki to back them up with a series of gunshots to lock down opponents as they approach. But you could just as easily decide to work your way in to an opponent the old-fashioned way and use Rathty and her oversized hammer to apply heavier pressure once you get close. Like pairing the right wine with your meal (or maybe just the right beer with your pizza), these decisions have a very real impact on the flavor of each match, so experimenting with different combinations feels worth it. Exploring character choices is made even more interesting by the fact that very few of the 13 main characters can be easily lumped into popular fighting game archetypes. The few that do fit into those classifications do so very loosely, and always have other neat twists to grasp. The casts main grappler Tamaki has a full-screen unblockable projectile that can be used to set up her big command grabs, while keep-away specialist Riannon wields an array of magical spells that can be used to heal her, buff her, or even change her emotional state - which is another way Aquapazza carves out its own distinctive niche. The interestingly tuned emotion system bears some similarity to the tension systems of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue in that they punish passive turtling while rewarding forward movement and aggression, though the penalties and rewards for each are refreshingly different from analogous systems in other games. Falling into low emotion takes a noticeable chunk out of your damage output, and makes your guard breakable if you block for too long. High emotion grants you extra damage, special properties on certain moves, and most interestingly, extra hit-stun on landed attacks. The potential rewards for staying on offense ensure matches with constant action, which ends up being something of a boon and a curse. On the one hand, playing offensively is great fun - both because of the payoff, and because of how well differentiated each characters mobility options are. On the other, defensive players wont have much to do. Normals are stubby almost across the board, so playing footsies and punishing whiffed or unsafe moves feels situational at best. And at the end of the day, if youre blocking, youre starting to slide down that slippery slope of the emotion system. While it succeeds at incentivizing players to stay active, the cost of Aquapazzas emotion system is that you feel like a car thats always stuck in sixth gear with the accelerator pinned. The result is that every match shares the same pace, despite the character diversity. So many of me. Not only is the character variety slightly undermined by one-note pacing, the visuals help bury some of it, too. Character art is all pulled directly from various visual novel series by Leaf, which may work for visual storytelling, but the effect is dulling in the context of a fighting game. Sure, it makes sense that three of the ToHeart characters are wearing identical uniforms since they go to the same school, but it also makes them look too samey. I can identify any character from Street Fighter or Persona 4 Arena by silhouette alone, but I dont think i could pick even my most-played Aquapazza character out of a lineup. On a technical level, Aquapazza looks like an upscaled PS2 game, which is understandable given how long its been out in Japanese arcades. But even compared to actual uprezzed PS2 fighters like Guilty Gear Accent Core, its graphics fail to convey the excitement of its frantic pace. I fight for the honor of my giant crab! Pros Character diversityFast pacedUnique systems Cons Visually boringAll offense Aquapazza is a successful home port that will satisfy those whove followed its competitive run in Japan. While its graphics do little to excite the senses, theres an interesting fighting game behind them - one that exhibits surprising creativity and variety despite its single-minded emphasis on offense.", "date": "Dec. 18, 2013,"}
