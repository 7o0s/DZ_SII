Her husband, a professional ninja, then gets fed up with her frequent feedings -- and so decides to slice and destroy all the cookies, pies and other sweet treats he sees in their home to keep her from being able to eat them. It's a funny storyline setup, but unfortunately that's about all Cake Ninja's got going for it. You could guess from the game's title that the gameplay in this one is a shameless clone of the more notableFruit Ninja that's become a hit across both mobile platforms and Microsoft's Kinect -- objects sail across the screen and you casually use the stylus to cut them into halves and quarters, earning points for each slice. Cake Ninja adds some extra ninja tools to the design as power-ups -- like throwing stars that bounce around the screen to earn extra cuts for you -- and the game seems to be proud of the fact it's knocking off Fruit Ninja, as the only object in the game that gives you a penalty for slicing it is a watermelon. But that's all Cake Ninja offers -- one game mode for single players, and competing against yourself for higher scores is the only motivation to keep playing. There is a two-player mode, but it requires both players to download the game separately -- and at five bucks a copy, that's not too advisable. CLOSING COMMENTS So let yourself be amused by the fact that a video game now exists that's based on a ninja going berserk in a kitchen because his wife got fat. Then move along to more original and more fleshed-out options vying for your eShop cash.
