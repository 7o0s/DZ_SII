Through its Galaxy line of phones, Samsung made sure that there was an Android phone for everyone and at its peak in 2013, Samsung held a 65% market share amongst Android phones. But a lot has changed in the past couple of years- phone manufacturers have changed, consumers have changed and phones have changed. Samsung realised that what had worked for them with the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy S4 wasnt enough with the Galaxy S5 even though it was bigger and better version of its predecessors in every way. So when creating the Galaxy S6, Samsung decided to go back to the drawing board and redesign its flagship product. And at MWC, we were introduced to the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. With us today, we have the Samsung Galaxy S6. Design One of the criticism that Samsung has received on a continuous basis is the use of plastic on its flagship products. But with the Alpha line released last year, we started seeing Samsung experiment with premium finishes. The Galaxy S6 is instantly recognisable as a Samsung phone and has been built ground-up to compete with any luxurious handset currently available. Although the front and the back is distinctively Samsung, the rounded metallic band and the edges resembles a device that came out of Cupertino a few months back. Measuring 143.4 x 70.5 and weighing just 138g, the Samsung Galaxy S6 fits really well in your hands and is deceitfully light. Its also very thin at just 6.8mm. Samsung has kept the screen to body ratio quite high with thin bezels on each side. Both the front and the back are made of glass with a metal frame surrounding the body with rounded edges. Its available in three colors at launch- black, white and gold. Samsung has used Gorilla Glass 4 in construction of the Galaxy S6 while the aluminium band is made of the same material that is used in aircraft construction. While the glass feels great, its also a fingerprint magnet, especially the gold version. The volume buttons are placed on the left while the power button sits on the right along with the SIM tray. Samsung finally moves to the nano SIM format with the Galaxy S6. At the bottom, you have the single speaker along with the 3.5mm audio jack and the USB connector. On the front, you still have the clickable home button which also houses a fingerprint sensor. Features In the past, Samsung has tried to make its flagship phone as feature rich as possible which have sometimes resulted in a questionable decisions. But with the Galaxy S6, Samsung has gotten serious and is only highlighting features that truly make the device shine out. The first of which is the Quad-HD 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screen. I dont think Ive seen a better screen on a phone. With a pixel density of 577 PPI, the Samsung Galaxy S6 outclasses just about everything else. Text is razor sharp and the unlocking water bubble effect is about as real as it can get. The second killer feature of the Samsung Galaxy S6 is integrated wireless charging that supports both Qi and PMA wireless charging formats. Samsung provided us with a wireless charger for this review which has a nice blue glow to show the unit is charging and green when its done. While wireless charging has been present in phones, its good to see a phone like the Galaxy S6 support it as this drive the industry faster towards making this a standard. Coming to the sound produced by the Galaxy S6, this is one area that Samsung still needs to work at. Very much like the iPhone, you have just one speaker present next to the charging connector and covering it will completely muffle the sounds from your Galaxy S6. Older features such as heart rate sensor as also present on the Galaxy S6, however, some might miss the lack of a microSD slot and the removable battery. Specs and Performance Unlike the previous flagship phones by Samsung, the Galaxy S6 does not use Qualcomms latest processors. Instead, Samsung is going all out with its own Exynos processor. While Samsung has used the Exynos in previous models, here in the Middle East, weve only seen the Qualcomm model. With the Exynos 7420, Samsung felt comfortable enough to stop relying on Qualcomm and youll see why in the benchmarks below. Besides the industrys first 14nm Octa-core processor, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is also equipped with super fast DDR4 RAM, again a first for mobiles. Built-in storage starts at 32GB and goes all the way to 128GB so you wont be missing the microSD slot much. We ran our usual AnTuTu benchmark on the Galaxy S6 and the result was a new record for our labs by a longshot. To give you an idea, the HTC One M9 that we recently reviewed that is powered by Qualcomms latest Snapdragon 810 processor scored just over 50000 making the Galaxy S6 over 20% faster. The Galaxy S6 almost takes all lag away from the phone and ran butter smooth. Camera The camera of the Galaxy S6 is probably my favourite feature of the device. Samsung has used a 16MP sensor which by no means is the largest but getting to the camera is as easy as double pressing the home key no matter where you are- even from the lock screen. The camera opens up almost immediately- Samsung claims a 0.7 second launch time and this is achieved by keeping the camera app on standby at all time. Once in the camera app, I wish that Samsung had implemented pressing on the home button to take a picture as well as that just feels a natural extension to the double tap but you need to use the onscreen button for that. The picture quality produced by the Samsung Galaxy S6 is also extremely impressive. I wont go as far as saying that it produces the best photos out of any phone Ive tested, but it is right up there with the best. What I will say is the convenience and speed of getting to the camera along with the picture quality produces the best camera experience out of any smartphone Ive tested. Here are some pictures I took with the Galaxy S6 across different environments. And these are all on Auto mode. The Galaxy S6 also shoots good video, however, the OIS could use a bit of improvement. Here is a small video I shot up-close to an anthill following the lovely sand storm in Dubai. Battery Life With the Galaxy S6, Samsung drops the user replaceable battery found on all of the previous model. Not only that but the battery of the Galaxy S6 is lower in capacity when compared to the Galaxy S6. Add a Quad HD screen to the mix and things start looking shaky. Thankfully some optimisations brought about between a mix of software and hardware make the Galaxy S6 last you longer than youd think it would. First of all, Googles Android 5.0 Lollipop is much better on the battery than previous versions and that, added with the Samsung Exynos 7420 processor helps out with the battery life. Throw in Samsungs battery saver mode and the ability to get almost four hours on a 10 minute charge, and you have a phone that could last you an entire day. For the quick charge to work, you need to use the Samsung supplied charger. I used the Samsung Galaxy S6 for five days and the results I got from the battery were different in all these days. The first couple of days were the hardest on the device which is somewhat expected as your apps and data are syncing and youre playing more than expected with the device. During these two days, my battery would deplete by 5PM. The following two days proved to be better and I was almost making it through to 9PM. The last day was the weekend so I was mostly at home all day and the device lasted me until I went to bed. Pros Brilliant Camera ExperienceFastest Phone We've TestedSupports Wireless Charging Cons OIS Not as EffectiveLack of MicroSD SlotUnpredictable Battery On paper, the Samsung Galaxy S6 might not appear as a great update to the Galaxy S5. It loses the water-proofing, doesnt have an expandable MicroSD card and has a smaller battery which is not removable. But all that becomes irrelevant as soon as you pick up the phone and start playing with it. The build quality and design as well as the screen and camera are aspects of the device that will instantly impress you. Its a phone that you feel Samsung has made with passion and one thats very easy to fall in love with. <br><br><hr><em> This article was original published on our sister website, <a href=~http://www.tbreak.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-review/~>Tbreak.com</a></em>", "date": "April 6, 2015,"}
