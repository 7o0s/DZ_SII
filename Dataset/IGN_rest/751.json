I'm currently halfway to level 53 (out of a new cap of 60), and I'd probably be much further along if it weren't for a nasty sting I received from a striped bark scorpion on Friday morning. Now here's the catch  the vast majority of that time has been spent slogging through old content from before the Heavensward expansion. That's right! In order to even play the new Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward content or even try out the three new jobs of Dark Knight, Astrologian, and Machinist, you need to play through the entire main storyline from the launch of the game up until the 2.55 patch that was released just last April. (Check out the quest titles: I was on page 5 when I started.) Keep in mind that this romp includes much more than the usual business of watching cutscenes and teleporting all the way across the continent just to read two lines from a white-haired kid in tights; it also means jumping into several four- and eight-man dungeons and trials that range from the ridiculously simple to those requiring considerable feats of coordination. This is a bold move on Square Enix's part, and I'm not sure I like it. Most MMORPG developers treat expansions as a hard reset of sorts, aimed at bringing players back who may have gotten bored with current content or didn't like the theme (think World of Warcraft's Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor shift). They shuffle players to that content as quickly as they can, particularly if those characters are already at the pre-expansion level cap. Square Enix, on the other hand, wants to make sure you've seen everything thats been added while you've been gone. Heading into this expansion, I originally felt bad that I hadn't stuck around for long after my original FFXIV: A Realm Reborn review because I couldn't keep up with my friends' raid schedule, but after what I've been through this week, I feel like I've seen everything I missed aside from those raids themselves. I can see the allure of this design, and it has its bonuses. Heading into the new realm of Ishgard, I'm now playing my Bard at peak level as though I never left, and I'm well-versed again in all the lore and minutiae, like crafting and using cosmetic gear. Challenging dungeons like the Steps of Faith, in which I had to man cannons and activate snares in order to stop a dragon before it reached a set of gates, ensured that I once again knew how to function in FFXIV's groups. This is all great now, especially while so many people are leveling new classes and the servers and dungeon queues are crammed with people excited about the expansion. But I worry that new players, or those like myself who left and are now returning, will find all this annoying to trudge through all this in a couple of weeks or months, perhaps even to the point of bowing out before they even reach the expansion they came to see. Already some of my queue times for specific story-related missions are lasting longer than 20 minutes, and I don't think it'll be long before they push past half an hour. (I hear you can lessen these by choosing all gameplay language options, but I like to be able to ask my group for advice on strategies.) At least trials like the Steps of Faith are relevant to the story; other group requirements seem like they should have been pulled prior to Heavensward's launch. Many hours into my journey, for instance, I came cross a main story quest called Good Intentions that was locked off because I hadn't done three hard-mode dungeons. Sure, okay, I love me some dungeon running... but the problem is that it gave me no clue as to where even to find the quests to unlock these dungeons, and in the end I only found those answers through Google and by sniffing through some forums. That sort of approach was fine when this was new content that was released in patches with months in between them, and subscribing players undoubtedly picked up and finished the quests in their spare time. When we're just experiencing the story leading up to Heavensward, though, it's a superfluous nuisance, and I shudder to think of what such hurdles must feel like for players who are leveling through FFXIV for the first time. I understand why Square Enix wants us to see this story, I do. By the time the credits rolled at the end of the vanilla content, I realized I cared more for the main NPC characters in this game than I do for anyone I'd come across in Final Fantasy XIII. Final Fantasy XIV's use of well-scripted cutscenes and good writing means it gets the story side of things oh-so-right, and in a way that should make most other MMORPG developers hang their heads in shame. If my crash course though the latter-day content has taught me anything, it's that the quality of storytelling has only improved since launch, and I'm hoping Square maintains that momentum through Heavensward. Above all, the main story is of utmost importance for understanding why you're going to Ishgard in the first place. Still, I wonder if much of that could have been explained in a series of cutscenes, thus allowing us to avoid the hours of often-silly story-driven imperatives to trot out to one spot, look around, and then ride your chocobo all the way back. I admit with some shame that I skipped an awful lot of cutscenes early on for the sake of speed; had I not, I might still be sitting here playing through old content instead of writing this update. At least let people access the new Dark Knight, Machinist, and Astrologian jobs if they have a level 50 character, Square Enix! Since you need to level the new jobs from 30 to 60 through the old content, it seems silly to also force us to experience all the old story content beforehand. Dang, Leif, I can hear some of you saying, that's a lot of ink to spill on that subject. And it's true, it is. But this is the stuff that's going to be hitting new or returning players in the face, and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're in one of those crowds. It also strikes me as strange since this is a group- and guild-focused MMORPG where personal interaction still matters, and it seems counterproductive to keep players away from the bulk of the new action for so long. I'm willing to entertain the idea that this is all by design. I've noticed that several colleagues and guild members claim that Heavensward has too many ~leveling gaps~ between story quests that need to be filled with side quests or by grinding dynamic ~FATE~ events, but since I'm sitting at level 53, I can't help but wonder if all that experience from the old story quests will help me avoid the same fate. Perhaps, in other words, Square Enix accounted for those gaps after all--it just wasn't the loyal players they had in mind. As for the expansion itself? It looks good. There are big, gothic, snowy towers that look like they crept in from Bloodborne without the more frightening beasties, and an entire zone filled with floating rocks that recalls both Avatar's Pandora and World of Warcraft's Outland. I like it, although what I've seen so far from the questing and gameplay perspectives seems like more of the same aside from some quirks such as flying mounts. At this point, I kind of believe that's a good thing, although it seems a waste in light of the massive amount of new features Square packed in when they resculpted XIV as A Realm Reborn.
