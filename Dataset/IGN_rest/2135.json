Which is exactly why Ive always liked Xiaomis Black Shark line of gaming phones. You get a handset thats just as powerful as the Asus ROG Phone or Razer Phone 2, but at a much lower price. The Black Shark 2 builds on the value of its predecessor, introducing more powerful specs plus an even longer lasting battery for just $529. Although it doesnt feature fancy functions like the ROG Phone 2s Air Triggers or a 120Hz display, this is still a great gaming phone for most people. While the Black Shark 2 has been succeeded by the Black Shark 2 Pro, Xiaomi's latest gaming phone seems to be very elusive and rarely seen on available anywhere compared to this older model. Xiaomi Black Shark 2  Design The Black Shark 2 isnt subtle. Its thick metal phone that feels far more robust than all the modern glass-backed flagship smartphones we have today. The back of the Black Shark 2 is fully aluminum with a mix of matte of mirrored finishes. Theres also a flurry of chamfered edges within chamfered edges in what I can only describe as a series of bow ties. The overall design is still more sophisticated and less in your face than other gaming phones on the market. Its also pretty pleasant to hold, as the large array of chamfered edges are placed exactly where your fingers end up cradling the device. Although the Black Shark 2 doesnt feel fragile in hand, its not waterproof or splashproof at all, which is a little disappointing. Of course, the Black Shark 2 wouldnt be gaming phone without at least some RGB lighting. Youll find it on three illumination zones including the small S logo on the back which you can set to display a rainbow of colors. The other two lighting zones are found on two strips at the sides of the device, which sadly only light up from red to green as you recharge the device. Its a bit of a waste. Around front you get a pretty sizable 6.39 inch AMOLED display with a 1,080 x 2,340 resolution and 90Hz refresh rate. Its not quite as fast or HDR-ready as the Asus ROG Phone 2, but the Black Shark does a more than decent job of displaying consistently crisp frames of action. Not to mention the 90Hz display also makes the whole Android phone experience look more fluid. The Black Shark 2 also isnt rocking one of the latest bezel-less curved displays either. Instead the top and bottom bezels are almost a full centimeter thick. There are also sizable side bezels between the black border and the actual edge of the phone. At least you get two front firing stereo speakers located at the top and bottom of the device. Theres a fingerprint sensor hidden under the display that lights up with a neat little circuitry pattern when activated. In my couple of weeks using the device it worked reliably except when my fingers were slightly wet or greasy. Xiaomi Black Shark 2  Gaming and Performance The Black Shark 2 I tested comes rocking a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor with 256GB of storage and 6GB of memory. With all this power in tow, this phone absolutely plows through anything I threw its way. When it comes to gaming, PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty: Mobile run more smoothly on this device than your typical phone all thanks to a little bit of more memory. The Black Shark also has an integrated liquid cooled system paired with a copper shield and a multi-layer graphite film. All of this helps keep the phone cool and performing well during gameplay sessions. Not only does this phone have a built-in gaming mode but also a dedicated physical switch to turn in on. Dubbed the (sigh) Shark Space, activating this feature clears all your available memory and brings up a secondary launch that lets you swipe through your library with a console-like user interface. While in game you can drag down diagonally from either the top-left or top-right corners of the display to open an extra tray of gaming settings. This OSD menu gives you some extra options to manually clear your system memory, turn on a frame rate counter, see your system performance, and most importantly activate the MasterTouch feature. The MasterTouch feature essentially allows you map two pressure sensitive zones to act as touch click zones. So, while youre using either side of the phone as a virtual joystick, you can also press harder to activate another command. In both Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG Mobile, I had the left zone activate aim down sights and I would click in on the right side to fire. MasterTouch works really well because you can do more without lifting your thumbs off the screen to perform another action. You also get a bit of haptic feedback that feels satisfying too. The sold-separately GamePad controllers also help sell the Black Shark 2 as a true gaming phone. The version I received for testing costs $89 with a case, but it feels like an essential accessory for this device. Unlike most controllers you dont get twin sticks here, but rather a left joystick paired with a right touchpad, which makes it a bit like the Steam Controller. I was never a fan of Valves dual touchpad controller, but Black Sharks arrangement here makes more sense as the right-side touchpad perfectly emulates using the phones actual touchscreen for aiming. All too often, mobile controllers have poorly tuned joystick sensitivities and dead zones that rotate your view too quickly. Thats not an issue with this touchpad, which can discern small movements for precise aim or fast swipes to perform a 180-degree turn. The controllers are Bluetooth, so they run on their own batteries and wont drain your phone. Since the Black Shark Gamepads are completely wireless, you can either slip them onto the sides of the phone using its accompanying case or just hold them like a pair of Joy Cons. Pressing the button at the bottom of the right controller brings up button mapping and you can truly customize your entire setup by assigning every button to a touch zone or command, allowing you to customize your inputs to work with any game featuring virtual on-screen buttons. Xiaomi Black Shark 2  Camera Mobile photography really isnt what I would imagine doing with a gaming phone, but if thats what youre looking for from the Black Shark 2, I think youll be pleased with the results. The Black Shark 2 sports two main cameras: a 48MP wide camerareally 12MP after pixel binning every four pixels into one big one to capture more lightand 12MP telephoto camera with a 2x zoom. Theres also a front-facing 20MP camera for selfies. One of the first things you might notice about my shots taken with the Black Shark 2 is theyre really sharpalmost overly sharp in some cases. At the same time theres also some artificial bokeh in some of the images that mostly looks natural, but terrible in certain cases. All of this image treatment comes from the cameras built in A.I. optimizations. The image processing can look a bit heavy-handed at times, but I liked the way my pictures looked with enhancements more often than not. Just be sure to turn off the device watermark, otherwise every single picture you take will say Shot on Black Shark 2 AI Dual Camera like my image samples do. Which also makes me wonder why would anyone ever want this watermark in the first place? Xiaomi Black Shark 2  Battery Life The Black Shark 2 comes with one of the biggest batteries available in a smartphone at 4,000mAh, allowing it to easily last through a day even with some intense mobile gaming sprinkled in. Unfortunately, with the metal back on this phone you cant get wireless charging. However, the Black Shark 2 supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0, which allows you to get back 60% of your battery life after plugging in the handset for just 30 minutes. The Black Shark 2 gives you almost everything you want in a gaming phoneor even a high-end phonefor an affordable price. It offers high-performance power, longer than all-day battery life, a large screen, and useful gaming features. This phone wont really do anything to wow you, but it also doesnt have any glaring flaws. The Black Shark 2 is just a solid handset that offers a lot for its price.", "date": "Nov. 5, 2019,"}
