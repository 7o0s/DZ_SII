Like its Templars and Assassins, who are locked in a never-ending struggle for relics, each game picks a side in the question of how strongly should it lean into its now-convoluted ancient lore and incorporate the still-underdeveloped present-day elements. Assassins Creed: Syndicate chooses wisely, leaves out multiplayer entirely, and pushes a lot of that baggage into the background, largely freeing itself up to make the most of Victorian London and have fun with sneaking, climbing, and stabbing. Sibling Rivalry Syndicate smartly negotiates this internal conflict by dramatising it in the form of its twin playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye. The former is a devout Assassin, intent on stopping the Templars by tracking down the remaining pieces of Eden. Her brother Jacob, however, is a pragmatist  a social reformer who rails against the Assassins burdensome legacy and wishes to help his city in more immediate ways, seemingly embodying my desire to move on from the tangled mysticism. Theyre both extremely likeable, well-drawn protagonists, and the interaction between the two is laced with a lively sibling rivalry that brings levity to otherwise-earnest cutscenes. But their contrasting worldviews have the greatest positive impact on Syndicates structure, which is both engaging and meaningful. You can freely switch between Jacob and Evie at most points, with side missions and open-world activities open equally to both. Campaign missions, however, are different, with Jacob taking the lead in the majority of the core assassinations. This is frustrating, especially since Evie is pitched as the more stealthy of the pair. But I soon realised that Syndicate is just not that interested in exploring forgotten tombs in search of dusty relics; it wants to liberate the great city of London from its terrible oppressors. And to be blunt, Syndicates a much better experience for identifying more closely with the goals of Jacob. Despite being sidelined so often, Evie comes across as the more nuanced character, struggling with her sense of duty, where Jacob is a more straightforward bloke with clear goals. By the end of the 20-hour campaign, I felt like Id probably spent more time with Evie due to prefering her in side missions, and I certainly knew her better. She sees the bigger picture, with her missions tackling problems Jacob cant even comprehend. Evie also stars in my favourite assassination mission  a nighttime infiltration of the Tower of London. Given their differences, I was disappointed with how similar Jacob and Evie are to play. They each possess three high-level abilities designed around their supposed strengths of stealth and combat, respectively  Evie can effectively become invisible when stationary, for example, while Jacob can string together longer combos. But the rest of the abilities are identical. At first, I exaggerated the differences by investing all of Evies points into the stealth skill tree and Jacobs into combat, thinking I could switch between the two depending on the situation. But since you cant switch between characters within campaign missions, thats not a viable approach. In one mission, I was playing as Jacob and it wouldve been really useful to unlock a specific door to make a quick escape, but because Id only unlocked advanced lockpicking for Evie  who was unavailable  I had to take a longer, more hazardous route out of the building. The Jewel in the Crown Ah, London in 1868, it was a bustling, heavily industrialised city, the heart of an unprecedented Empire. It feels like a different type of place to those Assassins Creed has visited in the past. The churches of Rome and Paris give way to Londons glistening train stations and infernal factories, its cathedrals to industry and progress. Its not an exact replica  the map is nipped and tucked, bringing some landmarks closer together  but on the whole it feels like London, especially key areas like Trafalgar Square and the Palace of Westminster. At first, I thought it was fairly ugly  a smear of brown and grey  but it slowly yields its charms. The slums are caked in mud and thousands of chimneys spew forth thick black smoke, but theres a kind of beauty when you see it blot the sky at dusk. Similarly, walking around the foggy streets of central London by gaslight is wonderfully atmospheric. And after Unity's troubled release, it's worth stating I encountered no noteworthy bugs or performance issues. But London is also well-represented in a mechanical sense. Jacobs effort to free the city from the Templars who control it is accomplished by slowly building up a gang, known as the Rooks, by deposing small-time Templars who control various districts within the seven boroughs. Most of the activities in the open-world, outside of side quests, contribute towards this goal, and as a consequence a lot of the optional activities feel more meaningful and less like filler. It feels like youre chipping away at the enemy, clawing back parts of the city. Similarly, you can stifle the enemy in other ways, like bribing the police or controlling the docks. Admittedly, these gang upgrades are simply purchased through a sterile menu, but they convey the notion of the 19th-century city as a complex organism. The campaign missions achieve something similar, with each target occupying a slightly different sphere of influence, including the worlds of science, politics, and finance. Even though it positions the devious Crawford Starrick behind everything, it effectively conveys the idea of corruption and control being diffused across different systems. A Side of Dickens It all sounds rather serious, but Syndicate is also the silliest Assassins instalment in quite some time. It shows a real delight in ransacking its rich Victorian setting for fun stuff to do. There are so many amusing missions, from tracking down hallucinogenic orchids for Charles Darwin to retrieving the lapdog of Benjamin Disraelis wife in the Devils Acre, the most dangerous part of London. Early on, you can dress up Jacob as Sherlock Holmes, don Cthulhu-inspired tentacular brass knuckles, and hunt down occultists with Charles Dickens. Whats not to love about that sentence? The Charles Dickens side-missions are definitely my favourites. You accompany the great novelist to expose fraudsters, catch hypnotists, visit the most haunted house in London, and even have a supernatural encounter of your own. Its Syndicate at its most consistently engaging, eccentric, and playful, which makes the terrible ending all the more baffling. What were they thinking? Its entirely at odds with what the story has been about, mired in the dense, po-faced lore it spends the best part of 25 hours trying its best to forget about. Assassin's Bones Inside the mostly entertaining and lively packaging, however, what youre being asked to do feels very familiar. Missions almost always involve the traditional Assassins Creed staples of following, escorting, or killing people and/or stealing items, but Syndicates characters and situations do more than enough to stave off boredom. The most prominent new mechanic is the grapple-gun, and on the whole, its well implemented and fun to use. Its ratcheting mechanism prevents you from turning into Batman; its not possible to zip around London at high speed or glide, but it allows you get negotiate wider roads without coming down to street level, and reach Londons higher rooftops with ease. When youre on the ground, carriages can be stolen at any time, and provide a helpful way to cover more ground since Londons a big place, around a third bigger than Unitys take on Paris. They dont feel particularly fast or exciting to drive, but they handle much better than I was expecting. The latest iteration of Assassins Creed combat, on the other hand, looks fast-paced and attractive  the sword cane became a favourite, thanks to its delightfully brutal finishers  but got a touch repetitive by the time I was through. It would also be nice to have more non-lethal ways to subdue others, especially in a setting that introduces the police as a hostile but ultimately well-meaning obstacle that I didnt feel good about having to kill. Technology dominates the era, but Alexander Graham-Bell  the eras Da Vinci  doesnt have much to offer your arsenal outside of an electrical grenade which is effective at incapacitating large groups of enemies but draws far too much attention. And if youre wondering if this is the year when Assassins Creed finally fixes its long-standing problems with your character accidentally grabbing the wrong ledge or climbing the wrong wall, it sadly has not. But free-running as good here as its ever been. Pros Focussed, fun storyDickens side-missionsThe city of London Cons Bad endingRepetitive combat Assassins Creed Syndicate is the most fun Ive had with an Assassins game since Black Flag. In fact, I liked it more. Apart from its ill-fitting conclusion, it never takes itself too seriously and delights in the rich possibilities of its Victorian setting and great new grapple gun. As you explore its contrasting boroughs, you glean some sense of what powered this great city in the 19th century. The story missions capitalise on this by exploring different spheres of influence, which when combined with elements like mass transit, heavy industry, and law enforcement, make this feel like a different type of city than has been featured in the series to date. Best of all, Syndicate asks you to take London back in a way puts the last few games to shame.", "date": "Oct. 22, 2015,"}
