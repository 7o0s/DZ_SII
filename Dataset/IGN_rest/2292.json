But in the context of a video game, it needs some extra energy. A pizazz. An added enthusiasm, even if its when browsing a menu, just to keep it from becoming something you can sleepwalk through. PGA Tour 2K23 lacks that. Its silent, its calm, its bland, its so proper. PGA Tour 2K23 (PS5) . . 260.00 See it  PGA Tour 2K23 (and previously, PGA Tour 2K21) was born of HB Studios fanatically accurate simulation The Golf Club, and the change in name hasnt changed much about the underlying philosophy behind it. The actual shot mechanisms, ball physics, and standard frustration when sinking into a bunker retain their dazzling authenticity, and yet, even with a year off between editions to rethink things, HB Studios has produced another plain, stuffy, elitist golf sim with as much personality as a white polo shirt. 2K23 makes minor strides towards loosening up the pomposity, but lands inches from dropping in the cup. 2K brings the points-based FedEx Cup into focus as the central career goal. Thats fine, although the PGA draws more attention for the Masters, US Open, and other high-profile events  the stuff EA licensed in the past for its golf projects. PGA Tour 2K23 doesnt have those, or their most famous courses, like Augusta National. That means the career mode feels like filler as it works around licensing restrictions and takes us through second-tier courses like the Detroit Golf Club and TPC Southwind. Thats an issue when its the primary way to play, and here there arent a lot of other options. The career mode feels like filler as it works around licensing restrictions and takes us through second-tier courses. Taking to the course, the major publisher influence from 2K becomes evident. Theres an effort to streamline things, including an optional three-click swing system. Thats new, but brutally difficult to master, and not the accessible feature that was expected. This method involves holding the swing button to set power, releasing to begin a spinning meter that needs to be stopped twice to determine swing accuracy. If youre anything like me you can expect botched shots on the regular before reverting to the smooth, clean, and precise analog stick swing. HB Studios mastered this analog method, thankfully. Other golf games have tried  and even succeeded in their own ways  but HBs quest to mimic the feel and challenge of a real club pays off. Its an appropriately fragile existence off the tee or from the fairway, as stick speed dictates a slice or hook. Even when well practiced, the possibility always remains to botch a shot  as it should be. Plus, 2K23 adds needed shot types like punches to squeeze the ball under hazards, furthering PGA Tours repertoire and strategy. Selectable golfers include NBA stars Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Theres an attempt to add charisma to this series, but it comes across as half-hearted. Selectable golfers include cover star Tiger Woods and other known PGA names, but also celebrities like NBA stars Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. In the equipment section, a hockey stick is offered as a putter choice, giving necessary nods to Happy Gilmore. Thats it though, and those celebrity players exist only in side modes or versus play. Say what you will about the defunct Tiger Woods PGA Tour series, but maintaining golfs central appeal while driving with Happy Gilmores walk-up swing was a delight, with no gameplay cost. Theres also TopGolf, a party-esque challenge founded in 2000. Now its digital, and a passable substitute for when short on time with friends, if also an uneventful target practice event unlikely to earn any long-term engagement. What We Said About PGA Tour 2K21 PGA Tour 2K21 is the most flexible and enjoyable golf game since EAs Tiger Woods series was at its peak. While its career mode could have done with some spit and polish to its presentation and featured more meaningful rewards, it nonetheless serves as a solid 20-hour straightaway to what could prove to be the most thriving part of PGA Tour 2K21s dance floor in the long term; the online societies. As far as establishing a new sports franchise goes (on the shoulders of the three Golf Club games that came before) this might not be the strongest shot off the tee, but its ended up in a very playable lie.  Tristan Ogilvie, August 20, 2020 Score: 7 Read the full PGA Tour 2K21 review Likely, the most time people are going to spend with PGA Tour 2K23 will be with the career, mostly because thats almost all thats offered. Theres one goal (FedEx), one play style, and outside of exhibitions, nothing else to do for solo golfers. Brief (usually) one-event rivalries using a Stableford scoring system bring the slightest additional drama. Local and online versus adds small variety like two-on-two match-ups and skins play. Thats something. Between matches the deepening RPG side offers incremental skill upgrades. Some offer easier swing timing, others accuracy, or better work out of bunkers. Leveling requires tiered decision making as each club type is individually boosted, and opportunities grow in tandem alongside the custom golfers XP meter. In a reversal of HB Studios usual philosophy, clubs themselves matter. Not just the clubs, but every boost to them, which are acquirable after winning events. A +3 club shaft of power matched with a +2 grip of shot shaping can form a credible weapon  err, piece of sporting equipment. Given PGA Tour 2K23s demanding swing precision, even a tiny boost to accuracy or timing will reduce risks, and thats appreciated. Its a notably game-y idea for what is otherwise such a deep simulation though, and purchasing actual clubs makes no difference. Only the part boosts do. The quality of its attempt to recreate the atmosphere of televised golf is dismal. Moving toward the FedEx Cup means dealing with HB Studios weak point: The dismal quality of its attempt to recreate the atmosphere of televised golf. Its not bad so much as utterly broken in places. Commentators make the wrong calls regularly, such as failing to identify when a ball is or isnt on the green or whether its trailing left or right. Attempts to show replays from earlier in the tournament take excessive time to load in this era of SSDs (and chug further when trying to reach the server sometimes), and when they do show up they frequently dont actually show anything. Rather than following the ball, these snippets stay on the golfer reacting to an unseen shot, but at least the character models justify that lingering attention. Coming from 2K, whose emulation of NBA broadcasts set a best-in-class example, PGA Tour 2K23s non-functional delivery annoyed more than helped once I got past the first matchs introduction. As a side note, the orchestral music playing over the menus painfully adds to the idea of golf being a dull, elitist game. There was room for PGA 2K23 to build energy while maintaining its status, but it didn't take a single opportunity to do so. The recurring course creator lets people give PGA Tour 2K23 the spark if they so want it. That also helps fill in the course selections holes  someone will render an accurate Pebble Beach in no time (with titles like, Pebbles on the Beach Golf Course), although as I played before release there was nothing available to download yet. That said, trying to build something offers a pleasant, easy-to-use menu system flush with choices. Better, everything is open from the outset, meaning theres no need to unlock items to fill the spaces. Yes, a crocodile hiding out by hole 9s green is just as much an option as placing a hotel on 16. Microtransaction Reaction Worried about the 2K label and its push for you to spend actual cash on virtual currency? Thankfully, this pressure isnt as intrusive as in NBA 2K, and even though the in-game currency gains are absurdly small given the shops prices  unless clothing matters to you  theres limited need to worry about it for now. Rewards are handed out frequently to keep leveling throughout the season, and since XP gains/club boosts are not for sale, everything is cosmetic. Even after a year off, PGA Tour 2K23 returns offering minimal progress from its preceding, prior-generation edition. A new three-click swing is an unforgiving mess, its somehow worse at emulating the look and feel of televised golf, and the few spurts of personality thatve been layered on cant counter developer HB Studios penchant for preserving pro golfs elitism above all, or the apparent terror of breaking from that form. At least PGA Tour 2K23 can define itself through the properly challenging golf sim at its heart and the barebones career mode that stands all but alone in its menus.", "date": "Oct. 15, 2022,"}
