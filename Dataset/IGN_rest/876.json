But while jamming an active spectacle of color into an Xbox One controller is indeed a very superficial addition, at least it's a pretty good one in the case of the PowerA Spectra. The Spectra cycles through 15 different colors in an impressively fluid and bright sequence. The translucent metallic center panel offers one light source, while another shines through the dots on the front grips (and the analog stick bases). Each is separately controllable with small buttons on the back of the controller (along with a brightness selector), and if the color morphing is too much, you can switch to a simple alternating option that swaps through the available colors sans animation. Or if you'd rather just have static colors shine through, you can pick any color combination you'd like, or just use one light source and not the other. What seems like it would be a chintzy and perhaps lame effect is actually really well-executed, almost coming off like a slick music visualizer built into your gamepad. It doesn't actually react to the gameplay or vibrationsthat would be one heck of a fun gimmickbut it's nicely subtle, given that it's a glaring light show in your hands. Also surprising is just how similar the PowerA Spectra is to the official Xbox One controller in overall design, feel, and build quality. There are subtle differences: the back grips are raised slightly outward, which makes it feel a bit fuller in your palms. Additionally, the d-pad has a slightly more rigid feel to it, but it works well and feels just fine for a fighter like Killer Instinct. PowerA Spectra: Essential Stats Manufacturer PowerA Price $50 Connectivity Wired Cord Length 9.8 feet Headset Port No Otherwise, the sticks and face buttons look and feel similar to the official pads, and while the shoulder buttons and triggers have slightly different shapes, I didn't notice any real difference in action. One note, however: the first controller that I tested ended up having a sticky A button after a few days of regular use. I received a second unit and put it through its paces without repeating the issue, so I'm inclined to believe it isn't a widespread design or manufacturing defect. The Spectra is only available as a wired controller with a 9.8ft cable attached, which is probably for the best considering the extra power needs for the lighting. However, the Spectra doesn't have a port at the bottom for a headset or audio adaptera decision no doubt borne of technical needs, but one that rules it out as a primary option for online gamers. It could still be a good option for single-player games or as an extra pad for local multiplayer action, but the lack of headset support is a definite mark against it. Additionally, on both of the controllers tested, I noticed small nicks on the metallic core panel that were visible with lights engaged. On the first unit, it was a couple of small specks, while the second gamepad had a large scratchbut in both cases, they seemed to be inside the non-removable front plate, so there's not a whole lot you can do. They weren't hugely noticeable issues, but for gamers who prefer collector-quality goods, they may be difficult to unsee once spotted. Pros Cool lighting effectSturdy, responsive feelCheaper than official pad Cons No headset portIlluminated scuffs While the missing headset port will kill its chances with some gamers, anyone who likes a little flashiness in their accessories might really dig the Spectra. It's a well-made, third-party option that feels about as sturdy and reliable as the official pad, albeit with a glossy light show that's actually quite cool. And it's $10 cheaper than Microsoft's controller, so if you can deal with the headset omission and want to add some pizzazz to your Xbox One gaming setup, the Spectra is well worth a look.", "date": "Feb. 10, 2015,"}
