Hitman Episode 5: Colorado features none of the above; instead its set on a run-down, walled-off, and heavily guarded militia base in the muddy American countryside. The result is a satisfying enough change of pace (its a very different experience to the levels released to date) albeit one that seems at times itd be a little more comfortable with Tom Clancys name added to the title. Unlike the previous four missions the Colorado compound is entirely hostile and, save for a small posse of easily frightened computer hackers tucked away inside the main farmhouse, every NPC is armed (even the chef has an assault rifle slung over his shoulder as he slaves away over his stove). The only way to walk around in the open is in disguise; theres no hiding in plain sight amongst civilians because there arent any. If you dont want to rely on disguises pure stealth is the only other way. Combined with the fact there are four targets plus an additional objective, this is really the trickiest mission so far (and with so much slaying to schedule its also quite lengthy). Colorado leverages most of what the previous levels have taught us, so if your skills arent up to snuff you may want to bone up on your sneaking and distraction techniques. Colorado leverages most of what the previous levels have taught us. My chief gripe is that this episodes Military Shooter 101 farm map of muted browns and grimy greys is definitely the least interesting environment to date. Compared to previous levels  particularly Sapienza and Paris  Colorado is a lot less engaging. The established Hitman tropes and creative traps are all present and accounted for but  aesthetically speaking, at least  this domestic terrorist training camp looks more like something plucked from a Splinter Cell game or any number of other military-themed also-rans. Taken as a pivot from the previous missions its a decent enough diversion, and there are a few noteworthy moments like posing as a scarecrow, or mincing bodies in a hay baler. But stacked up against the most memorable missions the Hitman series has had to offer, Colorado is pretty forgettable. ~Hay! No more scarecrow puns, thanks. This is the last straw.~ Pleasantly, I did find it isnt quite as small as it first seemed, particularly once I began to really explore the sheds, orchard, and various other outbuildings. It is, however, all a bit gloomy and samey. Where previous levels have featured several zones within each that are quite distinct from one another, this Colorado farm is very homogeneous; no one part feels markedly different from the next. It also seems a bit less refined than the other missions so far. For instance, I noted when guards went into an alert state many elect to take up positions at the entrances to the orchard but, because they all root themselves in exactly the same spot, I ended up watching as multiple guards stood clipping through each other like a quartet of armed ghosts all standing on the same doormat. It is worth noting that, for the first time, the English voice acting here in Colorado doesnt feel incompatible with the setting. Colorado, then, is the first time Ive found myself able to appreciate the nuance of their conversations (the way NPCs react to your actions and communicate your description to other NPCs is impressive) rather than cringe at the horribly incongruous accents. Unfortunately the next and final level for this season, Tokyo, will probably be a different story. Developer IO also continues to tug on the seasons connecting plot thread in Colorado but Im still finding it impossible to get invested in a tale told in two minute bursts, six or so weeks apart. With no civilian aspect to the map at all, Hitman Episode 5: Colorado is a shift in gear from the previous four missions thats both refreshing and a disappointment. In a way its a nice change-up to the established formula to date but the drab and gloomy farm isnt an especially memorable environment. It is, however, the trickiest series of hits this season thanks to a big push for stealth, and probably the lengthiest episode so far.", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
