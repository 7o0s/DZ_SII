Theres a very meta scene in Cars 3 where Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), shown a room filled with gaudy merchandise bearing his likeness, declares hes not just a brand. Cars is a film series many dismiss as only existing to sell toys, and it feels like Pixar  under the guidance of director Brian Fee for this installment  was well aware of this perception and wanted to prove this movie had a bigger, story-driven reason for existing. And on that front theyve succeeded, delivering a much more nuanced, emotional journey for this series. The first teaser for the film brought about a lot of big (and humorous) reactions with its slow-mo shot of Lightning McQueen in a terrible crash. Was this sequel going to be about Lightning finding himself paralyzed? Or worse?! Well, no, and while that crash is a big moment early in the film, Lightning doesnt have any long-term physical effects from it. But it does reflect how damaged his psyche has become. And yes, I know that sounds bizarre for Cars 3, yet its true. The story beings with Lightning suddenly supplanted as the hotshot racer to beat on the circuit as a new generation of cars takes center stage, led by the flashy, formidable Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer). No matter what he tries, Lightning cant seem to outrace Jackson, and that crash sidelines him completely  and casts doubt on whether he can or should ever race again. But Lightning is determined to return to the sport he loves and begins getting ready, backed by a slick, ambitious sponsor, Sterling (Nathan Fillion), and with the help of an energetic trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo). Cars was a basic story about a naturally skilled but arrogant athlete learning about good sportsmanship, while Cars 2 was a spy caper. Both had their amusing moments, but neither had that weight Pixar usually brings to its stories. Cars 3, on the other hand, feels like its about something deeper. Lightnings story here is filled with allegory and metaphor, in that classic Pixar manner, as he is determined to end his career on his own terms, even as he has to acknowledge hes not what he once was. The set up makes it easy to assume Cars 3 is the Rocky III of the series  with Lightning meeting his match, taking a bad loss, and then fighting his way back to victory. But the film has more on its mind than that, taking a good, hard look at what its like to be an aging athlete (or any aging professional) who has to come to terms with not being the best anymore and that, at a certain point, someone new will supplant you. And it works! Lightning is a much more fully realized character here, and Wilsons folksy delivery captures the thoughtful, Am I really becoming the old guy? feeling hes is going through. Meanwhile, Lightnings dynamic with Cruz is great and easy to invest in, with Alonzo perfectly capturing her amusing mixture of enthusiasm and trepidation. Cars has always felt like the mostly for kids outlier for Pixar, without all of the elements that make most of their films truly family friendly and often just as  if not more so  engaging for adults as children. Cars 3 flips this in a big way. Not only is the main plotline about the films protagonist dealing with aging, but the ever-goofy, wacky, and often annoying Mater (Larry the Cable Guy)  who, to be fair, many kids adore  is very much sidelined in this film, almost completely written out of the middle portion of the story. Cruz essentially takes over his role as Lightnings buddy/partner, but with a much more emotionally stirring arc, as we learn about her own dashed hopes and dreams of what could have been. Will young kids still be as engaged this time out, even as the film will possibly resonate even more with those who grew up with the series? Hard to say, though I would hope they're still entertained by the humor and the energetic racing scenes, including a trip to the Cars-universe version of a demolition derby. As the story progresses, you can begin to predict where its likely going  but its certainly not the basic Lightning and Mater have another adventure! path Cars 3 could have been. And even as I began to suspect how things might turn out, they didnt do so exactly in the way I predicted, as the story includes a couple of fun curveballs. Cars 3 still has some off moments and the humor is hit or miss, though there are some very funny scenes. Also on the downside, it's surprising how un-nuanced Jackson Storm is, whos a very one-note antagonist with zero layers, delivering one condescending line after another to Lightning. On top of that, Cars 3 still has the innate oddness of being about talking cars in a world made only of cars. While Pixar has so deftly invested us in talking toys, monsters, emotions (!) and more, the Cars films have a strange distancing factor, and even as I think people go a bit overboard in their amusing But how does this universe work?! rants, I still get why that topic comes up so much. Its a weird world, filled with moments that can easily give you pause or take you out of the story for a second. Theres a scene where a character mentions getting letters from another, and I found myself wondering, Wait, how do cars write letters? Little kids, who adore this franchise (and make its merchandise so lucrative), clearly arent hung up on this, but its still present for adults here  even as its impressive that this particular story manages to be one adults can finally invest in. There are some typically impressive Pixar visuals, with the scenes of the cars racing looking better than ever  and often eerily realistic, such as when youre watching them from afar or behind and dont see those eyes where the headlights should be. One scene on a beach where Lightning and Cruz are training is particularly lovely, featuring gorgeous-looking waves in the background as the two cars zoom along the sand. Its also notable how much Cars 3 functions as a direct sequel to the original Cars. Cars 2 is utterly ignored, with none of the characters introduced in that film returning, nor any of its events having any importance. On the other hand, the first films Doc Hudson is incredibly important here, after Cars 2 only had a couple of minor references to him having passed away. (Paul Newman died in real life after the first film was made.) In this story, though, as Lightning ponders his future he spends a lot of time thinking about Doc, and we actually get pieces of Docs backstory from the first film fleshed out in a much bigger way  voice recordings of Newman done for the first film are stirringly used several times. Its notably effective and what occurs here actually helped me retroactively like the first Cars a bit more. Cars 3 may not be among the best films Pixar has made, but its definitely the best film in the Cars series and the first to feel worthy of the Pixar label. Its got more on its mind than simply being about Lightning trying to win a race and is the first Cars film likely to truly resonate with a larger audience beyond the kids who love it already. While it feels like it could use a more nuanced antagonist and is hit or miss in the comedy realm, theres a nice sense of closure here, too, which would make this a perfect and redemptive beat to end the story on  both for the characters and the franchise as a whole. Lightning McQueen, youve come a long way.", "date": "June 12, 2017,"}
