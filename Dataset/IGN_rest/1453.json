Youd hear about the grindhouse style, brilliant comedy, shocking vulgarity, totally rock-n-roll soundtrack, or clashing themes. Nobodys instinctive answer would be, Oh, yeah, the combat was a lot of fun. This is the struggle of Lollipop Chainsaw: Its a one-of-a-kind experience, a game as fearless as it is unforgettable, and its as sterile as action games come. Few games establish a tone as firmly and quickly as this one. Even fewer are willing to leave you behind if you arent into it. In the first five minutes, a voluptuous blonde goes from welcoming you to her bedroom to having a steamy shower scene to slaughtering zombies in her high school. If you cant hang with the nonsense from the start, you wont keep up as the obscene insanity spirals further out of control. From top to bottom, Lollipop Chainsaw is self-aware and utterly silly. It has fun with itself and is proud to be what it is. Profanity is as prevalent as innuendo, and the open-faced absurdity is endearing. Until it isnt. Lollipop embraces exploitation to poke fun at itself -- everything is excessively violent, excessively sexual, and mashed together with glitter, sparkles, and rainbows. Thematically, it's a weird, funny mix. At some point, however, the over-the-top exploitation of a hyper-sexualized high school student isnt the parody it started as anymore. Just...shut up. Don't talk. For every zombie Juliet Starling decapitates with her chainsaw, someone calls her a whore, talks about masturbating to her, or comments on her gigantic breasts. In and out of combat, the primary goal of Lollipop Chainsaw is the money shot, whether its up Starlings skirt or down her shirt. Obscenity eventually hits a point where its no longer contributing to anything. When shocking and titillating the player take precedent over the core gameplay loop, we have problems. The exhausting vulgarity is amusing early on but grows annoying shortly afterward. A few hours into the five-hour story I was sick of hearing anyone say anything -- except for Nick, Juliets boyfriend. Of course, the guy cant do much more than color commentary since hes nothing more than a disembodied head strapped to Juliets waist. Hes confused, incapable of contributing much, and quick with a witty joke. His banter is one of the only constants in Lollipop Chainsaw. Almost every word out of Nicks mouth made me laugh out loud because hes written well. Juliet is an idiotic, unaware bimbo, and Nick is a frustrated, frightened, impatient high schooler who just has to deal with her. His sarcastic demeanor makes playing as Juliet tolerable -- something that cant really be said about the combat or enemy encounters. Aerial attacks are where it's at, but they still don't mix it up enough. Juliet uses pom-poms, a chainsaw, a gigantic gun, and sometimes the head of her boyfriend on the end of a leash to kill zombies. It sounds like an arsenal ripe for endless amusement, but the sad reality is that its a slow grind. Juliets basic moves -- tied to a couple attacks and a dodge function -- dont flow together until late in the game when shes unlocked basic combos wed expect to have from the start. As a result, she moves awkwardly, has to finish an animation before attacking again, and isnt terribly effective for a large chunk of the campaign. Somehow, against all odds, Lollipop Chainsaw made it utterly unfun to swing a chainsaw at undead masses. The greater problem is that none of the enemies are particularly dangerous or different. Some have more health. Others explode if you dont kill them fast enough. For the most part, theyre just fodder for you to fill the requisite kill counter before moving onto the next uninspired arena battle. Lollipop Chainsaw is barren, devoid of substance. Wasteful mini-games, like shooting zombies as Nick rounds the bases at a ball diamond, or making your way through Pac-Man mazes in a faux video game, are empty forms of variety. The bosses are another standout low point: They're traditional, predictable time-sinks, complete with different phases, forms, and irritating one-hit kills. The grindhouse film themes and vibrant, girly aesthetic exist on such opposite ends of the style spectrum that the game's violence always looks cool, especially against the backdrop of the fantastic, memorable, and totally rock-n-roll soundtrack. The tedium of using many of the same moves and the repetition of encounter types (shoot this, swing on that, jump on them), however, means its just not very entertaining to play. CLOSING COMMENTS Lollipop Chainsaw doesnt even attempt to differentiate itself from the genre, and most of what it does try new in the realm of its characters and writing ultimately ends up taking away from an incredible-on-paper action game. The music and sidekick are really all you can rely on to stay great from start to finish. The rest of Lollipop Chainsaw is all over the place before it ultimately settles for mediocrity and disappointment.
