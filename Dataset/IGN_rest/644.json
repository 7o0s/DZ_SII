I wasn't convinced at first  the RPG has a weird and sometimes frustrating battle system, it relies too much on fetch quests, and it's not super challenging. However, I very quickly realized that the draw of Yo-Kai Watch is in its fascinating world. It remains fun and charming even when dealing with sort of dark ideas, so I was ultimately happy not to meet too many challenges and instead just exist in its world for a while. Yo-kai are basically meddlesome spirits  some are mischievous, some are malicious, and others are just looking for a friend. Basically any strange phenomenon can be attributed to unseen yo-kai, and Yo-Kai Watch revolves around solving the mysteries and problems they cause. For example, freak car accidents in town are actually the work of Jibanyan, whos been trying to fight trucks because he was hit by one before he became a yo-kai. Most yo-kai fit into and affect the world in their own individual ways, and I immediately became interested in learning more about them. Spirit Animals The first yo-kai you meet is Whisper, who serves as your guide to the yo-kai realm (and quests). As far as companion NPCs go, hes one of my favorites. Hes helpful without being too obvious or interrupting too often, and his quips can actually be pretty funny. He also sometimes gives information about the different yo-kai you encounter, most of which are entertaining and charming in their own right. (The only one I really dislike is Cheeksqueak, who looks like a butt. Not a fan.) My favorite thing about Yo-Kai Watch is the sense of adventure and imagination it encouraged in me. I didnt mind breezing through basic quests, because it meant getting to explore. For example, in order to go out at night, I had to befriend the yo-kai Baku so she could pretend to be me asleep in my bed. But then something called Terror Time happened. I learned that it has to do with kids nightmares and that Id have to run to safety, and then I actually had to start running. It wasnt challenging, but it was really cool  I loved everyday problems and kids issues in particular could all be explained with yo-kai. A Fighting Chance Yo-Kai Watchs combat is a weird but interesting hybrid of real-time and turn-based elements. Yo-kai take turns attacking but do so on their own, and I handled healing them and rotating three of my six yo-kai in at a time. I very often felt like a manager or a coach instead of a player. My team could take down low-level opponents with little to no input from me, so Id just hit the fast forward button and wait it out. The strategy lies in organizing your team well beforehand, which I liked, but it was frustrating to watch my yo-kai use status moves instead of dealing obvious final blows. This unique battle style works way better on more difficult bosses. Instead of just sitting back, I often had to coordinate which yo-kai were out in combination with each other. Bosses deal a lot of damage, so healing in time was critical. Theres also a special move called a Soultimate thats more powerful than yo-kais regular attacks, and its not passive like those attacks. You have to play a short minigame on the touch screen while the battle rages on up top. That combined with keeping yo-kai healthy and handling both screens made boss battles frenetic and fun. Multiplayer battles are unfortunately not very notable. Theyre local wireless only, which is a misstep  Yo-Kai Watch doesnt particularly lend itself to competitive play, but keeping multiplayer local severely impedes the possibility. Playing with friends can be fun, but its subject to the same limitations as regular battles. Pros Rich worldbuildingCharm and personalityBoss fights Cons Passive battlesSome tedious quests As an RPG, Yo-Kai Watch mostly fumbles its battle system and creates a relatively passive experience. However, I adored exploring every corner of its compelling world. The low difficulty ultimately works in its favor  I was always eager to move on to the next charming character or compelling idea. Yo-Kai Watch is a kids game that doesnt talk down to or sugarcoat darker themes for kids, and I appreciated not being talked down to either.", "date": "Nov. 5, 2015,"}
