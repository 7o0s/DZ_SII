Fun, short-lived, slightly repetitive, yet leaving me interested to know more, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising was exactly how I pictured it. Releasing a companion game before the main game  in this case the upcoming Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, is certainly an unusual choice, especially given that Rising takes a very different approach to its JRPG sibling by swapping turn-based battles for a 2D action-RPG format. Make no mistake though, its worth playing for its own strengths.Our goal in Rising is to rebuild New Neveah, a town decimated by an earthquake several months ago. That same event also unearthed several ruins stacked with treasure, which is where we come in. Playing as an honourable scavenger, CJ, our role in the reconstruction is providing each resident with whichever materials theyve requested, ranging from basic ores and lumber to more specialized items later on. Just be aware this isnt a city-building sim like Cities: Skylines  here, every building location is predetermined and theres no finer tinkering, so dont expect anything too in-depth. You cant freely interact with the average NPC either, so New Neveahs not always the most exciting place to be. Still, theres an undeniable charm this small town presents as it grows, and while this isnt the most inventive premise, theres an unfolding mystery within that held my attention.Progress is mapped through a stamp card system, earning another every time you help residents. Filling out your stamp book upgrades it to the next level, bringing more people to town and further opportunities, and you can exchange stamps at the trading post for more exciting items later on. Youll need a few initially to obtain an explorers license for the ruins, so its slightly odd seeing CJ get so invested in collecting stamps once youve done that, but seeing her so dedicated to rebuilding this town is rather sweet.Seeing CJ so dedicated to rebuilding this town is rather sweet.Rising adopts a metroidvania approach to exploration, blocking off certain areas until youve found a set ability. For example, CJs double jump isnt available until youve improved her armor, the justification being that its become lighter and less restrictive, letting her reach certain platforms. Its a steady system that rewards the more thorough explorers but doesnt restrict your ability to obtain resources. Naturally, these areas are also teeming with your bog-standard monsters and a few bosses to cap them off, and CJs soon joined by two other party members: the young acting mayor, Isha, whose struggle to keep this town afloat after her fathers disappearance held my interest. Theres also Garoo, an anthropomorphic kangaroo mercenary that claims hes just in it for the money, but made me laugh at how frequently he caves to CJs demands.You can swap between party members easily during exploration, as all three are mapped to a set face button, which also activates their attack. Theres decent variety here: Garoo is your slow but heavy hitter whose greatsword is well suited to destroying enemy shields, Isha uses magic for ranged attacks and overcoming foes magical barriers, and CJ offers a nice middle ground with her two pickaxes, so youll need to frequently rotate between them. Eventually, equippable rune-lenses become available that give your team weapon elemental damage. That adds some strategy to fights as some enemies might be weak to fire damage, yet resistance against lightning, though it doesnt make a huge difference. Thanks to elemental stones blocking your path, hitting them with the matching rune-lense opens up new areas in exploration, too.Initially, you can't do much beyond single button attacks, leaving combat feeling rather basic.Initially, you cant do much beyond single-button attacks, leaving combat feeling rather basic. New abilities are only unlocked upon improving weapons and armor and, unlike other RPGs, you dont need to keep selling your legendary weapons to random shopkeepers once youve got a better one because theyre all upgraded through gradual improvements, assuming youve got the money and materials; given how many protagonists Hundred Heroes is promising, Id call this a wise approach to limit the burden of micromanagement. I just wish Rising didnt lock simple moves like attacking upwards or downward spikes behind these upgrades  its a strange choice that makes the early hours feel too straightforward. Id never expect a small-scale spin-off game to do anything revolutionary with its progression system but I wouldve liked a little more depth.Combat isnt just simplistic; on default difficulty its a cakewalk. Clearing out these ruins wasnt especially challenging and if youre after a tougher fight, hard mode is unfortunately locked until youve beaten the 12-hour campaign for the first time. Fortunately, combat does open up later on once you acquire these new moves and rune-lenses, leaving some room to strategize. Pulling off combos also felt pretty damn satisfying, a feeling amplified by the slow-motion sequence that activates alongside it, slowly showing your team tearing into the opposition. Theres a rush that comes from rinsing tougher foes with a quick set of strikes, inflicting major damage in a matter of a few seconds. Its one area where the basic nature of combat is advantageous, in that your party works in unison without any complicated inputs. These can be pulled off manually or activated automatically through Simple Mode, but keep in mind thats not a difficulty setting  its purely for controls. It doesnt take much combat, resource gathering, and questing for New Neveah to become a thriving town once more, offering all the classic buildings youd expect from a fantasy RPG. Inns, taverns, blacksmith services, all the usual sights are here. Smaller shops like the apothecary are relegated to being unlocked through side missions, found on a notice board in New Neveahs Plaza, and thankfully these dont need long to complete. Quests dont usually ask for more than providing each resident the requested materials, but I felt a sense of pride in rebuilding New Neveah. The results are immediately evident, and turning this town from a ruined mess to a thriving hub felt rewarding. That sentiment is nicely reflected in CJs own personal growth, seeing her go from ambitious treasure hunter to someone whod do anything for its citizens. New Neveahs growth is boosted by a lovely art direction and Risings packed with vibrant environments that I could watch all day. Whether its those beautiful trees of the Great Forest or the icy tundra known as Snowpeak, NatsumeAtaris given clear attention to detail here and thats a key part of its charm.Unfortunately, and not at all surprisingly, this mission structure quickly becomes repetitive, though the worst offenders are found in the side missions. Main quests are significantly varied but if you plan on going that extra mile for this town, almost everything is a fetch quest for material gathering. This certainly makes sense from a story perspective  you cant exactly do much construction work when theres no resources to work with, after all. But even with fast travel, continuously travelling between these ruins got tedious. I counted three occasions that required me finding the exact same ore, so I had to keep exploring those same locations. Fortunately, the trading post often provides whats required, its just not always cheap.While I understand these are optional, ignoring these quests can lock out some important upgrades to your weapons and armour with their respective attack and defence boosts, placing you at a significant disadvantage in combat later on. But the biggest facilities youll need are locked into main story missions, and if youre taking a moment to whack every rock, tree, and enemy you come across during exploration you may already have the needed resources on you when taking on a request. Granted, theres a limit to what you can carry, but storage space can also be increased to a generous degree. Still, despite sweeping through everything before the final boss, Rising only took me 12 hours to complete. That relatively low (for a JRPG) number of hours isnt that surprising for a companion game, and you can bump that up to 15 hours when including post-game content, which adds more side quests for completing your stamp book. Its not the longest adventure but crucially, this main story never felt dragged out, everything progressed at a natural rate. Because the partys story continues in Hundred Heroes - CJ, Garoo, Isha, and four other Rising characters all appear as protagonists - expect a few loose threads to be left when the story wraps up, but I still found a satisfying conclusion. Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising does exactly what any good companion game should do. Not only does this RPG set the stage nicely for the upcoming Eiyden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, its an enjoyable adventure that stands up on its own merits. Its true that combats a little basic in the opening hours and the optional fetch quests required to unlock some powerful abilities can become rather tedious, but thanks to the dynamic cast of characters, I found myself invested. Its campaign didnt last terribly long but it left me curious to see where this adventure goes next  and that was its main job.", "date": "May 10, 2022,"}
