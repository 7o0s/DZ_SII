The best description of Venom as a movie is provided by a quote from the titular antihero itself: An armless, legless, faceless thing rolling down the street like a turd in the wind. In this Ruben Fleischer-directed monstrosity that rewrites the characters origin to omit its foundational relationship to Spider-Man (who Sony has rented out to Marvel for the moment) slimy alien Symbiotes are brought to Earth and must merge with a perfectly matched human host in order to survive, otherwise the body rejects them, killing the host and potentially the Symbiote as well. Sadly, Venom suffers from the same lack of cohesion and rejects everything that mightve turned it into a badass joyride in the vein of Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy. The result is a muddled hodgepodge that isnt sure whether it wants to be comedic or take its troubled antihero way too seriously. (When your main character is threatening to eat someones pancreas as a tasty snack, you probably want to lean into the absurdity.) This is a shortcoming of both the script - a lumbering mutant thats credited to Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenberg, and Kelly Marcel - and Fleischers direction, both of which yank the actors from overwrought exposition to overproduced action scenes with no sense of pacing or tone. Thats a surprising misstep, considering Fleischers balance of both in the horror-comedy Zombieland. Without the benefit of a snarky alien companion, the rest of the cast is adrift. Riz Ahmed does his best as the Life Foundation's generic corporate overlord Carlton Drake, but even the Marvel Cinematic Universe has proven how rare it is to produce a compelling villain, and theyre generally working with much stronger scripts than this. As a result, Ahmed is reduced to scheming and mustache-twirling until the time comes for a messy Symbiote battle, where its often impossible to tell which monster were supposed to be rooting for, between the murky lighting and sloppy CGI. Michelle Williams is given more to do as Eddie's ex-girlfriend Anne than your typical superhero movie love interest, but since theres zero chemistry between her and Hardy, theres not much reason to root for Eddie and Anne after his mood swings take a turn for the cannibalistic. Meanwhile, Jenny Slate and Reid Scott manage to add some emotional grounding to their characters, but both roles are so underdeveloped, they cant contribute much to the melee. The first act is a total snooze until Venom makes an appearance, but things liven up once Eddie begins exhibiting some very strange symptoms. This gives Hardy a chance to prove himself as an underused talent when it comes to physical comedy, and his vocal performance as Venom is an effective blend of menace and obsessive affection for his host. The film's few bright spots are largely due to Hardys interplay with himself - this is the second time hes played dual roles, following 2015s underwritten but ambitious Legend. Its frustrating to imagine how much better the movie mightve been if the creative direction had matched Hardys obvious passion for the character. Theres something distinctly 90s about the tone of Venom, which relies on adolescent humor and gross-out gags in a way that doesnt gel with the intensity of Hardys performance. At the same time, it shares a lot of DNA with the superhero duds of the early aughts, like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or Elektra, where the storytelling approach is distinctly by-the-numbers and the visual effects have a noticeable green screen vibe. And while some of the early fight scenes have a frenetic, well-choreographed rhythm, as time wears on, everything devolves into a typical CGI slugfest. You can tell that Fleischer is straining against the confines of the PG-13 rating with the desire for more bloody, brain-chomping action, but its clear that a teen audience is more likely to be susceptible to the films awkward, schlocky tendencies than the more cerebral Logan crowd, leaving Venom stranded between two warring instincts. Perhaps the most disappointing part of Venom is all of its untapped potential; its easy to imagine an actor of Hardys caliber seamlessly sliding into the MCU, and at the very least, he has enough fun with the role that you cant help but want to see him face off with Tom Hollands wide-eyed Spider-Man. If he gets the chance, heres hoping the wind will have blown away the lingering whiff of this stinker by then. Tom Hardys committed performance cant overcome a painful script and indecisive direction, resulting in a film with a personality thats as split as its titular character. There are occasional moments of brilliance in the dynamic between Eddie and Venom that give a hint of what the film could have been in steadier hands, but ultimately, that only makes the finished product a more frustrating viewing experience.", "date": "Oct. 3, 2018,"}
