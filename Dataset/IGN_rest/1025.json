The 2014 remake pays proper respect, but it lacks the bravery to add the variety to make it worth playing more than a couple of times in the post coin-op era. Credit must be given for making the same foursome feel different. The Warrior can dish massive damage to enemy generators and tougher foes up close, while also taking his fair share of hits, too. The Valkyrie's dashing stab and Captain America-like shield throw give her some ranged attacks to complement her decent melee. The Elf controls more like a twin-stick shooter character firing infinite arrows from afar, though he can drop or shoot an explosive with far less frequency due to its countdown and cooldown periods. Those three are easy to pick up and play in solo or in a team, especially when you get enough gold to purchase spells like a crowd-stopping ice field or a path-clearing tornado. The wizard, on the other hand, is more complicated. Hes also twin-stick style, but he has has nine spells, and you can only activate them by pressing two-button combinations before launching them. No one seems to want to play as him in online multiplayer, and because you cant have two of any class on a team, there are a lot of three-player games out there. It's a shame, because the rapport between all four can be entertaining when compared to hearing a single hero spout snarky comments. While the view is zoomed out far higher than any previous Gauntlet, it's still not big enough to contain a full team's insanity on higher difficulty settings. Whether playing locally on the same PC or online, it's easy to lose sight of your small character amongst the chaos, or even behind the health meters. Additionally, if any online teammate goes idle, you can't move on without them. I died a few times because of both of those problems. Another slightly less lethal byproduct of the view is that it's often tough to tell if the door in your way is a gate that requires all enemies and generators cleared, a wooden door you must knock down, or a clear archway you can breeze on through. Making these pathways as obvious as the giant unlockable gates or the bomb-prone walls conveniently close to explosive barrels would have been preferable. The biggest enemy I encountered in Gauntlet isn't a ghost or giant, but predictability. Each set of levels in each of the three worlds unfolds in the same way: you'll start with a standard map, then move onto a shorter stage with a frustrating twist, like death itself or volcanic explosions following you or a largely darkened cave forcing everyone to a crawl. Then you take on a horde of enemies on a final small map. Finally, theres a boss at the end of each world. The bosses are nice changes of pace, as each requires a different tactic than the standard ~never stop attacking~ strategy that conquers just about every other foe. It's a shame there's only three of them. While the half-dozen hours it'll take to complete a run can be fun, thats about all there is to it. I got about a run and a half in before Id played my fill of each of the characters. Higher difficulty levels only make generators tougher to destroy, enemies more impervious to pain and drop more gold, but as intricate as they seem at first, I quickly got tired of playing the same maps due to a lack of any noticeable randomization or progression. Since purchasing new armor or weapons only makes for cosmetic changes, the only way to truly improve your character's stats is by performing specific feats called Masteries. While some Masteries make sense, like dying more to get more generous post-death invincibility periods and killing more specific enemy types to deal more damage, almost all of them require you to do a ridiculous amount of item collection and enemy kills. That doesnt make it fun, it just gives you a reward for enduring grindy monotony. The amount of Masteries you've earned is the only stat listed when joining other players online, and it can be deceptive since a fair amount of them are given for negative activities like dying or meaningless actions like destroying torches and empty containers.
