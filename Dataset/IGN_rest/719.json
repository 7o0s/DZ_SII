While surviving hordes of Darkspawn and obtaining high-level equipment feels rewarding, the new story, new characters, and new environments are flat and uninspired, making this expansion feel more like filler than fun. The Deep Roads are an important part of Dragon Age lore, so I was disappointed that The Descent does so little with it. After being sent to there to investigate a series of earthquakes, youre subjected to a muddled explanation about Dwarves and their connection to massive entities known as Titans. None of it feels connected to the Inquisition, including Renn and Valta, two dreary new characters who lack the wit and spunk of their fellow Dwarves. Theyre there to provide a bit of backstory and keep you informed of whats happening as they guide you through the Deep Roads, but some of their explanations are frustratingly vague, especially near the end. Even my Inquisitor was perplexed: Im leaving with more questions than answers, she mutters in the final scene. The Deep Roads themselves arent as fleshed out as they could be either, due to the lackluster level design. Each subterranean floor has a different look (a fiery hall, a blue cavern) which is a plus, but they all have a similar restrictive feel. The narrow corridors and slender cave tunnels offer little in the way of exploration, and when I came across a bridge that looked just like another bridge I had passed in an earlier location, I had an unpleasant flashback to Dragon Age 2s recycled dungeons. The saving grace of this expansion is the combat, which offers a tough-as-nails challenge even for veteran players. Though fighting endless hordes of Darkspawn sometimes got a little too tedious (like fending off an avalanche of genlocks and ogres in a locked room for minutes on end), I ultimately appreciated the careful strategy needed to take down enemies like the immune-to-almost-everything Earthshakers. Instead of mindlessly meleeing my way to victory, I had to find the right combination of spells and abilities to quickly take down their defenses and get the win before the next wave of Earthshakers attacked me. This gave me a newfound appreciation for the pause-combat feature, and I enjoyed being rewarded for my hard-fought victories with cool loot like Tier 4 armor schematics and plenty of gold. Theres a couple of extra quests available alongside the main mission, including unlocking hidden areas via the Deep Road expedition table and collecting gears to unlock special rooms, but they never felt all that deep or rewarding. Still, I did appreciate being able to send scouts out to collect rare items and up my Inquisitions influence, which will certainly help me in future expeditions. Pros Good lootChallenging Cons Muddled storyBland environmentsSlightly repetitive Even with its nasty hard combat, it still took me less than ten hours to complete The Descent and its side missions. Though the loot I snagged has kept me from completely regretting the time I invested in The Descent, I dont feel like its the best Dragon Age has to offer. Hopefully the next DLC will have more exciting environments and better answers to Dragon Ages more pressing story questions.", "date": "Aug. 14, 2015,"}
