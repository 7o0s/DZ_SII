However, despite ticking all of the right boxes, the Strix Pro failed to deliver on pretty much all levels, with its lackluster sound quality, excruciating discomfort, and the overall product design. The Asus Strix 7.1 that we are looking at today is the direct result of the feedback received on the Strix Pro, as well as the series of iterations that followed. Asus is promising better comfort and sound, while adding true surround sound capability with 5 discrete drivers in each ear cup. Design The Asus Strix 7.1 looks and feels exactly like the Strix Pro, although I do not have the original model with me to make a direct comparison. It still is carelessly large though, and shares the same goofy owl design of its predecessors. Thankfully, it has retained some of the better traits of the previous designs, such as the sturdy build quality and auto-adjusting headband. In my review of the Strix Pro, I noted the horrible comfort and ergonomics that made the headset almost unbearable to wear. This is something Asus has definitely taken into consideration as the Strix 7.1 is far more comfortable than its previous versions. I am not sure what exactly they seem to have changed to be honest, but the Strix 7.1 sits on the head better and my earlobes no longer brush against outside of the speakers (it could be due to the heftier cushion pads). That said, the Strix 7.1 are still no way near as comfortable as a headset should be. They fit like two overly large hands clamping down on the sides of your face, crushing it slowly and steadily before it starts to hurt. I couldnt wear these for more than 30 minutes as the pain of the clamp force and the heat generated due to the pleather cushions started to cause considerable discomfort. The Strix 7.1 comes with its own USB station that acts as its sound processor as well as the power supply for the headsets internal speakers and the needlessly bright lighting effects. Since the USB station is driver-supported, the headset will not work with the PS4 or the Xbox One. The headset itself cannot be connected to any other device as its cable ends on a HDMI connector which plugs into to the USB station. This severely limits the use of the Strix 7.1, and unless you want a dedicated PC-only headset, the lack of support for other devices is a huge oversight. The USB station offers an assortment of options that at first can be quite intimidating. Most importantly, it allows you to adjust the volume for each of its individual speakers as well as enable the 7.1 surround sound capability. The station also features different presets for gaming (FPS, action-adventure, footsteps, and racing), a button to turn the mic on and off, and a built-in amp that mercifully boosts the overall sound as I found it to be quite low by default. Each of the features can be enabled or disabled by pressing down on the large volume knob in the middle of the device. The USB station can also be connected to home speakers and has a button that easily lets you alternate between the two sources. Performance I quite liked the performance on the Asus Strix Pro and appreciated its near flat frequency response characteristics. However, the headset also tried to fake a large soundstage (being closed-back in nature) which only ended up distorting the overall listening experience and made the sound loose and hollow. The Strix 7.1 certainly rectifies most of it - the sound is a lot more defined and is carried across confidently. It also isnt trying to produce a soundstage larger than it can and instead relies on its ten individual speakers to create a surrounding experience. This doesnt mean the headsets delivers on true surround sound. A headset inherently isnt capable of doing that as each speaker needs to have some measured distance from your ears to create such an effect. However, in games like Titanfall, you can sometimes feel the rear-end speakers kicking in, which gave me a slightly better spatial awareness in picking off enemies approaching from behind. But in single player games like Far Cry 4, I could hardly notice any obvious surround sound effect and it certainly didnt sound any better than my regular stereo headsets. The sound quality isnt perfect by any means, though. There is still a bit of airy-ness about them that muddles the highs a bit. It lacks absolute clarity which is further compounded by the lackluster bass response. The end result is a sound experience that doesnt feel as wholesome, clear, and bright. Its almost quite distanced and doesnt truly bring the sound alive. This is somewhat mitigated by the Strix 7.1s stereo mode - which Asus in fact recommends for music purposes - but not entirely. The built-in presets such as FPS, racings, action-adventure, and footsteps arent that great as well (certainly not at the level of quality that Turtle Beach provides), with most of them either introducing a lot of bass or cranking up the treble to the highest. I simply left them turned off for the most part. The mic has seen the most improvement with the Strix 7.1. As I demonstrated in my Strix Pro review, the mic was atrociously bad in capturing my voice with any clarity. The Strix 7.1, however, boasts a pretty decent mic that provides clear voice communication capability, be it for recording audio files or chatting with friends in online games. Below is a sample of me reading a passage from Alice in the Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. It was recorded using Audacity on Windows 8.1. Pros Good build qualitySurround sound drivers can be individually tweakedSufficient immersive sound Cons Lacks absolute clarity, lackluster bass responseUncomfortableNot compatible with PS4 or Xbox OneBuilt-in presets are useless The Asus Strix 7.1 may be an overall improvement compared to previous models, but as a gaming headset, it falls short on many levels. It is an uncomfortable wear, and while its ten discrete drivers do manage to create a surround sound effect in some scenarios, it is still nothing to write home about. Its drivers-powered USB station also limits the headsets to PC-only, so if you are looking for an all-round device, the Strix 7.1 won't cut it.", "date": "Jan. 26, 2015,"}
