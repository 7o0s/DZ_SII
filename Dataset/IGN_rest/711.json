{"name": "Until Dawn", "name_review": "Until Dawn Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/until-dawn/110710/review/until-dawn-review", "text": "At its best, Until Dawn is a gleefully cheesy homage to horror movies, set in a world built by a developer that clearly adores the genre. Although its thrills are tempered by a lack of story cohesion, its robust choice-and-consequence system and keen eye on horrors most ridiculous tropes makes Until Dawn ultimately worth playing. Developer Supermassive Games has threaded horror movie cliches into Until Dawns set-up and amplified them to extreme degrees. Eight attractive stereotypes, played with great gusto by a well-rounded cast thats a little too good for the material, have gathered together to party like porn stars in a remote cabin on the top of a snowy mountain that can only be accessed by an unreliable cable car. Why are they there? To mark the one year anniversary of the mysterious disappearance of their friends in the surrounding woods, naturally. Until Dawns game world is small, but Supermassive has made it as entertainingly hostile as possible. Its beautifully detailed cabin is huge, cold, and full of secrets, while the surrounding area features a sanitorium with a large morgue, an abandoned mine shaft, and a range of aggressive wildlife. This bitter landscape is filmed with a keen eye on isolation, and Until Dawn does a great job at encouraging the sense youre always being watched through high angles and tracking shots. Its a ridiculous place to spend any length of time, of course, and during its first half Until Dawn really revels in the slasher genres idiosyncratic idiocy. Characters take baths with their headphones in. Couples go to dangerous lengths to have sex. Everybody seems to think scaring the hell out of each other is really fun. While I wish Graham Reznick and Larry Fessendens script had been more acerbic overall - sometimes I wondered if the bad jokes were intentionally bad jokes - I enjoyed Until Dawns familiarity, from the dumb jock arguing with the bad boy over the queen bee to Hayden Panettiere's character being stuck in a towel for half the run-time. Such gleeful abuse of genre tropes does dilute Until Dawns scares significantly - I laughed more than I flinched - though there is the odd bit of clever misdirection resulting in genuine shocks. Supermassive has an excellent handle on the visual language of horror movies, and Until Dawn is at its most scary when a character is ever so slowly backing out of a doorway, or approaching a rattling trap door. Until Dawn cant quite sustain its tongue-in-cheek tone through its ten-ish hours, however, and its story veers off in an entirely different direction in a much darker and sillier second half (which owes an awful lot to a certain British horror flick). While there are still some tense moments to be had here, this sudden shift strips away any cohesiveness and left me feeling like Id played through two very different - and discordant - games. Fortunately, Until Dawn encourages a more consistent sense of tension elsewhere. Your goal is to save (or kill?) as many characters as you can over the evening as possible, and every decision they make under your control shapes their fates. Bend a weapon out of shape? Dont expect to have it later when youre under attack. Be cruel to another character? You wont have his support when you need it the most. Some decisions I made in Until Dawn had minor consequences, some left me genuinely shocked, and all felt satisfyingly connected to an action I had made. I played through twice to mess around with its systems, and was delighted to find new storylines and information Id missed the first time around by choosing different options. Quick-time events play a big part in Until Dawn, too, and though occasionally tedious - theres far too much climbing over walls for my liking - there are real repercussions for failing. Some of Until Dawns most thrilling moments came when I was being pursued and had to make split-second decisions on my method of escape, all the while trying not to fumble at a prompt which would result in my immediate capture or death. Its worth noting I had a tough time with Until Dawns motion controls during these frantic sections, and as they brought nothing to the experience elsewhere, Id recommend sticking with traditional controls. Less successful is an odd bit of fourth-wall breaking theatre that has a more obtuse effect on Until Dawns story. Doctor Hill (performed by Fargos Peter Storemare) is a psychiatrist who will talk to you directly in between chapters, at first ascertaining your fears and teasing out your thoughts on each character. How you answer him has a subtle effect on Until Dawns early scares - youll encounter a needle if you tell him youre scared of needles, for example - but his role quickly descends into a strictly thematic one, which becomes redundant as the story takes that hard left-turn. Pros Tongue-in-cheek toneCreepy environmentsChoices have real consequences Cons Silly, derailing second halfDoctor Hill fades into obscurity Until Dawn is a flawed, but fun experience. Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, its an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences.", "date": "Aug. 24, 2015,"}
