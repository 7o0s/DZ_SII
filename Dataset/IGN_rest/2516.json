Lots of things, though in this case theyre not the kind that lead to good gameplay. With so few interesting decisions and so much mundane busywork going on in Jurassic World Evolution, there is no need to, as Samuel L. Jackson once famously recommended, hold onto your butts. Jeff Goldblum lends his recognizable-anywhere voice to some of the narration as Dr. Ian Malcolm, and hes clearly having a lot of fun with the pronunciation of the islands names  just wait until you hear him say Isla Matanceros in the opening flyover cutscene  but otherwise it very much sounds like his first read-through of the script. Opposite him are a handful of Jurassic World actors, including Bryce Dallas Howard and B.D. Wong, and then theres someone voicing Chris Pratt's character who doesnt even seem to be making an attempt at impersonating him. In this simple business sim, the idea is to build dino-zoo parks across five samey looking tropical islands, plus a samey looking sandbox island. Granted, it makes some sense for all of the islands in a region to be blanketed in the same jungles and grassy fields, but if youve ever been to the Big Island of Hawaii and seen how dramatically the environment can change in just a 15-minute drive  from jungle to forest to Mars-like volcanic wastelands  a little visual variety wouldve been nice. My almost-three-year-old son absolutely loves watching the dinosaurs.But just like the park-going public, were here to see dinosaurs, and their detailed models and animations are the best thing about Jurassic World Evolution. There are 42 different species available, and watching everything from the nimble gallimimus to the lumbering brachiosaurus roam around the screen making movie-authentic noises is great the first few times. (My almost-three-year-old son absolutely loves them.) The problem is, the process of unlocking and improving their genomes is painfully dull and repetitive, and doing it 42 times is a special kind of tedium. It almost seems like something out of a bad mobile game: You go to the map screen and click on the dots representing dig sites around the globe where you have a chance to discover fossils from a set of species to send your dig team, then wait for the roughly two-minute timer to expire. Then you go to a separate screen where you see the random assortment of fossils youve acquired  resembling a lootbox-style card pack  to click on the fossils to research or sell them. You only want to sell them if youve already fully researched that dinos genome, or if its a valuable rock with no dino-DNA, so theres no actual decision-making happening here, just mandatory robotic actions. And then you repeat that cycle, dozens and dozens of times, until youve done them all. I dont know if this is intended to replicate the real paleontology work of scrubbing an unearthed fossil with a toothbrush, but if anything its less fun. Its also a let-down that, among these 42 species, there are no flying or swimming dinosaurs in the mix. Without pteranodons or a mosasaurus, its impossible to recreate the first Jurassic World movie, even on the sandbox island. For the record, that unlimited-money sandbox mode must be unlocked, and even then you can only play with the dinosaurs and buildings youve unlocked in the campaign, so theres no avoiding playing the boring part of Jurassic World Evolution, which  based on my roughly two dozen hours of play  could take upwards of 30 to unlock everything. There's no avoiding playing the boring part of Jurassic World Evolution.Once youve unlocked a dinosaur, you have to roll the dice to see if you get to create them. Every dinosaur has a viability percentage based on how much of their genome youve researched and which stat-modifying gene mods youve applied, and that affects whether or not they end up as a towering majestic beast or a scrambled egg brunch that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Bringing a long-extinct creature back from the dead shouldnt be easy, granted, but in a game where youre effectively gambling with having to spend more time playing a dull game to get what you want, losing that bet is just depressing. Thats much worse here than in most similar city-builder games because, bizarrely, theres no way to speed up time to skip long stretches of waiting for cash to roll in or dinosaurs to hatch. In everything from SimCity to Frostpunk, speeding up time avoids the doldrums of awaiting a paycheck, so even if your in-game performance (if youre going for efficiency) takes a hit, the pace of play isnt significantly impacted. But here, if youre making $100,000 per minute and you want to incubate a dinosaur that costs $1,000,000 and has a 70% chance of viability, thats 10 minutes of gameplay (in which you spend no money, so youre doing basically nothing) youre wagering against a 30% chance youre going to have to spend another 10 minutes doing very little. Having played quite a bit, Im not inclined to take that bet. Actually building your park is basic but mostly intuitive, and the road and fence tools work well enough. Sometimes Ive been frustrated by not being able to plop a road or building where it seems like I should be able to, but the almost completely inconsequential cost of raising or lowering ground levels (or adding or removing water or forests) to the terrain makes it pretty easy to place whatever you want wherever you want it. Power is the only resource to worry about, but you get the sense its only really there so they can have outages like in the movies. There's not much room for creativity.But the reason building is so dull is that most of the maps are tightly constrained, so theres not much room for creativity. And even when there is room, there arent a ton of options for buildings to choose from to make a park feel like your own  at least, not until youve unlocked everything, by which point youll probably have long since grown tired of the grind of fulfilling the objectives of the three factions: security, science, and entertainment. These three departments will pop up with objectives every so often to attempt to give you direction, but almost invariably theyre things you were going to do anyway, for rewards that are barely worth noticing. Research a new dinos genome up to 60%! Yeah, I was doing that. Increase your income to $150K! Yes, Im at $145K right now and in the process of placing the thing that will get me above $150K. Sell two of these $350K-each dinosaur for $100K; well give you $200K as a reward! Well, that makes no sense, but fine, because that helps me unlock some new buildings. Every mission you complete from one of the factions angers the other two, so you have to focus on one at a time to unlock their specific upgrades before moving to the next one. But that means the other two factions will be mad at you, and that would be very scary if the sabotage acts they engage in werent so pathetic and ineffectual. Oh no, weve given three dinosaurs a disease! What will you do? Well, Ill send a ranger team or two to stick them with blowdarts and cure them immediately, rendering the entire thing moot. As long as theres no coinciding storm or something equally beyond my control to randomly mess me up, Im fine. I suppose that was true of Dennis Nedrys sabotage as well, but John Hammond wasnt having a good gameplay experience in that situation, either. There's never a ~must go faster~ moment.So most of the time, youre sitting around performing mandatory boring tasks like ordering your jeeps to resupply feeding stations or curing random disease outbreaks. You can fill some of the downtime by taking direct control and cruising around in a jeep or helicopter, but theres not much to do with those vehicles outside of taking photos of dinosaurs (the more appealing option for people who just want to watch these animals in action) or tranquilizing dinosaurs from the air for sport. But theres never a must go faster moment because even the most ferocious-looking dinosaurs just ignore you  theres no concept of your vehicles taking damage. Shooting tranq darts at dinosaurs sounds like fun  and it really should be. But even when youve researched and equipped some upgrades for it, firing slow-moving, fast-dropping darts that reload slowly at smaller, fast-moving targets like velociraptors from a helicopter is just not fun. I found I was much better off letting the AI handle it in the event of a breakout, which it does with reasonable effectiveness once you buy the upgrades that raise the apparently deliberately annoying limitation on how many tasks you can queue up for it at once. One of the really frustrating things about the way youre evaluated is how its split between Dinosaur Rating and Park Rating. Yes, both contribute to your overall rating, which is how unlocks are doled out. But the fact that only the Dinosaur Rating determines how much money you make means you can completely neglect the Park Rating  that's everything from monorail transportation to clothes shopping and bowling alleys  until your dinosaurs are drawing in enough money that none of those things matter. I routinely set all my shops to have maximum staff and literally give away the most expensive merchandise for free to maximize their effect on park-goer happiness because the amount of money they cost is negligible after Ive built up my park a bit. Thats just bizarre, and a broken simulation of how a park should work. That these park-goers never pipe up to let you know they're awed or disgusted.Whats sad is that that these park-goers never pipe up to let you know theyre awed by a huge apatosaurus or grossed out by a velociraptor disemboweling something in front of them makes the whole thing feel artificial. You cant select them to see how theyre feeling at all  you just get a chart showing their overall happiness, as determined by their food, drink, shopping, transportation, and dinosaur visibility (which is in turn determined by where you place your viewing point structures). It all feels extremely artificial. The challenge that eventually emerges in Jurassic World Evolution isnt managing the economy, because thats simple. Its not hitting the simplistic mission goals that pop up, because half of the time youre most of the way to beating those objectives before theyre issued. Its not even repairing random storm damage, because thats done by sending out your jeeps to instantly fix most of it. No, the tough part is jamming together as wide a variety of dinosaurs as possible in as small an area as possible without making them angry  thats the puzzle were supposed to solve. And once wikis work out which dinosaurs can co-exist, in what numbers, in a pen with the same proportions of forest and grassland, that will be no problem at all. But figuring those combinations out on your own is a headache, because a lot of stats (such as how many of their own kind they can tolerate and how many creatures of other kinds theyre okay with being in the same area) are hidden until you create a dinosaur of a given type. If any one stat isnt satisfied within its tolerances, theyll beat their heads against a concrete wall until they break out and go on a rampage, potentially taking a bite out of your income with injury lawsuits(a polite term for being swallowed whole) that make you wait, totally paralyzed, for your bank balance to work itself out of the red. Any breakout can lead to a long and boring game of whack-a-mole.Oh, but sometimes that T-rex thats been happily munching on goats for the past few hours will randomly decide she wants more trees in her pen and use that as an excuse to bust out with little warning. Shell run around, eating a few park patrons before you can tranquilize her. Actually, thats the best-case scenario, because a T-rex is a solitary animal  it will even attack its own kind if two are together. But if you have something like a stegosaurus, where you need five of them together in one pen to prevent them from losing their minds and running amok, restoring order becomes a huge pain. In fact, nearly any breakout can lead to a long and boring game of whack-a-mole as you knock out escapees and toss them back in their pens using transport helicopters, only to have them break out again because you havent caught all their friends yet and they were lonely. And of course, you can have your dinosaurs fight for your entertainment and to build up their combat infamy rating. But when the outcome is just a roll of the dice, you get really frustrating situations like when my first $2 million T-rex was immediately killed in its first tussle with a $600K ceratosaurus. On top of that, unlike the pit fights in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you already own both combatants, so no matter who wins, you lose because you paid to incubate the loser. And even if you do have a winner who you manage to fatten up with a bunch of wins, all of your dinosaurs will die of old age sooner than youd expect anyway, so all the effort of setting up those fights doesnt feel worth it. Besides the fact that theres absolutely no evolution involved in it, Jurassic World: Evolution is a bad game because its just a bore of a park sim. Sure, the dinosaurs look nice enough, but the process of unlocking new species is beyond tedious and actually running the business is shallow and quickly gets stale. It beats getting mauled by raptors, but after careful consideration, Ive decided not to endorse this park.", "date": "June 11, 2018,"}
