Its packed with interesting characters who present tough, morally gray decisions, and their outcome had me feeling like Id left a real mark on this self-contained region. Much in the same way that Fallout 4s main quest begins as a simple search for a missing child before blooming into a region-shaping battle, Far Harbor lures you to its island in the course of a missing persons investigation taken on by the Valentine Detective Agency (which means you must have gotten far enough to meet Nick Valentine, around level 20) and then introduces you to the far more intriguing and mysterious real reason youre here. Each of the three factions competing for survival and control of the island  the Far Harbor townspeople, the Children of Atom cultists, and the synth refugees  is well developed, with internal conflicts as well as external, and each has interesting characters that are strongly voice acted. Most notably, synth leader DiMAs calm but intense performance as he raises some big questions about synths who dont know theyre synths. This is the kind of nuanced, impactful decision-making that was in short supply in Fallout 4.The way the conflicts and intrigue are unraveled allows for justifiably different reactions. Whos in the right and whos in the wrong to your character will depend on your concept of justice for individuals and how you weigh that against the bigger picture. Do the ends justify the means when it comes to keeping the peace? This is the kind of nuanced, impactful decision-making that was in short supply in Fallout 4s main story quest, and in some spots theres more than one way to accomplish your goals. I didnt get to see all of the potential outcomes in one roughly 12-hour playthrough, but theres a lot of groundwork laid for different results. In the middle of all of the main quest, Far Harbor takes a surprising detour into a virtual environment that makes use of the settlement-building mechanics to turn Fallout 4 into a puzzle game. The series of puzzle rooms are built around just one simple idea: redirecting lasers to hit targets, not unlike what weve seen in the Portal games. Mixing that with Minecraft-like block building created some moderately clever challenges  especially in the last two chambers (which are optional) the difficulty is ramped up significantly. Theres also a Lemmings-like component where after youve lasered the path clear you must guide virtual bugs to a goal, but that part is so hard to fail Im not sure why Bethesda bothered with it. We also get a fairly unremarkable companion in the grizzled fisherman Old Longfellow. Hes introduced as a guide who can lead you through the radioactive fog that blankets the island, though its never that radioactive, so its never more than a minor annoyance. Longfellow isnt a key player in the story, but adds some color commentary about the island and its history as you explore, and serves as a barometer for the Far Harbor communitys reaction to your choices. Side quests are in full force here, too. While there are a fair amount of straight-up fetch and kill quests to pad it out, theres some more imaginative stuff, too. The highlight is a whimsical locked-room murder mystery where the voice actors clearly enjoyed hamming it up (just listen to the intonation whenever your character says, The murder). This region also introduces a handful of new weapons and armor, including wicked-looking fish hooks and elaborate Children of Atom armor, but the harpoon gun really steals the show. Its an extremely powerful but slow-firing projectile weapon that can pin severed heads to the wall, delivering as much punch as a rocket launcher. Its especially useful against the new hostile wildlife: giant fish monsters, salamanders, and lobsters that would each give a deathclaw or yao gai a run for its money. Pros Large and denseInteresting decisionsHarpoon gun Cons Annoying fogBland companion Fallout 4: Far Harbor adds a large amount of great quests and content within its gloomy but distinctive island setting. Thanks to some well-written, morally ambiguous characters, its choices are as gray as the weather, and much more interesting. Though the new companion isnt the strongest and the supposedly ruinous radioactive fog is more annoying than threatening, all of the adventuring and new gear absolutely made it worth my while to return to Fallout 4 for Far Harbor.", "date": "May 21, 2016,"}
