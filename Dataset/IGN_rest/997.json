Sometimes, I felt that way too. This is a game about making games, and it functions comparably to game engines such as Unreal or Unity. It can be complicated, tedious, and frustrating -- but the reward for overcoming the challenges of creation is having something your friends, family, and the world can play. This, above all else, makes something thats already smart and fun even more exciting. The part of Project Spark that functions like an actual game is an episodic single-player campaign that demonstrates whats possible, as well as how you can create useful and fun logic for characters and objects. Its a helpful first step, but it isnt enough to guide you to make something whole. Plus, its 3D action game simplicity isnt terribly enjoyable on its own. But at any point, if you own the objects Project Spark sells piecemeal, you can stop playing and start editing right then and there to figure out how something operates. Everything in Project Spark has a Brain, in which you can modify how an object responds when something happens to it. Im a game design daydreamer with no formal training, so navigating complicated menus to create artificial intelligence behaviors is terrifying, and getting them to work can be challenging, even in spite of its helpful visual scripting. But its interesting, satisfying, and really fun to design a space from scratch, populate it with people, and see them respond to a player character with dialogue you wrote, or a big event you scripted. It feels good to make something. It feels better when someone says its cool. Project Spark is a sandbox and a playground for your creativity, and its relatively easy to jump in and start creating. Its also really, really hard to make something that That all of those tools are available for free is amazing. Project Sparks $40 starter set gives you a ton of new props for visual variety, and the DLC packs have even more, but everything you need to make something is available for free. Understanding these systems takes time and effort, but Project Spark is reasonably accessible. Because Sparks tutorials only scratch the surface of what it can do, I relied heavily on YouTube videos to tell me how to use a boolean variable, or what an objects vector means. Now theyre core to the kinds of games Im making with friends -- and making games with friends is where Project Spark becomes something truly special. Cooperative design is easily the best thing about Project Spark. I enjoyed my time alone, tinkering with 2D platformers and 3D action games, but having someone else to help make your game design dreams come true is legitimately among my favorite game experience in a while. While my friend created an interactive sequence later in our 2D platformer level, I decorated an early scene with new lighting, visual effects, and props. He, the designer, me, the artist. In another game, I used Project Sparks flexible tools to create walls, paths, and visual cues. Thats level design. Meanwhile, he was making a non-playable character respond to player interactions using the Brain editors visual programming. We argued about what was best for the game versus what was best for the player. We solved problems together, and he cleaned up my messes. This isnt exactly like being a development team -- but like Rock Band is awesome for wannabe rockstars, Project Spark is a terrific approximation of what it might be like to work at a video game studio. Here, though, you actually create something you can share, and doing it together is as good as Project Spark gets. Its still very early in its life, so right now most of what Project Sparks community has made is...lacking in quality, to say the least. People are still learning whats possible though, and I found myself giving high ratings to games that accomplished novel things I didnt know how to do, rather than games I actually thought were good. Theres potential here, even if most of the action games are garbage Fable clones, or straight-up remakes of other games. But imitation is a helpful way to learn. To be fair, my games are simple, pointless, or too limited to begood. I have not made anything Im comfortable sharing publicly, and Im not sure I ever will. But what I have is a small collection of things representing my growth as a creator. Im proud of what Ive made -- even though youd probably hate it. If you spend time with Project Spark, you might appreciate my cool cave-in sequence, or the fixed camera right behind my main character. Maybe youll make something youve always dreamed of, or learn from my mistakes. Pros Multiplayer designPowerful toolsSatisfying to learn Cons Tons of menusObtuse tutorials Project Spark is a commitment, and a huge time investment to really make something substantial. Its also a worthwhile endeavor for anyone whos ever wished to make games. Learning the obtuse and complicated systems is surprisingly enjoyable, because youll see satisfying results instantly when you conquer a problem. <br/><br/> So far, there are few games Id actually recommend playing on the Project Spark marketplace, but the engine itself is an enormous amount of fun to use. Its rich with possibility, primed for your creativity, and capable of bringing your imagination to life.", "date": "Oct. 19, 2014,"}
