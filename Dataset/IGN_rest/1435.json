This should give you some idea about how bad Dungeon Twister actually is. But what is this Dungeon Twister? you ask. Is it like Twister, but played in a dungeon with a few drinks and that cute chick from your office? Sadly, no. It's a digital recreation of the French board game of the same name, made available for download on PSN. It also happens to be a complete mess of a video game. I love me some super nerdy board games, but Dungeon Twister is a substandard looking mess with a rule set that's big on complexity but short on actual depth. The basic idea sounds good enough on paper. You form a party of four heroes (chosen from a list of eight) and wage turn-based battle against your opponent's squad in a dungeon filled with traps, obstacles and special items with various effects. But things go south almost immediately when you start learning how to play through what may be the most long winded tutorial ever put into a game. See, Dungeon Twister has rules -- lots and lots of rules  so many, in fact, that it doesn't have one or two tutorial missions. No, it has 20. And these aren't simple, minute long affairs either. We're talking 5-15 minutes each, and that's if you nail them all on the first attempt (which you won't thanks to some truly awful descriptions and a bevy of overly convoluted systems). All told, you're looking at a few hours of work just to understand how the game is played. And then the real fun begins. And of course by real fun, I actually mean complete boredom. The game's many nuances make you feel like you're jumping through hoops rather than making important strategic decisions. Take, for instance, the choosing of an action point (AP) card at the start of your turn. The cards range in value from two to five, and when selected furnish you with the corresponding amount of AP to use before the round ends. Once you pick one card, you can't pick it again until you've picked every other card first. Except on the first turn where you can only pick 2, after which your opponent can only pick the same value card or one higher, and on and on. But of course, that's only for the first AP card cycle, not the subsequent ones. Confused yet? No? Good, because there's tons more where that came from. The thing is, in a game where the point is to cross the stage before your opponent, and every little action from initiating combat to jumping over pits and unlocking gates costs AP, why would you ever take anything but the highest currently available amount of AP? The answer is that except for the occasional freak situation, you won't. Most of Dungeon Twister's gameplay mechanics boil down the same way. They're complex and counter-intuitive, but without the upside of feeling rewarding or strategically interesting. Setting the board up for play, revealing hidden rooms in a dungeon and sometimes even grabbing, moving or using items are all done in needlessly meandering ways, making every step of the process feel like a total chore. And the rancid brussel sprout on top of the sundae are the visuals, which manage to establish a new low water mark, even by downloadable standards. At a stretch, Dungeon Twister might have looked graphically acceptable on the PS2, but that's being generous. The colors remind me of when I used to swirl all the paints together in art class, and the character models vaguely resemble blow up dolls with Mr. Potato Head parts glued on. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh but I honestly can't imagine the era in which graphics this artistically and technically botched would make the grade. As drab and joyless as the game looks when zoomed out during general play, things go from bad to worse when the camera sweeps in close for battle animations and what can only be described as end-zone victory dances, at which point the stilted animations and generic fantasy artwork become painfully apparent. You may want to download the trial version and escape the dungeon with your Thief just to see her dance her jig. It's probably the worst thing I've seen since I walked by the Just Dance booth at PAX last year. Also, clerics who headbutt their spell book before combat. You know, just because. CLOSING COMMENTS I feel just a little bad slamming the game this badly, mostly because it's exactly the kind of game I want so desperately to like. It has a lot to it, and I love the idea of taking a board game with so many elements and making it playable online. The problem is that I don't think it's a very good board game in the first place, and the folks who recreated it as a video game did it absolutely no favors with the terrible visuals and animations. These factors, combined with the arduous tutorial and AI that sometimes just stops playing altogether make Dungeon Twister one of the worst downloadable titles I've played in recent memory. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a Dominion party to host. IGN RATINGS FOR DUNGEON TWISTER (PS3) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 3.5 Presentation Menus and interface are functional but ugly, and the entire game feels dull and lifeless. It completely fails to create a sense of wonder or excitement. 2.5 Graphics Muddy colors, amateur hour fantasy art work and some of the worst modeling and animation I have seen in two console generations. Dungeon Twister is a visual atrocity. 4.5 Sound There isn't much sound to speak of, and what's present is pretty mediocre. Effects are simple, low quality duds, and while the one track that plays during a match is unoffensive, it gets repetitive quickly. 3.0 Gameplay Needlessly complex gameplay systems mask simplistic turn based strategy. It succeeds in replicating the board game, but this is not a board game I would ever want to play. 3.0 Lasting Appeal You can play a match against the CPU or against an opponent on line. That's about it. The only thing that lasts is the hours-long tutorial. 3.0 OVERALL Awful (out of 10) I feel just a little bad slamming the game this badly, mostly because it's exactly the kind of game I want so desperately to like. It has a lot to it, and I love the idea of taking a board game with so many elements and making it playable online. The problem is that I don't think it's a very good board game in the first place, and the folks who recreated it as a video game did it absolutely no favors with the terrible visuals and animations.
