While it doesnt stand out enough from the main game to prove essential, it does offer beautiful Lost World-esque environments to explore, some tough new challenges, and a story that adds an interesting, if surprisingly low-key, dynamic to the Dragon Age universe. Jaws of Hakkon introduces a sun-dappled region studded with fairy-tale mushrooms, prehistoric nasties, and tropical birds known as Frostback Basin. Not only is this addition one of the Inquisition maps most immediately beautiful terrains, its got a fair bit of design depth to it, too. As I galloped my way through it, I was treated to a wide variety of locales; a muddy, foggy swamp, twisted, dizzying tree trunks twisted into pathways, and little villages were I began the quests that would occupy me for a good five or six hours. While I found the basic thrust of these overly familiar  Find X to complete the quest! Kill Y to complete the quest! Oh no, Z is mysteriously missing!  Jaws of Hakkon provides an interesting context to give each more relevance. It turns out that the Frostback Basin is being terrorized by fevered fanatics of the God of Hakkon, which causes trouble for your Inquisitor as you search for the final resting place of the last Inquisitor, missing in the region for 800 years. Its a surprisingly impersonal story  your Inquisitor status is rather meaningless, and while your party returns with their signature vibrance, they merely provide background colour  but at the very least, it highlights developer BioWares skill at world-building. Theres a real sense of history here between the Hakkonites and Avaar who live in the region, and their traditions and rituals have been obviously created with a great deal of thought and imagination. Jaws of Hakkon also gives a bit more screentime to one of Inquistions most endearing characters: Scout Harding. While she remains characteristically professional, Harding  and her wonderful voice actress Ali Hillis  reveal a little more of her heart here, and Jaws of Hakkon is a more touching story for it. It helps that Inqusitions sense of humour is dryer than ever in this DLC. While I wouldnt dare recommend one party member over the rest (ahem  Dorian), Hakkons banter game is strong, and some of the characters youll meet have some fantastic one-liners that made me genuinely laugh  always a tough feat in the frequently ultra-serious fantasy RPG genre. The lightness is particularly appreciated later on, when Jaws of Hakkon ramps up the difficulty to a teeth-clenching degree. For those even at a highish level  I began at 22  theres real challenge to be found here. The more I explored the region, the more Hakkonites swamped me in numbers, and the Pride Demons at fade rifts grew more relentless. For the most part I welcomed the sudden upturn in difficulty, particularly as Id begun to take my power for granted after 60 or so hours of Inquisititing. The exception is that I would have liked the option to have changed my party composition at a certain brutal point in the late game, where a combination of inexplicable finality on BioWares part and poor-decision making on mine almost cost me six hours of progress. My advice? Manually save  and do it often. Pros Beautiful environmentsTough gameplayMore Scout Harding Cons Over-familiar questsInconsequential story Jaws of Hakkon is certainly a worthwhile addition to Inquisitions enormous map, although not an entirely consequential one. While theres a real charm to the DLC thanks to its gorgeous environments and a light tone backed by intensely challenging combat, I hope the next installment offers an ever-so-slightly chunkier hunk of flesh to sink my teeth into.", "date": "March 27, 2015"}
