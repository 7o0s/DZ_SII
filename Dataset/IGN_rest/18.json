Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia is successful for some of the same reasons those were. When I really dug into it though, what I found was a bit of a showboat. It has a lot of cool, new ideas but slips up on the fundamentals in ways that keep those ideas from effectively coming together into a great whole. The map is among the most detailed and eye-catching in the series so far, modeling Ireland and Great Britain at about the same dimensions that had to contain all of Europe in Total War: Attila. Fighting and maneuvering armies along the jagged coasts of Western Scotland is a much different strategic and tactical experience from wading through the marshy bogs of Essex. The countryside feels fleshed-out and alive thanks to the presence of tiny villages and priories outside the protection of major walled cities. Each turn still represents a quarter of a year, though, and armies havent had their movement range changed significantly, which creates some oddly immersion-breaking conceits when zoomed in this far. It can take multiple years to march from Portsmouth to Inverness, for example  a feat that a hiker could accomplish in less than three months, even at a quite leisurely pace. It makes me wonder why the designers didnt opt to have one turn represent a month or even a week instead. Some level of abstraction is expected, but this really stretches my suspension of disbelief. I was forced to make a tactical decision of where to deploy my badass battalion.Elsewhere, Thrones of Britannia is packed with new campaign mechanics that range from meaningful to negligible. Perhaps most notable is that armies are recruited from a single, global pool and technologies, rather than buildings, are the main way of unlocking better units. Since the pool refills semi-randomly over time, youre forced to either raise a smaller army of your best units, or round out a larger one with weaker units. I really liked how this encouraged me to not have every stack be fully comprised of Elite Praetorian Murderlords by the late game, while forcing interesting tactical decisions about where to deploy my badass battalion and which part of the line could be trusted to the farmers with sharpened sticks. The problem with most of the other new campaign stuff is that it becomes far too easy to manage, with rewards for success and penalties for failure each feeling underwhelming. Theres the War Fervor stat returning from Age of Charlemagne, which measures your peoples desire to fight, and I had parked at nearly maximum for most of the late game, making it feel irrelevant. As the leader of one of the Danelaw factions, I had to balance the desires of my new English subjects with those of my viking warriors  both of whom gave me their unwavering, utter adoration by the late game. As the Irish King Flann Sinna, I had to maintain my legitimacy in the eyes of the other Gaelic lords which yep, by the late game, was absolutely unquestioned. It's far too easy to become ludicrously powerful.These systems definitely keep you on your toes early on, which is when Thrones of Britannia is the most fun. But the lack of meaningful checks on snowballing, even on hard difficulty, made it far too easy to become ludicrously powerful. The army cap from the most recent Total Wars is replaced with a food upkeep cost for armies, and food is eventually so plentiful that having 20 to 30 stacks isnt implausible. Theres also more of a lean toward story than previous Total War games, but again, its something I mostly found relevant in the early game. Having to choose between building a church to keep the English happy or a runestone to keep the Norsemen happy isnt much of a dilemma when both groups are utterly pacified. Not all of the faction-specific storylines have much of a wrap-up either. The Scots of Circenn have a definite endpoint to their Stone of Destiny quest, but their Norse adversaries in Northymbre, tasked with avenging the death of Ragnarr Lodbrok, never get any kind of payoff or reward for successfully accomplishing said vengeance. At least, not any that I could find having conquered all of Britain and fulfilled every victory condition. The campaign is unexpectedly short.The campaign is also really, unexpectedly short. I reached a long victory as two different factions in well under 100 turns, and achieved the Ultimate Victory by holding off waves of Norse, Danish, and Norman invaders who arrive from off-map not long after that. The invaders are powerful, but act somewhat aimlessly in a way that lessened the threat I felt from them. While I was fighting the Danes, for instance, the Norwegians went off and conquered a completely different area of the map where they settled down to be, more or less, just another standard faction for me to eventually crush. I feel like the endgame would be a lot more interesting if all of the invaders targeted the faction that has claimed dominion over Britannia specifically, which would have had me fighting a tense, three-front war to preserve my kingdom. The battles can be fun and exciting, if pretty standard historical Total War fare. The factions have roughly the same types of units available with minor variations, like Norsemen having better axes and the Welsh having better bows, so they can start to feel a bit samey after a while. One exception is that the relationship between ranged and melee infantry has changed a fair bit. Archers can now score deadly critical hits against even heavily-armored targets, and most melee troops now have access to a shield wall formation that makes them highly resistant to a sustained barrage. Add in the fact that there really are no super-heavy cavalry units anywhere to be found and the pacing has been thankfully slowed down a bit relative to Total War: Attila, and I definitely got the sense that Thrones of Britannia battles have their own feel and character. The first Total War Saga game tries a lot of new things, succeeding at about half of them. It improves on a few areas historical Total War games have struggled with, but at the same time falls back into some bad, old habits that other games in the series were able to rise above. The overall tapestry reads as more than competent, and I could watch hardened huskarls with their massive axes crash into a Saxon shield wall all day. But there are too many blemishes for me to place it alongside some of its truly great peers like Attila and Warhammer.", "date": "May 2, 2018, 2"}
