As far as I can tell, there are two differences between this year's version and the 2018 variant I previously reviewed. The 2019 model is 0.02mm thicker and now uses the brand new Nvidia RTX 20-series GPUs. For the past week I've been testing the entry-level Advanced configuration that includes an RTX 2060 GPU. Razer also offers the Blade 15 with an RTX 2070 or RTX 2080, or if you want to save some cash, there's still a model with a GTX 1060 available. Pricing for the Blade 15 ranges from $1,599 to $2,999 based on GPU, storage, and display (4K or touchscreen options are available) you want. With very little difference between the laptop sitting on my desk and the GTX 1070-equipped model I tested last year, I was looking forward to seeing how the GTX 1070 and the RTX 2060 compared  and after my testing, I'm left slightly surprised by the performance. Here are the specifications of the Razer Blade 15 (2019) I am evaluating: Model: RZ09-02886 Display: 15.6-inch 144Hz Full HD (1920x1080) Processor: Intel Core i7-8750H at 2.2GHz (9M Cache, up to 4.10 GHz) Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6) Memory: 16GB DDR4 OS: Windows 10 Home Storage: 512 NVMe PCIe SSD Webcam: 720p Ports: 3 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB-C/Thunderbolt, 1 x HDMI, 1 x miniDisplayPort, 1 x 3.5mm audio jack Connectivity: 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.0 Dimensions: 13.98 x 9.25 x 0.7-inches (WxDxH) Weight: 4.56 pounds Price as tested: $2,299 Razer Blade 15  Design and Features Inside the all-black housing is a six-core Intel Core i7-8750H processor, a 6GB RTX 2060 GPU, 16GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The sum of those components power a 15.6-inch 144Hz Full HD matte screen that's surrounded by thick 4.9mm bezels. Just above the display is a 720p webcam and the necessary pieces for it to work with Windows Hello's facial unlock feature. The entire housing of the Advanced model is black, save for the green Razer logo on the lid. If white is more your thing, Razer offers a Mercury White model for a $50 premium. Speakers flank both sides of the keyboard, and the power button blends into to speaker grille on the right side. Razer's tried-and-true glass touchpad is centered within the housing, and it's as velvety smooth as ever. Seriously, if I was forced to pick a touchpad to use across all laptops, I think this touchpad would beat out the MacBook's, just barely. Razer equips the Blade 15 with a healthy mix of ports. On the left side there's a charging port, two USB 3.1 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the opposite side is a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port, another USB 3.1 port, and then an HDMI port and a miniDisplayPort. With USB-C becoming more prevalent, replacing one of the USB 3.1 ports  or even the miniDisplayPort  with another USB-C port would be a nice touch. The Blade 15 remains easily portable with a weight of 4.56 pounds and a footprint of 13.98 x 9.25 x 0.7-inches, making it easy to carry around in a backpack. One of my favorite aspects of any Razer product is how colorful its Chroma lighting is. The Blade 15's keyboard boasts individually lit RGB keys that not only look good but are buttery smooth when typing or gaming. I wasn't able to remove the bottom cover of the Blade 15 due to the use of pentalobe screws, so I apologize for lack of an internal photo. Razer Blade 15  Software I appreciate Razer's approach of refusing to install any bloatware or extra apps on a laptop that users pay thousands of dollars for. It's nice to set up a brand new laptop and not worry about annoying popups from antivirus programs begging for your money, or having to deal with half a dozen apps with single-use cases. The only pre-installed app you'll find outside of the standard Window's catalog is Razer's Synapse program for programming the Chroma lighting and customizing various profiles. I still find Synapse confusing to use when it comes time to create lighting profiles for a game or general use. Not to mention I cannot, for the life of me, find a spot to disable the trackpad when a game is launched  I can't even begin to tell you how many errant shots I fired in Apex Legends when accidentally bumping the trackpad. (Eventually, I used Windows' settings to disable the trackpad when a mouse is connected.) Synapse, I think, is better suited for users with several Razer accessories who have the incentive to figure out where to go to create profiles, customize schemes, and sync settings across all Chroma-enabled devices. Razer Blade 15  Performance and Gaming I ran our typical suite of gaming benchmarks on the updated Blade, and compared it to the previous GTX 1070-powered version as well as the Walmart notebook with a GTX 1060 since that's technically the same GPU from the previous generation. What I find most interesting about the benchmark results of the RTX 2060 is not that it expectedly outperforms the GTX 1060 model, but that it nearly matches last year's Blade 15 that was powered by a GTX 1070 in every test. That kind of lines up with how the desktop RTX 2060 is essentially similar to a GTX 1070 Ti. Also, if you're wondering how the RTX 2060 mobile compares to the RTX 2080 mobile, I was curious too. So far I've only had access to two RTX laptops; this one with an RTX 2060 and an RTX 2080 with Max-Q from Asus, so I wanted to see just how the two GPUs compared in similarly spec'd laptops. It's no surprise the 2080 easily outperforms the 2060 across the board. I hope to have results from an RTX 2070 to add to this chart in the near future that should set a baseline expectation for all three of the new GPUs. I was fortunate enough that the timing of this review lined up with the release of Apex Legends, of which I played a lot while testing. I also spent time in Fortnite and Battlefield V, thanks to its support for the RTX 2060's real-time ray tracing. Playing Battlefield V at 65 FPS with real-time ray tracing certainly isn't a terrible experience, by any stretch of the imagination. Playing Battlefield V with DXR set to ultra, the Blade 15 stayed right between 60 and 65 FPS at 1080p. That's a fairly big drop when compared to the Asus ROG Zephyrus S's RTX 2080 and its 115 FPS, but, again, it's to be expected. Playing Battlefield V at 65 FPS with real-time ray tracing certainly isn't a terrible experience, by any stretch of the imagination. As for Fortnite, the Blade 15 achieved 110 FPS on the Epic setting level. While trying to get the hang of Apex Legends, I adjusted the graphics settings, and ultimately found a mixture of settings that consistently turned out 115 FPS. With the default settings, which were set to low, I was able to push the system to 144 FPS to match the panel's refresh rate. With last year's Blade 15, I recall the housing getting hot to the touch. Almost too hot. However, this year's model does a better job keeping itself cool and, despite being warm, it wasn't to the same level as last year's model. The only logical explanation is that the lower clocked RTX 2060 doesn't generate the same amount of heat as the GTX 1070 mobile part. The cooling fans not only keep the housing cool, but they aren't distracting or loud enough that I couldn't hear the speakers during gameplay. I never had to push the speakers beyond 80-percent of total volume. The keyboard's slim keys don't require much pressure before they're triggered and are nearly silent while doing so. As I said earlier, the keys are the best of both worlds  small and streamlined for typing, but responsive enough to keep up during gaming sessions. Razer Blade 15  Battery Life The Blade 15 lasted 197 minutes, or 3 hours and 17 minutes, when looping a 4K video before the battery ran out of power and the laptop powered off. I don't have any other RTX 2060 laptops to compare this to, so instead I'm comparing it to the Overpowered 17+, which lasted 226 minutes in the same test. Oddly, battery life of the Razer Blade 15 (2018) was over six hours, so the fact that it was roughly half with the newer model left me scratching my head. I ran the battery test multiple times, because I couldn't believe it. I expected similar battery life on this version of the Blade 15, considering the only real difference is the GPU. When I asked Razer about this they stated it should be six hours, not the three and change I got. As we went to press they were still claiming something was amiss, but I could never resolve it. Three hours is still a respectable score when it comes to battery life for a gaming laptop, though. It's not the six Razer is claiming, but still not too shabby. This 2019 Razer Blade 15 comes with the latest GPU technology, yet costs $300 less than last year's 1070-equipped model while providing nearly the same performance, save for battery life. This means that instead of blowing my mind like the previous model, it's simply great. If this model also offered six hours of battery life while costing less than the 2018 model, it would easily be the best Blade yet.", "date": "Feb. 21, 2019,"}
