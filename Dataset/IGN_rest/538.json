But for all that fondness for its art and style, I winced a little at the thought of returning to developer Stoic's bleak, beautiful Nordic fantasy world for The Banner Saga 2. Aside from its incredible Eyvind Earle-inspired, hand-drawn aesthetic, the world itself is about as uplifting as a bankruptcy notice in a funeral home. Happily, it only took me a few moments to realize how much I would have regretted missing this strong sequel. The Banner Saga 2 still boasts a warehouse's worth of doom 'n' gloom amid its many turn-based tactical battles and apocalyptic themes, but its characters and settings imbue it with a liveliness the original never really had. The stakes are higher now, yet there's also a greater sense of what's being lost as the world breaks and the sun squats motionless above. Out of the gate, a handy option to import Steam save files ensures your choices from the previous game won't be among the casualties. Those choices are important, as they decide whether you start the game as Rook or his daughter Alette; if those names mean nothing to you, I suggest you play the first excellent game before jumping in here and relying on the recap cutscene in the main menu  its a good refresher, but hardly a substitute. (If you're like present company and you just hate the choices you've made, there's also a convenient option to play as either Rook or Alette with preset world states.) Alette emerges as the more interesting hero. The choice mattered more than I expected. Much as in a Telltale game, the overall story arcs wind up in the same places, but the main role greatly colors the journey there. I only played for around two hours with Rook, but it was enough to see that past events had left the hunter virtually suicidal in his recklessness. His counterpart and fellow archer Alette emerges as the more interesting hero, as the saga becomes the chronicle of her development as a leader in the face of doubts over her young age and relative inexperience. The design works well in part because Stoic took the rare step of making these choices affect more than lines of dialogue, as when Rook runs off like a fool in his wrathful grief to a new part of the strategic gridded map that's well apart from his companions, creating a unique scenario. But both Rook and Alette are both too charitable for this world. Enter Bolverk, a hulking Varl who runs a mercenary outfit and who allegedly crafted the handles of his twin axes from his own horns. At least half of the story follows Bolverk as he leads his own caravan in Oregon Trail-style sequences away from the menacing Dredge, and The Banner Saga 2 ends up the better for it. Bolverk is the kind of guy who can end up killing his (incredibly useful) friends over drunken insults. He accidentally hits comrades in battle during his berserker rages. He and his loyal shieldmaiden companion Folka are in it for the gold, which means it's just as much in character when they leave poor refugees to their fate or help them out in the expectation of an advantage. By the end, Bolverk effectively becomes the main character, and his rough-edge tale of transformation cuts more deeply than those of his counterparts. Mountains No More He is, in a sense, the right kind of man for this unforgiving world. It's partly because of him that the surrounding tragedies don't feel quite so stifling as before, as his gruffer outlook keeps the melancholy at bay and allows some of remaining wonders of dying world to shine through. In contrast to the 2014 originals reliance on gray mountains and dark conifers, The Banner Saga 2 takes us into places like russet deciduous forests where creepy villagers skulk beneath the canopy, into caverns where Lovecraftian horrors lurk, across swamps with self-resurrecting bears, and over sprawling plains where centaurs hunt with spears and flails. Sometimes it even gets downright trippy, and the world breaks in ways I never would have imagined two years ago. The Banner Saga 2 ends with big events regardless of whose eyes you're seeing the world through. At the same time, I couldn't ever escape the impression that it's a Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers of sorts, in that the pieces are obviously being set in place for the planned third entry and arent capitalized on yet. The original game left some questions unanswered, but it felt more like a self-contained narrative than what we get here. It avoids its predecessor's slump into monotony by introducing new units for both friendlies and baddies. The strength of the turn-based combat fully satisfies where the story does not. It keeps to the excellent design of the original, in which your heroes duke it out with the guys on the other side of the field, but it avoids its predecessors slump into monotony by introducing new units for both friendlies and baddies. Take the new Tracker class, which can disappear on the battlefield and then unleash a stunning attack that rips away an opponent's armor. Or consider the ~Horseborn~ centaurs, some of whom can trample distant enemies and still ride out of danger on the same turn. Bog people and their bears and a nasty entity that resurrects your fallen comrades and pits them against you enrich the tactical possibilities further. Battlefield Barriers Their associated tactics find their stride on the new combat maps, which break up tidy strategies by altering victory conditions or forcing you to plan combat around obstacles both indestructible and destructible. Sometimes a harrowing battle can end with the death of an enemy leader; at other times I found myself struggling to clear away snow while Dredge beat on me. As for the obstacles, they're only occasionally used to good effect. My favorite maps were the ones where I found myself having to work around crevasses cutting through the grid, while others involved little more than barrels strewn across the map, seemingly randomly. One of the weakest consisted of a besieged greathall with a room-long firepit, where I outwitted the AI by staying put and watching as they idiotically ran through the flames. I get the impression it wasn't even properly implemented, as the NPCs lining the hall looked more like they were partying than enduring an attack outside on two fronts. It's a small sin, ultimately. The Banner Saga 2 exceeds its predecessor in almost every way, and Stoic appears to feel more comfortable with the world it has created. I found that to be true even for Wintory's soundtrack, which now seems better woven into the plot than before. It's true the story ends up seeming like it's on a precipice overlooking something greater, but that's not such a bad thing. As the inhabitants of this world know, it's always good to have something to look forward to. Pros Two stories to followNew combat unitsVictory conditionsStunning aesthetic Cons Questionable obstacles The Banner Saga 2 doesn't change much of the experience that made the original such a well-loved surprise two years ago, and that's a good thing. The improvements may be small, but they're also substantial: the new combat units, the introduction of a second caravan story to follow, and the obstacles in the battlefield add up nicely. While beautifully written and populated with memorable characters and twists, the story does slightly suffer from a case of the ~middle episodes~ that may leave you eager for more. On the bright side, we know that more is on the way in a third and final installment.", "date": "April 19, 2016"}
