Thats undoubtedly the case for Trackmanias over-the-top time trials and deep track editor  a simple but addictive combination thats earned the series a dedicated community for nearly two decades. The latest entry, a remake of 2006s TrackMania Nations simply called Trackmania, feels like a return to form in many ways. But an off-putting subscription system and poor tools to actually teach you its intricacies make it a bittersweet reunion. While theres plenty of racing in Trackmania, the main event has always been variations on time trials. Whether youre playing alone or against others online, youre always really competing against your own skills. This can make a lot of Trackmanias modes feel repetitive, whether its Time Attack, the team multiplayer of Chase or the traditional circuit-based Lap. But that drive to master a track is more than enough reason to keep coming back. Unfortunately, Trackmania has never explained itself particularly well, and 2020s rendition is no different. An all too brief tutorial covers the basics, but youre on your own when it comes to learning the mechanical subtlety behind getting truly fast times  tricks like nudging the jetpack-like reactor boost in midair to hover through midair checkpoints you didnt see coming. That gives Trackmania a steeper learning curve than it ought to have. But once you zoom past those initial speed bumps, Trackmania can be hard to put down. Finishing any of its decent launch selection of 45+ official tracks can take less than 90 seconds a piece, but youll want to play them over and over to shave off seconds and find all the clever shortcuts hidden in plain sight. The potent sounds of your engine roaring backed by high energy music can even eventually become quite soothing, drawing you in as you boost, jump, and drift around each corner in perfect rhythm. It feels like you're perpetually on the edge of losing control, making good runs exhilarating. That doesnt mean that youll be calmly cruising to the finish line though. Trackmanias cars always feel floaty around turns, and you often pick up speed faster than you think you should. That may sound like a bad thing, but it actually contributes to the feeling that youre perpetually just on the edge of losing control, which makes it all the more exhilarating when you dial things in just right and hit the goal for a gold medal. Drifting Off The Main Circuit The other side of the Trackmania coin is its custom tracks, which remain as impressive as ever  partially thanks to an intuitive block-based editor. Even before release, there are already user-made tracks ranging from recreations of Mario Kart classics to car golf to a rudimentary version of bumper cars. One dark course full of lamp posts felt like a throwback to Night Driver on the Atari 2600. Another downward slope felt like a slide from a water park that could send your vehicle flipping and flying at any moment. You never really know what youll get as you rummage through Trackmanias course selections, and thats half the fun. Time will tell if custom servers can achieve the level of plugin-based madness seen in the days of Trackmania 2, but creators already seem to have the means to go nuts in all sorts of ways. Unfortunately, not everyone who plays Trackmania can utilize these tools thanks to its unappealing new subscription service. You can play on official tracks and use a simplified map editor entirely for free, but most other things require either the Standard or Club access subscriptions, which are $10 and $30 per year respectively. Without open access to custom tracks and other community features like chat, its less of a free-to-play experience and more of a glorified demo. Gating off access like this runs the risk of putting a damper on the community support that makes Trackmania shine long term. 2016s Trackmania Turbo proved the community wont automatically rally around the latest entry in the series just because its new, especially when you can load up new tracks in TrackMania 2 for the rest of your life at no extra cost. This new Trackmania is definitely a fun return with an impressive new coat of paint, but theres not really enough thats brand new to justify a recurring entry fee. Nadeo has committed to adding a new set of official tracks every season for all players, but that can only differentiate things so much compared to what the community cooks up. What the Deal With Trackmania's Subscription Tiers? Whats the difference between the Standard and Club tiers you may ask? The biggest difference lies right in the names. Only Club members can create and join Clubs, which are Trackmanias solution to the lack of an online server browser. Each Club acts as its own server, but it can also host specific custom tracks and car skins to download. If youre not subscribed at all, you have to rely on random Arcade matchmaking to even get a chance at seeing custom maps, and you cant download any you stumble on to replay later. Standard members can join Club servers to have a bit more control, but they cant really participate directly beyond that. Serious track creators will also need to cough up the annual cash for either paid tier, as the advanced track editor (which unlocks tools vital to making anything more than a basic course) is only available for subscribers. There are certainly people who enjoy Trackmania for its single-player elements alone, which includes free official tracks quarterly, and the F2P tier will no doubt be exciting for that type of player. But for anyone who wants to see the full depth of what Trackmania has to offer, youre going to end up wanting the most expensive option eventually. You can find all the details of whats in each tier in this almost comically convoluted chart, a perfect example of how this system is an overcomplicated and unnerving cloud hanging over the entire experience. Whether youre playing free or paid, Trackmanias fancy new graphics at least makes everything look and feel fresh  its not going to stand up to the latest Forza or Gran Turismo, but this more lighthearted take on racing isnt exactly trying to. Cars have a great sheen to them that persists even as you pick up speed and focus on the road ahead. Outside of the races, Trackmania doesnt look as impressive. Its menus are poorly cobbled together  but as a longtime fan, that off-kilter feeling oddly seems like a core part of the Trackmania experience at this point, and Nadeo probably knows it. Maniaplanet may be gone, but the charm of strange font choices and obtuse settings reminded me exactly what game I was playing, even if those rough edges will probably keep newcomers at arms length. Trackmanias mechanically nuanced time trials are as tense and addictive in 2020 as they were in 2006. The initial content selection of this latest entry is robust and a wealth of entertaining custom tracks are potentially just a click away as long as both you and the community of talented track creators are willing to pay for its yearly subscription, that is. The idea that youll have to rebuy this version of Trackmania annually raises very real concerns about its longevity, but right now at least, it offers a well-modernized (if not revolutionary) take on a uniquely entertaining racing experience that threw out the rulebook years ago.", "date": "June 30, 2020,"}
