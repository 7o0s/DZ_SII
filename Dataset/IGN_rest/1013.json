The handling is easy to grasp, and the focus on fictional, predefined circuits and point-to-point courses in various locations across the world places it in a category separate from super-serious circuit-lappers like Gran Turismo 6 or any of todays plentiful open-world racers. The result is a fast, fun, beautiful, and accessible racer, although its one thats a little narrower than most of its modern peers. Handling trends towards the arcade side of the spectrum, yet its considerably less superficial than something like Burnout. The 50 cars in Driveclub brake hard and grip like glue, but the driving model is still nuanced enough to let you feel the difference between a bulky Bentley Continental GT and an eager John Cooper Works-tuned Mini. Its one-size-fits-all handling, though. In keeping with the overall arcade sensibilities, even with a bootful of throttle Driveclubs high-horsepower hypercars spring from the line with only moderate wheelspin, and they seem mostly reluctant to about-face mid-corner in an orgy of oversteer. Even if the back end does step out it generally only takes a smidge of countersteering to correct it. I found it satisfying and entirely in line with Driveclubs direction, even if its a fraction simplistic. The biggest problem I had with it is that the handlings too sticky to make the drift events much fun; I generally found myself getting bogged down mid-corner because its surprisingly difficult to maintain momentum. Driveclubs car selection is nicely curated to represent some of Europes most desirable sports cars, grand tourers, supercars and hypercars, plus a smattering of hot hatches as an entry point. They look absolutely remarkable. Theyre best enjoyed from inside the cabins, where the attention to detail is so extreme that even the windscreens show those subtle semi-circle scuffs on the glass you get from the wipers when the glare of the sun catches them. Supercars like the Marussia B2 have fully functioning screens for their rear-facing cameras mounted in the centre console in lieu of a rear-view mirror, too, which developer Evolution captured exquisitely. Even little touches like the custom door-opening sequences, tailored to the configuration of the exterior and interior door handles, go a long way in making these rides feel real in a way racing games rarely manage. They sound exceptional too; Gran Turismo could learn a lot from this example. Driveclub looks amazing at night. Its strange that the car list is so heavily biased towards European models, though; almost exclusively so, in fact. Theres actually only a single American car  the Hennessey Venom GT  and even thats really just a Texas-built powerplant shipped over to the UK and manhandled into a modified Lotus Exige. More bafflingly, there are no Japanese cars at all. No doubt theres some great stuff in Driveclub, including some properly amazing, lesser-known models that even the completely stacked Gran Turismo series is still omitting. But car lovers are nothing if not tribal, and this surprisingly insular day-one vehicle roster is going to rustle some jimmies. Performance upgrades and tuning arent featured, although visual customisation is. Its not a completely freeform livery editor like the one found in the Forza series, however; its more like Grid Autosport, where you choose from a bunch of pre-set patterns, icons and numbers. I find all three distracting and garish; flaming eight-balls look pretty daft on the side of anything. You can turn all these elements off if you want, or just race in a factory colour, but even in single-player races youre still going to find yourself pitted against a bunch of dorky-looking lime-green AI Ferraris covered in more stickers than a childs bicycle. Aside from our cars, were afforded some basic driver avatar customisation, too. Theres not a great deal more to it than there is in the likes of, say, PGR4  choose a gender and select from a bunch of preset heads and shirts  but it feels like a sensible touch giving us some elementary control over what we look like behind the wheel, whether we stand up to pee or not. A simple but welcome option, like PGR4 and TDU before it. At any rate, while the garage is almost entirely Euro-centric for now, its racing locations are much less so. Tracks in Scotland and Norway are joined by routes across Canada, India, and Chile. As immaculately detailed as the cars are, I think Driveclubs tracks are doubly breathtaking. Postcard-perfect trackside vistas stretch for miles, but theyre just as capable of standing up to close scrutiny, from the individual stones in the road surface to the barely perceptible wiggle of a tautly stretched corner flag. The attention to detail is truly admirable; check out the plastic bags and Driveclub pamphlets wafting across the roads, and the multi-coloured butterflies doing the same thing. The arcade nature has brought with it a forcefield of sorts that will ricochet you away from rocky verges, clumped snow, and protruding guard rails and prevents us from interacting much with anything beyond the asphalt. But stuff like this, combined with the incredibly realistic lighting, really helps make the tracks feel alive. Most of the routes are quite skinny too, which makes passing without contact a bit tricky but contributes to an excellent sense of speed. Driveclub features a few dedicated, fictional race circuits, though next to scenic blasts through sun-baked Indian scrubland and icy, Scandinavian tunnels, they feel quite boring. Driveclub nixes ugly racing lines for coloured corner flags that indicate their severity. Perhaps as a side-effect of the narrow roads, the racing can tend to be quite aggressive; AI cars have a habit of blitzing past you suddenly and at great speed, and more than once I was poleaxed out of contention with just a corner or two to go. Theres no mechanical damage, but there is a speed-retarding penalty system for harsh collisions. It doesnt seem to apply to the AI, only to us, and its annoyingly inconsistent. Sometimes a slight tap when going two wide on a corner will trigger it, yet a massive shunt will go unnoticed. Its irritating and caused me a few restarts, but thankfully wasnt too common. A single-player progression system breaks up the racing with time trials and drift events. I quite enjoy the former; hotlapping against ghosts can become pretty compulsive. Of course, as with many of 2014s big-ticket racers, connectivity is part of Driveclubs key shtick  and it works well. Every track is populated with face-off challenges for us to try and beat in the process of racing or hotlapping: smash a friends (or strangers) average speed, drift score, or the like on a marked segment of track, and youll be rewarded with XP. Participate in (or create and share) custom challenge events, and youll be rewarded with XP based on your spot on the ladder when the challenge expires. I had a bunch of these challenges on the boil at a time, and by ranking decently I had a steady stream of XP accumulating even when I wasnt playing. I really like this kind of asynchronous multiplayer; its much like the Forza series Rivals mode. Skilful driving also racks up XP; the spirit of PGR lives on in Driveclub. Its a good thing these social challenges exist alongside the straightforward multiplayer racing, because it only takes a few days to mostly exhaust Driveclubs single-player event slate, and thatll leave you far short of unlocking all 50 cars. A clean and simple interface makes navigating to events and quickly jumping into challenges and pre-packaged multiplayer races extremely uncomplicated. Joining or creating an online race team of likeminded friends  your club  of between two and six players is important too. As rewards are shared among members, and also because five of Driveclubs cars (including the mental BAC Mono) can only be unlocked by levelling up your club, being part of an active club is beneficial. You wont be privy to all Driveclub offers playing as a so-called Free Agent. (You cant have the name Pickleweasel, though, because I already took it.) Your individual achievements contribute to your club XP too, although as a part of a club you can also tackle the club-only challenges. Theyre much like the individual challenges, and equally fun; each member can attempt the challenge, and the best club effort wins. However, Driveclub is overzealously protective of these precious cars: if you leave the club (or, as I discovered, play when the PSN is down), the cars are locked again. Pros Breathtaking detailGreat sense of speedConstant challenges Cons Little solo contentEuro-centric car list Driveclub is the best-looking racing game Ive ever seen on a console, but down deep its a more modest, conventional arcade racer than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today. While it successfully creates fast and fun races with a great sense of speed, the overly aggressive AI grates, the difficult drifting seems at odds with the accessible handling, and the single-player loses zest once the solo content runs dry. Im also surprised at how partisan the day-one car list is. That said, the tentacles of Driveclub can grip tight if you get invested in the games asynchronous challenges, and its very much geared around encouraging us to hop online and compete by making it so easy.", "date": "Oct. 7, 2014,"}
