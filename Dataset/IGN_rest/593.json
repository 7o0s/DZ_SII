The game is a visual treat to those who are not familiar with the series, but for the ones who are, it is one of the best, if not the best, Naruto game out there. The game has an AMV styled opening which is very reminiscent to the anime. Once I got to the main menu I was greeted with a bunch of game modes (and Naruto posing for each option). The game offers the main story mode, an adventure mode, free and online battle modes as well. I was disappointed when I tried to open the story mode and it kept giving me an error saying that the game is being installed and I can only play the free battle. It may seem a little nitpicky, but the lack of a progress bar anywhere telling me the status of the install irked me a little, and even led to me restarting my console a couple times. However, the advantage to that was I got to play around a lot in the Free battle mode which helped me get used to the controls. And trust me, once you get used to the controls, the rest of the game is pretty easy, except for some of the boss fights. Fights in the main story range from single versus battles, team battles and even mob battles; where the player can go all out against a large group of enemies. However, while playing some of the mob battles where there is a huge demand on graphics, the battle between Uchiha Obito and the Mist Ninja for example, there are instances where there is a massive drop in frame rates which slows down the game. The story of the game follows the previous game and starts the final chapters of The Fourth Great Ninja War. The game starts off with an explosive fight between Hashirama Senju and Uchiha Madara during The First Great Ninja War, a fight which is of great importance in the series. After that we are fast forwarded to the present day, with Uzumaki Naruto getting into the battlefield of The Fourth Great Ninja War against Tobi and Uchiha Madara, while Sasuke revives Orochimaru and learns the secret behind Uchiha Itachi's mission from the Hokages. Just like the anime, each flashback is in vivid detail and will often include a fight or two. Further down the story we see an in depth chapter describing the relationship between Hatake Kakashi and Uchiha Obito. I do want to talk more about the story, but I do not want to spoil it for those who are still catching up with the series (guys, what are you waiting for?). Just one thing, those who are up to date with the anime, get ready for a lot of old feels to come back. If you watch the anime Im pretty sure you know about fillers. Thankfully, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 4 covers the main story, but skips all the unwanted fillers. A little thing I liked about the game was, during the main story, once you finish the portion of the story till where the anime has been released, the player will be blocked from recording any further. This may not seem like much, but it does keep people waiting for the anime to catch up. Other than the story, I played around in the free battle, which comes with all characters unlocked (and a whole lot of them if I might add). Returning to the game is the ~Wall Running~ feature, where two shinobis can fight while running on the walls. While in the previous games, the other player could only fight on the wall if the opponent jumps on the wall, this time one shinobi can fight from the ground as well. There is also a Leader Swap feature, which allows the player to swap the character to a second member of the team they have chosen. On the bright side, to keep things fair, the new character will share the same health bar. Once again drawing comparisons to the predecessors, players can activate all three fighting styles (Ultimate, Awakening and Drive) any time in a battle, a feature that was taken away from Storm Revolution. You can also choose between multiple jutsus and Ultimate Jutsus to use in battle. One of my favourite features was how the game has become a bit more realistic. The best example for this is the damage on clothes. When a character uses a fire based jutsu for example, the opponent's clothes take fire damage, and will be on fire for a while, which can be countered with a water based jutsu. You know, the little things. Once you are done with the story, you can move to the adventure mode, which allows the player to play as Naruto in an original story after the events of the main story. Players can travel from village to village completing tasks and missions. It basically adds a RPG element to the game, but it seems very unpolished. However, more than an extensive game mode, it felt more like an ode to the fans, as they can walk around in a very well recreated rendition of the village and locations from the series. You can also jump into an online mode where you can face off against friends, or ranked players. The online mode works pretty well, and matchmaking is pretty easy. Players can also customize their character, just like any other online game. The online mode is a whole lot of fun to play, especially because we get to see other players use different characters and use different combos and finishers. Just like its predecessor Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 has taken a cell shaded approach to the game, which I really love. At first I felt that the developers were being a bit lazy when they used screenshots from the anime for cutscenes, as well as dialogues, but eventually I started liking it. There are just some moments when the character's animations dont match with the dialogs, but it is not really that obvious. The audio is on point with the game, and for the best effect, I suggest you change the language to Japanese with English subtitles. The game is pretty easy, but just at the start. Later down the line the game gets really hard, especially with bigger, badder bosses. Another little feature I liked was, once you fail a battle, you are greeted to a screen where Hagomoro Otsutsuki says that the player is not ready to die and gives two options. The first option allows users to raise their defense, get a full health revive while the enemy continues with the same health. The second option allows users to raise their attack instead of defence. In short, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is a treat to the fans of the series, but can still be fun to those who are unfamiliar with the series. There are rumors that this may be the last game, which can be true because the manga is over, the anime will soon be over (hopefully), which doesnt leave much source material. Three more DLCs are on their way, so we can have some more material, but might focus on some filler arcs.
