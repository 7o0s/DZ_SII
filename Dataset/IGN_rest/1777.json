Its accessible enough for newcomers and younger players alike to enjoy, but with intricate mechanics to keep a more experienced audience engaged. Its also a beautiful love-letter to the Monster Hunter series, and presents an imaginative world I cant help but dream about just existing in, as dangerous as that would be. Unlike Monster Hunters action-focused gameplay loop of hunting, crafting, and then hunting some more, Wings of Ruin plays like a tried-and-true JRPG. It can be played if you skip its predecessor, too: while there are some returning characters you befriend along the way, you dont have to have played the first to understand the second. There are plenty of likable new characters thrown in as well, and its incredibly well-paced tutorials both teach well while letting you roam and do as you please early on. Wings of Ruin carries with it many great changes from the original, but some are, unfortunately, a bit of a letdown. Like its predecessor, it swaps real-time combat for turn-based battles, deep customization systems, a copious amount of side tasks, and a heartfelt story. It translates the classic Monster Hunter formula well, except instead of being a Hunter youre placed into the role of a Rider. Riders primarily befriend monsters (though they still make them into pants out of necessity, too), resulting in a party-building mechanic with somewhat similar to Pokemon, where each Monstie (monsters that are your besties, of course) has different stats, elemental strengths and weaknesses, and skills. This includes your Rider, too, who fights alongside your Monstie of choice and has armor and weapons to craft and equip. Each of the six weapon types have different mechanics, skills, and damage types, and you can equip three at a time. Being able to switch both weapons and Monsties out once a turn without losing an action makes switching between your three weapons and up to six Monsties a viable, necessary tactic and method to keep things from getting repetitive.Rock Paper Scissors - Battle! Turn-based combat is focused on a Rock-Paper-Scissors format with Power, Technical, and Speed type attacks, with each monster species (and Monstie) favoring one of these types. Wings of Ruin includes more intricate mechanics in a majority of battles than its predecessor, with monster parts to break and readable attack pattern changes rather than seemingly random ones.(You can read more about these changes in detail in here). Wings of Ruin includes more intricate mechanics in a majority of battles than its predecessorThough the previous method to reading an opponents intent was a near-impossible task, now it requires you to simply pay attention. If a monster becomes enraged, takes flight, or otherwise changes its appearance -- like when a Zamtrios becomes iceclad -- odds are its going to change the type it attacks with, giving you a heads-up to potentially switch to a Monstie that prefers the advantageous type of Speed, Power, or Technical to attack with. Its way more doable and deliberate than memorizing a dubious pattern with variables like in the first. Overall, I appreciate the combat changes. They make battles engaging, thought-provoking, and more reminiscent of classic Monster Hunter -- attacking Duramboros legs specifically will eventually make it topple over, attacking Kulu-Ya-Kus rock with a blunt weapon will break it faster, or hitting it with a Flash Bomb will make it drop entirely. Early on, NPCs will hand out tips like these, but further into the campaign these more often become rewarding personal discoveries (or exercises of previous Monster Hunter knowledge).Theres even more nuance to these battles, too, like the Kinship Gauge used to fuel skills and cool very anime ultimate Kinship Attacks, Head-to-Heads, your classic elemental strengths and weaknesses, quick-time events, and more. I wish I could turn off the QTEs so I could avoid button mashing, but that option isnt available. Eventually though, the length and tediousness of battles against your average overworld monsters began to wear on me -- even though you can triple the animation speed (thank goodness), and use a Quick Finish function when facing something significantly weaker than you. The latter was only useful when backtracking, but since the Kinship Attacks that require you to completely build up a skill gauge with other moves dont actually do all that much more damage than regular attacks and exploiting an enemys elemental weakness doesnt have that drastic of an effect, theres not really a reliable way to end battles quickly against monsters on par with your own power. It makes sense in a Monster Hunter context for battles to be hard-fought, but for a turn-based JRPG, the idea is less fun in practice. Eventually though, the length and tediousness of battles against your average overworld monsters began to wear on meLuckily, grinding specifically for experience generally wasnt necessary because of a range of entertaining side tasks Ill come to a little later, and the awesome new innate system that grants a huge EXP boosts for under-leveled Monsties. What a relief, since I loved experimenting with new Monsties on my team. Performance on the Nintendo SwitchLoading times were fast, but very slight pop-in and more noticeable, variable framerate dips were present on the Nintendo Switch. These were more noticeable while docked, and, oddly, during cutscenes. Because its turn-based, this wasnt disruptive enough for me to consider switching over to a PC instead. Other than that, I didnt encounter anything technical that disrupted my experience as a whole. I only failed against a story scenario twice in the 70ish-hour campaign (which could have been a lot shorter if I didnt tinker so much, more on that later), as it normally would require my own carelessness to lose. To counter the first, I simply upgraded the armor and weapons I had neglected. The grind for materials is also much more streamlined than in classic Monster Hunter; you dont need specific materials, just a handful from a certain monster or two you want to forge equipment out of. When nearing the end of the campaign, I found myself and my Monsties getting one-shot by a story boss. It took many hours to finetune my team, catch new Monsties up to speed with the rest, and craft equipment specifically for that fight. I indirectly gained a few levels in the process, and the new set-up then carried me to the credits, which I was thankful for. Storied ExplorationWhile Stories is right there in the title, the one told here isnt actually Wings of Ruins main draw. The cutscenes are often thrilling visual spectacles, and there were plenty of surprising moments that made me gasp or even get a tad emotional  but this is primarily a lighthearted story that isnt anything groundbreaking, complete with a mascot-worthy mouth-piece for your silent protagonist named Navirou who speaks heavily in cat puns. The writing can be funny, and I laughed quite a bit, but there were only so many times I could hear pawsitively clawdatious! before I wanted to pawsitively claw Navirous tongue out of his meowth. Sorry. The plot itself is actually pretty standard fare for Monster Hunter. The plot itself is actually pretty standard fare for Monster Hunter: something is making monsters run amok, forcing Hunters and Riders to face them. Odds are its being caused by some bigger, unknown threat, and it's up to you to figure out whats going on and to stop it. But while thats not exactly breaking the mold, there are some exciting subplots that keep things moving at a decent pace, like your newly hatched Rathalos prophesied Wings of Ruin rumored to be connected to the disasters, your renowned grandpas past, and lots of interesting characters to meet and team up with in battle. All throughout, the musical score acted as a brilliant companion, and I could not stop commenting on how great the music was within cutscenes and beyond. There is no repetitive battle music in Wings of Ruin, either, as this changes often depending on a variety of factors, making it so nothing ever got old. The story held on just enough for me to stay invested, but the actual gameplay gripped tight and never let go. I wish I had an endless amount of time with Wings of Ruin because its filled to the brim with fun activities to distract you from the main path, and I wanted to do everything it threw at me. I really cannot praise enough how much stuff there is to do in Wings of Ruin, and how enticingly fun it all is. There are tons of Subquests to take on outside of the core campaign missions. Some take the form of especially challenging monsters to track down and defeat out in the field, while others task you with collecting ingredients, a specific monster, armor, or weaponry.Beyond the specific Subquests, from the Quest Board alone you can also choose to take on Trial Quests, compete in a Tournament Mode, and even do rewarding Multiplayer quests  the latter of which can be completed with a real-life buddy, although youll be paired with a fairly competent NPC if you want to try them alone. My favorite of the new Multiplayer quests were the Exploration quests, which let me pick up multiple random eggs (containing Monsties) at once. Though I was never able to actually try any of these with an actual person, Im looking forward to riding with a friend in the future. I really cannot praise enough how much stuff there is to do and how enticingly fun it all is. While I easily spent hours doing tasks at the Quest Board, the world outside it is, obviously, pretty vast as well. When youre not in a town, youll be riding around one of Wings of Ruins six main hubs (among dozens more side areas) on your Monsties, gathering materials, fighting monsters, and exploring dens in search of eggs to hatch into more possible party members. The scenery is beautifully colorful, and just exploring on the back of my favorite monsters is a treat. Seeing new areas, like the bustling city of Loloska, or perpetual blooming cherry blossom grove of Pomore Garden, and new monsters always put a smile on my face. Incidentally, beyond the credits theres even more to do, including some truly exciting post-game content. There are also terrain obstacles while youre out and about, like breakable rocks or climbable vines blocking certain paths, which only monsters with specific field abilities can traverse. That put pressure on me to choose my team based not only on battle strategy, but field usefulness, too, as each Monstie in your party of six only has one or two field abilities. There are many useful field abilities that make exploration easier and restricted areas accessible, like Diablos Roar or Yian Kut-Kus rock breaker. But there are equally as many Monsties with less useful ones (some of which I cant say for fear of spoilers), forcing me to leave some otherwise interesting Monsties on the bench in favor of Monsties more useful in the field. I opted for the opposite near the end of the campaign, where I ignored off-limits areas in favor of a more battle-ready team, and overall had become tired of actively exploring every nook and cranny for items that usually werent all that impactful anyway. Though there is a fantastic fast-travel system, some areas are a far ride from warp spots, and schlepping back to those areas for a potential rare item just didnt appeal to me enough to go through the effort considering all the other things I wanted to do. This fast-travel system has been upgraded from the original Stories by removing the need for an item to warp to one of dozens of Catavan Stands throughout the world, and you can warp to any Catavan Stand from anywhere -- which also gratefully pop up automatically as a quick link when looking at a monsters location in the Field Guide, too. Constant, Delightful Distractions While exploring these open areas and completing quests, there is a near-neverending stream of distracting shiny objects in the form of new monsters, crafting materials, rare and challenging Royal Monsters, treasure chests, Monster Dens, and the ever enticing golden Rare Monster Dens. The procedurally generated dens where you find new monster eggs are the most important of the lot because they drive my favorite part of Monster Hunter Stories: hatching and customizing my Monsties, of which there are more than 80. However, Speed-type Monsties are essentially non-existent besides Velocidrome until you approach the end of the second area, which took me almost around 15 hours to reach. This is remedied with more variety, complete with a few fan favorites, right after that--but I also learned a few of my personal favorites are disappointingly unridable, like the adorably large Duramboros. Theres much more to a Monstie than just its species and preferred attack type: each one has nine gene slots, which can be filled upon hatching with either passive abilities like elemental defense boosts or active abilities like a Khezus Thunder Breath. Each species can hatch with only certain genes, but some genes are incredibly rare and powerful. Because any gene from any Monstie can be transferred over to any slot on another, theres tons of freedom in how you can build and tweak your team, and duplicate Monsties arent so disappointing since they could have a cool gene! So if you want, you could make a Nargacuga with Thunder-element boost and Zinogres powerful Thunderfist, or a Barioth with a huge critical hit rate and the ability to heal when landing a crit.The pattern, smell, and weight of the egg gives you a bit of intel on what kind of Monstie is inside, how many and how good their genes could be, and generally just how happy you should be with your pull. Anyone familiar with gacha mechanics will know the drill here, but without the microtransactions and artificial scarcity to drag it down, this system feels genuinely rewarding.Anyone familiar with gacha mechanics will know the drill here, but without the microtransactions and artificial scarcity to drag it down, this system feels genuinely rewarding.No matter the quest, the monster collection and customization mechanic had me searching for rare eggs and happily spending hours tweaking my team. Its a fantastic system, but it also has one oversight I have a huge gripe with: you cant see an individual Monsties full stats like you could in the first Monster Hunter Stories. You can only see an individual Monstie's best and worst elemental stats -- which I assume is tied to the overall simplification of elemental stats in Wings of Ruin. Even if that is the case, its still baffling for a JRPG, especially when Monsties can be born with stat variations and genes that make it no longer match the stats represented in Wings of Ruins version of the Pokedex.If You Want To Get in the Stat Block WeedsThe expected base stats and elemental strengths and weaknesses of a monster can be seen, but only by sluggishly opening up the menu, then the Field Guides, then the Monstipedia, then scrolling through to the Monstie you want to look at (it cant be sorted.)Its worth noting each monster is unique in its elemental weaknesses and strengths, and it isnt determined by a general type. These stats are rated by a point system up to 10. Referencing this, it looks like if its not an individual Monsties best or worst elemental stat, you can assume the rest are all equally average, normally one or two below the best stat. This would be an argument as to why they dont need to be on an individual Monsties stat page -- but the Monstipedia, of course, doesnt account for any of an individual Monsties genes or hatch bonuses, which pop up on the screen for only a moment, that you can never see again. I started naming my Monsties based on these and its annoying to have to do that to keep track, instead of just being able to look at a stat screen. The inability to see my specific Monsties Dragon attack and defense is really dragon me down. (What has Navirou done to me?) Its even more frustrating that at one point an NPC references the fact that the element a Monstie attacks with isnt its natural element, but its strongest, telling me I can see this in the Monsterpedia - but, this will just be wrong for some individuals with specific stat bonuses and genes.This missing stat information bleeds into your own armor as well, but Im assuming the armor shares the same defensive stats as the monster its made out of - so we can assume its all average except its best and worst stats. But this might be wrong, Im just assuming because I cant see any details. The fact is, I shouldnt have to be assuming this at all -- it feels like a very strange oversight from Capcom.You can change a Monsties elemental attack and defense type if you increase that stat enough, and like in the original Stories, a change to the attack will change the Monsties color (though in Wings of Ruin this change only appears in the overworld). However, Im confounded by this, too. I can reliably change most Level 1 Monsties attack element easily, but never for a higher level Monstie. For example, Yian Kut-Kus base fire attack stat is rated a five out of ten, and its thunder element a four. After giving it both Extra Large and Large Thunder attack genes, plus a 150% increase bonus, it still reverted back to a fire type after reaching only level 15. I wish I could see its hidden stats to see if thats the reason, and if this system can even be strategically useful--even if it wasnt, maybe Id just want to rock a Red Khezu with icy blue lips! But right now, I havent figured out how to get a high-level monster to change attack elements, though I've started chipping away at the postgame which has yet to reveal anything. Its not like Wings of Ruin is that hard, and its combat is more dependent on decisions made in battle than a Monsties minutely different elemental stats, but its still disheartening for people like me, who enjoy toiling away in menus to piece together that perfect strategy. My real worry is that this might not be the case when facing other genetically modified beasts in PvP, which I wasnt able to try ahead of launch -- without the kind of stat micromanagement that powers Pokmons PvP, for example, I do wonder how much myself and others will be drawn to play it here. Minor oversights and frustrations certainly wore away at me over the 80+ hours I spent with Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin -- during its campaign and beyond -- but the journey was well worth taking despite the frequent grains of sand in my shoe. Its mercifully free, gacha-like monster hatching loop is always exciting, and its combat and customization are both accessible but still intricate and rewarding. Its story is enjoyable if a bit cliche, but exploring this gorgeous world from the backs of my favorite monsters is an absolute delight.", "date": "July 7, 2021,"}
