This crowd-funded remake hits most of the right notes as far as the twitchy controller tap-dancing gameplay is concerned, but a soundtrack lacking in musical diversity and a limited selection of modes narrows both its appeal and lifespan. The original Amplitude is a musical mash-up of Simon Says and plate-spinning, and that hasnt changed for this 2016 remake. Youre still challenged to switch between the different tracks of a song, from drums to synths to guitars to vocals, to nail the three-button-based note sequences in each to trigger them in the mix and keep your score streak going. I started worrying less about the twisting note highways and more about my own cramping carpal tunnels. Sustaining the groove this time around is a little more streamlined, thanks to the welcome addition of a streak seek mechanic that lets you skip over adjacent tracks on your way to the next available sequence. Although you can still manually move from track to track, I found the use of the streak seek essential to maintaining my multiplier and racking up a decent score. Thats not to say that Amplitude is too easy, and in fact as I progressed to the higher difficulty settings I started worrying less about the twisting note highways and more about my own cramping carpal tunnels. Veterans of the original game can rest assured; Amplitude is capable of presenting as stiff a challenge to your sense of rhythm and digital dexterity as ever. Block Rockin Beeps Which is a good thing, since increasing the difficulty is one of the only ways to prolong Amplitudes lifespan. The remix mode and online multiplayer from the original are absent from this remake, and the included soundtrack lacks any big names as it skews heavily towards electronica, most of which was created in-house at Harmonix. To be fair the purpose-built bleeps and bloops do suit the neon-soaked psychedelia of Amplitudes aesthetic, but the songs themselves are mostly forgettable. 15 of them form the backbone of the ,oncept album campaign mode, an interesting albeit short-lived journey along the neural pathways of a comatose patient. The majority of these tunes blend into each other and lack any real hooks; after hours spent playing, Im struggling to remember any of them now that Ive put the controller down, which dulls any impulse I have to pick it back up again. There are four 'Beat Blaster' ships to choose from, each with the exact same abilities. The rest of the 30 songs are mostly borrowed from indie games such as Transistor and Skullgirls, or provided by indie artists like Jim Guthrie and George & Jonathan. There are a few standouts  Freezepops Phantoms is a personal favourite  but as a collection it just isnt on par with the more eclectic tracklist of the original game, which spanned David Bowie to Blink-182 and Slipknot to Run-DMC. Still, if you do dig the tunes on offer and you have a few like-minded friends around, Amplitude can be played by four players in either individual or team-based score attack modes. Local multiplayer can serve up some frantic fun, particularly with the inclusion of an eject power-up that launches an opponent right off their track. However, the curious inability to set individual player difficulty settings creates somewhat of an imbalance when you have seasoned hands playing alongside newcomers, lessening its overall appeal as a party game. Pros Streak seekInteresting campaign conceptChallenging on higher difficulty settings Cons Soundtrack lacks diversityFew modes Despite its improved HD veneer and tweaked controls, I just didnt find the Amplitude of 2016 to be as addictive or long-lasting an experience as the Amplitude of 2003. I had some fun with it for as long as it took to play through its hypnotic campaign and unlock all its tracks in the quickplay mode, but the samey soundtrack and meagre selection of modes meant that I had little motivation to return to it thereafter. Committed high score-chasers will probably stick around in an effort to top the online leaderboards since the challenge is most certainly still there, but for everyone else Amplitude will likely feel like a commendable cover of a classic, but a mere cover all the same.", "date": "Jan. 8, 2016,"}
