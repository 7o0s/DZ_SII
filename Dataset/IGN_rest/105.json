This web of new overworld trials and Shrines is strung together by some fairly throwaway backstory, and its rewards are minimal. And yet, as it came to a close, it was what I'd played, not the story I'd been told, that shone through. I'd just been given 8 more stellar hours of one of the best games ever made. This isn't a goodbye from Hyrule, it's a nudge to return there. While its teed up as story-focused DLC, The Champions Ballad feels much more akin to the first DLC pack, The Master Trials, in structure. Its definitively endgame material, focused on challenging players who think theyve mastered Breath of the Wilds beautifully tessellated systems. That quest starts out by taking you back to where it all began: the Great Plateau (a.k.a. the most beautiful tutorial yet conceived) and transforming it into a much more dangerous territory. Handing you a new weapon, the One Hit Obliterator(!), the quest suddenly becomes a neat survival challenge - you kill everything in one hit, but everything kills you in one hit, too. And I mean everything - I spent five minutes running away from bees at one point. Once youve cautiously dispatched new nests of monsters, youre given four sets of new quests, each loosely themed around one of the four Champion characters. This is the best of what The Champions Ballad has to offer: a mixture of new boss monsters to fight, inventive time trials (brush up on your shield surfing), and some gratifying treasure hunts - all relying on your intimate knowledge of the worlds map to even find them in the first place. The only real downside here is how each Champions questline is topped off with repeated boss fights from the main game, only made minutely more challenging than they were in the first instance. Every single quest objective rewards you with a new Shrine to complete, offering over a dozen more of BotWs gratifyingly frustrating, How did I not think of that in the first place? one-shot puzzles. Add on a slightly unexpected final quest that I wont spoil, and theres around six to eight hours of new material in the main story quest alone. Sadly, only around 20 minutes of that  made up almost entirely of flashback cutscenes invoked by nomadic accordion musclebird, Kass  amounts to actual, you know, story. It makes for an odd feeling, because the hope was that this DLC might round out the story in some way, or offer a further glimpse at whats next for this Hyrule. And yet vanquishing Ganon still sends you back to your last save, Zelda remains a voice in your head, Link will always remain on his heros quest. Theres none of the resolution Id hoped to see. Im not necessarily sure Nintendo wants to make a true ending beyond the teasing, open-ended one it already gave us - a point possibly proven by its final gift. But what Nintendo has made is, once again, magnificent. The Champions Ballad questline is Breath of the Wild in microcosm  a supremely made set of brilliant and surprising overworld encounters, peppered with satisfying miniature puzzle-dungeons, and overlaid with, yes, a slightly underfed approach to storytelling. Alongside the main quest, there are yet more treasure hunts for new armour, mostly recognisable from previous games  Toon Links lobster shirt, Zants helmet from The Twilight Princess, and more. Like The Master Trials, all of this armor is wildly underpowered by the time you come to the endgame, serving more as fan service than utility. Horse armour that allows you to warp your horse wherever you are on the map is more useful but, again, would have made more sense earlier. But theres one more addition. The improbable addition of a Sheikah motorbike  awarded for finishing the Ballad storyline  wouldnt have made much mechanical sense in the context of the main game, but as I realised I had no more quests to complete, it was the Master Cycle Zero that I summoned. Its the perfect tool for exploring the Hyrulean nooks and crannies youve failed to visit over the course of your journey. Im sure that  apart from the sheer, dumb delight of giving Link a weird old hog to zoom about on  this is the point, because Ive played at least another two mindless hours since I finished the quests simply because of how effortless it makes travel. The Champions Ballad isnt the extra dose of story for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that many fans were expecting, but it would be churlish to turn down another chunk of hours with one of gamings greatest achievements. Even better, those hours are filled with new surprises, endgame-level challenges, and the weirdest post-game reward of recent years.", "date": "Dec. 13, 2017,"}
