This was once the mantra of the creative kid in the boring backyard; now its a pitch well-suited for Warframe. Theres nothing openly exciting about where its repetitive mission designs take you, but the huge variety of weapons, powers, and combat suits lets your creativity open up the battlefield to fun experimentation  that is, if youre willing to pay. Warframe is a free-to-play, third-person, co-op shooter in the vein of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but with approximately 250 percent more ninjas wearing sci-fi suits (the titular warframes). The starter suits offer plenty of variety right from the get-go: one, Excalibur, is a well-balanced set thats a good starting point for beginners. Another, the Loki set, lets you trick enemies with decoys and turn invisible in an instant. It feels especially sneaky and manipulative in a rewarding way. Each of these suits function as entirely different characters, and each is fun and challenging to play with. So, these sleek, awesome warframe-ninjas you play as? They fight mean aliens. Thats about as deep as the story dives, unfortunately. Relative to other co-op centric shooters like Left 4 Dead and Borderlands that use characters and humor so well, something important feels missing. But of course, that doesnt really reduce the effectiveness of Warframes action-heavy gameplay, or the pleasure that comes from slicing and shooting its variety of faceless and disposable enemies, including riflemen, shield carriers, and napalm launchers. Why am I killing these guys? Who cares. Now excuse me while I power-slide down a hill, flip into the air, and fire an arrow into a dudes head before I land. The most glaring issue I faced as a new player is that Warframe doesnt explain things well enough. Suits need to be modded with abilities, but the menus are unintuitive. Sometimes slotting a new power works fine, but other times the screen flashes red but doesnt tell you whats wrong. The interstellar mission-select screen is also unhelpful, as it doesnt show you at a glance which planets have missions that are unlocked and ready for you to begin, forcing you to click on each one to track them down. It also doesnt put much care into making missions feel distinct. They include the following: killing things and then blow up a reactor, killing things and then rescuing a person, killing things and then killing a boss, etc. Point is, though theyre different in name, most of Warframes dozens of levels feel exactly the same. Follow the dot on the minimap, shoot or stab the things that reside there, and then keep going. However, because the combat is so much fun I didnt mind replaying levels multiple times to conquer them in different ways. With a party of four players, its wise to think about team composition  especially in more difficult stages. Like in most MMORPGs, a healer and a front-line tank prove essential for most hectic fights. Cutting through hordes of enemies with a well-rounded team is fast, fun and satisfying. Playing a level alone, meanwhile, is a big change of pace. Because you take a massive cut in firepower, its more important to earn stealth kills and avoid alarms. I played through one area crouched with a bow and a glaive, then I played it again with a shotgun and fiery area attacks. You have complete control over the pacing of combat, which feels welcome and invigorating in a shooter. The biggest draw of Warframe lies in using the variety of suits, weapons, and other gear. This introduces a huge caveat  Warframe is a free-to-play game, and its in-game purchases can get very, very expensive. There are over a dozen warframes for sale, as well as dozens of other weapons, drones, and modifications. If you want a small selection of characters and only a few weapons to swap between them, youll end up dropping a full $60 on Warframe in no time. The in-game currency is earned too slowly to be rewarding; after four hours of play I was still at level one and I hadnt accrued enough money to buy even the cheapest of suits. Rewards earned from playing normally feel purposely stunted, and its very disappointing for a game that couldve kept me hooked long enough to fall in love with it (and throw money at it) with a little enticement. The store itself could also be more transparent. For example, I bought a sniper rifle with real money. When I used it in a game, the reticle was so full of lines, dots, and other crap that I could hardly see what I was supposed to shoot. A preview option would've been handy, especially when things are so expensive. Pros Fast gameplayVariety of powersGreat co-op Cons Expensive itemsBoring story Warframe tips the scales too far in one direction. The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and its reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be. Still, if you plan to pick it up, its worth dropping $60 and pretend theres nothing else to it.", "date": "Dec. 5, 2013,"}
