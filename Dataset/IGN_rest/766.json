It not only operates in the world of terrorism and counter-terrorism, but trades on images of that particular day. Some of these moments in the movie are strong and powerful, but all too often they fall flat. The tale finds Milla Jovovich playing Kate Abbott, a US Government employee at the embassy in London who has been tasked with sniffing out a possible threat against the States. We know Abbott is good at her job because we are told that she was very successful ferretting out another terrorist plot. In London, though, she instantly runs into trouble when several of her various bosses don't like the way she handles things. Survivor then swiftly moves into a woman on the run tale, where Abbott is the only person out there fighting to stop an horrific plot and her bosses at the embassy are either involved, incompetent, or two steps behind. Naturally, Abbott is discredited and believed to be dirty (mostly because she was in a location where a bomb went off, wasn't killed, and then disappeared). It is all exceptionally silly and wholly outlandish, and there are moments when the movie almost recognizes this. Dylan McDermott plays one of Abbott's embassy bosses (two steps behind, not incompetent nor evil), and there is a scene where he points out to everyone at the embassy that they have suddenly dismissed all Abbott's past successes in deciding she's the bad guy. It feels less like a character talking to someone else in the film and much more like the audience yelling at the screen. Sadly, McDermott's character fails in his attempt to stop the movie from going off the rails and does so because he has to  Survivor would instantly come crashing down if anyone at the embassy listened to him. Rather than rerouting itself to a more sane, believable story, the film continues careening down a ludicrous track. There are moments in the movie where a single phone call could put an end to the terrorist plot, the sort of phone calls that are probably made everyday (e.g. flagging someone's passport so that they get questioned upon arrival in the US). However, as Abbott is perceived as dirty, the calls don't get made and things progress towards their predictable ending. Jovovich is generally solid in the role, and it's great to see a heroine at the center of the film trying to save the world, but she is hurt by the fact that Survivor never seems quite sure of her history or skills. There are moments when she is wholly unaware of protocol and acts like an espionage neophyte (one who has never even seen a spy movie), and others where she is a seasoned pro. More hamstrung than Jovovich is Pierce Brosnan, who plays an expert bomb maker and contract killer. Audiences are used to seeing the actor with a gun in hand, but not as the merciless, cruel, calculating baddie he plays here. It is a role which could be great if only Survivor could get out of its own way. It can't, and rather than let Brosnan go all out, it offers him foolish bits of dialogue and worse explanations from others about his character's history. Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, James D'Arcy, and Roger Rees are all similarly constrained. It is a good cast doing their best, yet trapped by bad dialogue and silly machinations used in service of a never-in-doubt ending. If Survivor opted to not follow the predictable, well-worn path at any point, some of the poor earlier choices could be forgiven, but it never strays. It is a movie making a beeline for its climax and which is going to get there no matter the cost. The goal may be laudable, to honor those who have thwarted, the movie says, 53 terrorist attacks in New York alone post 9/11. If we are to believe the film though, the institutions out there to protect us aren't doing that job at all. Instead, the task falls to single individuals who are thwarted by the agencies for which they work. Pros Actors give it their allInteresting potential threat Cons Obvious storyPoor dialogueMurky character histories Nearly 14 years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, we have seen images of that day used multiple times on the big screen. It can act as a powerful shorthand attempting to explain why our nation has taken various actions (for good or ill). In Survivor, it is used to explain why one person takes her job so seriously and to convince the audience that we are not safe. The film is particularly disappointing as McTeigue also directed V for Vendetta, a much sharper, much more intriguing, much more thought-provoking look at our post-9/11 world.", "date": "May 31, 2015,"}
