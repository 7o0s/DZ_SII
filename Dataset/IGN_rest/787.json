Beyond that, however, its too limited to be of much use in the long term, unless youre a developer aiming to create your own apps. Thats who this Innovator Edition is aimed at, so it mightve been more clear for Samsung to just name this what it really is: a developer kit. Hardware-wise, this $200 headset is polished and simple to use. The Galaxy Note 4 (sold separately) that powers it clips in easily, and the connection via the USB port on the bottom of the phone automatically triggers the custom software (which is installed off an included micro SD card). Because dust can get on both the headset lenses and on the Notes screen itself, wiping both with the included microfiber cloth before use is a must. In terms of fit, the Gear VRs white plastic shell is light and decently comfortable to wear. Velcro connects the foam strip that contacts with your face, and it can be swapped out for an alternate or replaced if its damaged or dirty. The head straps loosen or tighten easily, and a wheel on the top of the headset moves the screen closer to or farther away from your eyes to adjust focus. A sensor inside the headset detects when its close to your face and turns the screen off when its not to conserve the phones battery. Thats a useful feature, because the Gear VR connects to the Note 4 using the micro USB port, making it impossible to use it while connected to power. A trackpad, back button, and volume rocker on the right temple allows you to control most compatible apps without the use of a peripheral. Gear VRs interface is made up of square and rectangular panels that resemble the style of Microsofts Modern UI, with large, easy-to-read text. Flipping through UI pages by swiping forward and back on the touch pad and tapping to select makes navigation feel natural, and its easy to pick up and understand quickly. Thanks to the Galaxy Note 4s 1440p screen, the display looks nice (its higher than the Oculus Rift DK2s 1080p resolution), but theres still a noticeable screen-door effect that reminds you youre not actually where you appear to be. Response time is quicker and more accurate than Id thought possible for a device that wasnt designed to be strapped to your face from the outsetin fact, its comparable to the Oculus Rift DK2. It definitely leaves an impression, and the fact that its so easy to strap to any laymans face and get it going right away makes it a lot of fun to watch your friends and family experience it for the first time. Having used the Oculus Rift DK2, I found the Gear VR liberating in that theres no cord tethering you to a PC. Youre free to explore your 360-degree environment without fear of getting tangled up in a cable. On the other hand, theres not much you can do with said freedomthe Gear VR lacks the Rifts positional tracking, so your virtual self remains stationary even as you physically move around a room. That can be disorienting, and potentially nauseating, because moving your head vertically or laterally doesnt produce the change in perspective your brain expects. Most of the apps that come with the headset are simple media viewers for demo videos. You can, for example, watch short 360-degree videos taken from the cockpit of a fighter plane at an air show, or from the stage of a Cirque du Soleil performance as acrobats perform around you. Theres a cheesy Matrix-inspired short film where the viewer is interrogated by a woman who can control the world around you. Nothings worth watch more than once or twice, of course. As for the available games, most in the built-in Oculus store are little more than simple arcade shooting galleries in simple 3D environments. Think about the virtual reality game from Star Trek: The Next Generation, without the addictive qualities or any reason to play beyond the first couple of rounds, and youll have a pretty good idea what youre in for. (Ill say this much for it, though: tapping the pad to fire projectiles makes me feel like the X-Mens Cyclops.) Keep in mind that some of the games require a bluetooth gamepad to function, too. You can also activate the Note 4s camera from within and walk around your house using it as a proxy for your eyeballs. Theres no practical use for this, really; its just kind of neat. Its a strange sensation to view things from a perspective thats about two inches farther forward than youre accustomed to, and lacking proper depth perception (because theres only one camera), but its workable despite the noticeable lag. Beyond demo purposes and simple amusements, the only real long-term use for the Gear VR (for now) seems to lie in the theater app, which allows you to view any video on your phone in a virtual movie theater. I could eventually see myself using a viewer like this to watch movies while traveling to completely block out the plane or train Im on. However, its not quite there yeteven with the 1440p screen, the resolution is too grainy for the viewing experience to be very good. Pros Ease of useLight and comfortableGreat intro to VR Cons No positional trackingFew interesting apps The Samsung Gear VR is a great, portable introduction for Samsung Galaxy Note 4 owners to the possibilities opened up by the Oculus technology that powers itbut for consumers, thats all it is for now. Its fun, and its an important stepping stone on the path to wireless head-mounted virtual-reality displays, but this developer kit has precious few applications for it outside the novelty of experiencing VR for the first time. If youre a developer with big ideas for virtual-reality Android apps, jump right on board; if youre a VR enthusiast, just keep in mind that you still have to wait before youll have more than a party trick in your hands.", "date": "May 2, 2015, 1"}
