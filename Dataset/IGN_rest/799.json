It also comes with the additional caveat that Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is the only Wii U game built to take advantage of the required hardware. Enter the Hori Battle Pad for Wii U. This alternative controller mimics the appearance and performance of a GameCube input device, comes with the added benefit of support across a variety of games spanning Virtual Console, Wii, and Wii Uand it works right out of the box with your Wii U for just $25. Branding on the controller is a little confusing: the box says its for Wii U, but the controller sports the Wii logo. The Battle Pad is shockingly lightweight the first time you hold it in your hands, but it doesnt feel cheaply made. Hori's controller is actually quite worthy of its inspiration: the analog joystick, face buttons, and c-stick offer a solid build quality thats responsive and sturdy. And keeping the face of the Battle Pad consistent with the GameCube controllers layout makes it comfortable and familiar, too. Manufacturer Hori didnt pass on the chance to improve Nintendos GameCube controller, thoughwith mixed results. The larger directional pad is convenient and softer, but it has a spongy feel that feels inconsistent with the d-pad of the Wii U GamePad or Wii remote, as well as the rest of the buttons on the controller. And the push style ZL, ZR, left trigger, and right trigger buttons put the Battle Pad on par with modern Wii U (or Wii) Pro Controllers, but the loss of springy left and right triggers takes some adjustment, especially for grizzled Smash veterans. With less resistance offered, the difference is immediately apparent to anyone whos grown accustomed to the clicks of the GameCube controller. Horis tweaks ultimately lead to a set of parallel situations for the Battle Pad. As an alternative for someone who never used a GameCube controller, its a decent input device that feels good. The elite Smash player, on the other hand, will appreciate some of the modifications but in the end not find much to compel them to make the switch from an official GameCube controller. If you fall somewhere in between, youll want to get some hands-on time first before committing to a purchase. Balancing this out (in terms of value, at least) is the fact that the Battle Pad is detected as a Pro Controller, since it plugs into the base of the Wii remote. It thus supports compatibility with a variety of games, including Wii mode, but with a few limitations: some Nintendo games like Super Mario 3D World dont offer customizable control options, meaning youll use the X or Y button strictly as run inputs while B and A control jumping. For anyone whos played a Mario platformer in the last decade, this is a major hurdle on par with the time Mega Man Anniversary for the GameCube swapped the well-known fire and jump inputs. Sadly, the Battle Pad doesnt offer a way around this issue. The Battle Pad comes in Mario, Luigi, and Pikachu-colored variants; the first two look right at home when paired with a Mario or Luigi Wii remote. Overall, though, the Battle Pad saves you from having to buy both a GameCube controller and a Pro Controller, and when configurable button-mapping is available, it's a great way to play a lot of Nintendo 64 Virtual Console games compared to some of the other controllers on the market. Pros Well-madeBigger d-padSturdy, responsive buttons Cons Spongy d-padPush-style triggers When youre trying to quickly thwack an opponent out of the ring in Super Smash Bros., Horis Battle Pad for Wii U doesn't disappoint. That is, as long as you can live with the adjustments Horis made to Nintendos GameCube controller designsome of Horis well-intended changes have negative effects that make the Battle Pad hard to recommend to veteran Smash fans. If that isnt an issue, then youll get a lot of bang for your buck, as the Battle Pad doubles as an another Wii U or Virtual Console controller. Just make sure the game you plan to use it for supports custom input configurations.", "date": "April 19, 2015"}
