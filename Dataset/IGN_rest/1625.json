Mutant Mudds is one of those titles. The game is retro throwback care of developerRenegade Kid, and should hit the spot for gamers who grew up in the 8-bit era, as well as those who can appreciate the joys of pure, simple, old school platforming. The game follows Max, a blonde, bespectacled kid who is out to save his planet from the mutant mud monsters that are trying to take over. Helping him achieve this goal is a bubble blaster and water pack that allows him to hover for a short period of time. In each of the 40 levels Max must find the hidden water sprite, which he needs to collect to get rid of the mud creatures. The level design is clever and challenging, and learning the ropes of each area is not only entertaining, but also quite difficult at times. Shoot those mud monsters! One of the more interesting mechanics of Mutant Mudds is that it has players jumping between the background and foreground to access different sections of the level - something made that much cooler by the 3D effect. The game has a lot of personality, and it really comes through how much love the developers have for the retro game experience. In fact, half of the levels are either gray scale Game Boy-inspired areas or red and black Virtual Boy-inspired ones. For anyone who owned these systems, it's a well-done and much-appreciated throwback. The only complaint I have against Mutant Mudds is that it could have used a little more variation of gameplay. A different weapon or two, or perhaps a few more ways to interact with the world outside of shooting enemies, would have gone a long way in fleshing out the experience. The game is also rather short - you can clear all the levels and collect everything in just a few hours. It's still a great download and tons of fun, but these two factors do bring it down from being truly amazing. CLOSING COMMENTS Mutant Mudds is a fitting homage to the 8-bit era of gaming. Its got lots of personality, and though its gameplay may be a bit too simplified, the clever, challenging levels still provide plenty of good times. Retro gaming enthusiasts should particularly enjoy this title, though all 3DS owners shouldnt think twice about adding this download to their collection.
