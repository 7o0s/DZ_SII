Even ignoring Remastered Collections beautifully enhanced graphics, which wouldve definitely fooled me into believing these were modern real-time strategy games, the way original developer Relic expertly pulls off a brilliant recreation of the Star Wars-scale space fleet battles is nothing short of amazing. Time has been very kind to both Homeworlds highly atmospheric story, and its design. Its fantastic that new developer Gearbox has updated these games for a new generation of strategy fans. But of course I did play Homeworld in 1999, and a great many games since, yet these two 15-hour campaigns are still some of the best large-scale space battles Ive ever taken part in. The way fighters strafe and weave in combat is really impressive  they almost never have physics-breaking bumper-car collisions  and I adore watching individual turrets on larger ships track their targets. That breathtaking attention to detail, along with the newly refreshed models, textures, and effects highlight the creatively distinctive and often asymmetrical spaceship designs. A good-sized engagement of a few dozen ships is like a ballet mixed with a fireworks display of violent explosions, lighting up the already colorful nebula-tinged skyboxes like a laser show. Homeworld and Homeworld 2 definitely arent simple games, but their complexity is the rewarding kind. Controlling fleets that can move freely in full-3D space is challenging to get the hang of, and it can be difficult to even figure out whats going on when two armadas of fighters, bombers, and corvettes are all swirling around in a giant furball of a dogfight around frigates, destroyers, battlecruisers, carriers, and the massive mothership itself. Getting used to tethering the free-floating camera to ships or objects in the area youre interested in is the equivalent of finding your sea legs when youre accustomed to having solid ground under your feet. Homeworlds interface does a good job of helping you wrangle your forces, though, especially now that many of Homeworld 2s improvements have been retrofitted to the original. Zooming out to a tactical view of the area and giving orders to control groups makes things manageable, and double-clicking to select every unit of a type lets you take command of fast-moving and scattered ships. The toughest trick is giving orders to travel to a specific point in space - you have to give a move order, then hold Shift to adjust the altitude, and you have to constantly shift the camera around to get a sense of depth. Admirably, the interface does all of this without getting in the way of the action - even the build and research menus are mostly kept collapsed and out of sight. Subtle improvements, like the elimination of the need to refuel fighters and corvettes periodically, makes moment-to-moment gameplay move a little smoother than it originally did. Notably absent is Homeworld: Cataclysm, the campaign that came between the two numbered games. Gearbox says too much of the source materials from that game has been lost or misplaced to give it the full remastering treatment for now. Its a shame Gearbox couldnt take the Beta label off of the multiplayer modes before The Remastered Collection went on sale, so it should be approached with skepticism with regards to its balance and stability. However, its great that the it offers the ability to play as any of the four different factions from across both games. This means you can set up a scenario where you play as the Kushan from the original Homeworld against Homeworld 2s Hiigarans (the same people), or match the first games Taiidan empire against the second games invading Vaygr. Not that any of the sides is radically different in a mechanical sense, but the subtleties of each, such as the Kushans Stealth Fighter and Drone Frigate, give the options some variety. Its here that the research system that seems so superfluous in the single-player game (because techs are unlocked one or two at a time) actually matters, and allows for some crucial decisions for what type of fleet youll build. Homeworld will likely never be a competitive RTS due to its slow pace, but skirmishing against the AI or other space battle fans wont get old anytime soon. It also features a great fleet painter, which lets you splash your ships with pink and purple if you so chose. On the technical side, Ive experienced great performance on my GeForce GTX 970, and only one crash in more than 40 hours of play. The one significant issue has been that running in full screen mode has caused a strange problem where the cursor is constrained to roughly 75 percent of the screen area, unable to reach the bottom or right sides. (Windowed mode works fine.) For some reason, this occurred on two of three computers tested, and Gearboxs team says this is the first theyve heard of it. Much as I appreciate the inclusion of the original, untouched versions of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 as extras in The Remastered Collection, some slight updating wouldve been nice - for example, making them support 16:9 resolutions without having to go in and tweak .ini files. But they do run, if only barely. Trying to run Homeworld Classic at above 640x480 caused text to become illegible. But this is the only way to experience fun but goofy features ability to play through the Homeworld campaign as the Taiidan instead of the Kushan. Pros Amazing space battlesWell-told storyAwe-inspiring musicGood controls Cons A few tedious missions Homeworld: The Remastered Collection does a fantastic job of polishing up and reintroducing these formerly hard-to-experience classic real-time strategy games. Over the 15 years since it first came out, these exciting, large-scale space battles havent been matched, much less surpassed, and its outstanding atmosphere and story can teach modern game developers valuable lessons on how to make the most of simple animation, dramatic camera angles, and a largely classical score. With only a few missions and ideas that stand out as poor with the benefit of hindsight, its amazing how well Homeworld holds up as a single-player focused RTS, and I can recommend it as strongly today as we did in 1999.", "date": "Feb. 25, 2015,"}
