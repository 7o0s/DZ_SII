Its world and wildlife are engrossing and beautifully designed, and in classic Crytek fashion its one of the most graphically impressive games available on its platform  its currently exclusive to the PlayStation VR. However, when things go wrong (and they often do), they go very, very wrong. Unclear puzzles, nausea-inducing climbing, and a general lack of guidance make for an experience thats, at best, equal parts frustrating and fun. Tell me if this sounds familiar: Youre playing a game with puzzles. After trying a handful of solutions that seem obvious, you realize none of them are going to work. Twenty minutes later youve resorted to trying something bonkers, something theres no reasonable way the developers could have intended for you to do. When that doesnt work, you begin the pixel hunt for some hidden clue or item to solve your problems. Sometimes you find it, but sometimes you fall into a tar pit or off the side of a cliff, and feel the sweet but temporary release of death before being respawned and having lost a frustrating amount of progress. Thats the core loop of Robinson, a not-so-subtle futuristic/prehistoric take on Robinson Crusoe. The tale begins one year after your massive spaceship crash lands on an alien planet that happens to be populated by prehistoric Earth creatures. You are Robin, the lone survivor, a young boy whose only company is a an adorable hide-and-seek-playing pet T-Rex named Laika (theyre cute when theyre still small) and a floating AI ball called HIGS. Hes well acted and occasionally a bit funny, but Portal 2s Wheatley he is not. The premise of searching for other humans is simple but intriguing enough, but its really all in the service of showing you new environments  which are Robinsons double-edged sword. Jurassic World No matter where you look, the world of The Journey is beautiful. Lush jungles of twisted trees of all types crawl with wildlife big and small. Looming cliffs tower overhead and bubbling tar pits look so thick and gooey you can almost smell the sulfur. And because your crashed spacecraft was quite massive, the incredibly scenic environments are littered with white and silver space-age materials which contrast well against the natural look. Its not uncommon to peer up and see a massive section of a ship jutting into the sky like its another snow-capped mountain. It feels like a space that has been lived in by a real, lonely human being just trying to get by. Cryteks environmental storytelling is also on point. At the very beginning, you have a moment to look through Robins makeshift home. Its an excellent blend of both a life-support pod and a kids bedroom. Posters hang beside crucial equipment and spare parts have been assembled into makeshift gadgets like some kind of futuristic LEGO sets. It feels like a space that has been lived in by a real, lonely human being just trying to get by. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, getting through these environments can result in literal headaches. While maybe half of the puzzles are clear enough, the other half left me wondering what the heck I was supposed to be doing, which is much different (and worse) than a good puzzle making me wonder how Im supposed to accomplish the goal. Sometimes you need to drag a tool or a piece of debris along with you, and sometimes you can but dont need to. When you die the checkpoints are too unforgiving, so youre never sure if hauling something along is worth the hassle. But if you dont take it and you need it later, youll need to backtrack or just kill yourself to reset the checkpoint and try again. Making you experiment to figure out how to solve a puzzle and then punishing you for that experimentation is not a good combination. There are also times where you can command Laika to roar and scare animals so they move or drop something, but that ability is so rarely used that its often an afterthought. Sometimes HIGS will explicitly call that out to alert you, but other times he wont say anything at all. Theres also the issue of trying to navigate this world and accomplish your goals, which is an unnecessary hassle. At any time you can bring up an objective list, but theres no objective marker to follow. This isnt a huge issue in some games, where movement feels good, but in a VR game where youre using the gamepad to walk, lots of exploration can be nauseating. Theres no option to warp to where youre looking, only to make the right stick turn you in increments instead of smoothly (which can be a big cause of motion sickness), so the DIY approach to finding the path forward just creates a situation where youre forced to do a lot of needless walking. Worse, you spend a good amount of time climbing to high and low ground using a climbing minigame where you have to find and grab handholds on the rock face. But bizarrely, Robinson doesnt have Move controller support (even though youre carrying a device that looks a lot like one) or even use controller tracking to move your hands, so guiding those virtual hands onto ledges requires you to bob and slide your head around, awkwardly guiding them to the handholds with your nose and controlling the grip with a gamepad. Combine that movement with the fact that the ledges appear to be a few inches in front of your face (this is a first-person game, after all), and you have all the ingredients needed for a bad time. Robinson: The Journey is a beautiful world to explore, and being in the presence of dinosaurs can be awe-inspiring. However, almost everything about it that makes it a game rather than a non-interactive virtual experience is unpleasant. Slow progress and poor direction kills the momentum, extending what could be a four-hour experience into something nearly twice as long, and makes even the amazing-looking environments feel stale. The best moments, like when you think youre looking at at wall of rock and its starts to move, or climbing a cliff and realizing youre not alone at the top, are few and far between. As powerful as they are, they cant save Robison: The Journey from extinction.", "date": "Nov. 9, 2016,"}
