How about a laptop with dual fast GTX 980M GPUs in SLI configuration? If that lit up your eyes then say hello to the MSI GT80 Titan SLI from MSI, a monstrous laptop that will most likely climb up the ranks in your want list. I got a chance to try out the portable gaming powerhouse, and find out if it can truly replace a gaming rig. Design and form-factor The GT80 is a unique gaming beast that will probably make all the other gaming laptops look like wannabes. At the first glance, this large, rigorous looking machine gave me the impression that it means business. Courtesy of SteelSeries, the MSI GT80 is the worlds first laptop to come with a mechanical keyboard. The backlit keys with a red theme give great feedback, thanks to the keyboard switches built by Cherry. I loved the typing experience. Whats even better is that the WASD keys on the laptop are separately gold themed and gave a somewhat more solid tactile feedback. MSI has positioned the mouse pad on the right side of the keyboard which might look odd at first but is the most practical mouse design I've ever seen on a gaming laptop. It saves a lot of space and is convenient to work on. It's also very smooth and responsive and I did not notice any lag whatsoever. The mousepad holds a neat trick that doubles itself as a numberpad. By tapping a number lock capacitive trigger button, the mousepad lits itself and shows all the numbers, calculation symbols and the enter button. Tap the number lock again, and the mousepad deactivates the numberpad and returns to mouse mode. Unfortunately, you cannot use the mousepad to control the cursor while the numberpad is activated so this is strictly for using with an external mouse. A soft palm rest is bundled with the MSI GT80 that can be attached to the front edge of the keyboard though I never felt the need to use it. What is a bit unconventional is the rather large area between the keyboard and the screen. Inside this metal hairlined plate lies the powerful guts of the machine. The plate can be popped out with a particular technique, and MSI has given the option for users to easily upgrade the innards of the device. Inside, you find a user-replaceable 2.5-inch HDD with four M.2 SSD slots and RAM modules. Apparently, MSI has a 2-year upgrade scheme that will allow users to upgrade the SLI GPU MXM modules and the cooling systems for the next two GPU generations. This makes the MSI GT80 the most upgradable gaming laptop we've tested. Also worth mentioning is that there are literally no processors under the keyboard which helps keeping the keyboard and mouse area cool while gaming. Neat! The metal plate also houses the DynaAudio speaker mesh right below the display, and these speakers are loud and clear thanks to technology provided by the Creative Sound Blaster Cinema 2. The speaker mesh starts from the left end and goes all the way to the right side. In the middle of the plate, MSI has engraved a large transparent Gaming dragon logo, which can be seen from an angled view. MSI adds three buttons on the right side for powering the GT80, switching between the integrated GPU and NVIDIA, and a fan button that cranks the dual fans to full speed. Speaking of fans, this big machine holds a total of four fan vents, two of which are between the right and left side of the laptop below the removable panel, and two on the back, shaped like the exhausts of a Lamborghini. During my gaming sessions, I noticed that most of the hot air flows from the side vents, rather than the rear ones. The air can get pretty hot- enough to melt the cheese on your sandwich. The laptop spins the fans faster automatically during gaming sessions and it can get loud. When I pressed the fan button to max its RPM, it literally sounds like a hair dryer running at full speed. Noise aside, MSI has done an excellent job of cooling the laptop, considering the fact that the laptop holds not just one, but two of the worlds fastest mobile GPUs. Looking at the ports, the GT80 holds five USB 3.0 ports, three of which are placed on the left side and the remaining two on the right. The device also has a Blue Ray writer drive placed on the left side, next to the vent. The audio/SPDIF outputs and the SD card slot are also here. MSI has also placed ports on the back of the device, specifically in the middle of the two rear vents- an HDMI v1.4 port, two mini DisplayPort v1.2 and a power connector. Speaking of power, the MSI GT80's power brick is about as big as a red brick used for construction. The display lid is also beautifully crafted with a metal hairline finish along with two cuts bordered by two red backlit lines. As for dimensions, MSI claims the GT80 to be the worlds slimmest 18-inch gaming laptop, with a thickness of 4.9cm. Even though the MSI GT80 is a huge laptop, it only weighs 4.5kg. Display and Specifications The MSI GT80 has all the specs that a hardcore PC gamer would dream of. Under the hood lies a Haswell based Intel i7-4980HQ quad core processor, with support for 32GB of DDR3 RAM- enough power and room to do all sorts of process heavy jobs. The laptop runs on the 64-bit Windows 8.1, with some apps from MSI such as an MSI gaming control center. The unit we received had a 512GB M.2 SSD drive as a boot drive and a 1TB hard disk drive for mass storage. The MSI GT80 is equipped with an 18.4-inch WLED display with FullHD resolution. This laptop is meant to be a gaming desktop replacement, and the 18-inch screen does the job really well. I found the screen to be bright and vibrant during gaming when looking straight at it. Although, the viewing angles from the sides are just above average. But the real stars of the show are the two GTX 980m MXM graphics cards. We are talking about a laptop that can easily outperform a single full powered GTX 980 desktop card. Believe me, this machine can take on any game at full maxed out settings with ease. Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to test a multi-display configuration and find out how the dual GTX 980ms perform at higher resolutions. Although the MSI GT80 holds two graphics cards, some games actually performed better when SLI was disabled, i.e with running with just one GTX 980m GPU. This might sound weird but drivers and the engine some games use are aren't optimized for SLI mode. Benchmarks PC Mark 8 and 3D Mark 11 Storage Benchmarks Game Benchmarks Battery The MSI GT80 Titan SLI holds a large 8-cell Lithium battery. You might think that this would be sufficient to give you few hours of gaming but that's not the case. Using the laptop for normal use such as typing articles, and browsing the web, I would get just about an hour out of it. Switching to the integrated GPU and enabling battery saver mode would get me another hour out of it. Whats worse is that the laptop sips down battery really quickly when gaming- you'll barely get an hour when gaming. This could be argued by the fact that youre trying to power two GTX 980ms with a single battery. Nevertheless, this laptop is supposed to be a desktop replacement, and not like your average ultrabook to work for hours of use in an ultra portable form. Keep in mind that when playing games in battery mode, the framerates drastically dropped down which means the laptop is heavily throttling the CPU and GPU.

Also, most gaming laptops arent upgradable. MSI has tried to solve both these problems with the GT80. It can match your desktop rig in terms of performance and is fairly upgradeable. But that comes at a price and it's hard to swallow the price tag of 16990 AED that MSI is charging for the GT80. It's the most expensive laptop I've seen.</p> <p><a href=~http://www.tbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC00102.jpg~ target=~_blank~><img alt=~DSC00102~ class=~td-modal-image td-post-image-full aligncenter wp-image-42814 size-full~ src=~http://www.tbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC00102.jpg~ /></a></p> <p>Nevertheless, I still feel that this laptop is worth the price. With a mechanical Cherry switched keyboard, a multi-use mouse pad, an excellent cooling system, fast processor and storage, and two of the worlds fastest graphics cards in SLI configuration, this beautiful piece of machinery is the best laptop a gamer can spend on. I should even applause for the flexibility of upgrades MSI has offered on this machine.", "date": "Sept. 7, 2015,"}
