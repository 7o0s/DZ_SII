In The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a rare balance is struck where its brutal bullet-hell difficulty isnt a punishment, but an opportunity to see something totally new. Because of excellent randomization and seemingly endless content, Im still seeing items, bosses, and entirely new types of dungeons even after 30 hours of intense twin-stick shooter-style battle. And, every so often, I pause for a moment and appreciate that Im playing as a traumatized, naked child whos destroying poop monsters and zombie babies by crying on them because his crazy mother tried to kill him. So its something we can all relate to. While its randomized maps and collectable hearts, keys, and bombs resemble the dungeons of the original Legend of Zelda, the skills involved in surviving here are more about mastering your tear projectiles, which are are affected by your momentum at the moment you fire them. That enables a surprising depth in trick shots that can be launched further than their inherent range or curve off their natural four-directional path. However, because of the perspective, it can be hard to hit flying enemies, or large ones, due to shots passing behind their sprites when they appear to be on target. One of the best things about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is that every time I play, Isaac ends up looking and behaving radically differently  usually within a few moments of starting a run. He begins as a strangely adorable big-headed pink child with teary eyes that launch projectiles at enemies with typical twin-stick shooter controls, but picking up an item from behind a golden door can enhance his powers while disfiguring him in one of a hundred different horrible ways. One time you might pick up an item that turns him into a cyclops that fires huge mega-tears, and the next youll find a powerup thatll embed a meteorite in his head and cause his tears to orbit around him. Even better, if you find one and then the other, Isaac will become a cyclops with a meteorite embedded in his head, with giant, powerful tears orbiting him and obliterating any flies or spiders or bloated corpse-babies nearby. Those continue to stack as you move from dungeon to dungeon, which sometimes allows you to become wildly overpowered - and yet still vulnerable to an unforeseen enemy type or stepping on spikes. You lose everything when you die, so the stakes rise with every promising new discovery. It keeps you guessing and adapting to new powers and challenges, all the while rewarding you with a huge variety of creepy-cute artwork. Enemy variety is off the charts, too, with dozens of different attack patterns to learn and adapt to. The movement and attack patterns of several different types of spiders, hostile feces, ghosts, zombies, centipedes, blobs, floating heads, burrowing worms, shielded skull-inhabiting fleshy creatures, and way more are all different, and just when I think Ive got them figured out, they throw new combinations or variants at me and send me back to the beginning, where the whole cycle begins again - sometimes with an unlockable alternate character that changes up my starting stats. Pros RandomizationCreepy/cute artItem combosEnemy variety Cons Lacking info The time Ive spent with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has been non-stop fun and surprises, with just a tad too much frustration when I lose a rare item. But even when it slaps me down harder than Id have liked, starting again is always a treat, because Im likely to discover something new and darkly comedic. Thats plenty of motivation to keep right on playing this amazing game.", "date": "Nov. 26, 2014,"}
