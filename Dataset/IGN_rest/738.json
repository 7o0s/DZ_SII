So its a pleasant surprise that Rise of Incarnates does an excellent job of adapting 3D fighting game mechanics to fit team-based multiplayer, and that it does so in a way thats free (and fair) to play. Teamwork forms the cornerstone of these 2v2 battles, providing a rewarding experience for you and a friend who can work well with you. For those trying to go alone, however, the action falls a bit flat. Straight away, Rise of Incarnates throws you into the action with a comprehensive tutorial, allowing you to get your hands dirty while learning the basics. The controls, while not overly complex, are responsive, and as youd expect for a fighting game I found it easier to play on controller than on keyboard and mouse. The mechanics are simple, though as with most elements in Rise of Incarnates, its how you combine them that creates a wide range of possible scenarios. A hail of laser fire from your partner may allow you to slip behind your targets guard and deliver a flurry of blows, or your melee assault might leave an opening for your teammate to launch an enemy into the air for a combo. Each of the 13 Incarnates is the human aspect of a fantastic mythological creature. Terrence Blake transforms into the Greek god of war, Ares, a hulking figure in shining, spiked blue armor, clenching a massive battle axe in his fist. The scythe-wielding Dr. Gaspard Watteau becomes the Grim Reaper, his flesh melting away to reveal the glowing bones beneath.The visual designs are eye-catching, with lots of color on the palette, and they help bring these mythic figures to life. In addition, as time goes on, new Incarnates are being added to the game, one-by-one. Skirmishes take place between two teams of two, and its this team-oriented nature that brings things in Rise of the Incarnates to a tactical level you dont see in the typical one-on-one fighter. As you learn your own favorite characters, it behooves you to also find a way to complement your allys Incarnate. The powerful Odin, for instance, can harness a full arsenal of missiles, bullets, and even harpoons, but hes slow, and vulnerable in close-quarters. With the right ally protecting him from getting blitzed, Odin can fall back and do what he does best, harrying the enemy from a distance. This strategic focus extends to Rise of Incarnates Team Stock system, which grants each team six Stock points and values each character on a scale of one to three. This is an interesting method of balancing characters of varying power against one another, and it creates a unique level of depth and further encourages team-based decisions. A three-Stock combatant has more health and more potent attacks than a two- or one-Stock Incarnate, but using one puts more eggs into your basket. Do you and your friend both choose heavy-hitting powerhouses? If one of you gets taken out, the battles already half over. Do you try to find a balance? Maybe the two of you decide to go all-out and run a more economic duo of one-Stock Incarnates, relying on your deeper pool of second (and third, and fourth) chances to whittle down your targets and win the day. With that balance in mind, choices in the fast-paced fights take on new significance. You and your partner must decide if you want to focus damage on a single target, overwhelming your opponents one at a time, or if youll try your hand at pairing off for individual combat. In turn, how will you respond to one of you being the subject of a two-player assault? Additionally, each fighter has a melee option that launches their target into the air, prompting their ally to respond for a Tag Combo, rewarding your teamwork with big damage. Communicating these opportunities - made easier by Rise of Incarnates integrated voice chat - in the heat of the action is essential. When it all falls into place, the experience is satisfying. However, for those venturing into matchmaking as a solo player looking to enter a match, that sensation is rare. Rise of Incarnates does have matchmaking, but theres no opportunity to coordinate with your randomly assigned ally. Youll get paired with another random character regardless of Stock value, and from there you must try to hold your own - usually absent of the cooperation that creates Rise of Incarnates best moments. That reduces the proceedings to a monotonous hack-and-slash affair that often ends quickly. The good news is that Rise of Incarnates free-to-play model (similar to League of Legends) makes it easy to recruit friends to play with a batch of free characters, and to progress. Youll unlock characters by simply playing, or you can speed up the process with real-life currency. An impressive catalogue of cosmetic items like alternate hair, faces, colors, and weaponry can also be purchased with your hard-earned dollars, but thats the limit of the influence your credit card can wield - nothing that gives you a competitive advantage. So long as you meet the recommended technical specifications and have a microphone set up, the action is smooth. The worst I encountered were brief but semi-rare framerate hiccups when the several graphically intense visual effect flashed up simultaneously. Pros Colorful artNo pay to winSatisfying co-opStrategic fighting Cons Lackluster solo play Rise of Incarnates offers action that leans heavily on teamwork - when you recruit a friend, it shines by rewarding duos that master communication and cooperation. Experiencing Rise of Incarnates to its fullest requires a coordinated two-person team, as jumping into matchmaking solo pales by comparison. As a free-to-play game, at least its easy to recruit an ally to take into the fray.", "date": "July 16, 2015,"}
