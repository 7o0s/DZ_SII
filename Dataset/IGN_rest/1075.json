Thats pretty great, but once the silly novelty wears off, youre left with a mostly harmless infinite runner that doesnt do much to distinguish itself within a crowded genre. That being said, while infinite runners are a dime a dozen on the app store (actually, most are free), many dont feel as good to play as Sharknado. Swiping to dodge cars, jump on sharks, and duck below roadblocks is quick and responsive on a touch screen, and I never died because of what felt like a sluggish input. For a game that hinges on your ability to complete quick, minute tasks at a fast pace, this is a very good thing. Sharknado has three lanes to weave between, and they arent there simply to look pretty. The goal of some levels is to kill different kinds of sharks with bats, golf clubs, and other weapon pick-ups. A more difficult lane lined with obstacles might also contain rarer sharks, which net you rewards based on how many youve killed. Having to make quick decisions based on risk and reward adds a small layer strategy to a type of game normally focused on reflexes. Rewards for good play, unfortunately, arent so compelling. Every level has three parts: the aforementioned street segment, a surfing section, and the boss level, which is a showdown with a full-blown sharknado. After finishing one round, your character is booted back to the streets to do the same thing again, only with more obstacles and less room for error. There are no alternate paths or even an aesthetic change to shake up the bland, blocky look of the scenery, and the cycle quickly feels tiring. The song that plays during the surfing segment deserves a special shout out. If you imagine really hard, it sounds sort of like The Ramones, if The Ramones had written a song about not wanting to die in a sharknado. Its silly and it made me laugh, but after dozens of tries, it wore out its welcome. In-app purchases are common in mobile game territory, and Sharknado is no different  right down to the dual-currency system. Both gold and chum can be acquired in game without too much grinding, and the upgrades they unlock  like more durable weapons  are well worth the investment. Chum can be used to revive yourself after death, and each subsequent revival within a run will cost you more chum. Its a good, cheap way to offer a second chance and minimize frustrations. Pros Smooth controlsFair in-app purchases Cons Cyclical level designMusic gets annoyingChunky graphics Sharknados ridiculous tone, tight controls, and respectful in-app purchases make it fine to play for a while. But once the novelty wears off and you play the same level (and hear the same song) dozens of times over, theres not much left to sink your teeth into.", "date": "Aug. 2, 2014,"}
