Luckily, with a dash of mischief, a dollop of whimsy, and, yes, a hearty spoonful of sugar, Mary Poppins Returns manages to feel less like a cynical cash-grab and more like a visit from an old friend  even if the reality of her reappearance doesnt quite live up to your fuzzy memories of the good ol days. Set 25 years after the events of Mary Poppins, the sequel finds the titular nanny (who has effortlessly transformed into Emily Blunt) dropping back in on the Banks children when theyre all grown up. Feisty Jane (Emily Mortimer) is following in her activist mothers footsteps as a labor organizer with no time for romance, and nebbish Michael (Ben Whishaw) is reeling from the death of his wife, simultaneously trying to take care of their three children, Annabel (Pixie Davies), John (Nathanael Saleh), and Georgie (Joel Dawson), while struggling to solve a stressful financial situation. Needless to say, Mary blows back into their lives at just the right moment  once again intent on reminding both generations of Banks children that theres nothing more valuable than time spent together. Its oddly thrilling to see the reunion between the nanny and her former charges, with Mary marching into 17 Cherry Tree Lane as if no time has passed, and Jane and Michael instantly regressing to their younger selves before realizing that they should probably act like sensible, no-nonsense adults now. Mortimer and Whishaw present a convincingly synchronized sibling unit, displaying all the same grit and determination that Jane and Michael possessed as children, while the three new Banks children are all precocious without being grating. The loss of their mother has forced them to grow up fast, and Davies, in particular, sells the cynicism of a kid who is used to holding things together when everything is falling apart. As for the plot, Michaels money troubles are ostensibly designed to add a sense of urgency to the proceedings, but the childrens adventures with Mary Poppins are so transporting (and increasingly bonkers), the film sometimes undermines the gravity of what the family is facing, which results in a bit of tonal whiplash. But for the most part, in the steady hands of director Rob Marshall (a veteran of big-screen musicals like Chicago and Into the Woods) and writer David Magee, the story skips along at a jaunty pace and effectively recreates an enthralling  and occasionally ominous  slice of 1930s London, complete with a joyful detour into an animated world that comes close to recapturing the magic of the original. (An early song, which relies heavily on CGI effects to recreate an underwater world, is the films weakest, too reminiscent of Disneys more overproduced live-action outings like Alice in Wonderland.) Blunt has said that she tried to approach her iconic character just like any other role, rather than trying to imitate Julie Andrews  and that seems like the only sane choice, given the Oscar-winning, kitten-heeled shoes she has to fill. That results in a sterner (and hilariously, vainer) Mary, more in line with P.L. Traverss books, but also adds gravitas to the films more emotional moments  and there are a few. It takes a while to warm up to Blunts performance simply because she has a different rhythm from Andrews, but something clicks (perhaps not coincidentally) around the time that Mary and the children take a trip to interact with an assortment of anthropomorphic animals at a vibrant and lively animated music hall. From that point on, we have a better sense of Marys true self as she allows the children to see beneath her prim and proper exterior, and Blunt confidently makes the role her own with a little more sass than Andrews likely wouldve been allowed to portray in 1964. In place of her old pal Bert, Marys new (platonic) partner-in-crime is his former apprentice, a lamplighter named Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda), who is every bit as fleet-footed and charming as his mentor, with a cockney accent thats only slightly more convincing. You get the sense that Travers mightve appreciated Blunts iteration of Mary more than the originals; she famously disapproved of any implied flirtation between the mischievous nanny and Bert, but the chemistry between Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke was winkingly palpable despite her objections. Blunts take on the character is definitely more austere, while Mirandas Jack has eyes for someone else, giving the duo a chummy but less magnetic vibe. Still, the two are more than a match in the song-and-dance department, with one show-stopping shared number that seems to be begging the audience to applaud when its over (and gives Miranda an opportunity to showcase his rap skills, no less). At times, though, the team behind Mary Poppins Returns seems a little too loyal to its predecessor. From the staging and choreography to the placement of the songs, the sequel sometimes feels less like an homage and more like an outright recreation of the 1964 classic, just set to a slightly different tune. This is especially true of the music  written by Marc Shaiman with lyrics by Scott Wittman  which appears to purposefully parallel the rhythms and messages of the original, to the point where you might catch yourself comparing the two. While none of the songs are as immediately ear-wormy as the work of the Sherman brothers (and really, what could ever compete with Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?), each is charming in its own way  Blunt performs one of the most moving Disney ballads in recent memory around the halfway point of the film, and Miranda gets a chance to make his mark with a Step in Time-style dance number thats exhilarating to watch. What stands out most about Mary Poppins Returns is its heart; even more than the original, it opts for sentimentality over subtlety, but much like this years equally charming Paddington 2, its earnest intentions never tip it too far into eye-roll territory. Its life lessons may be a bit too on-the-nose for some adults, but its clear that now, just as in 1964, Mary Poppins has plenty to teach us. Mary Poppins Returns isnt practical or perfect  and at times it trips itself up by relying a little too heavily on your nostalgia for the original  but anchored by a heartfelt performance from Blunt, an irresistible turn from Miranda, and a bewitching desire to spark your imagination, its still a jolly holiday treat that wont tarnish your appreciation of the original.", "date": "Dec. 13, 2018,"}
