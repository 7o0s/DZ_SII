Nintendo uses constant misdirection from enemy invaders to build tension and poke holes in your best-laid plans. Star Fox Guards retro-inspired graphics can look a little bland next to Nintendos colorful HD standards, but theres a lot going on here. Varied enemies of all shapes and sizes will mess with your view of the action, forcing you to make tough decisions to counter attacking troops. Successfully foiling these invasions unlocks more powerful weapons and new skirmishes to play, which creates an addictive upgrade loop. The way Star Fox Guard splits all the information necessary to keep your base safe between the GamePad and the TV in an instinctive way is a notable part of its success. On the TV, you see an array of 12 video feeds from turret-mounted cameras which you carefully place inside your base, with one feed displayed large in the center. The GamePad displays a handy map that highlights each turret position along with motion-tracker data, so you can keep tabs on pesky invaders even when youre looking down at the controller. The two screens complement each other nicely, since the rules are clear from the start: Action always takes place on the TV screen, with the GamePad used as a vital tool to shift your focus between active turrets and fire on incoming targets. This isnt a co-op game, at least in the sense that other players cant pick up controllers to help you, but the two-screen setup works great in a room full of people. The frantic, high-stakes missions got everyone calling out enemy locations for me to react to. Star Fox Guards seven robot-blasting weapon types are standard fare for this genre, but each becomes essential to fight the robots you face in the 40-mission campaign. The standard turret cam felt like outdated technology once I got my hands on the Slow Cam, an awesome upgrade that bought precious extra seconds I needed to save my base from annihilation countless times. The Charge Cams powered-up blasts will kill surrounding robots in a cinch, and the Freeze Cam stops enemies in their tracks, making them sitting ducks to shoot and shatter with another gun. I, Robot You need them, because once the campaign ramps up in difficulty, Star Fox Guard packs devilishly clever robots into nail-biting enemy waves that constantly mess with your cameras. The 26 robot enemies are split into two distinct classes that showcase adorable personality quirks. Some of my favorites came from the Chaos class since their tactics focus on misdirection. The jamming signal from the Dishrupter, a walking radar dish that could easily be mistaken for a kids toy, scrambles video feeds and temporarily blinds you, and Pausemo is a nagging deceiver that latches onto a camera and loops fake footage to help enemies sneak in. Combat-class bots are no slouches either. The speedy F.L.I. rides a rocket straight into the center of your base to deactivate the core, while others, like the Cloak-R, take a sneakier approach that often made me panic because it doesnt show up on the GamePad radar. Meanwhile the Shieldtron hides behind a full-body shield that can withstand turret fire, making it a tough threat until you find a better angle to shoot from. Before every mission, Star Fox Guard gives you a count of Combat-cass enemies but keeps the other roles a secret, so I felt surprised as the action unfolded. The constant pressure made me labor over where I should place turrets before a level begins, and how to most effectively use my upgrades. Creative Chaos The main missions are mostly similar in structure  you simply have to survive until the waves of enemies are exhausted  but when you get into the dozens of optional side missions, Star Fox Guard takes this great formula one step further by adding allies to defend or limiting ammo, forcing you to make each shot count. My favorite missions caught me by surprise with fresh ideas like these. Carefully planning the layout of your cameras can often set up desperate moments during the end of a skirmish, as you rush to use any turrets left standing in a last-ditch effort to keep the base up and running. These tense situations are the highlight of a good action-tower defense game. Theres a competitive side, too  as you progress through the campaign, youre unlocking bots that can eventually be organized into your own personal squad to terrorize your friends bases. Its part of an optional challenge mode, but since victories and losses in that mode factor into the upgrade system, it encouraged me to take a chance and see if I could string together some extra points. If your friends squads arent up to snuff, Star Fox Guard lets you tackle other robot squad from random players on the internet to keep you busy once youre done with the main campaign. Pros Clever enemiesIntuitive controlsExtra missions Cons Bland graphicsSimple campaign Star Fox Guard is a fun action-tower defense game about managing different perspectives to put out fires as you use your resources to grow an awesome arsenal of robot-busting turrets. Its graphics are plain considering Nintendos artistic pedigree, but its still an elegant little game that can get a whole room of friends working together.", "date": "April 21, 2016"}
