It hit the Vita with a fresh perspective, demonstrating just how great technical street skating could be in 2D. OlliOlli 2 blows that first effort out of the water on every level. This is developer Roll7s Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2. Like that landmark game, OlliOlli 2 introduces the manual, bringing a whole new dimension to the gameplay. It works in much the same way, letting you land in a manual out of any trick and thus keep your combo going, opening up the possibility of beating each level in a single monster trick. Bluntslides are cool, but OlliOlli 2 introduces new tricks like darkslides. Each of OlliOlli 2s levels are short gauntlets, jam-packed with stair sets, rails, ramps, deadly obstacles and  in the case of the Titan Sky levels  towering robots, hovercars, and toxic ooze. The skating is pure and skill-based. Forget steering: this is a left-to-right stream of skating consciousness, where youre flowing gracefully from one mini set piece to the next, attempting to commune with the clever level design and trick mechanics. Flip tricks and grinds are the main tools of your trade. The former are triggered with a flick or swirl of the left analogue stick (potentially with a shoulder button held down if its particularly complex). So far, so similar. The innovation is that you need to catch the trick to land it, and the later you catch it, the better the rating you get  from sloppy to perfect. Tap X (or X and left or right for a manual) just before you hit the ground and youll be awarded a perfect landing. Grinds are a little looser to execute, only requiring holding in one of four directions (again, potentially with one or more shoulder buttons as modifiers), but the same timing applies: move and hold the analogue stick at the last second and youll get a perfect rating, this time accompanied by green sparks and a speed boost. Perfect ratings mean a faster-climbing multiplier for trick combos, but they also factor into the level design in a pretty major way. Once youre a chunk of the way through the career mode, youll come across grind sequences that arent possible to beat unless you nail the timing, or score goals that require switching grinds on the fly  which is only possible with a perfectly timed initial grind. Youll also be required to use perfectly timed tricks off ramps to boost to the next section or wind up broken and battered on the spikes below. The aforementioned spikes below. Thankfully, OlliOlli 2 doesnt demand that of you initially. In fact, it gives you plenty of time to get a feel for the systems and get your eye in. By the time it starts throwing steeper challenges at you, you should be ready for them. Each of the 25 amateur levels has five challenges to beat (beyond getting to the end), and theyre a great mix, addressing every aspect of the gameplay. From combo and high-score tests through to nailing specific tricks or collecting hard-to-reach items, the challenges are a great teaching tool in their own right. It wasnt long until I was nailing perfect single-combo runs and feeling like a badass. Theres always a steeper challenge, of course. Once you master all five challenges in an amateur level, a corresponding pro level opens up, with its own set of five. And if you can beat all 250 amateur and pro challenges, youll unlock another set of even harder levels. (Full disclosure  Im nowhere even near this.) OlliOlli 2 has a learning curve that seemingly goes forever, but its pacing is expertly judged. Even challenges that I attempted upwards of 40 or 50 times didnt leave me (too) frustrated. The mechanics are robust enough, the controls responsive enough, and the level designs finely honed enough that I was content to simply keep at it. The restarts are instantaneous, by the way. That helps a lot. Outside of the career modes 50 levels, there are another 50 spots to post a high score on  and see how you fare against your friends and the world. Theres even an Ultimate Spots Score, tallying up your scores across all 50 spots. Its a shame theres no way to watch a replay of the top runs on the leaderboard in-game to see how the hell the score was earned, but Im sure therell be plenty of videos floating around on YouTube before long. Its also a shame that the Combo Rush mode wasnt ready for launch. This splitscreen multiplayer mode will definitely help round out OlliOlli 2s ways to play when its eventually patched in. The Olliwood premise is put to good effect. No matter, because theres a lot of gameplay here already, and its tied together by an absolutely inspired makeover. The original games functional pixel art has been replaced by a highly stylised, flat-shaded look thats slick and contemporary, while also echoing points of inspiration like Another World and Prince of Persia. Each of the five locations is wonderfully distinct, taking you from the film back-lots of Olliwood through to the film sets themselves, covering Aztec ruins, the wild west, a creepy amusement park, and a futuristic cityscape. It can take a few minutes to adjust to the palettes and iconography of each new setting, but overall the visual design is a triumph. Its far smoother in motion than the original too, and the controls are every bit as responsive as youd expect for a timing-based game. Another bonus is that OlliOlli 2 is cross-buy between PS4 and Vita, and integrates cross-save to allow you to move your game between devices. It plays really well on Vita, with the brief levels and instant restarts making it a great short-burst game while out and about. Its definitely best on PS4, however. I found it easier to time my manuals with the Dual Shock 4s far more robust analogue stick, and the art direction and silky frame rate are at their most impressive on a big screen. Pros Trick mechanicsLevel designArt directionSilky smooth Cons Combo Rush still to come Theres essentially no limit to how good you can get at OlliOlli 2. Just when youve mastered beating levels in a single combo and timing every single grind and manual perfectly, there are a host of other mechanics to integrate into your skating to bump that high score even further skyward. Why land in a boring old manual when you could revert into it? Why do a standard trick or grind when you could add a rotation or pull off something more complex with a longer  and riskier - animation? And hey, are you grind switching on every rail you can? Its an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect.", "date": "March 3, 2015,"}
