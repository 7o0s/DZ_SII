Its cinematics are technically competent  even impressive  at conveying characters emotions without sound, but the story its telling is uninspired and the playable third-person combat sequences are overly simplistic and repetitive. At times, The Quiet Man feels like it was made for network television, and the interactive elements are more of an afterthought. The Quiet Mans minimal use of sound does effectively add tension, making it difficult to look away from the screen for fear of missing some important plot point during the live-action sequences. The hero, Dane, exists in a nearly silent environment with little to no audible dialogue. This creative choice forces you to focus on the actors facial expressions in order to interpret what he or she is saying in a given scene  and the actors do an exceptional job of conveying their emotions. When someone is speaking to Dane, the only sounds are the haunting, ethereal noises that let you know he understands whats being said. We also get muffled sound effects whenever he lands a punch or kick. In terms of its story, The Quiet Man is familiar and, at times, uninspired. After enduring a childhood fraught with abuse and tragedy, Dane enters into a life a crime and works as a bodyguard for one of the citys top crime bosses. In typical Hollywood fashion theres a forbidden love component, a damsel in distress, and a bunch of stereotypical (often dark-skinned) ruffians in need of a good beatdown. I did find myself becoming a better lip reader by the halfway mark, but I wished there were some clever twist to the plot to make the effort worthwhile. Instead, The Quiet Man distinguishes its live-action scenes with production quality that feels like a well-made episode of TV  minus the sound, of course. Its gorgeous cinematography includes long tracking shots of New York Citys streets and the intimate confines of a swanky nightclub, and the only times I felt engrossed were in these beautifully crafted cinematic moments. I found myself just button-mashing my way through every cookie-cutter gangster I came across. Things take a turn for the worse when the cameras turn off and youre given control of Dane for some third-person action. At first, the close-quarters combat seemed tense and exciting, especially when you perform a perfect dodge or block and follow it up with a satisfying slow-motion finisher move. However, the lack of additional moves and abilities to unlock meant I found myself just button-mashing my way through every cookie-cutter gangster I came across. Even during the span of its short three-hour campaign, the number of times you have to fight the same lackluster baddies over and over again quickly becomes repetitive. There are a few thrilling boss battles that offer unique challenges, since theyre more powerful and agile than your average opponents, but its not enough to carry the gameplay segments. It doesnt help that, unlike the varied live-action scenes, most of the in-game environments are forgettable  after the third or fourth graffiti-ridden hallway or dark alley youve basically seen it all. Theres currently little reason to replay The Quiet Man after youre done, but the developers are promising an update later this week that will let you enable the muted dialogue and audio to reveal whats really going on. That may entice you to give it another playthrough, or at least give those parts a watch on YouTube. However, with a straightforward and sometimes predictable plot, audio is unlikely to improve it much, especially since the creative use of silence is the main thing that makes it interesting right now. In a gaming landscape where sensory overload is everywhere, The Quiet Man offers something quite different and unexpected. The bold choice to mute out nearly all sound effectively adds mystery and tension. But Danes story is brief and not especially original, and the combat becomes repetitive very quickly, making this movie/game hybrid difficult to recommend as something youd want to experience as a whole.", "date": "Nov. 7, 2018,"}
