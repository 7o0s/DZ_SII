From the top-quality voice acting and the still-unmatched facial animations to the multi-layered crimes to solve, the parts that really matter work great on the Switch. The old-looking and empty open-world parts in between, not so much. Six years later, LA Noire is still a unique game. (Read our original LA Noire review.) There are cops-and-robbers car chases and occasional gunfights, but most of it is a smartly paced, contemplative challenge that keeps you thinking. As a Los Angeles cop working in the 1940s, youll be sent to a weird and wonderful array of crime scenes where you find clues, interact with witnesses, and draw conclusions with a limited amount of hand-holding. I never thought Id find myself interested in the forgery of pink slips until I met the diverse cast of suspects and witnesses involved in a grand theft auto scheme, and using the right pieces of evidence against each of them presented a test of its own. A few of the 21 cases are a little repetitive, but every time I was close to feeling bored, something completely unexpected would happen and draw me back in again. The stellar performances are captured down to every grimace and wrinkle.The interrogation system is still my favourite part of solving a crime in LA Noire, and theres a unique challenge in reading a suspects face and determine if theyre lying to you or not. The reason that really works is because of the stellar performances from the actors, which are captured down to every grimace and wrinkle. Watching one of the countless well-realized characters speak with a slightly lopsided mouth or twitch one of their eyebrows for just a moment, combined with a smart script, makes them truly feel like real people. Im not sure Ive played another game that does this quite so well. Even though the graphics have obviously aged in terms of lighting, facial animations still look outstanding on Switch, and keep the moments where theyre the center of attention feeling timeless. But LA Noire doesnt hold up as well elsewhere. The open world felt a little empty and lifeless even in 2011, but in 2017, its conspicuously so. There are cars driving around and similar character models walking the streets, but its all very grey and lifeless, with nothing to do except find rare cars in secluded garages. Despite that lack of activity, the draw distance is short and fuzzy, jarring drops below the targeted 30 frames per second rate are unfortunately common, and theres lots of pop-in. But it does run in 1080p in docked mode (and 720p in handheld), at least. The gunfights that happen in the open world are tedious and imprecise, too, and Ill remember them more for how much I felt like I was fighting the Switch controller than for any of the enemies I was actually supposed to be shooting at. Theres also far too much driving considering how uninteresting it is, though you can skip a lot of it to fast-track your way to the drama LA Noire thrives on. I just wish the tedious obstacles didnt exist at all, because just stringing together the good parts uninterrupted wouldve been so much better. At the same time, LA Noire definitely makes use of the Switchs hardware in more ways than most ports. In any control scheme, you can choose to play with motion controls to move the camera and flip around items youre inspecting at crime scenes. This comes in handy specifically if youre looking for a label or a model number, and the motion controls are precise enough to match the in-game animations well. If you want to stick to handheld, it also has touch-screen features that let you finish the entire game without touching a controller, except to get to the menu. That does have a slight learning curve, like remembering to tap twice to interact with an object and to hold down on your car to have your partner drive, but when you know how it works its a smooth experience that would probably translate very well to a mobile port. But no matter how you play, its great it is to have this full, story-driven Rockstar game available on a console you can take with you anywhere. Note that LA Noire is large enough that it doesnt fit on the Switchs 32GB internal memory and therefore needs to be installed on a MicroSD, but when it is, loading screens are short and the battery lasts just under five hours. The most important parts of LA Noire have aged beautifully, with incredibly detailed faces, diverse characters, and unique, challenging crimes to solve as a detective. The top-notch writing and voice acting bring 1940s Los Angeles to life, but are let down by a dull open world with frequent frame rate drops. Aside from difficulty aiming in gun fights, its a smart port with accurate motion controls and the ability to play almost entirely touchscreen, too.", "date": "Nov. 21, 2017,"}
