It's tactically demanding, and exciting both to watch and to play. Not only could I believe that this is the bloodsport of choice in some distant future, but I find myself wondering if you could make this game work in real life. Everything that happens on the field is appealing, and it arguably makes even better turn-based tactical game than Mode 7's terrific Frozen Synapse. Its only off the field that it drops a few balls. Cortexs fundamental rules are only a little more complicated than those of Fight Club: the offense is trying to get to the end zone at the south end of the field. Each touchdown is worth seven points. If there is a turnover, play continues with the offense going north. Any player can pass the ball, but the pass has to be in a forward direction. If a player runs with the ball, they must run in a forward direction, and forfeit the chance to pass. It's simple stuff that takes just a handful of games to figure out, which is great because the tutorial really only teaches the controls and the manual is wall of text on the ~help~ menu. The simple playing field and a handful of rules generate endless variety as two coaches draw detailed up plans for each of their players during the next turn. You can lay out waypoints for each of your players to navigate, tell them to delay orders in case you need to hit a careful timing, and fill out similar hypothetical plans for your opponent's players based on what you think the other coach might try to do. It's slow-motion competitive mind-reading, full of suspense and agonizing mental gymnastics. Once both players are satisfied with their plans, theyre combined, and both players get to see how their plans end up interacting with each other. Turns end after several seconds or (and this is more likely) when something important happens: a pass is caught, or a turnover takes place. Then both players get a chance to stop and adjust to the new state of play. The pacing is absolutely ideal: turns are just short enough that you don't have to worry about making overly elaborate plans that speculate too far in the future, but they're just long enough to allow for huge, unexpected developments. This also adds another interesting wrinkle: passes are a great offensive weapon that let you bypass a lot of territory at once and keep your options open for your next turn, but it's running plays that can actually be the most surprising and explosive, because they don't cause the turn to end and thus dont give your opponent a chance to give new orders in response. If someone fails to guard a running lane, or if the offensive player arranges a key block, then a good running play will usually result in a score. It's a really cool tradeoff. Randomly generated fields help keep things fresh. Wide-open space is a scarce commodity, as the typical Cortex pitch is carved up into a maze of low barriers, which allow passes but block runs, and high barriers, which deny both passes and runs. One field might promote lots of open field passing and running, while another turns into Space Hulk Rugby as players brawl at tight intersections, all fighting to get final possession of the ball. There are a few dud maps now and then. In one game, each offensive drive started with a wide obstacle between my ~center~ (let's call him that, since he started in the center of my formation) and the place where he needed to pick up the ball. The defensive side had clear angles to the ball. So every time my center tried to get the ball, he got there only one step ahead of a tackler, and was tackled on the very next turn, which triggers a turnover. I tried running with the ball and was tackled immediately. I tried throwing it and watched it practically ripped out of my player's hands. There was no way, with that map layout and the starting players on both sides, that I would ever be able to take possession of the ball and start a drive. It was a deeply frustrating game. But fortunately, each game is over in 12 turns, so you don't have to sit around getting stomped if you have a bad game. More often than not, though, the fate of a game hangs in the balance until the very end. That brings us to the other side of Frozen Cortex: the disappointing sports management game wrapped around the tactical game. When I first laid eyes on a story about corruption in pro Cortex and the tensions in the society that produces it, the Robot Market where you can purchase players with better stats, and the sports book where you can wager on league matches, I was intrigued. Visions of a new Blood Bowl, but with a better and more exciting game at the center of it, danced in my head. But none of that potential ever really materializes. With play limited to a single season, and no management elements other than, ~Gather money, spend on better players,~ the franchise mode proves to be a red herring. It's just the normal game with a whole lot of vague narrative cruft and meaningless monopoly money. Likewise, the ~knockout mode~ is basically franchise mode, except that your season ends the first time you lose a game and you can't buy players. So the same, but with even less stuff to do. The AI, at least, tends to put up a good fight and gave me something to do while waiting for human players to file their turns. This side of Frozen Cortex is not only much less enjoyable, but it's a collection of huge missed opportunities, made tedious by endlessly talking heads. Fortunately, this is not a major part of playing and enjoying Frozen Cortex, and I expect most people will likely end up ignoring it after a few games. Still, the ingredients of an absolute classic are just sitting there, going to waste alongside an excellent turn-based tactics game. So, it's against human coaches that Frozen Cortex is at its best. It's easy to find an opponent and maintain several games at once, and the tension against a live opponent is positively nerve wracking. To be quite honest, I find it a better game than Mode 7's awesome Frozen Synapse, partly because structuring it as a sport allows for more comebacks and less snowballing victories. It helps that Frozen Synapse just looks and sounds great. While the style is fairly minimalist, as in Frozen Synapse, the quality is far higher across the board. The art  and especially the punchy electronic music  give it a sleek, icy futurist vibe, and the cinematic cam shows robot-on-robot violence to great effect. The only downside is that sometimes important status conditions, such as whether a robot is stunned, can be tough to make out, particularly when a lot of robots end up a in a scrum. Outside of that, Frozen Cortex rather beautifully combines form and function. Pros Art and musicCortex is a great sportAwesome turn planner Cons Franchise modeIntrusive talking heads Frozen Cortex is a great blend of sports and tactics, and provides us with yet another great multiplayer game in the vein of Frozen Synapse. Its under-developed single-player and franchise management options leave a lot of points on the field, but they can be safely ignored once you get your bearings as a coach and can join the intense competition online.
