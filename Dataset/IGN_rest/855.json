While it curiously under-delivers on imagination where locations and enemies are concerned, Episode 1: Penal Colony marks the start of a confident action-horror story which contains enough pulp to leave me eager for the next three episodes. Episode 1 dances between two pairs of familiar and not-so-familiar Resident Evil faces: Barry Burtons teenage daughter Moira and Claire Redfield, and in a distinctively Last of Us-esque combo, Barry himself and Natalia, a little girl with strange powers. The mysteries in Episode 1 are big and juicy, and not over-explained; a relief considering Resident Evils tendency towards convoluted exposition. Further, its all a lot less po-faced than I have come to expect from this series, thanks to accomplished voice acting, amusing interplay between Claire and Moira, and some healthy self-deprecation (at one point, Claire mutters I was almost a Claire sandwich, followed by some severe eye-rolling). In a series so often bogged down in big science and ultra-seriousness, I enjoyed the dark humour. I was also relieved to find that significant improvements have been made to character mobility since the last Revelations. The dodge move, haphazardly implemented in the original, is now easy to execute, and the quick turn similarly more intuitive. Theres a lot less stopping and starting in Revelations 2, and a lot more running and dodging; in other words, its kept up with modern action games. Co-op is now available in Revelations 2 from the get-go, and it works well. After the last games disappointingly useless puppet AI, remembered mostly for pumping ineffective rounds into enemies to give the illusion of teamwork, its great to see that this time round he or she has a particular skill that is essential on the battlefield. Moiras flashlight can be used to blind enemies and find hidden objects, while Natalia can crawl through tiny spaces, throw bricks, and use her sight to see enemies before Barry can (although her ~point-in-direction-of-danger~ ability is effectively useless in both solo and co-op modes). You can - and will likely want to - switch between characters on the fly. Although I would have liked more co-op puzzle solving, split-screen combat dynamics are particularly fun; as one character in each pair is significantly under-powered against enemies, you must learn to communicate with your partner in order to stay alive. With the moment-to-moment gameplay so well orchestrated, I was surprised at how uninspiring Episode 1s environments are. The prison where most of the action takes place is dull, its rooms and corridors dark and grainy and painfully samey, without an eccentric puzzle or elaborate trap to be seen. Such boring design feels like a real backstep, considering the grand, ornate interiors of the Queen Zenobia in the original Revelations (and indeed, the gorgeous interiors of the original Resident Evil). All told, the first episodes campaign took me roughly three and half hours, though I imagine this would have been a significantly smaller number had I not spent so much time going round in circles. Enemy designs, too, lack imagination here. In 2015, brainless shamblers are merely heads to be popped, and in this episode at least, youll pop them easily. Considering how the Resident Evil series has evolved over the years, its barely worth pointing out that Revelations 2 sits more comfortably in the gung-ho action genre than in the one labelled survival horror, and I do recommend you play through the campaign on the harder difficulty if youre looking for real challenge. Fortunately, the Raid minigame is once again a highlight, played either solo or in split-screen co-op. These furious shooting-galleries - where the ultimate goal is to kill all the enemies in an arena below your level without healing yourself - do offer real challenge; at least if you want to complete each at 100% in order to unlock the best bonuses you can. Theres a great deal of depth to Raids customization, via skill trees and collectable weapons, while beginner stats differ from character to character, making for interesting combos in co-op. For score chasers, this mode promises a great deal of longevity outside of the main campaign. Pros Confident storyExcellent co-opRaid mode Cons Unimaginative environmentsPredictable enemies Revelations 2: Episode 1 is let down by dull environments and creature design, but a terrific co-op mode, intriguing story, and replayable Raid Mode balances out its flaws. Not quite a headshot, then; but its left a bloody impression on me nonetheless.", "date": "Feb. 24, 2015,"}
