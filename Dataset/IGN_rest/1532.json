Something to zone out to, without any silly exposition or narrative getting in the way of just blowing stuff up and avoiding enemies' deadly touch. It strips away higher brain functions and favours your pure instincts instead, putting you into a zen-like trance state where you're one with your little spherical character, rolling about the arena dispensing death from the torrent of your sphere. It looks like all you have to think about is how to get away from that angry ball, towards that combo multiplier. There's more going on than that, though. Although the enemy types are fairly standard for the most part, with a few varying behaviours, the ingenuity of the game relies heavily on passive, unassuming hexes. This is where Waves starts to get interesting, and starts to bring your brain back into the game. These hexes spawn as a single entity, but quickly start to multiply. Leave them alone and you'll soon have an entire field of them blocking off a huge chunk of the arena, making it harder for you to get around and easier for the other balls to flank and corner you. So you make sure to take out the hexes early, right? Stop any fields forming? Well no, because you need to cultivate those fields. Having a huge cluster of them is good for you, as it allows you to build a crazy multiplier. Each enemy you kill within quick succession starts to stack, and as soon as you hit 10x you can trigger a bomb, which blasts a shockwave out with you at its epicentre, wiping out everything in its path. Get another 10x off that bomb? Have another bomb. And another. So farming those fields of hexes means you can get huge chain reactions going off, racking up a ridiculous score. It means you need to be conscious all the time of how big they're getting, where they are, and when you want to wipe them out. You never have all of the arena on your screen at once, which means you can't ever have a handle on everything. And then you get back to being breathless and desperate. As you should be. Waves, at first glance, has a lot in common with seminal XBLA game Geometry Wars thanks to the neon retro visuals and wireframe enemies, and while there's the added depth of being in the UDK engine, the primary aesthetic difference is that where Geometry Wars was all angles and squares, Waves is elegant curves and sinister spheres. Gone is the square arena, replaced by something altogether more circular. It comes with four game modes, each with its own particular constriction that forces you out of your comfort zone. Crunch imposes a time limit, whereas Survival gives you limited lives but the freedom to dictate the pace. Rush has you wiping out giant cubes to increase the amount of time left, and Bombing Run, the most esoteric of the bunch, takes away your guns and makes you pick up and drop off bombs around the arena. Survival is the easiest to pick up and play for ten minutes, not least because it seems to have the most variation in how it plays; you'll often be ambushed by enemy spawns, surrounding you with one enemy type or another, requiring liberal use of the slow motion button to escape before you're swarmed. Being a Steamworks title, the Leaderboards are dictated by your Steam friends list, and it's heavily integrated throughout the game. Whomever you're closest to score-wise shows up on the right side of the screen, with your score on the left. Beat that score and the next pops up, and the next, until you're up against whichever of your friends is fiendishly good at the game. It's a great way to incentivise competitive play without being too intrusive, although it naturally requires knowing other people who play. CLOSING COMMENTS Waves is a game designed to be a quick distraction: ten minutes here, ten minutes there. Each of the game modes accommodates that, but the game itself doesnt let you just switch off and blow stuff up without thinking. While that could be seen as a negative, it makes the satisfaction for getting those huge explosions all the sweeter, and the visual reward all the more impressive. For a budget indie game, this is well worth the purchase. IGN RATINGS FOR WAVES (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 Presentation Its all scan lines and retro aesthetic, but everything is always abundantly clear and eye-catching. 8.5 Graphics The neon visuals are pretty enough, but all the lovely little effects elevate it tremendously. 7.5 Sound The choice between a male or female announcer is a nice touch, and theres a good electronic musical score that fits with the visuals. 9.0 Gameplay The controls are incredibly tight, the pace is frenetic, and its demanding if you want to attain more than a respectable score. 8.0 Lasting Appeal While its easy to put down after a session or two, itll have you coming back repeatedly over time, if only to try and best your friends. Assuming you have any. 8.5 OVERALL Great (out of 10) Waves is a game designed to be a quick distraction: ten minutes here, ten minutes there. Each of the game modes accommodates that, but the game itself doesnt let you just switch off and blow stuff up without thinking. While that could be seen as a negative, it makes the satisfaction for getting those huge explosions all the sweeter, and the visual reward all the more impressive.
