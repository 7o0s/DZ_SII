With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isnt without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves  optional or not  and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs Ive played in recent years. Youre thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass  even if, to be blunt, Reeves stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnnys confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077s slow burn of an intro  it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time  I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in Vs struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no ones going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble  and from the early hours youll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time. The structure here feels very different from many RPGs Ive played, including CD Projekt Reds own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you dont have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often dont even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but theres so much to see and do  and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out  that I didnt mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice. The intro did an incredible job of getting me invested in V and Johnny's struggle. And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you wont get that wow feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it  for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered theres practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. Youll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer  from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them  is frequently rewarding on its own. In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means youll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. Theres some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while youre constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I wont spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions. Divergent Paths Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly youll miss half of what it has to offer. But dont let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. Its frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make  choice in dialogue options, how to build your character, how to approach missions, and beyond. Id frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if Id done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both Vs own story and those of the characters around them. At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result  that wasnt a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone elses game where theyd picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasnt even offered to another player because of a single decision wed made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. Id unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation. Don't let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and through. The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark. I dont want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I dont think Ill forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like MILFguard (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witchers Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in. The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesnt mean its not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPRs previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one)  and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff youll get in the end. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a Rorschach Test. This is the crux of whats so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. Its not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: its a Rorschach Test. Its shorter than the epic-length quest you mightve expected, but with an amount of variation thats almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what youre going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player. That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how its organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnnys story than others. Its primarily broken into Main Jobs that are required to progress, Gigs that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a Side Jobs category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. Whats frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings. Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of Vs journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that. Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times  like youre playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of Vs journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of Vs story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural. Blade Gunner While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isnt any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if youre planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (Im not sure why, but lets just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown. Whats great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you cant bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you dont invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use  so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize youre really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether youve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have. Combat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete control over the choreography. Combat itself is another aspect where youll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasnt in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting. What's the Deal With PS5 and Series X Versions? I've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year. I wouldnt say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. Its not the most complex dance in the world, but its one I felt I had complete control over choreographing. I also love Cyberpunk 2077s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot  things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff. The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in Vs apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use  though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons Ive found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap. The soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially stands out. Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isnt much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way. Quickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my Vs high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out. When things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone. Bugs in the System Unfortunately, the amount of bugs Ive experienced really does need to be mentioned. Ive only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues Ive encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as youd hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions  but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me. Ive had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. Id frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. Ive had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful. A day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance  which is always good, but frankly those arent the issues thatve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today. Just to restate, a word of warning: we havent been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all  not on the new-gen systems or the old. While Id wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues Ive seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what itll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If thats where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision. If your only option right now is playing Cyberpunk 2077 on either of the base console platforms, I highly suggest you dont play at all until its many terrible performance issues are fixed. And if youve already bought it and had an experience similar to what Ive described, you should absolutely <a href=~https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-request-a-refund-for-cyberpunk-2077-for-ps4-and-xbox-one~>get a refund</a> if possible. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions are simply not in an acceptable state, and it makes me sad to think that so many people are having their first Cyberpunk 2077 experience ruined this way  because when it works, its a fantastic RPG.", "date": "Dec. 7, 2020,"}
