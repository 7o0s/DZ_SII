The 2008 first-person parkour platformer struck me as bold as it was beautiful, and it remains a game I revisit every year or so. In fact, I was so excited for its revival I actually cheered when Mirrors Edge Catalyst was confirmed by EA. Its one of the biggest letdowns of my gaming life, then, that playing through this half-prequel, half-reboot was an exercise in enthusiasm-draining disappointment. Catalyst is hardly a bad game, thanks to the strength of its movement systems, but everything else about it is so uninspiring that I get sad when I recall my initial reaction to its announcement. Running is supposed to release endorphins that make people happy, but Faith Connors and her friends dont seem to take any joy in being off-the-grid mailmen in the city of Glass Big Brother-ruled future. Literally everyone in Mirrors Edge Catalyst is sullen at best or angry at worst, and without a shred of humor or levity it becomes a huge downer. Fun fact: you wont see a single smile in this entire eight to 10-hour story campaign (more if you fill it out with sidequests) until Faith finally cracks a grin in the post-credits scene. Character development is nonexistent, and worse, everyone  including Faith herself  is completely unlikable. The main story arc is both thin and predictable, and Faiths own flashback-fueled backstory is lifted almost directly out of the Bruce Wayne playbook. You may not have liked the animated, eSurance-looking cutscenes that told the story of the original Mirrors Edge, but the first games simpler plot did a lot more with a lot less than Catalyst does with its convoluted, pointless mess. Given that this is a prequel, its not surprising (or a spoiler) when Catalyst more or less comes right out and says, Welp, youd expect things to have changed after all this, but nope, everythings the same at the end of the campaign, but it is disappointing. It only reinforced the apathy I felt toward the characters the entire time. Run Time So lets ignore the story and focus on what made Mirrors Edge unique and exciting in the first place. Locomotion in Catalyst still feels as fresh and empowering as it did in 2008, with our viewpoint firmly fixed inside Faiths noggin for every jump, slide, wallrun, and skill roll (save for the occasional finishing move that pulls the camera out to third-person). That perspective makes the simple act of running a thrill, just like in the original. The crunch of gravel or the squeak of a glass floor under Faiths feet, the heavy breaths she draws as she runs faster and longer  its practically exhilarating to string moves together successfully as you move from one area of Glass to another across its rooftops. The grappling hook youll pick up partway through the campaign helps sell the idea that Faith can traverse a city like you can tie your shoes. Perhaps no other game utilizes the LB/L1 button more than Catalyst  its your jump button that leads into momentum jumps, mid-air attacks, and ziplines  but it feels perfectly natural as you run and jump around Glass. Speed and momentum are encouraged by the game design, in that Faith has both a health meter and a shield of sorts thats fueled by her continuous movement. This makes it difficult for weapon-wielding enemies to hit her, and when you can dash around an area keeping your shield up, you can scan your environment relative to each bad guys location and plot each ones own unique, aggressive takedown: a chest-kick from above, a wallrun-fueled kick to the side of the head, etc. Slow down or stop, however, and youll be more vulnerable to the attacks  both melee and ranged  of K-Sec guards. Catalyst, like its predecessor, subtly but effectively guides you in the direction of your objective by turning a nearby interactable object red, indicating that you should jump, slide, mantle, or climb it in order to progress. Contrasted against the citys appealing use of primary colors  a welcome reprieve from the grays and browns that drape many modern first-person games  its a laudable substitute for the usual giant GO HERE arrow that points to the next goal. Unlike the original Mirrors Edge, Catalysts version of the gleaming white city of Glass is an open world, and it offers a couple of advantages. First, it lets you challenge yourself to put together epic-length, perfect runs that span the entire city. In fact, a built-in tool lets you easily create your own time trials (a fan-favorite feature from the original thats put to better use in this freeform city), which will automatically show up as optional events in your friends games. And while some sidequest events are fetch quests good for little more than building up your XP so you can unlock more traversal moves, combat abilities, or Faiths take-it-or-leave-it gear (such as the Disrupt attack from her grappling hook that stuns enemies with an EMP-type blast), other missions like the Billboard Hacks and Secret Messenger Bag retrievals become enjoyably challenging little parkour puzzles unto themselves. And when you inevitably miss a precise jump, checkpoints are mercifully liberal and reload times are fairly speedy, making your parkour failure easier to digest and reckless experimentation more fun. Fight the Power Combat has also been revamped since the first Mirrors Edge, and the new system is hit and miss. Unlike the original, Faith never even gets the option to wield a gun in Catalyst, which focuses the fights on fast and furious beatings (though sadly, that means you can no longer earn an Achievement for finishing the campaign without picking up a firearm). I welcome this, as guns never fit her character anyway and, and use of them subjected you to the original games most difficult-to-use controls; stripping them out makes everything flow better. So does Catalysts new HUD indicator, which lets you not only know if bad guys are around, but also which general direction your enemies are in, removing the clunky and confusing guesswork that marked the fights in Faiths first outing. Punches and kicks can be varied by mixing in directions, allowing you to throw a Holly Holm-on-Ronda-Rousey kick to the side of a helmeted foes skull. Landing one of those makes me feel powerful as his protective facemask shatters and he stumbles into one of his buddies, injuring the bad-guy bystander as well. The same feeling of strength comes from attacking an enemy with a parkour move, i.e. wallrunning and then punching a K-Sec guard in the face or speeding down a zipline, letting go, and planting both feet straight into a targets chest. Combat becomes a bit awkward when youre not running, however (a condition that is sometimes forced by the story missions). When that happens its too easy to cheese enemies when standing toe to toe by alternating directional kicks, particularly when youre near a rooftop edge or railing, as stumbling guards will practically throw themselves over the edge like theyre extras in a Rambo parody. Foggy Glass Mirrors Edges move to an open world also comes at a cost, however. Catalyst prioritizes a high framerate, but as a result, texture quality suffers, particularly on the console versions. It gives Catalyst a bland look rather than the boldness brought by the primary colors of the original, which are still on display here but are literally muddled. Even then, its far from a steady 60 frames a second on consoles, with frequent noticeable dips. Playing on PC with your input method of choice is highly recommended. Gameplay-wise, Glass is full of an endless pile of sidequests that mean youll always have something to do, but most simply involve running from Point A to Point B. Even the joy of Mirrors Edges parkour movement cant endure this kind of shameless repetition for long, especially in a city as bland and devoid of unique and interesting landmarks and hazards as this one. Without the setpiece-focused design of the original, Catalyst feels barren of memorable spots like the first games crane or construction yard. Beyond those, were expected to track down the inevitable truckload of collectibles stashed around the city, but that concept is a complete mismatch for a game built on constant movement and momentum. Most of these items are hidden in such a way that youre forced to stop in your tracks, defying the central design principle Catalyst is built upon. Looking for them is the worst way to spend time in this game. Pros Fun parkourUser-made races Cons Unlikable characters & storyMuddy texturesUneven combat The staples of Mirrors Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalysts attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses dont always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirrors Edges return to fall short. I was so happy this game was being made, but in the end Im just as disappointed in how it turned out.", "date": "June 6, 2016,"}
