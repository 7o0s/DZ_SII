Developer 343 Industries has engineered the strongest combat Halo has ever seen, with tons of excellent weapons, varied maps, an expansive and intense new multiplayer mode joining a host of returning greats, and some game-changing new mobility. At the same time, Guardians repeats Halo 4s mistake of telling a story that cant stand on its own without Halos expanded universe. This hurts, but doesnt ruin, its otherwise impressive cooperative campaign. I Need a Hero Make no mistake: though Spartan Jameson Locke and Master Chief share the cover of Halo 5, Locke is the main character. You play as him, leading Fireteam Osiris, in 80% of the campaigns 15 missions, but he doesnt have the charisma needed to fill that role. He falls into the same trap that ensnares many similar military-type main characters: Locke doesnt really want anything for himself; he just wants to complete the mission that someone else gave him. The lack of a hero with a cause to root for costs Halo 5s bigger story dearly, which wastes some good potential. Though the plot is overly complicated and unclear at times, its interesting that the new threat is less black-and-white in its motives than the Covenant, the Flood, or the Forerunners. One great thing about this new story is that, after spending so much one-on-one time with Cortana in previous games, its refreshing to hear new voices share their stories about Halos universe. Learning backstories, such as how Osiris 22-year-old Spartan Vale came to learn the Elites language, is a neat, believable touch thats well conveyed just through background chatter. Unfortunately, Master Chiefs Blue Team doesnt get the same treatment. If I didnt know them from Halos expanded universe, Id have only a weak idea about who Fred, Kelly, and Linda are, where they came from, or why I should care about them. What should be a meaningful reunion for Chief  a chance to again fight alongside the few who truly understand him  feels like business as usual, except with three extra guns behind his back due to lack of context. 343 has released an animated Fall of Reach series alongside Halo 5 that explains the origins of Blue Team, but its only included with pricey special editions. Divide and Conquer Its surprising the characters backstories werent worked into audio logs or something, considering how dense the seven-hour campaign is with other important stuff and secrets I missed at first glance. After a battle, Id wander around Halo 5s diverse locations looking for the thoroughly hidden skulls and realize I hadnt even seen whole other rooms, hidden pathways, weapons, vehicles, and more. Halo 5s levels often arent physically as big as areas in, say, Halo 3, but theyre so dense with things to discover that I didnt miss the breathing room. This kind of design makes Halo 5s campaign ripe for replaying, and well suited for the convenient drop-in, four-player (online-only) co-op its clearly made for. You and your friends can spread out, grab a variety of weapons, and use these levels to their fullest  maybe have one person sniping priority targets from the high ground, another sneaking off to activate auto-turrets, and the other two people engaging the rest of the enemies in mid-range fights. There are many more options available than point four guns at the thing and shoot. When playing solo, the new squad commands for your AI-controlled team (mapped to the D-pad) are about as simple as possible: stand over there, get in that vehicle, or shoot that enemy. This is a great quality-of-life improvement over past Halo games, where the only communication you could have with your NPC helpers was Gimmie that gun youve got. In addition, they seemed to know what I wanted them to do. I spent very little time waiting for allies to jump on my Warthogs turret, or getting them to hop into a spare Ghost for some extra firepower and mobility. The targeting command is useful for taking out elusive enemies, especially if you and your teammates are spread out and have different angles on the same area. The one issue I had with squad commands is that sometimes teammates just didnt listen. I get it: If I run out into the middle of the enemies, die, and need to be revived, thats a dumb move on my part and no sane teammate would want to make the same mistake. At the same time, when they sometimes decide to let me bleed out, its game over... so its frustrating when they inconsistently decide they dont want to take one for the team. Old Guns, New Tricks Halo 5 also has the most satisfying arsenal in the series going for it, thanks to returning classics and design facelifts for guns that used to feel worthless. Old favorites like the battle rifle, Spartan laser, and trusty assault rifle look and feel great, and work in new ways with the new hover mechanics. One unexpected standout is the Suppressor, a Forerunner assault rifle thats mediocre in Halo 4. It now fires homing projectiles, which are perfect for hunting down Halo 5s quicker enemy types. A few weapons are disappointing, like the new Hydra Launcher. That monstrosity looks huge and menacing, but the homing rockets it fires dont do enough damage to warrant a spot in my holster  especially since the campaign is so generous with handing out great guns. I was constantly trying to fit three or four really cool weapons into my two slots, which is a great problem to have. Youll have plenty of things to shoot, thanks to Halo 5s strong enemy variety. Forerunner troops are highly mobile and will dodge slower projectiles if youre not careful. The annoying flying enemies that provide shields are much less prevalent than they are in Halo 4, so they still provide an occasional challenge without becoming overbearing. The major negative standout here is the series of boss battles with a similar enemy type, who really drives home that Halo 5 is a co-op-first campaign. This guys weakest point is on his back, which is hard to shoot without a real human being helping to distract it. In co-op its fine, but if youre playing solo theres no way to spread out your AI to get different angles, making it more frustrating than fun. Old-school Covenant soldiers are as strong as theyve always been, with tough enemies like sniper Jackals and Hunter pairs. One major improvement is the invisible Elites, whose much more convincing active camouflage effect is one of the benefits of Halo 5 being native to the Xbox One. I was taken out by surprise much more frequently by the stealthy warriors, but not so often that it felt cheap  it was nice to be surprised and outsmarted. Of course, Halo 5 also looks better in all the ways youd expect from a generational leap forward. The campaign takes us to an eerie abandoned research station, a backwater planet ripe with odd, gorgeous life and vegetation, ruins with ancient and worn-looking monuments, and several other excellent looking locations. There is detail everywhere, and it Get Reqt Where single-player has its successes and failures, Halo 5s multiplayer is one big, sustained high point. The new headliner mode is Warzone, and what Ive played so far has been so much fun and full of heaps of exciting tension that I could ignore the rest of the modes and be satisfied with Halo 5. Think of Warzone as an expanded, 24-player version of Halos old Big Team Battle playlist  but in addition to fighting the other team, youre racking up points by capturing locations and killing roaming NPC bosses like tank warlords or super-strong Hunters. Two different victory conditions  either earning 1,000 points before the other team, or by destroying the enemy teams base  make it dangerous to get complacent when youre way ahead in either race. Great comebacks are entirely possible. Warzones maps are up to four times larger than the biggest previous Halo maps to accommodate so many players and vehicles, but are cleverly designed with several close-quarters pathways and hiding spots to give infantry a fighting chance. These matches are often 20 to 25 minutes long, and require a new aspect of combat that Halos classic modes dont have: resource management. Hey Big Spender Each player slowly earns REQ points over time, which can be spent on power weapons, vehicles, power-ups, and more. If you spend a few points each time you spawn, youll probably have better weapons than the average enemy you square off against, making them relatively easy targets. However, that frugal enemy might turn the tables 10 minutes down the line by rolling into your base equipped with an expensive Scorpion tank while you have only enough money for a battle rifle. From my experience, its well balanced: no strategy seems dominant, and nothing can trump good old-fashioned mechanical skill. A good player could approach that tank under cover, dodge a shot, land on the tank, and destroy it with a grenade and a few punches. Smarts and skill will still win the day. But of course, Warzone is just one mode among many. Arena is classic Halo at its finest: 4v4, with well-designed maps that dont heavily favor one strategy over another, and a broad variety of modes like Slayer, CTF, and the fan-favorite fast-kill mode, SWAT. Its slew of maps and cosmetic armor customization options is impressive, and Halo 5s new mechanical improvements apply to multiplayer as well as campaign. The most notable of those mechanics (which include the ability to quick-dash in any direction) is the hover jets. In previous Halos, jumping launched you on a predictable trajectory, essentially giving adversaries free time to line up headshots or toss a grenade on the area where you were about to land. Halo 5 shakes that up by introducing hover jets that activate when you aim down your sights while in the air, and now I dont know how I played Halo without them. This tool allowed me to make new lines of sight at will, avoid explosions, and use splash damage weapons much more efficiently. Even better, its immensely fun to outsmart enemies with unexpected moves: you can pop out from cover  not just at the right or the left, but above it  get in a surprise shot or two, and then fight or run. Finally, it lets you set up the tough-to-execute ground-pound move that sends your floating Spartan crashing down on enemies below in a spectacular but risky finishing move. Clambering is a huge addition to your mobility as well. As long as you get within a reasonable range of a ledge, your Spartan will grab onto the ledge and quickly hoist itself up. Not only is this mechanic much simpler than the old duck-jumping trick, it also cuts down on the number of failed jumps when trying to get somewhere quickly. In game modes where time matters, this improvement is especially useful. Pros Improved mechanicsDense levelsGuns. Lots of gunsStrong MP modes Cons Weak characters In its 14 years, Halo has never felt so good to play. An updated arsenal and great new mobility mechanics give both campaign and multiplayer and modern touch without sacrificing Halos classic feel. It fails to introduce its new Spartan characters in a meaningful way, and the story does make some odd logical leaps, but its still fast, beautiful, and fun  especially with four-player co-op. Guardians multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.", "date": "Oct. 26, 2015,"}
