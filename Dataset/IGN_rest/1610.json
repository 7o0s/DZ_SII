New Orbit manages to accomplish something very rare in the increasingly all-encompassing video game industry: it does something new. I've never played anything quite like it. Gamers play as an unnamed engineer, stranded in deep space with just a damaged shuttle and a will to survive. The crux of New Orbit is its realistic gravity simulation. Gamers simply have to touch anywhere on their screen to fire shuttle thrusters, accelerating in that direction. The only way to dissipate your shuttle's momentum is to thrust in the opposite direction. Later on, players are forced to perform advanced maneuvers like slingshotting around an asteroid, using its gravity in order to survive. Did we like it? It's pretty heady to lightly feather thrusters in order to enter a stable orbit around a celestial body, all with simple one-button touch controls. But New Orbit's biggest surprise is its engaging storyline. The entire adventure is voice-acted, and by the end I had developed quite an attachment to New Orbit's hero and his quirky method of talking to himself. Unfortunately, not every aspect of New Orbit's presentation is as engaging as its writing. The entire production was created by one-man studio Blaskish, and these limitations show. While the hero's voice acting is fine, other characters sound like bad impressions of villains. Additionally, while likely true-to-life, New Orbit's depiction of space as a wholly empty and desolate place is often boring. Often times the only thing on-screen is your tiny speck of a shuttle and black space. Should you buy it? The biggest knock against New Orbit is that there simply isn't enough of it. I cleared the entire episode in one 90-minute sitting (more episodes are promised). If you're a gamer that likes to try inventive products that explore new concepts, this is $0.99 very well spent. Gamers that insist on only high-polish titles will likely be less enamored with New Orbit's gravitational adventure. CLOSING COMMENTS Gamers that dont mind a few rough edges will quickly be sucked into New Orbits tale of space warfare, rogue asteroid miners, and gravity slingshots. It scores bonus points for not being another App Store platformer or tower defense title  the mobile platform is ripe for risk-takers.
