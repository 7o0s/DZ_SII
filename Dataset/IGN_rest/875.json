So it makes sense that third-party manufacturers are starting to undercut the official gamepad with cheaper options. Hori's Horipad is the latest, offering a smaller, wired build with a much different design. But saving some cash on this $40 option might hurt you eventuallydepending on which games you're playing. The Horipad for Xbox One shaves a bit of bulk off of Microsoft's design, both on the front and upper back, with the general shape coming off like a mishmash of Xbox and PlayStation controller designs. Hori adds a distinctive visual tweak with what it calls ~crystal cut design~a series of glossy triangles found inside on the controller grips, which are visible through the translucent black front of the pad. The design differences compared to the official Microsoft pad extend to every input on the controller. The front buttons are nearly flat on the surface, while the d-pad has a softer touch to itthere's no noticeable click upon impact. The surface of the analog stick is a bit wider than on the official pad, and has eight raised dots for grip, while the shoulder buttons also lack a click when pressed. It's the trigger buttons that prove most different overall, however, and not in a good way for many types of games. Playing Grand Theft Auto V shortly after starting testing of the Horipad, I wondered why driving didn't feel anywhere near as responsive as usual. But it became clear very quickly: rather than fluid, pressure-sensitive analog triggers that respond to your slightest input, the Horipad's trigger buttons must be fully depressed to generate any reaction at all. Hori Horipad: Essential Stats Manufacturer Hori Price $40 Connectivity Wired Cord Length 8.2 feet Headset Port No Fighting game enthusiasts' ears probably perked up at that last mention, and it's true: between the solid d-pad and the digital triggers with less range of motion, the Horipad for Xbox One can be a fair, dedicated controller for fighters. But for other types of games, namely racing games and first-person shooters, it's just not good enough. You can't slowly accelerate or brake your car a little bit in Forza Horizon 2 using the Horipadit's either full-on gas or full-on brakes. And trying to aim down a scope in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare means jamming down as hard as you can on the left trigger, which doesn't feel as natural as calmly pulling the magnifier into view. Hori's controller robs those games of some of their subtletythough it doesn't mean they're rendered terrible or unplayable. Rather, the experience just doesn't feel right, because the games weren't designed for this kind of controller. Also, as with the better PowerA Spectra, the different controller design means there's no headset input on the bottom of the pad. And depending on your gaming setup, you may be reminded of its budget status due to the 8.2-foot cord, which came about a foot short of my own living room couch. The Spectra has a 9.8-foot cord, by comparison. Pros Budget pricedSolid for fighters Cons Non-analog triggersNo headset inputShort cord Fighting game fans that don't want to splurge for a stick might find value in the Horipad's digital triggers, but other types of modern gamesincluding racers and shootersare diminished by the lack of analog triggers. It's the biggest mark against a pad that has a couple of other concessions compared to Microsoft's official controller: after spending hundreds of dollars on an Xbox One console, trying to save $20 for a less-useful controller seems impractical.", "date": "Feb. 10, 2015,"}
