It improves the VR experience in some important ways, but doesnt do much to address others. If this was 2018, wed be having a very different conversation right now. But the G2 originally arrived a few months after the Oculus Quest 2, and comparisons to the far cheaper headset are often not flattering. The question we need to untangle: Does the Reverb G2 make sense for anyone, and if so, for whom? HP Reverb G2  Design and Features Lets get this out of the way right up front: The Reverb G2 delivers a massive resolution of 2160x2160 pixels per eye with a maximum refresh rate of 90Hz and a field of view of 114 degrees. Thats the main reason, Id guess, that VR gamers would be interested in this headset to begin with. But if its possible to be both impressed and underwhelmed at the same time, well, here we are. Objectively, these are formidable specs. The Oculus Quest 2, for comparison, puts 1832x1920 pixels in front of each eye, though now also at 90Hz. Still, the Reverb G2 wins on overall performance. But lets not forget that these are the same specs as youll find in the Reverb G1. Its no slouch, but HP has recycled its existing hardware without improving resolution. The HP Reverb G2 is a tethered headset that uses inside-out tracking; in other words, you need to connect it to your gaming PC via the included 20-foot cable  the headset is a dumb terminal that relies on your PC for processing  and instead of wall-mounted sensors, the headset is peppered with cameras to understand its position in space and to keep tables on the controllers. First and foremost, the G2 has improved both of these design elements over the original G1. HP has slimmed down the cable so its less cumbersome to trail behind you when youre playing, and it has doubled the number of cameras, adding a pair of side-mounted cameras to the two forward-facing lenses to improve tracking coverage and accuracy. The headset is the most comfortable one I have ever had the pleasure to wear. Theres no comparison to either version of the Oculus Quest, for example, both of which I consider to be so aggressively uncomfortable I can only assume it must be intentional. Even compared to the Valve Index, which I thought was reasonably comfortable, this headset is noticeably better. The face padding features a soft cushion around every surface that comes in contact with your head, and it sits comfortably on your head with only moderate tension  it weighs just 1.2 pounds so light tension is enough to keep it in place. And its not housing a computer or battery, so its not unbalanced or front-heavy. You adjust it with three Velcro straps, which might seem like a step backward from a tension dial, but its easy to find the right fit so you can wear it for extended sessions without fatigue. And the G2 has a genius feature that quickly becomes indispensable: You can flip up the headset up to see the outside world, so you dont need to completely remove it to have a conversation or make sure youre not about to trip over the dog. A small speaker hangs down from each strap and can pivot up and out of the way if you need to hear something in the real world. The same design as the Valve Index, these speakers deliver adequate audio, but dont cover your ears the way headphones would. The only other feature on the outside of the headset is the IPD slider. Unlike the Quest 2, which limits you to three fixed presets, the G2 uses a continuous slider so you can dial in the precise interpupillary distance thats most comfortable for you. The controllers are substantially the same as the ones that accompany most other headsets. They feel a little weird  theyre heavy, with ludicrously oversized tracking rings  but are easy enough to use, equipped with four buttons (two action buttons as well as a menu and Windows button) trigger, grip button, and thumbstick). They run on a pair of AA batteries and seem to offer long battery life. HP Reverb G2  Setup Setting up your Reverb G2 is far easier than a first-generation outside-in headset, but still more cumbersome than getting started with something like the Quest 2. Because this is a tethered headset, you need to plug the headset into your PC, and your PC needs to be running no less than an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. I wouldnt recommend that, though; I had good performance during testing, but even my GeForce RTX 2060 Super and Intel Core i7 combo stuttered on rare occasions. A DisplayPort and USB cable split off from a small breakout box, and since the USB port cant deliver enough power to the headset, you need to plug that box into an AC adapter. The resulting rats nest of wires looks like a prop from a 90s sci-fi movie. On the other hand, the single cable that runs from the breakout to the headset is quite thin and light, and is so easy to insert and remove that you might find it easier to unplug the headset and coil the cable near your PC, storing the headset elsewhere. It inserts behind the face padding, which slips into place magnetically. Its pretty elegant, actually. Getting started is a simple matter of connecting the headset to your PC. Since the G2 relies on Windows 10s Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) feature, your PC should recognize it immediately and automatically install the necessary software to get you up and running. Before you can enter VR though, you need to define your play space. Thats not too difficult unless, like me, youre doing it alone and your space is behind the PC. Heres the problem: WMR, like all tethered headsets Ive used, assumes the play space is in front of your PC and makes no allowances for any other configuration. I had to employ the skills of a gymnast to dangle the headset in the air in the middle of the play space while simultaneously leaning across my desk and around my monitor to complete the PC-based setup using my keyboard. The process didnt endear me to the Reverb G2, especially since the Quest 2s painless setup was still fresh in my mind. If you want to play Steam VR games (and you will), youll need to install the SteamVR app. Once youre configured, you can enter VR through WMR or by launching Steam, though the two experiences are separate and distinct. HP Reverb G2  Gaming For all intents and purposes, the screen door effect is gone  whether I was in the WMR portal, playing a SteamVR game like Half Life: Alyx, or in the mixed reality universe with a title like Racket: Nx, I was simply unable to discern any tell-tale grid structure differentiating individual pixels. In fact, I found myself going back to games I havent played in a while to see them again through new, sharper eyes. Remember Beat Saber precursor Audioshield? The backgrounds are gorgeous. Did you ever play the superb RTS game Final Assault, or solve puzzles in the charming Rooms: A Toymakers Mansion? Everything is so crisp that it takes on an all-new hyper-realistic texture. And then theres Alyx  I could marvel endlessly at the dystopian cityscape at the start of the game. Then, down in the underground, the graphics were intense enough that I had serious trouble playing the game. (I do not like jump scares in VR. Sue me.) Unfortunately, once inside action titles it becomes clear that HPs inside-out design isnt flawless. There are only four cameras on board, and they cant see behind you or directly in front if you hug your body too closely, and that means there are situations in which the headsets controller tracking goes off the rails badly enough that it affects gameplay. It wasnt unusual for Beat Saber to occasionally lose track of a controller. And the aforementioned Audioshield often missed when I clearly blocked a beat off to the far side. If that were the whole story, I could still forgive the Reverb G2; after all, it wins on resolution and comfort. But the G2s fatal flaw isnt controller tracking  it is the underlying design. Its the fact that its a tethered headset. I cant count how many times I got tripped up by the cable, for example. And the reliance on WMR complicates everything without actually giving you anything in return. Redrawing your boundary lines is an ordeal, for example. You can do it on a Quest in seconds. And where are the new features that might make me want to choose a Reverb 2? The Quest offers full on, sci-fi-caliber hand tracking, not to mention an integrated health and fitness dashboard. Meanwhile, the G2s WMR portal is a house that looks like abandonware from 2016. One could argue that the Reverb gives you access to richer, deeper games than you can get with a standalone headset like the Quest, but Oculus Link lets you optionally tap into anything you can do on the Reverb. That said, I think I understand why HP is okay with originally releasing the Reverb G2 in 2020. This headset really isnt for you or me. Sure, its an option, especially for gamers who simply cant bring themselves to sign into a Facebook account to use the Quest. But more importantly, HP is making a corporate play with the Reverb G2. An enhanced version of this headset, the Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition, is packed with internal sensors  eye tracking, pupillometry, a face cam and heart rate sensor. Leveraging these tools, HPs Omnicept software lets developers create VR applications that can respond in real time to the user. In training scenarios, for example, evaluators can monitor the reactions of users in real time and vary the complexity of simulations in response. Its a genuinely brilliant application for VR, and HP is using the Reverb G2 to trailblaze this exciting new market. Selling the consumer version of the Reverb G2 is gravy, which may be why, compared to some of the competition, the G2 feels like a product thats been trapped in amber since 2017. On paper, the HP Reverb G2 should have been the VR headset I chose to replace my aging HTC Vive. But despite being a fanatic for resolution and performance, I chose a Quest 2 instead, and after using a Reverb G2 for weeks, I don't regret that decision. The Reverb G2 may have limited appeal for gamers who value resolution at all costs or who refuse to agree to Oculuss Facebook policy. But there are simply too many reasons to spend half as much on a headset that offers close to the same resolution, but with far fewer limitations.", "date": "April 14, 2021"}
