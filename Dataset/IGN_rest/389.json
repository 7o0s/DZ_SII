Even though its become clear that were more observing Bruce Waynes story than having a meaningful impact on how it turns out, the tension is still real: all of the political and personal relationships introduced in the first two episodes and Bruces once-prestigious public image seem as though they might shatter under one slightly under-calculated dialogue choice and the stress of this multi-faceted journey lasts the entire episode. Unpredictable conflicts and brutal twists. Especially for the most dedicated Batman fans, episode three - titled New World Order - continues and heightens the series trend of offering unexpected new takes on well-known DC characters, offering unpredictable conflicts with brutal twists that had me feeling helpless to save everyone. Bruce Waynes professional relationships and friendships alike are challenged and tested in ways that are relatable, too, with writing that successfully and subtly elaborates on character traits and motives with each interaction, adding layer upon layer of consequence. Weve grown away from the repetitious exposition that bogged down episode one and into a series of dynamic relationships that beg to be considered during every single choice. An interaction with Catwoman might affect Harvey Dents political campaign, and an interaction with Vicki Vale, even as Batman, might affect Bruce Waynes public perception. But with the increase of intensely intertwined characters and relationships this episode feels like its all about Bruce. While there are still some segments that have you play as the masked vigilante, this is one of the first Batman stories Ive encountered where, even when in the armor, Batman feels like Bruce Wayne, the philanthropist. While Im missing the parts of episode one that had me shaping Batman independently, at least Telltales version Bruce Wayne is a well-written, dynamic character who doesnt fit into the somewhat dull millionaire playboy archetype he has often been forced into. Telltale's Bruce Wayne is a well-written, dynamic character. Episode three is also the first episode to reveal a disappointing lack of consequence. As is with every other Telltale game, this episode all but confirms that your choices wont dramatically change the outcome of the plot, as all the areas where it had briefly diverged are forced back to a common point. A seemingly enormous, weighty conflict in episode two has almost no impact on episode three, with the two characters involved following the same path regardless of which choice you made. Its something that was disappointing but expected, and my investment in the complex, alluring characters and their relationships means that I dont really care. Regardless of how little Im able to impact the outcomes, its a strong, unpredictable story that Im still eagerly waiting to watch unfold. One thing I do care about, though, is that there are some huge framerate drops that meant I nearly ran out of time to make decisions before they even appeared on screen. This happened three times throughout my playthrough, and while Batman largely presents the most colorful, dense, and detailed environments weve seen from Telltale yet, that isnt worth it if it comes at the cost of performance problems like these. Thankfully this didnt happen during any of the quick-time-event combat. Fights are less frequent this episode than in the previous two, but much more creatively animated thanks to the formal introduction of a brand-new villain with an alluring, ballet-looking fighting style. Batmans brawls are still a treat to watch, but watching is still most of what you actually do. The detective-style scenes follow the exact same model as the previous two episodes, where you can somewhat lazily link pieces of evidence together to help Batman draw conclusions. The puzzles dont present an interesting challenge and I was much more interested in getting through them to progress the story than I was in the actual gameplay. The foundation is solid, but the crime-scene investigation segments havent been built upon at all since episode one, so they feel a little stale. Its a tribute to Telltale that the intricate, multi-layered plot and diverse cast of intertwined villains and madmen makes episode threes lack of consequence and gameplay shortcomings excusable. I did encounter some brutal performance issues, but the writing has significantly improved from episode one, the voice acting is at its highest quality yet, and Gotham feels dense, detailed, and alive. The detective missions are starting to feel a little redundant, but the combat direction and animations that follow are so swift that its like watching a well-choreographed dance. Above all else, the elaborate plot has me utterly hooked.", "date": "Oct. 26, 2016,"}
