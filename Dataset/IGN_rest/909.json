That may sound impressive, but how does the keyboard stack up in practice? Design Straight out of the box, the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma is gorgeous even before it is plugged in and set up. With a braided fibre cable and a sleek black case, and keys that feel smooth and comfortable to the touch, the keyboard looks and feels like it could really take a pounding for a long time yet still remain stylish-looking. The Razer BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma features the all-new Razer Mechanical Switches that have been designed from scratch. Razers aim of the redesigned switches is to elevate the speed and responsiveness of the gaming keyboard beyond the capabilities of the current generation mechanical switches. Razer notes convenient easy-access media keys that allow you to adjust brightness, volume and playback control through a couple of keystrokes. The BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma also offers Chroma backlighting with 16.8 million customisable colour options. Whats more, the keyboard also features a USB port, an audio-out and mic-in jack hidden on the right side for ease of access virtually at the tips of your fingers (or at least very close to it). Performance The BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma comes with several sets of lighting changes. Theres the wave mode which allows you to chose whether the colours move in a wave from the right side to the left, or from the left to the right. Spectrum cycling mode has the keyboard cycle through all colours. The breathing mode simulates breathing as it fades in and out between 1 or 2 colours of your choice, while reactive mode allows the keyboard to react when keys are pressed and static mode will keep to one colour of your choice. All these features can be controlled via the Razer Synapse 2.0 software, downloadable from Razers website. There are pre-loaded templates with light effects for a variety of games, including Counter Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA, League of Legends, Starcraft II as well as generic MMO and FPS games. If youre not satisfied with the presents, you can easily create your own. From within the Synapse 2.0 software you can control the brightness of the colours from having the lights off completely, dim, normal and bright. You can also choose to switch off all the lighting when your display(s) is(are) turned off, which is very handy for when you leave your room for a while as the keyboard wont be a possible annoyance in the form of a lone eerie light source in the dark. Speaking of annoying, a somewhat annoying feature is the volume/playback control function on the keyboard. You need to press the FN key before pressing any other keys that allow you to control the volume or skip a track. A lot of the time, that would require the use of both hands, or stretching your right hand from bottom to top depending on how big your hands are. It would be nice to have buttons dedicated for media control, although it should be noted, during game-mode, the function keys are enabled automatically, so youll only require to hit one button to access the media controls. The keyboard also features on-the-fly macro recording, so if theres a long and complex series of commands that need to be executed they can easily be encoded in just a single keystroke. Up to 5 macros can be saved on the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma keyboard at the same time, which should be enough for most gamers, unless youre into MMOs. Automated macro recording is accessible through the F10/(G) key, which is handy, but it is still better to use the Synapse 2.0 software to tweak and fine tune your macros for further precision. Outside of gaming, the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma fulfils all your word-processing, chatting, Tweeting as well as Internet-surfing needs quite nicely. The keys are sensitive, but not too sensitive, so you dont necessarily have to hit them hard when typing. Unlike with some keyboards, a light and gentle touch is enough to get the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma to respond. The keyboard is also comfortable enough and quick to get used to once you switch from another keyboard. At first the noise made by the keys can be jarring to family/co-workers, but after a short while they get used to it, unless you require a totally silent environment to work in. The clicking of the keys is far from music to ones ears, however, but at least the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma doesn't sound like you've let loose your pet woodpecker on your desk. At least your family/co-workers will be able to tell how angry you are by how loud you bash the keys of the keyboard, so the BlackWidow Ultimate Chroma doubles as an excellent warning system in that sense. Razer claims the Ultimate BlackWidow Chroma has a lifetime of around 60,000,000 keystrokes. This is something thats hard to prove easily as it requires several thousand hours of constant typing to hit the 60 million limit, and by that time surely Razer will have come out with its next new keyboard with even more bells and whistles. On the other hand, if you or someone you know has managed to hit the 60,000,000 keystroke limit on the Ultimate BlackWidow Chroma, let us know how the keyboard is doing. Better yet, how are your wrists doing after all that typing? Pros Cool designResponsive keys Cons No dedicated media controls outside of gaming modePrice is a bit too steep If youre in the market for a sleek-looking, sturdy keyboard with highly responsive keys, and one that does pretty much what it says on the box, the Ultimate BlackWidow Chroma delivers all throughout. With the variety of colour schemes to pick from, the world is your oyster as far as finding a colour to suit your gaming or working mood. Coupled with the Razer Mamba mouse, the Ultimate BlackWidow Chroma keyboard make for a killer combination to suit your needs, however the price tag of AED719 can be somewhat of a turnoff.", "date": "Jan. 4, 2015,"}
