Over the last two years, companies like Pebble, Samsung, and Sony have released a number of these wrist-worn, connected wearables, but they have yet to really show why anyone needs to own one. Regardless, the idea of a smartwatch has become popular enough to garner the attention of additional major players in the industry, with Google developing a version of its operating system built specifically for this type of device, Microsoft recently launching a smart band of its own, and Apple preparing to sell its first wearable next year. With the introduction of Google's Android Wear platform earlier this year, Motorola joined in on the party by announcing the Moto 360which is currently available through the Google Play store for $250 USD with a leather band or you can opt for a metal band for $300. Like so many others, Motorola, along with Google, are attempting to establish a foundation for the young product category, and even though the Moto 360 makes a strong case for the future of smartwatches, it's clear that we still have a ways to go before we really understand their true potential. Unlike the square-faced LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live that debuted at the same time as Motorola's new device, the Moto 360 utilizes a round face, making it more closely resemble a traditional analog time piece. The steel housing is sleek, simple, and classy, and the overall design turned quite a few heads while I was using it. It's somewhat heavier than the original Pebble, but not to the point of being an annoyance. I took the Moto 360 out for a jog and, although I noticeably felt its presence on my wrist during the 4-mile run, it wasn't a vastly different experience than when I use my plastic ePaper smartwatch. Up front is a 1.56-inch LCD screen that features a small black strip at the bottom of the display that hides some of the watch's sensors and internals. This imperfection does disrupt the otherwise attractive design, especially since it might partially cover up some of the numbers on a chosen watch face, but it isn't a deal breakerLG, on the other hand, managed to keep the full face of its brand-new G Watch R clear of obstruction, so hopefully this characteristic won't be found on the Moto 360's successor. The screen has a pixel density of 205 ppi, which is much lower than today's smartphones, but it's definitely adequate for a watch since you won't be viewing hi-res photos or watching HD movies on it. You can view individual pixels, but if you're looking for them then you're probably doing it wrong. Thankfully, I had no problems viewing the Moto 360 display in direct sunlight. Keeping the phone powered is a 320 mAh battery that is charged by a handy wireless Qi charger that doubles as a dock. Motorola claims that the battery can last all day and, with all updates available as of the time of publishing this review loaded onto the watch, that was certainly the case for me. With the Ambient Screen setting disabledwhich keeps the screen slightly lit up with monochromatic colors when not in useI typically had anywhere between 20 to 40 percent battery life by the end of the night. Those who don't light up the screen very often or carefully choose which notifications are sent to the device can probably reach 2 days of use, but it's not something I was able to do. The Moto 360 is one of the first devices to utilize Android Wear, which, for now, mostly acts as a notification extender and a way to deliver Google Now cards to your wrist. When a message comes in, the watch will gently vibrate and a card will pop up from the bottom of the screen, which you can then interact with in a number of ways, depending on the app. With email, for example, you can reply via voice, archive the message, mark as read by swiping to the right, or choose to open the app on your phone. Other notifications that are tied to apps that don't require a response will just give the option to view the app on your handset. Unfortunately, there's no way to pull up past notifications, so once you're done interacting on the watch, it's gone for good. Android Wear also takes advantage of Google's voice recognition software. By saying ~Ok, Google~ or tapping on a watch face, you can essentially do the same things you can do on your phone, like set reminders, send text messages, and inquire about the weather. The device's microphones did a decent job at picking up commands, even when others were speaking nearby. It wasn't perfect, but it worked more often than not. The Moto 360 doesn't include a speaker, though, so don't expect to take calls directly from the watch or hear any notification sounds. The watch's hardware and software also make for a decent fitness-tracker. There's a heart rate sensor built into the backside of the device and a pedometer for keeping track of your daily activity. A few fitness apps are already compatible with the operating system and the ability to control Runkeeper through the watch instead of my arm-strapped phone was very convenient. The pre-loaded Google Fit adds additional health-tracking resources into the mix and Motorola will soon roll out its own Moto Body software. Unfortunately, the Moto 360 does not include GPS connectivity, so you'll still need your handset if you want to track your patha downside for active folks who would like to leave their phone at home, especially since you can load Google Play Music songs onto the watch and connect to a Bluetooth headset directly. At this point, Android Wear feels like it's still in its early stages of deploymentwhich it is. There is a lot of potential with the Google Now implementation (if you use it on your phone), and the company's voice recognition capabilities are generally great. Navigation can be odd, though. Various input commands include single taps, long presses, swipes from every direction, and the device's single hardware button, which takes both single and long presses. After a week with the watch I still occasionally stumbled when trying to expand notifications, get to the device's settings (which can be done three different ways), or open an app. There are some inconsistencies with how one interacts with notifications as well: sometimes you tap it to see more information, or you might have to swipe to get more details, or maybe you'll be forced to jump back to your phone to find out what that message was all about. In other situations, similar app notifications behaved differently for no apparent reason. For example, when receiving a text message using the stock messaging app on a pre-Android 5.0 phone, the watch's notification won't show the sender's name or phone number, even though this information shows up when the Moto 360's synced to a Lollipop-equipped device. There's also the problem of a limited number of useful apps, which is natural for such a young platform. Aside from fitness-related options, there are things like calculators, calendars, and various methods to control your phone. Using the Lyft app to request a car directly from the watch is handy, and taking quick notes via voice dictation using Google Keep is a nice feature, but as of now it appears that developers are just making sure that their apps send proper, interactive notifications to the wearable. More apps will surely make their way over to Android Wear, but at the moment there aren't many choices that would make you decide to use a small screen on your wrist instead of your large-screened phone. Pros Attractive, well-constructed design.Effective notification extender and fitness-tracker. Cons Google Wear needs refinement.Few useful apps. As far as smartwatch hardware is concerned, Motorola's Moto 360 is a big step in the right direction. It's not only more aesthetically pleasing than alternatives from Samsung and Pebble, but its more traditional design has the potential to attract those who currently use fashionable analog watches. The device's quality construction also helps justify the price tag.<br><br> But until the software meets the same level of quality, the Moto 360 feels like an incomplete product. Being a such a new platform, Android Wear definitely has room for improvement, and it's likely that Google will quickly address the operating system's shortcomings in upcoming updates. There is potential with Google's wearable OS, but it's going to have to do a lot more before the masses can be convinced that a smartwatch is must-have product.", "date": "Nov. 11, 2014,"}
