Developer Omega Forces third-person action game interpretation of the franchise goes through the plot of the anime and takes the first stab at adapting a bit of the manga that the anime has yet to cover. While it does a great job of capturing the brutal essence and fast action of the show, it has mixed results presenting the mangas content and its own slog of an original ending in an interesting way. If youve never experienced Attack on Titan, this isnt the worst way to do it  that would be Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains  but of course its not as good as manga either. The roughly 15-hour campaign hits all the essential plot events as Eren and his crew join the military and seek revenge against the titans for destroying their families, homes, and lives, but youll miss a lot of the more nuanced details and political scenes. Thats not too bad for the campaign, though: the focus isnt on Attack on Titans politics, but on decimating titans. I found a lot of the cutscenes to be a nice refresher for some events I forgot. The introduction to subjugating titans is a little intimidating, but the controls are rather intuitive once you get used to the combo of swinging, targeting, then slashing the back of a titans neck. Once I did, I practically flew through the map as I hunted down targets using the omni-directional maneuver gear (which lets you move a lot like Spider-Man) to swing between buildings and trees with peak efficiency. Executing this move perfectly time after time made me feel powerful. Engagements are quick, but require precision: after locking onto one of five possible locations on a titans body, youll need to gain speed and hit the attack button at just the right time to do the most damage possible. Executing this perfectly time after time made me feel powerful, but it took me a while to get there. If you do execute the combo incorrectly  attack at the wrong time or if you attack without enough speed  youll disconnect from the titan and fall back to the ground. This gives titans an opportunity to trample, hit, or grab you. Sometimes I got careless while I was targeting a titans limb, and the beast would snatch me out of the air, or throw their arm so that I was flug far away. If you miss an attack, a message flashes on the screen about why you failed. That was helpful while I learned how to master the system. Its gross, but theres a weird satisfaction in coming out of a fight drenched in titan blood. While taking on one or two titans isnt too difficult, the diversity in size and type of titan kept me on my toes. An abnormal crawling titan that leapt in the air was a lot harder to subjugate than a relatively small, five-meter titan that went down in one hit. As I progressed to later missions and faced more specialized enemies, like the female titan that more actively blocks attacks and counter-attacks, I found myself needing to be more tactical with my resources and play to my characters strengths. Different ability combinations help characters feel more authentic. One of the things that kept the constant titan hunt fresh was the character roaster. Though youll mainly play as Eren, Armin, Mikasa, or Levi, there is a point where the campaign allows you to play missions as one of 10 characters, and each has their own combat style that matches their personality. For example, Armin isnt the strongest fighter but he is a brilliant tactician, so to match that, while playing as him or another leader-type character youll have the ability to direct a squad of collected comrades to attack certain points on a titan. Then we have Levi, one of the fastest and strongest fighters, so he has the ability to attack multiple times after the first hit. Combat abilities learned through leveling up may repeat between characters, but the different ability combinations helped them feel more authentic. The first chunk of the campaign has nice mission and map variety; I got to traverse plains on horseback, escort terrified settlers to safe zones, and stop the female titan from completely obliterating the Stohess District. Each mission also features side quests with various characters that, when helped, can either give you more supplies or join you in combat. Its not necessary, but hearing them scream when theyre defeated wasnt really an option for me, either, because Omega Force captures the horror of Attack on Titan well. When random scouts sometimes get grabbed and eaten by titans, the sound is bloodcurdling. Their deaths dont affect success in the mission, but I always made sure to get revenge. I just wish these unlockables would have been introduced earlier. The credits roll after completing the animes story, which took me roughly seven hours, but weirdly enough the campaign isnt over. Instead, the floodgates open and Omega Force awkwardly adds a few new features to go with its original take on what happens next in the story. In the lengthy epilogue you can buy weird statues of titans to display in your camp and in multiplayer mode, and receive requests from other characters. The requests were simple (kill a certain number of titans, get a certain score, recruit so many members) and completing them means youll be rewarded with funny cutscenes and the occasional costume. I was really happy when I unlocked Cleaning Levi  I just wish these would have been introduced earlier so I couldve enjoyed them in the main campaign. Survey missions make sense contextually, but they go on for far too long. Unfortunately, the epilogue doesnt flow too well. The few regular story missions in the epilogue are broken up by long, boring stretches of repetitive survey missions, which are essentially missions on old maps to eliminate titans or save a few settlers. They make sense contextually  of course youd want to scout out and eliminate threats in an area before moving on  but they go on for far too long. On average it took me about an hour to get through enough survey missions before unlocking the next story mission. A lot of the missions themselves are short, but replaying a bunch of maps for hours and not receiving much story content gets stale quickly. It feels like Omega Force tried to pepper the character requests and their respective scenes to break up the monotony of the padded-out survey missions, but theyre not frequent enough to jolt me out of the tedium. Pair that with the slow reveal of information from the story battles and the epilogue just moves too slowly. Its still fun to take out titans with your character of choice, but this section definitely needed some of those survey missions cut. On the plus side, you can get through some of those survey missions with friends in multiplayer, and the progress and items you earn in multiplayer carry over to your campaign. Its fun to work with other people to take down objectives and race each other to get the most titan subjugations, plus playing with others helped me to clear some of those survey missions faster. Slaying titans is a satisfying, bloody mess thanks to fun and fast combat. The meat of the campaign follows the anime through fun missions and features varied playstyles for each of the characters that matched their personalities well. While the epilogue suffers from serious pacing problems, being able to get through some of its more tedious missions with friends make the extra content a little less of a pain.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2016,"}
