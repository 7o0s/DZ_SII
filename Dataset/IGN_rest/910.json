Unfortunately, too much of Loadout weighed on me. When I didn't spend real money, the experience was too oppressive. When I started playing with money, there were still some unforgivable issues in the way matches are set up. As far as third-person shooters go, Loadout is decent in terms of gameplay. Character movement is floatier than most shooters, but I got used to the pace within a few matches. The speediness of the combat was the bigger challenge to acclimate to; scopes are nearly useless, and headshots are a rarity. I did appreciate the abundance of arcade-inspired damage indicators, though  between giant glowing numbers and loud chimes, I always knew when I'd hit my mark. There are both a co-op PvE campaign and PvP competitive matches in Loadout (both are always team-based and max out at four on four). The campaign and its bare-minimum backstory is a series of 50-plus matches against an AI-controlled aliens, each carrying stipulations given by unseen characters. A military commander will need help with enemies twice as strong as usual, an arms dealer will want some kills with a certain weapon, or a director may want a few headshots for gory movie footage. A simple character portrait would have done wonders to give them personality, but all we get are a few sentences of mission-select screen text. Fortunately, the guns got me excited for battles when the mission setup didn't. The weapon-crafting system is insane, as each weapon type has at least seven customizable parts, from the trigger to the scope. I was able to make some pretty powerful and fun weapons, though there's some trial and error involved. For every hit, like my full-auto Tesla beam that spreads through groups of enemies, I'd usually find another that looked good statistically and performed decently during target practice but fell flat in combat. Even with the duds, I enjoyed tinkering with my guns. I can't say the same for Loadout's attempt to infuse its characters with personality. Theyre are actually more fun dead than alive - getting limbs shot off or faces removed (leaving an eyes-only visage reminiscent of Assassin's Creed Unity's launch glitches) is fine, and the overwrought death animations are better than motionless fatalities. They're also better when you earn a rare costume item instead of buying into the glut of high-priced tchochkes. Fortunately, I wasn't enticed to spend, since much of Loadout's customizable items trade in crude humor. For some folks, giving the busty, big-boned Helga character the Fattoo skin, thong underwear, and a twerking taunt might elicit a chuckle, but it just came across as trying too hard to be outrageous. The bigger issue is that while the campaign match types are completely randomized, stipulations aren't matched to complementary modes. In many cases, that led to stipulations completely incongruous to a match. A level with a stipulation asking for a number of rocket kills would be perfect for a ~find and capture randomized points~ mode, but usually I'd get thrown into something completely different at first like Death Snatch, where the Kill Confirmed-style rules wouldn't allow me to fire up-close rockets at enemies. Theres no option to repeat a match type, either, so a lot of the campaign's strategy is ~wait until a compatible match pops up.~ Since progression through the campaign requires both a victory in battle and completing the personal objectives, I had many frustrating experiences of letting my team down while just eking out an ultimately meaningless objective, or setting aside my personal gain for the team, knowing another long match laid ahead with the same stipulations. That isnt a fun decision to make. While Loadout isn't impossible to play free, I did have to do an insane amount of prepping and micromanaging to stand a chance without paying. Apropos to its name, there's only a single loadout to manage when you start, and while that may have been beneficial to learning the ins and outs of weaponcrafting, the prohibitive cost of purchasing a second slot made for awkward rounds where I brought the wrong weapons to battle and had to debate between ditching my team or spending the next 10 minutes with a losing strategy. When I did start investing even a modicum of real-world money into Loadout, the results were pretty shocking in the campaign. I went from barely winning missions, maintaining a K:D ratio of 1.5:1 and rarely earning match MVP awards, to a team-carrying monster with double-digit killstreaks. In a way, I preferred the free experience  while it was much more of a grind early on, I feel way more accomplishment with a hard-fought victory than I do rolling over the opposition. Even when spending, I was often frustrated by missions requiring a certain ammo type that I ended up purchasing, only to reward me with a bounty of said ammo type. When it came to the PvP multiplayer, it was nice to see that the equalized levels made money less important, and limited the pay-to-win feel to the co-op corner. However, outside of the more robust choices available when playing an invite-only match, the standard public matches are sparse when it comes to options, putting the mode to a vote and randomizing everything else. The underappreciated ~Jackhammer~ mode, where one team defends a giant crane while the other attacks it, almost never wins public vote, and I wish there was a way to find a match besides corralling friends. Pros Insane customizationFun arcade combatSome personality Cons Grindy free experienceMismatched objectives I had some fun free-to-play battles with Loadout, but far more time was spent mired in frustration or feeling under-fulfilled with a purchased campaign victory; it's not quite ~pay to win,~ but it definitely is ~pay to win with a lot less hassle.~ Even though the campaign promises over 50 unique co-op situations, almost all of my fondest Loadout memories came during PvP matches  even if I looked and taunted a lot like everyone else.", "date": "Jan. 4, 2015,"}
