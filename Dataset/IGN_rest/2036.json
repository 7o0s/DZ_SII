In this review, we head towards the companys new premium range with the G14, a compact, beautifully engineered system crammed with some of the latest hardware on the market. The G14 is truly a small wonder, packing in AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS processor, NVIDIA RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics card, and over 9 hours of battery life, into a chassis that will surely turn a few heads. For AED 6,999, it offers plenty of power to punch through current and next-gen games at 1080p, although we wouldnt necessarily recommend the 60Hz display model that we received for review. Design and Features The G14 is a gaming laptop disguised as an Ultrabook. It has all the trimmings of being one, with a slim silhouette and an easily pocketable weight of just around 1.5kgs, making it one of the smallest and lightest gaming laptop available on the market. It has an elegant look to it, as well. Our review unit came in a milky white finish, paired with a metallic silver deck that is in equal parts simplistic and modern. Asus also offers the laptop in a gray finish with matching lid and deck, if you prefer a more subdued look. One of the several aesthetic flourishes of the laptop is on the lid itself. The surface is adorned with a pattern of dots spread across half of the lids surface. They are in fact tiny holes that serves no other purpose than to look nice and acts as a stand-in for other Zephrus G14 models that come with an array of micro LED lights instead. Asus calls it the AniMe Matrix Display, and lets you customize it with animated text and graphics. Another design flourish is the drop hinge lid mechanism which raises the laptop slightly when opened. This not only places the keyboard and the screen at a more comfortable angle, but also gives much needed breathing room to the ventilation grilles placed around the outside of the chassis. My only bit of problem with this is that the vents exhausts directly onto the lower part of the screen, which may or may not damage it in the long run. The laptop does get seriously hot, especially around the vents, and so the idea of it expelling hot air directly onto the screen doesnt sit quite comfortably with me. In terms of ports, Asus keeps it fairly light as expected with 2x USB 3.0 ports, 2x USB Type-C ports (one of which can act as a G-sync enabled Display Port as well as a charging port), 1x HDMI port and a single 3.5mm audio jack that combines both audio and mic inputs. A design gripe I have here is with the placement of the power port. It is placed smack in the middle of the left side which could potentially block the HDMI port, but also doesnt allow for clean cable management. AniMe Matrix Display Hands-On Update: July 15, 2020 Asus provided us a separate G14 model that came equipped with the AniMe Matrix Display (AED7,999). The matrix display consists of a cluster of white LEDs embedded into the dotted pattern on the lid. These LEDs can be customized in a variety of ways, either with custom text in different fonts and sizes, or to display battery status, clock, number of unread emails, or work as a music visualizer. The most fun to be had with this, however, is to use the display to feature animated GIFs of your favorite character or object. Any GIF with a transparent background will work well, and it can be positioned and resized to fit the matrix displays size. You can also create a timeline of different GIFs and have them play one after the other, where you can make each GIF last upto 10 seconds before it moves onto the next one. The Armoury Crate isnt the most intuitive software to use to customize the matrix display, but it does the job once you know the lay of the land. It at least has its bases covered with plenty of options to customize the look of the laptops lid so it has that going for it, which is nice. As for if this version is worth over the plain-jane version really depends on your preference. Is AED 1,000 worth having an animated LED display on the lid of your laptop? Personally, the price gap is too large for me to even consider the AniMe version, so it really depends on how deep you watch to stretch your pockets for this. Display The G14 we received came with a 14 1440p 60hz display, which is not an ideal solution if you want to experience higher frame rate gaming which the system is fairly capable of. Other models come outfitted with a 1080p 120Hz display, and I'll always prefer that over higher resolution as it barely makes a noticeable difference on smaller screens. Of course, you can always use an external monitor, and it might just be worth doing so considering the onboard RTX 2060 does support G-Sync. The display is Pantone Validated, which is a color system used across several industries such as fashion and advertisement, so you can expect great color accuracy and black level management. The panel does appear slightly washed out, however, but not to an extent that ruins gaming or movies in any major way. In my tests, I didnt notice any banding or gradient rendering issues, and the panel was speedy enough to not have any severe ghosting either. I have put in several sessions of Overwatch, Fortnite, Doom Eternal and Far Cry 5, and the display managed to produce accurate colors and sufficiently deep blacks for an enjoyable experience. The input lag remained a non-issue as well, however we had to turn off V-Sync to achieve that. This will introduce screen tearing in varying degrees, but thats the price you will have to pay for a higher resolution 60Hz panel. Keyboard The G14 sports a tenkeyless keyboard, which is not ideal but considering the size of the system it is to be expected. While the layout isnt edge-to-edge, it doesnt feel cramped thanks to the spacing between the keys. The chicklet-style keyboard also has reasonably deep key travel and feels accurate and responsive while typing. Above the keyboard are dedicated volume and mic muting keys, as well as a button to load the ROG Armoury Crate software that lets you manage the GPU and CPU performance, set up per-app profiles, manage your game collection, and more. Considering that you wont be using the software all that much after the initial setup, I would have preferred the dedicated key to instead cycle through the different performance profiles (Windows, Silent, Performance, and Turbo) as using the FN key to cycle between them is a bit unresponsive and clunky. The keyboard does feature back lighting, but the implementation of it is shockingly poor. Each key seems to have transparent lettering that glows when the back lighting is turned on. But it seems that that keycaps are placed on top of the LEDs which doesnt allow much light through. As such, the back lighting is inconsistent across the entire keyboard, and in fact, completely unusable in all but dark conditions. Turning on the lighting in brighter conditions blends the lettering with the silver coloring of the deck, making it hard to read the keys. This is surprisingly poor design on an otherwise sharply engineered system, and one wonders how this passed through any quality checks. Thankfully, with the back lighting turned all the way down, the lettering on the keys are dark enough to never be an issue reading the keyboard in any condition. The back lighting does seem to do its job in a dark room, hitting the keys with just enough light to make them readable, even though it is terribly inconsistent. Speaking of inconsistency, the touchpad is far from the best I have tried. The smooth glassy finish of the surface allows you to move across the screen with reasonable accuracy, but the tap detection is wonky at best and I found myself jabbing at the pad which failed to register at least 60% of my taps. It is fine to use it in a clutch, but I do recommend using a mouse alas it befalls to your rage when it fails to register a click after the fifth attempt. Speakers The laptop rocks a quad-speaker setup, with a pair of 2.5-watt speakers and a pair of 0.7-watt tweeters pumping out loud, clear audio with a touch of bass to support the sound. There is a good amount of separation in the audio, and there is enough detail and richness for some casual music listening. The speakers are also able to drum up a large soundstage, so the audio doesnt feel like its coming from a tiny space. However, they arent good enough to substitute for a good pair of headphones or a speaker system, which are recommended if you want to play games or watch movies. I must mention that I could hear crackling and tearing while playing some (if not most) audio files. The tear is clearly noticeable where there is a lot of vocals, such as a YouTube video. I am not sure if this is a production defect that affects every model, or its just my review unit, but it is something to keep in mind if you plan to purchase the laptop. Battery Life A gaming laptop that lasts more than a few hours is a rare breed, but the G14 surpasses all expectations. Using a 76WHrs 4-cell battery, the laptop was able to last for nearly 9 hours on battery. I was able to complete an entire workday on a single charge, using the laptop for browsing the Internet, writing a few articles, watching a few YouTube videos, rendering a small 5-min file on Premiere Pro and more. I achieved this by using the Silent performance profile, and keeping the brightness at 50%, speakers at 100% and turning off the backlit on the keyboard (not that you would want to use it anyway). I can only assume that the laptop will last a lot more with some concessions involved. Heat and Fan Noise The Achilles heel of such a compact gaming laptop is heat collection. With such little space for the air to move around, it is only but natural that the chassis is going to heat up. And so, the G14s biggest issue is the heat management, and it is severe enough that it gets almost unplayable after a couple of hours of gaming. Heat is collected across the deck, with the curvature near the palm rest and WASD keys getting the most hit. The front ventilation grilles are naturally too hot to touch, but annoyingly, the laptop also expels hot air from the sides, and the throw is wide enough to easily heat up the surrounding area. You will feel a bit of warmth on right hand controlling the mouse even if its not touching the laptop. The Silent performance profile generates the least amount of heat, and it is best used whenever you are not gaming or doing any intensive work such as video rendering or high-resolution photo editing. It does get warm around the palm rest but only to negligible degrees. In terms of fan noise, as is common with most Asus gaming laptops, the fans are nice and quiet with the Silent performance profile, while sounding like a small drone about to take off on Performance or Turbo profiles. They arent loud enough to be intrusive when you are using headphones but will surely make their presence felt if you chose to use the speakers. Performance The combo of AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS and NVIDIA RTX 2060 Max-Q with 6GB of VRAM produces expectedly great results. While the Max-Q isnt up to snuff with the full RTX 2060 card found on the cheaper TUF Gaming A15 laptop, it is still a top performer and should easily manage to produce 60fps+ on 1080p for current and next-gen games. At 1440p, it naturally takes a hit on frame rates but on a 14 screen, you are better off trading resolution for higher frame rates. Benchmark 1080p 1440p Far Cry 5 77fps 58fps Rise of the Tomb Raider 60fps 53fps Shadow of the Tomb Raider w/RTX 37fps 25fps Shadow of the Tomb Raider w/o RTX 68fps 45fps The Division 2 48fps 33fps Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4 75.8fps 46.4fps Note: The benchmarks were performed using the Turbo performance profile at the highest graphical settings available. Benchmark Points Cinebench 20 4181 3D Mark - Timespy 6046 3D Mark - Firestrike 13984 3D Mark - Port Royal 3257 3D Mark - Sky Diver 29665 3D Mark - PCMark10 5427 Unlike the A15 laptop, there was no discernible difference between the Performance and Turbo profiles, so I chose to remove Performance results from the benchmarks entirely. However, I would still recommend using the Turbo mode to get the best possible performance out of the system. On the productivity side, the 4900HS processor, 16GB RAM and a speedy 1TB nVMe SSD keeps things blazing quick. I didnt notice a slow down while having several apps open in the background while the processor was busy crunching a video render together. Purchase Guide Pre-orders for the the ROG Zephryus G14 starts from May 7 in the UAE at Amazon, Emax, SharafDG, and from May 11 at Virgin Megastores, and will be bundled with a ROG Delta Core gaming headset. The pre-orders will be fulfilled by May 24. The laptop will hit retail shelves from May 21 onwards in the UAE, and should be available at Computronics, Dubai Duty Free, E-City, Emax, Jumbo, Sharaf DG and Virgin Megastores. Do keep in mind that only the 60Hz display model will be available on launch. The faster display models will be available at an unspecified later date. The Asus G14 does several things well that is hard to overlook  it's the smallest and lightest laptop in its category, it lasts nearly 9 hours on battery, it sports an excellent quad-speaker setup, and the two-punch combo of the AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS and NVIDIA RTX 2060 Max-Q is some of the best youll find on a gaming laptop. However, its shoddy keyboard back lighting and excessive heat generation keeps it from being what could had been a near flawless gaming system. Of course, the 60Hz display is a no-go if you want the laptop for gaming, but the 120Hz panel will cost you a bit more. For AED 6,999, Asus has priced the G14 quite competitively, and for the performance it offers, it is easily a leader in its category. However, it is taken to task with the companys own TUF Gaming A15 laptop that does most of things just as well, performs better and is a cool thousand bucks cheaper. The only drawback of the A15 is its chunky footprint and comparatively poor battery life (under 5 hours). Ultimately, its up to you and your requirements from a gaming laptop, but you wont go wrong with either one here.", "date": "May 7, 2020, 1"}
