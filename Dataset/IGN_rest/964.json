After playing the slowly paced Book One, which includes the first two chapters of the story and a short interlude, I wish Dreamfall Chapters was released all at once, too. It feels slow to start and heavy on exposition, yet somehow poor at giving newcomers enough background material to care about the characters or even fully understand what the heck is going on. Dont get me wrong: once all five books are released, Dreamfall Chapters *could* be phenomenal. Judged as a stand-alone entry, though, Book One: Reborn can be confusing, introducing you to three different playable characters and four different settings in its relatively brief three to five hours. With just a few cryptic lines about how she ended up here, were reintroduced to main character Zo Castillo, still trapped in a coma following the events of Dreamfall, and the concept of Storytime - an ethereal netherworld where we go when we dream. Theres no recap of Dreamfalls deep, intricate storyline, and the lack of backstory gets even more confusing in Chapter 2 when the action suddenly drops you into the subplot of Kian Alvane. Hes another returning character from Dreamfall, whos been imprisoned in the magical world of Arcadia for treason. In short, you should probably go back and play The Longest Journey if you want to know why you should care about these people. Even within the scope of Dreamfall Chapters itself, the lack of context can be frustrating. When we return to Zo six months later in yet another setting - the dystopian futuristic city of Europolis where youll spend most of Book One - she starts by unloading a big information dump of exposition to her therapist that turns out to be more dull than informative. Its a lazy storytelling device that slows down the already leisurely pace of this first episode. Meanwhile, the amateurish voice acting of the therapist character is in stark contrast to the strong performances of Zo and a few other characters. Acting quality is all over the place. Dreamfall Chapters gameplay is very similar to its predecessor, letting you easily control a free-roaming character in third-person and seamlessly interact with noteworthy objects via pop-up icons. Thankfully, the combat and stealth systems that mucked up Dreamfall: The Longest Journey have been dropped in lieu of straightforward adventuring and puzzle-solving, such as creating a makeshift torch by combining an oily rag with an arrow. Most of the puzzles are too easy for my tastes, though Ill admit to lucking into the answer of one or two of them. So few items exist for you to pick up that combining the two you have, no matter how dubious it may seem, is probably the right solution. One standout puzzle sees Zo tasked with evaluating a banged-up bot for duty. The robots comedic antics and voice are reminiscent of Borderlands Claptrap, while its crass name (shh...it rhymes with Itbot) makes you remember that this is an adventure with mature themes and writing, even when it veers into potty humor. Figuring out how to direct this inept hunk of hovering junk, such as fixing other broken bots, is made more entertaining due to its excitable personality. Much like The Walking Dead episodes, choices that you make - such as interrupting a conversation or merely eavesdropping - will be remembered by other characters, and will supposedly influence gameplay. I say supposedly because I saw little such influence in Book One; presumably most of the ramifications of your choices wont be felt until more Books are released. Its one of those features that has awesome potential, but its too soon to say whether itll ever be fulfilled. Pros IntricateFun, if easy, puzzles Cons Poor pacingUnsatisfying story arcMissing context Dreamfall Chapters: Book One could be the start of an epic adventure, but without any clear narrative arc of its own, this first episode falls flat. Given how intricate its predecessors plot was, a recap or flashbacks for Dreamfall wouldve been immensely helpful to understanding the characters current predicaments and their disparate realities. Its puzzles are fun, if mostly easy, and the setup lays rich groundwork for something grand...eventually. My recommendation (especially for newcomers to The Longest Journey saga) is to wait for future episodes to be released before jumping into its byzantine story.", "date": "Nov. 13, 2014,"}
