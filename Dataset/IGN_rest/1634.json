The camera focuses tightly behind your back, adding to that sense of claustrophobia and dread as you clunkily move through the caverns. Suddenly, you hear the distinctive screams of famed High School Musical diva Sharpay Evans from ahead. You know youre about to be met with a heart-pounding fight against some godforsaken terror that will be sure to test your quick-time event skills.This is what its like to play every game in The Dark Pictures Anthology series, and its latest tale, House of Ashes, is no different. If, like me, you think Until Dawn was one of the most interesting games to have come out of the last generation of consoles and havent minded the growing pains Supermassive Games has had to try to anthologize the series, House of Ashes is its best work since Until Dawn in 2015. However, if youve become bored with the formula or never liked it in the first place, the latest story probably wont change your mind.In some ways, thats the rub of this entire review. Supermassive hasnt made any, well, massive changes to how its games play or look outside of new difficulty options. The facial capture is still mostly great, though sometimes the characters necks look like theyre made out of liquid. Environments look stunning at times while others will remind you that Supermassive is no longer working with a big budget from Sony. Movement is clunky even though we now have full control over the camera during exploration. The bulk of the gameplay in House of Ashes six-or-so-hour runtime comes down to making choices and performing different types of QTEs. Its a formula that Supermassive has used to varying success over its last three Dark Pictures games, but in the right circumstances it still pays off. Supermassive hasn't made any massive changes to how its games play or look.Without going into spoilers, House of Ashes is very much a step up in storytelling compared to the previous two games in the Dark Pictures series. Both Man of Medan and Little Hope tried to subvert expectations in ways that never felt in the spirit of Until Dawn. House of Ashes swings the story pendulum back and ends with the prospects for an entirely new direction for the series. Following the reveals in Little Hope, I was left fascinated to see what the team would do next. Thats not because Im continually chasing the excellence that is Until Dawn, but because the direction the franchise might take next is as interesting as The Dark Pictures Anthology has ever been. I dont want to oversell the story, though. There are still instances of weirdly stilted dialogue and certain aspects of the plot dont really pay off in meaningful ways. Plus, the whole idea of a game set in the middle of the Iraq War with Marines going into a secret compound to search for Saddams biological weapons can be off putting knowing what we now know about how that particular conflict turned out.Characters continue to be the weakest part of The Dark Pictures Anthology.Theres also some potential for character arcs to feel either unearned or heavily cliched. I mean, you can probably guess what might happen when a young Marine and an Iraqi soldier are forced to work together. It can, of course, change depending on your choices, but it never feels like Supermassive is breaking new ground with its character work. If anything, the characters continue to be the weakest part of The Dark Pictures Anthology, though the participants in House of Ashes are a small step up from what weve seen in Man of Medan and Little Hope, with Salim being the most notable.What We Said About The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little HopeLittle Hope tells a mostly one-note story with underdeveloped characters, and even a fun co-op mode cant inject enough life to fix that. There werent enough meaningful consequences to the choices I made to inspire further digging into its box of tricks, which made additional playthroughs tough going, and the more generous amount of time you have to react to quick-time events deprived me of any gory deaths. A gorgeous setting and some genuinely frantic monster sequences save it from being a complete disaster, but this still feels like a step backward from the heights of interactive horror stories. Hopefully, the next entry in the Dark Pictures Anthology will have interesting characters with much more to say and do, as Little Hopes predecessors have proven Supermassive can deliver. - Lucy O'Brien, October 29, 2020Score: 5Read the full The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope reviewWhat House of Ashes does do well is the same thing that made Until Dawn so special. Supermassive excels at building tension throughout its best moments, and it subtly uses the environment to help do that. For example, House of Ashes mostly takes place in an underground ruin. Think of films like The Descent for a solid reference point. In both that movie and this game, the creators use tight camera shots as the characters are sneaking through tunnels to add an extra sense of claustrophobia, which increases the scare factor. You never know whats going to be around that next bend, and Supermassive is superb at mixing in both jump scares and other ways to keep you on your toes.Supermassive is superb at mixing in both jump scares and other ways to keep you on your toes.And for fans of the gory deaths that are seen so often in horror games, the new difficulty options make the QTEs even harder. You can, of course, turn things down to easy mode for a fun night with friends. On that note, we should mention that co-op is the best way to play these games. Whether in the same room via Movie Night or online, this is a fright that youll want to share. If you want to take things up a notch and really see some blood and guts, the tougher difficulty options will oblige. I mostly played on the middle difficulty (Challenging) and didnt have too much trouble, but bumping things up to Lethal tested me  as it should.On top of everything else good about House of Ashes is a central mystery thats a return to form for Supermassive. After two back-to-back middling endings with Man of Medan and Little Hope, this one nailed it for me. That isnt to say its groundbreaking or guaranteed to blow your socks off, but its more in line with what many expected to see coming out of Until Dawn. Plus, again, the implications it has for the future of the franchise are beyond intriguing. Without spoiling much, its safe to say that I am as hyped as Ive been for the series since Supermassive first announced it was making more horror games. If it can deliver on what its set up, we might be on the verge of The Dark Pictures Anthology becoming a force in horror games. In many respects, you know exactly what youre getting with The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes. Its a QTE-filled horrorfest that is often stretching against the limitations of its budget. The script could use some polish and the characters could be a little more outside the box. However, the claustrophobic scares work effectively, and the central mystery of House of Ashes signifies a return to what fans loved about Until Dawn. It gives us a tantalizing look at what could be coming in the future.", "date": "Oct. 21, 2021,"}
