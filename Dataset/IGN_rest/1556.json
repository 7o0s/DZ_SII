Its not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5s DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means its much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2. With all of that, including a few features you dont see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valves Index and HPs Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category except available games.PlayStation VR2  Design and FeaturesThe PlayStation VR2 is an immediate improvement over its predecessor in every way, but the physical design is actually pretty similar. Like its forebear, its got a clean black-and-white look that matches your PS5, and its built around an adjustable head strap thats separated from the VR display itself, which does a great job of comfortably accommodating a wide range of head shapes and lets the weight of the screen rest on the top of your head rather than on your face. The one-stop adjustment mechanism on the back of the head strap remains an excellent way to dial in a perfect fit.Its nice to see the PS VR2 has a slider on the top-left side of the lens casing to quickly adjust the headsets interpupillary distance, or IPD, and its especially neat that the internal camera quickly measures the distance between your eyes during setup. Other than that Sony has kept the headset itself simple, with just two buttons at the bottom of the display. The center button turns the headset on and off, and the other instantly activates passthrough mode, letting you see the real world around you in black and white without taking off the headset. This is great if you need to adjust your controllers or greet someone whos entered your play area. That said, its slightly disappointing there are no physical buttons to adjust the volume.Sony has kept the headset itself simple.Everything else about the PS VR2 feels like a quantum leap over any other headset in its price class  save for the HP Reverb G2 which, up until now, has offered a level of fidelity only accessible to PC gamers. This is no longer the case, and the PlayStation VR2 is now the most affordable way to play PC-quality VR games at 4K resolution. Unlike the Reverb G2, however, the PS VR2s display uses two HDR-enabled 2,000 x 2,040 per-eye OLED panels that operate at up to 120 Hz and offer a 110-degree FOV, rather than the G2s slightly less glamorous dual 2,160 x 2,160 LCD panels that cap out at 90 Hz and a 98-degree FOV without any support for HDR. As a result, the PlayStation VR2 displays a picture that is smoother, richer, and deeper than anything else on the market today  save for, perhaps, the Meta Quest Pro which costs three times as much.PlayStation VR2  Setup and ControllersCompared to the original PSVR, setup is a breeze. Instead of a whole bunch of cables and an HDMI switcher that was an absolute chore to deal with  to say nothing of the tracking camera  the PS VR2 has a single USB-C cable you plug into your PS5, and youre done! After that youll need to install a firmware update and then quickly calibrate your controllers, eye tracking, and lens spacing, and the four tracking cameras will capture a scan of your room. Its extremely cool to see it accurately map out the geometry of a room  and everything in it, including furniture, pets, and even the leftovers on your coffee table. Once you carve out a play area, the PS VR2s guardian walls rise out of the ground, clearly marking which parts of your room are safe to walk around in.Its easy to recalibrate or adjust your settings at any point from the main PlayStation 5 settings menu, and anyone familiar with the PS5s control center wont have a problem seamlessly navigating between the VR experience and the PS5s main menu. Still, its neat that someone can stand outside of the PS VR2 headset and direct the experience remotely using a DualSense controller. This can make setup way simpler if youre trying to show off the PS VR2 to someone who doesnt usually spend time in VR or isnt familiar with the PS5s interface.What We Said About the Original PlayStation VRSony has managed to make its lower-priced PlayStation VR headset competitive where it counts. Despite its relatively low resolution it looks very good in games, and the headset is comfortable to wear and easy to use after youve dealt with its many wires. Paired with the Move controllers it provides good but sometimes flakey motion tracking on your hands, but the PlayStation Cameras limited viewing angle is a weakness, and so is its inability to see behind you. Should you run out and buy one? That depends. The technology is astonishing but still in its infancy, and VR games that rival current console blockbusters are a long way off, so it wont be as immediately useful as you might expect for a $400 to $500 price. However, its a lot of fun to be on the forefront of something as exciting as VR. Some of the best times Ive had with my VR headsets are from wowing people who come over and try it for the first time, and that never gets old. Dan Stapleton, October 5, 2016Score: 8.5Read the full PlayStation VR reviewIf youve only ever used the PSVRs Move controllers, the moment you grab onto the included pair of Sense controllers is a revelation. The layout of their clicky face buttons and analog sticks will feel familiar to anyone who has played room-scale VR in the last several years, but they step things up with the addition of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The analog sticks are half the size of the DualSenses, but remain tactile, allowing almost the same degree of precision as a D-Pad when playing a game of Tetris Effect: Connected, which is notoriously difficult to play on the Quest 2s default Touch controllers. Each button also features capacitive touch that can tell if your fingers are on it or not, which allows you to make reasonably accurate gestures with your hands. Its not quite as sophisticated as the finger tracking on the Valve Index controllers, though, so youre limited to specific gestures like giving a thumbs up or pointing with your index finger.In games like Horizon Call of the Mountain and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxys Edge, you can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster through the resistance of the adaptive triggers. Haptic feedback improves this effect by simulating certain forces, textures, and noises through dynamic vibrations. This can be felt in everything from smashing a large shipping container with your Godzilla-sized tentacles in Tentacular to tackling an opponent in 2MD: VR Football Unleashed  but its at its most impressive when producing subtle but accurate vibrations for calmer interactions, such as gliding your paddle against the flow of water in Kayak VR Mirage, where you can almost feel the resistance of the water through the Sense controllers haptic vibrations. You can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster.Of course, just like with the DualSense, battery life is a concern here: with all that vibrating and resisting, a full charge only lasts around four to five hours. Thats a long time for a session of VR gaming, but the fact that you cant swap out batteries for a fresh pair means you might get cut short if you forget to plug them in. Likewise, the Sense controllers ring design may take some getting used to  it can be difficult to figure out where your hands are supposed to go by touch, which adds a little hassle to the joy of introducing someone new to VR. But theyre comfortable to hold once you get a grip.PlayStation VR2  Gaming PerformanceIn contrast to the OLED panel included in the original PSVR, the PS VR2s 4K HDR OLED panel offers richer colors and up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making even less visually detailed games come to life. The screen door effect was never an issue with the PSVR, and it isnt here either, but with proper IPD calibration, you can now tactically eliminate glare as well. The fact that youre encompassed by 110 degrees of scenery at all times makes VR all the more lifelike. Thats 10 degrees wider than the original PSVR, and its a significant difference in how much of the world around you is visible. Its still a bit like wearing a SCUBA mask, but its a bigger, less-claustrophobic SCUBA mask. Simply put, the PS VR2 is by far the most gorgeous headset in the $500 price range. The PS VR2s access to the PS5s graphical horsepower allows its games to have vast draw distances, much like their flatscreen counterparts, and theres no better demonstration of this than in Horizon Call of the Mountain. You can see fully simulated mechanical creatures running around across the map, contrasted against cascading waterfalls and picturesque mountaintops reflecting light in the distance. Similarly, Cities VR: Enhanced Edition allows you to build urban sprawls that truly come alive from a distance  and now you can see all of it, all at once. The PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering.On top of that, the PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering, which means its built-in IR camera tracks the movement of your eyes and uses that information to improve efficiency. Because it knows exactly what youre focused on, it can put all its processing power into making that area super detailed, while everything else can be dialed down to conserve resources. Its also neat that certain games can now allow you to select menu options with your eyes, or toggle interactions just by glancing at a character. The only other headset available right now that can do this is the Meta Quest Pro, and thatll cost you $1,500. What We Said About Horizon Call of the MountainHorizon Call of the Mountains exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizons first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to derail completely. Its an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the Horizon story. Simon Cardy, February 16, 2023Score: 7Read the full Horizon Call of the Mountain reviewAnother nice touch you dont see on the other popular VR sets is built-in headset vibration, which adds a new layer of immersion to gameplay when implemented at the right moments. For example, roving dinosaurs in Jurassic World Aftermath and explosions in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxys Edge both generate haptic vibrations that pulse through the headset, coinciding with the distance, position, and intensity of the sounds they produce. It can bring the cinematic details out of sound design in games that implement it skillfully, but you really want proper 3D audio on top of the haptics in order to get the full experience, which means the disappointing packed-in earbuds dont cut it quite as well as something like Sonys own Pulse 3D wireless headphones. The disappointing packed-in earbuds don't cut it quite as well as something like Sony's own Pulse 3D wireless headphones. Unfortunately, youre out of luck if youre hoping any of this will work with your existing PSVR game catalog. Because of how big an improvement it is, PS VR2 represents a clean slate for PlayStations entire VR library, so even if youve spent hundreds of dollars on PSVR games that made the list of PS VR2 games in the launch window, youll have to buy them again (though a few publishers have announced free PS VR2 upgrades for existing PSVR games). And considering that there just arent a ton of new games announced yet, it might be a while before the PS VR2 catches up to other platforms in terms of selection. But hey, it has Beat Saber, and what more do you really need?PlayStation VR2  Purchasing GuideThe PlayStation VR2 is initially available through PlayStation Direct for $549.99 with two Sense controllers, a single USB-C cable, and auxiliary earbuds. PlayStation Direct currently offers a $599.99 bundle containing Horizon Call of the Mountain at a $10 discount. The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console youll need to use it. Even so, its such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2s unique features.", "date": "Feb. 16, 2023,"}
