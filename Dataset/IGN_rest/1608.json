The newest downloadable title set to hit the 3DS eShop on February 2, this unassuming action adventure takes players on a trip through ancient Japan. You're put in the wooden shoes of a young samurai tasked with saving Princess Cherry Blossom, the daughter of the gods who has been taken away from the people by an evil force. To bring her back and restore peace, you must battle your way across the map, defeating several menacing bosses along the way. Oh, and all of this is done at the request of a lonely Kappa. Naturally. A simple premise, to be sure, but the game quickly had its hooks in me, and wowed me with its distinct charm and fulfilling gameplay. The art style is gorgeous, like a ukiyo-e painting come to life, and the added 3D depth further brings the world of Sakura Samurai to life. The map contains 30 different areas, including three boss castles and three villages. The rest of the areas pit you against groups of various enemies, and defeating each of these segments earns you a petal (collecting two of which increases your health by one heart). The vibrant world of Sakura Samurai. The enemies are varied and a thrill to fight. From sword-wielding flunkies to archers to spear-wielders to ninjas that toss bombs and ninja stars while vanishing in an explosion of smoke - each of these opponents has its own attack style that must be isolated and overcome to assure victory. The best part is that there is variation even among the same type of bad guy. This constantly keeps you on your toes, as you never know whether one will charge right for you or pause mid-attack to throw you off-guard. The final showdown at Dark Moon Castle is particularly epic, putting all the samurai skills you've amassed along the way to the test. Actual combat involves slashing with A, parrying with L or R, and blocking with B. Pressing X allows you to freely walk around the area, though this opens you up to unforeseen assaults. Building up power in your sword over time allows you to unleash a special attack when you need an extra show of strength. This special power can be upgraded by winning different gems in the local street games. Blocking is useful, but only to an extent - after a short time it will cause your sword to dull, and you'll have to either use a whetstone to repair it to take it in to the local swordsmith. Dodging at just the right moment also earns you precision points, which you can build up by continuing to execute perfect evasions and avoiding damage. These can be traded in at the local Frogs Plus market for precious coins. Rain or shine - a samurai is always prepared. The villages, which all contain the same lovable NPCs, take a fun game and make it the charming, memorable experience that Sakura Samurai is. Whether you're stocking up on rice cakes (the game's form of health) at the Frogs Plus, getting your sword upgraded, taking a rest or saving your progress at the local inn, waving to the pinwheel-wielding little girl who wonders why a Kappa is hiding in the fountain or partaking in one of several different street games in exchange for coins or prizes - the villages are full of life, and go a long way in lending personality and a human element to this sword-swinging adventure. And don't think you won't get your money's worth either - completing the game unlocks a harder mode that doubles the damage dealt by enemies and challenges you with beating the entire game with only three hearts (and without the ability to purchase rice cakes too). Along the way you also unlock a 30-, 50-, and 100-Thug Challenge, which you can try to best your own time in. The game also has a Rock Garden, which lets you ~dedicate~ the steps you've taken with your 3DS system in sleep mode. The more you dedicate, the more beautiful your garden becomes as your cherry blossoms bloom. And in case you're worried, it doesn't affect your system's step or play coin count in any way. CLOSING COMMENTS Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword is a gorgeous game, and a brilliant addition to the 3DS library. The art style and music transport you to another world, and the combat is more than engaging. The enemies are also varied and require your full attention to defeat, making for a deep experience and keeping Sakura Samurai from becoming just a generic, samurai-themed brawler. The RPG elements - care of the items, sword upgrades and delightfully populated villages - further enrich the experience. If youre a 3DS owner, dont hesitate - download Sakura Samurai now, and begin your journey to Dark Moon Castle.
