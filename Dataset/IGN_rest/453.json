Taking the time to explore the massive cast of fighters and master their intricate abilities is a test of dexterity and patience, but it delivers a satisfying experience perfect for those looking for a challenge to conquer. The transition to polygonal graphics from the historical sprites hasnt exactly been kind to it, but this is still an excellent entry in the series. King of Fighters XIV is nearly exhausting in the sheer amount of content it contains. Theres enough here to spend hours learning various moves, characters, and combinations and still feel as if youve barely scratched the surface. A total of 50 individual fighters provides nearly unparalleled variety when choosing just who to take with you onto the field of battle. Most of the men and women vying for the title of the King of Fighters feel unique, some radically so, such as Angel and the impressive variety of her Unchain Circle combo attacks. Eighteen of the combatants are all-new to the series with this game. Most of the new arrivals fit right in with the old favorites, like Kukri, who can harness various projectiles to confound opponents and pour on the pressure. Others carry on the King of Fighters tradition of groups of characters representing countries and areas from around the globe, such as Nelson, Zarina, and Bandeiras who form Team South America. I Choose You Nakoruru This seemingly endless variety of fighting styles and matchups really comes to a head when deciding which three fighters will make up your team. Making adjustments to your regular crew by replacing a character to shore up a weakness might shift the synergy of the entire team, requiring you to use a new style with old favorites. You may try a new fighter that you feel makes good use of your Max meter and play them last, but if you add in another character that fills the same function you may need to learn to play them without spending resources, or perhaps change them out entirely. Since you need to become proficient with at least three characters, as opposed to just one in most other fighting games, theres a tremendous amount to learn. There are, for instance, no less than four different ways just to jump - nothing is simple. Youre given the tools to learn though, including a Trial mode which will teach you basic and intermediate combos for every character, but its up to you to put in the work. The options are almost too plentiful, but exploration of the nearly endless combinations of characters, maneuvers, and matchups is a large portion of the appeal. Action is often frantic and its generally geared more towards offense. Dashes, rolls, and hops help you to apply pressure, and damage really ramps up in the later portions of a bout when both players have a lot of Max meter to work with. Making a defensive mistake against a skilled opponent late in a match could cost you a character, adding tension to each of your decisions. That said, big damage doesnt come easy; even for those familiar with other fighting games KoFs complicated controller motions and button combinations may seem daunting or alien at first. Finally landing that crazy, character-killing combo late in a match after practicing it for hours in training is hugely satisfying, and its that particular rush that kept me coming back for more. Technical Knockouts Moments like that are hard to come by online, sadly. In its current form netplay is a big black fly in the punch bowl. Online multiplayer is inconsistent in quality at best, with matches often reduced to a stuttering and unplayable mess. It is possible to find smooth fights when carefully matching against players with strong internet connections, but it requires patience and a little searching. Even attempts to fight players on medium-strength connections were sluggish and hitched. Despite running at a smooth 60 fps though, King of Fighters XIV doesnt look great. This game marks a transition from the seriess traditional 2D sprites to more modern 3D-rendered models on a 2D plane, similar to Street Fighter V. Oddly, despite the in-game animations being fluid and the fighter models being well crafted, characters in cutscenes arent animated as skillfully, looking stiff and clumsy. These brief glimpses of the simple plot are also graphically shabby, with the vignettes looking more like they belong in an early PlayStation 3 game. The cutscenes and quick in-game interactions between characters fail to give a comprehensive understanding of anyones motivations, which was really frustrating considering how initially appealing some of these characters are at first glance. Though technically lacking, strong art direction throughout the 19 vibrantly colored stages and 50 distinct characters helps to establish a fantastic atmosphere for the over-the-top proceedings. The environments range from an abandoned church to an aircraft carrier to the Great Wall of China. Most of the characters are equally visually striking, like Chinese opera dancer Mian and her traditional stage garb, or the mysterious luchador known as King of Dinosaurs, a rudo fighter wearing a Tyrannosaurus mask. Even with so many fighters to choose from, most of them sport radically different character designs. This actually made me want to learn new fighters; I spent hours in Training mode checking out various fighters and seeing what they could do based simply on the fact their appearance alone made them interesting. King of Fighters XIV offers an astonishing amount of content, with nearly double the playable characters of most other games available on day one. The fighters themselves are interesting and well designed, both visually and mechanically, and they push limits with an execution ceiling higher than perhaps any other fighting game. King of Fighters XIVs netcode and technical shortcomings are itis biggest stumbling blocks, but mastering its characters and leveraging what youve learned remains satisfying regardless. There are no shortcuts to becoming the new King of Fighters, but the journey to the top is well worth taking.", "date": "Aug. 25, 2016,"}
