It turns out to be much closer to what my inner cynic expected: a poorly made tie-in that cant even stand up as a competent third-person action game, much less something I could recommend to a fan of the show. What a disappointment. As youd expect from a rote video game adaptation, the ~story~ has Avatar Korra immediately robbed of her water, earth, fire, and air-bending powers and forces her to reactivate them one at a time. And as youd expect, combat against generic, mostly palette-swapped enemies is painfully simplistic (though it is challenging) and takes place in a series of bland, featureless arenas. Its especially bad in the first few hours of its approximately five-hour campaign. Every move Korra has is executed with a combination of just the X and Y buttons, with the triggers dedicated to countering on the left and dodging on the right  so its inherently button-mashy. To be fair, it does get better over time. Once Id gotten the hang of its annoyingly short counter timing windows and leveled up my bending skills I was able to pull off some attack strings that resembled the beatdowns Korra delivers to her adversaries in the show. Freezing them in ice, blowing them away in a whirlwind, blasting them with fireballs, and crushing them with boulders is impressively animated, so long as the enemies dont glitch out. It just never felt that good, even with the elaborate quick-time event finishing moves, and it took until I began my second playthrough of a game I didnt really want to finish the first time to unlock enough moves for it to become remotely rewarding. Enemy variety isnt terrible, but their baffling lack of resistances or vulnerabilities to any specific element means you almost never have to vary your attacks. I used water for distant or flying foes, earth for bashing them up close, air for crowd control, and fire for when I wanted to lose. Whats more, theres no incentive to mix things up to create multiple-element combos. That seems like a waste, given that youre the Avatar. Perhaps the most offensive part about The Legend of Korra: The Game is that, as a fan of the show, I could barely detect a hint of the wit and charm that makes its characters endearing. Thats partially because there essentially is no writing - just short, repetitive bursts of uncharacteristic and unimaginative smack-talk - and partially because Korra is effectively the only character who appears at all. A completely unanimated and badly voice-impersonated Jinora floats around giving advice on how to unlock your powers; Sidekicks Mako and Bolin show up for literally 15 seconds in an early cutscene before being knocked off screen and out of the game; Iroh has two lines of dialogue that repeat every time you visit the item store; Tenzin, Asami, Lin, Meelo, Ikki, Bumi, and the rest are complete no-shows. In fact, even the cutscenes are poor  they look to be animated at about 10 frames per second and feel slightly off-model. Its embarrassing. A close second on the terribleness scale is Irohs item store. This is a fairly tough game on normal difficulty, and I was routinely beaten up by earth, fire, and water-bending enemies until I got some decent moves. Thatd be fine, except for that when you die, all of the health potions and buffs youve used (and the points you used to acquire them) stay gone. That means they must be repurchased and re-equipped every single time, or you cant heal at all. Its a genuinely stupid system. You can even end up in a situation where one of the obnoxiously durable and repetitious bosses kills you enough that you run out of money and have to fight with no healing ability whatsoever, or go back to an earlier stage and grind for currency. The Legend of Korra: The Game isnt all combat, though when Id played the endless-runner minigame interjected every few levels I wished it was. Its actually not a terrible endless runner, but the addition of a few bending-themed powers like fireballs to destroy obstacles and launching yourself into the air with earth-bending doesn't make it a good one either, and it looks absurd to see Korra riding her polar bear/dog hybrid mount Naga as she makes disorienting 90-degree turns at high speed. Tacking on another mediocre mode of play doesnt improve this game - and that goes for the Pro Bending minigame, too. Pros Combat animations Cons Awful storyTerrible item storeCombat scenario designDull minigames I have no idea who The Legend of Korra: The Game is for. Its definitely not for young fans of Korra, as the combat is too unforgiving, the boss battles too tedious, the economy ridiculously punishing, and the story too weak and lacking any of the shows charm. Its not for older people who enjoy a good action game, because next to contemporaries like Batman: Arkham City, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, and even Platinums own Bayonetta 2, Korra looks terrible with its simple two-button combos and poor combat scenario design. I cant recommend it to anyone.", "date": "Oct. 22, 2014,"}
