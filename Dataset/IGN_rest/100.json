It's disappointing that it's locked to 30 frames per second on all systems instead of 60 (or higher), but other than that its gameplay and beautiful art style hold up just as well on modern systems as it did when the review below was written.  Daemon Hatfield Okami was, without doubt, one of the PlayStation 2s finest hours. A majestic riff on the Zelda archetype, its sprawling adventure was steeped in traditional Japanese culture, folklore and art, making it one of the most distinct yet holistic titles on the system. Okami HD represents the definitive version of the game, elevating its already incredible art direction to new heights. Simply put, Okami was destined to be played in 1080p 4K, and here it is. Okamis world is nothing if not a classical vision of Japan past. Rural life is celebrated, power is centralised in the hands of emperors and kings, tradition is embraced and mystical forces play an active role in the lives of its people. Into this world an ancient evil has awakened, spreading corruption across the land, and the sun goddess Amaterasu - in the form of a wolf - must restore peace and tranquillity. One of the reasons Okami is such a success is that every element of its design complements every other element. The hand-drawn ink and watercolour styling of its world, for instance, flows elegantly through to its gameplay. Its no accident that the sky has a thick paper texture and distant mountains are often little more than a few simple ink lines. In Okami, the world itself is a canvas, manipulated through the players most valuable tool: the Celestial Brush. Freeze frame the mountain scene I just described and you can draw a circle in the sky to turn night into day, or a crescent to turn day into night. Its an unbelievably potent concept, and one that Okami absolutely delivers on. Over the course of the game, Amaterasu learns 13 core brush techniques, and theyre nothing short of magical. By drawing the right icon, players can make dead trees bloom, repair broken bridges and machinery, slow down time and summon gusts of wind, spouts of water, bombs and more. The Celestial Brush mechanic isnt just a great thematic companion to the art style, but crucial to every aspect of the gameplay. In the wider world, players use it to solve basic puzzles and get around. Need to traverse a stretch of water? Create a lily pad and hop on, then draw a gust of wind to blow Amaterasu to her destination. Want to get up into a tree? Grapple up there by drawing a line between the flower above it and Amaterasu. Its the classic Zelda school of game design, where each technique opens up new possibilities for exploration and treasure hunting. Of course, the Celestial Brush is invaluable in combat too; the exclamation point on Amaterasus flurried melee attacks. In these sequences the brush can become a sword that can slice an enemy in half, or a machine gun capable of peppering them with rapid-fire ink bullets. The combat in this game isnt difficult - and there arent many enemies that demand more than rudimentary tactics - but there are some neat touches nonetheless. Some enemies must be attacked from behind with the brush, while others require the player to knock back their projectiles to open them up to attack. You get the idea. Everywhere you look in Okami, traditional Japanese culture and folklore shines through. Shintoism and its belief in the spirit world permeates the game, while many of the enemy designs are informed by Japanese mythology. Even the societal roles of the worlds inhabitants evoke a classical Japan. Oh, and how many games can you think of where the treasures you find are things like lacquerware sets and incense burners? Its all dealt with playfully, however. Amaterasu, for instance, has a delightful duality. At once a powerful goddess, capable of making sweeping changes to the world, she's also in turn a wolf pup, digging into the earth in search of treasure. The brush gods also walk this line, often revealing themselves in bizarre and slapstick cutscenes. Yes, a rich vein of humour runs throughout Okami  helped along by a sterling translation  and this is best exemplified by the player's travelling companion, the diminutive wandering artist Issun. His role is both expository and comedic; he brings a levity to conversations and provides the perfect yin to the silent protagonist's yang. Our two leads are joined by some memorable supporting characters too. In fact, while the tale is framed as the sun goddess quest to restore the land of Nippon, Amaterasu doesnt do it alone. The first major portion of the game sees Ammy repeatedly crossing paths with Susano, a descendant of the legendary warrior that  alongside the white wolf Shiranui  slayed the great beast that has now returned. Initially a comedic figure  lazy, something of a drunkard, all pretense but no skill  he eventually becomes far more. Similarly, Waka is a powerful, mysterious figure with a lightsaber sword and French affectations, who regularly turns up to make enigmatic pronouncements about the future. Hes also not above doing Amaterasus job for her. Much of the opening dozen or so hours, for instance, sees Amaterasu restoring Guardian Saplings to full bloom, but when they arrive in the coastal region of North Ryoshima, Waka has already restored its Sapling, reinforcing the fact that Ammy is not the only driving force of this story. This is a game full of twists and surprises. Over the course of Okami HD, players will venture to an underwater kingdom, go inside the belly of a beast, puppeteer an Emperor, scale an absolutely epic tower, watch a character set off for the stars in a bamboo rocket ship, and so much more. The dungeons are never hugely challenging, but they're satisfying nonetheless. Its an enormous game too; dozens of hours long for those that want to smell the roses. As grand and compelling as Okami is, its perhaps not as taut in some areas as it could be. Cutscenes can drag on a little, for instance, while the camera  particularly during combat  isnt always the players friend. Theres almost too much to collect, as well, and while praise (earned by completing tasks, restoring the world and feeding animals you come across) helps players expand core attributes, and money (earned by defeating monsters and selling treasure) can be used to buy new moves and items, the games power-ups add little. You simply wont need these  or even think to use them  in the vast majority of combat scenarios, and so discovering them in treasure chests across the land is something of a letdown. You can always sell them, of course. Its also worth pointing out a few minor issues with the presentation. First though, I really do need to underline that as a whole Okami HD is jaw-droppingly pretty. Its minimal, artistic aesthetic translates incredibly well to 1080p and looks absolutely phenomenal. There are countless flourishes that add appreciably to the experience as well, such as the shifting colours of the plants and flowers that spring up behind Amaterasu as she gains speed. That said, its a shame the pop-in wasnt pushed back in this version. Players still cant see more minor objects in the environment until they get relatively close. Youll also occasionally see brightly coloured polygonal base character models in the world from a distance. Its only a momentary thing before the characters texture pops in, but it happens. Finally, as youd expect, Okami HD incorporates Move functionality, but why youd choose to play this way Im not sure. Yes, theres greater responsiveness to the brush movements, but the upshot is that its actually harder to use. Slashing at an enemy with the brush, for instance, requires the player to draw a straight line through the enemy in question, and this is easier with the analogue stick than a highly sensitive motion controller. Youll certainly adapt to the Move controls, but everything is either slightly less intuitive or slightly clunkier. Using the D-pad or a combination of the square button/motion to manipulate the camera, for instance, is awkward  particularly in combat, while the button layout simply isnt as user friendly. My advice  ignore Move and stick to a pad. Okami is one of the finest games to come out of Japan in the last decade, and Okami HD is absolutely the best way to experience this epic adventure. Its re-release is rather timely too, given Japanese game publishers are currently preoccupied with creating games that will appeal in the West. Okami, in contrast, represents a pure, resolutely Japanese vision, and is all the more appealing for it.", "date": "Dec. 17, 2017,"}
