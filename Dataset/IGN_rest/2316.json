Probably not many; I can count on just a few fingers all of the serious soundbars Ive encountered. The Sound BlasterX Katana is here to remedy this shortfall. Creative bills the Katana as the world's first true Under Monitor Audio System, and to prove theyre serious about it, they seem to have coined a new acronym in the process. To that end, the Katana packs 4 speakers and an external sound card with 24-bit audio into a bar about 2 feet long, so it's squat enough to slide under any desktop PC monitor. Paired with the included subwoofer, this $300 sound system has positioned itself as a premium audio experience for the full range of PC activities  gaming, music, and movies. Sound BlasterX Katana Design and Features Lets get this out of the way right up front: The Katana is very fetching. The all-black, brushed aluminum chassis keeps a low profile, sitting no more than 2.5-inches high. Its angled slightly upward, toward you. Aesthetically, that makes it look like its some sort of alien drone, poised to spring into action, but theres an engineering rationale here  it orients the pair of tweeters to fire slightly upwards rather than directly into your keyboard and chest. Centered on the top are five buttons (the ones at either end are tastefully illuminated with a soft white light), and when you make a selection, your choice is briefly displayed on the front of the soundbar in an eight-character LED display. But that text fades, leaving nothing but the sleek black grille most of the time. Indeed, if it wasnt for the Sound BlasterX logo atop the bar, this could pass for a high-end home theater component. In a sense, Ive buried the lede. The visual highlight here is the Katanas LED light show: a ring of 49 lights that can be programmed to pulsate, strobe, move, or just softly glow from under the soundbar and reflect off the surface of your desk. The soundbar can light up your desk with 16.8 million colors, and it comes with a handful of great presets, like a slowly cycling rainbow of colors, a blue beam that pulses back and forth with Cylon-like intensity, or just a steady orange glow. Theyre all simply stunning, and you can make your own lighting profiles with the desktop software too. In addition to the bar itself, which sites under or in front of your monitor, theres also a beefy subwoofer thatll need to go under your desk. Setup is simple: An array of connectors are positioned in the back of the bar (facing your monitor), and thats where youll plug in the sub, AC power, and the USB cable for your computer (you can also connect a PS4). There are plenty of additional connectors back there, including a USB port for playing music directly from a flash drive, an optical port for connecting digital audio sources, headphone jack, aux audio input, and even a microphone input. Naturally, the Katana also connects to your phone via Bluetooth. What wont you find? HDMI  a clear sign that Creative is serious that this is meant for use with a PC rather than a living room television. Under the hood, the Katana has a pair of 2.5-inch Neodymium-powered midbass drivers  positioned so they fire more or less straight up out of the top of the soundbar  and a pair of 1.3-inch tweeters at either end so they wont be blocked even if you place the soundbar behind a large laptop. Whats interesting is that the Katana has three independent amplifiers: one for the high-end speakers, one for the mids, and a third for the 5.25-inch driver in the sub. The design is somewhat unconventional  not in high-end home theater receivers, where its typical  but definitely on PC desktops that often favor economy over audio quality. Sound BlasterX Katana  Software The Katana works with a version of the same Creative Connect suite that powers other Sound Blaster products, and while its not essential (you can control all of the soundbars essential features from the five onboard buttons and small remote control), it does extend your options significantly. You can shape the sound with an equalizer and an assortment of other audio controls, some of which work surprisingly well. Immersion, for example, does a surprisingly respectable job of expanding the soundstage of music and games. Creative supplies a handful of pre-built profiles (optimized for music, movies, and specific games like Call of Duty and DOTA 2) and  this is cool  you can move your favorites to Katanas onboard memory, so you dont have to start the software to launch your favorite profiles. Unfortunately, the Katana stores just 4 of them, which seems pretty stingy. You also get a lighting workbench, where you can create cool light shows for the Katana, selecting a single color or a range of hues, direction of motion, and more. You can save your favorites and insert them in sound profiles. It would be nice if the lights could react to sound  to accentuate explosions and gunfire, for example  but thats not on the menu. Sound BlasterX Katana  Performance Theres so very much to love here. Whether listening to music, watching Netflix, or playing games, the Katana sounds like Creative put every penny of the systems $300 price tag into the audio itself, and then some. Listening to The Beatles Dear Prudence  which has perhaps the loveliest bassline in rock history  shows how precise the Katana is, peeling off the low end to the highly capable subwoofer while playing the delicate arpeggios at the high end with astonishing clarity. And switching to something with a more active low end like Black Rebel Motorcycle Clubs Teenage Disease, I was frankly shocked that the subwoofer could keep up with the demands of the song, even at high volume, whereas I had I expected the low end to fade into the background. Of course, when I say high volume, Im speaking relatively. The Katana is a beast in terms of volume, and I simply never got anywhere close to its top volume. At my desk, I could comfortably play it no more than a quarter of its max volume. I briefly pushed it to nearly 50 percent to see how the subwoofer held up  but trust me when I say no one has a room big enough to take advantage of the Katanas audio potential. Indeed, the soundstage felt simply enormous Spinning up Fallout 4, Katana delivered more of the same. Getting out from under a pair of headphones is refreshing, and the soundbar seemed to offer a brighter, more open soundstage than Im used to hearing with a pair of cans around my ears, and without any ear or skull fatigue. Indeed, the soundstage felt simply enormous, as if the speakers were much further apart than they really were. Impressive. Also impressive: I applied the desktop apps Battlefield profile and found it made a noticeable difference even in Fallout, particularly in punching up background sounds and dialog, compared to playing it with the audio completely dry. That said, I felt that the Virtual 7.1 surround sound wasnt as effective at pointing me to the action as when Im wearing good gaming headphones. When I opted to play some Overwatch, though, I wanted to slip back into headphones with an integrated mic. And this is when I discovered that the headphone jack (and, for that matter, the flash drive port) is so darned inconvenient. Theres just no good way to plug headphones into this soundbar; either you need to pick it up and twist it around, or feel around blindly with your fingers looking for the port. The headphones should be located on the top or front, no question. The Katana fires on almost every cylinder. Its attractive and loud enough to wake the dead, and sounds about as good as any desktop speaker system Ive ever heard. The only thing that might give me some pause is the inconvenience of plugging in headphones  and perhaps the fact that these cant grow with you to something that requires HDMI.", "date": "April 2, 2019,"}
