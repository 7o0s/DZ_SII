Thankfully, Mario Party Superstars is a celebration of only the best moments this long-running franchise has had. It gathers 100 of the most enjoyable minigames, five excellent boards from the first three Mario Party games, and an amalgamation of some of the best rules, mechanics, and quality-of-life improvements into a single Switch game. Its still unsurprisingly dull without friends, and not all of the minigames are worthy of the superstar label, but on the whole this is quite simply the best Mario Party has been in a very long time. 2018s Super Mario Party represented a back to basics shift for the series, and Mario Party Superstars has taken that idea several steps further by focusing in on the N64 and early GameCube days. There are no motion-controlled minigames, no item capsules, no character-specific custom dice blocks, no buddies to recruit, and of course, no party car. Just four players, each taking turns rolling dice, moving along a virtual game board, playing minigames to earn coins, and using those coins to buy stars. And maybe it's because it has been a long while since weve had a Mario Party game without some sort of extra gimmick, but this simplicity is incredibly refreshing, and I certainly didnt miss having something there to mix up the formula. It helps that the five boards are some of the best-designed in Mario Partys history. Yoshis Tropical Island is an excellent starter board with an easy-to-understand layout and a fun twist involving the star marker swapping between its two islands  its sure to lead to heartbreak and elation in equal measure among your friends. Space Land, meanwhile, is a go-to when I want to play without any game-changing board mechanics and just get that pure virtual board game experience; Peachs Birthday Cake offers a completely different style of play by keeping the star in one position and sprinkling spots where you can plant coin or star-stealing piranha plants; Woody Woods forces you to think several moves ahead thanks to its constantly changing arrows that send you down different paths; and finally, Horror Land is a personal favorite of mine because of its fun day/night mechanic and a King Boo that can let you steal a star from every other player... if you get a skeleton key, 150 coins, and are able to reach him while its night. Its an insane hail Mary win condition to shoot for, but if you are able to manage it, its sure to be a story you and your friends wont soon forget. Developer NdCube has done a fantastic job of bringing both the looks and sounds of these boards up to modern standards as well. Character models are pretty much identical to how they looked in Super Mario Party three years ago, but the remade boards are immaculately detailed, with Peachs Birthday Cake being a clear standout thanks to the hyper-realistic and delicious-looking snacks decorating the linear path around the cake. It also cant be understated that not only have all of the boards and nearly all of the 100 minigames undergone dramatic visual transformations, but theyve also gained new instrumental arrangements for every song that accompanies them. You can even unlock the songs from the store and listen to both the classic and modern versions of each one in the Data House, which is great because while the N64 songs still hold up, their modernized versions are even better. One more board from Mario Party 3 would have made the overall package feel more robust.But while the boards are all impressive, the one bummer is that there are still only five of them. That is a step up over the dismal four that Super Mario Party offered, but still not on par with just about every single other numbered Mario Party game in the past, which have almost always included six. Even just adding one more board from Mario Party 3 would have gone a long way toward making the package feel more robust, and it would have evened out the balance of boards from the three N64 games at the same time. Minigame MadnessAt the heart of any good Mario Party game is its minigames, and fortunately almost none of the 100 that were cherry picked from every numbered entry in the series disappoint. Youve got your all-time classics like Bumper Balls, Shy Guy Says, Hot Rope Jump, Revers-A-Bomb, and Booksquirm, just to name a few favorites. What makes these games so great is their sheer simplicity, plus a small added twist. Bumper Balls, for instance, is literally just a game about bumping your rivals off a small circular platform while riding a bouncy ball. But the twist is that in order to knock an opponent off, you have to put yourself in a dangerous position by building up momentum and bumping them close to the edge, which puts you in prime position to get bumped off yourself. And then you also have some picks that might not immediately come to mind, yet wind up being great selections because of the variety they bring to the table. Honeycomb Havoc, a game in which you just take turns picking one or two fruits at a time and try not to be the one whos forced to grab a honeycomb, may not be the most exciting game in the world based on whats happening on-screen, but the metagame thats happening between you and your friends as youre all able to see their loss or victory several moves ahead makes it one of my favorites out of the whole pack.Very few, if any, are complete duds. That said, there are a couple of minigames that are so close to each other that including both of them feels like a waste of space. Leaf Leap and What Goes Up both have you racing upwards by hopping up platforms as fast as you can; Pokey Pummel and Mecha Marathon both have you pressing a button (or buttons) really fast; and Roll Call and Goomba Spotting both have you counting the number of things that appear on screen. All are fun games, and none are completely identical, but when you consider that classic minigames such as Platform Peril, Locked Out, and Running of the Bulb didnt make the final cut, its hard not to feel a bit disappointed at these handful of double-ups.Very few minigames, if any, are complete duds.My only other gripe with the minigame selection is that many of the 1v3 minigames are so skewed to favor either the single player or the group of three that it really doesnt make it much fun for either. In Piranhas Pursuit, for instance, it doesnt even feel like youre part of the minigame when youre on the team of three, Archer-ival feels actively terrible when youre not the archer, and Tidal Toss feels nearly impossible to win as a solo player if even one of the team of three is any good. Oh, and theres the iconic, N64 controller-destroying Tug o War, which actually requires an in-game warning to advise you not to use your palm to rotate the control stick in order to avoid damaging either your Joy-Con or your hand. That said, there are a couple of genuinely great 1v3 minigames, like Tackle Takedown, which is a football minigame that has the team of three attempting to tackle the single player who is able to use three bursts of speed to try and juke them out of their boots. But the majority are underwhelming and I always groaned when I saw one was coming up. Bringin It All BackMario Party Superstars doesnt do much thats completely new for the series, which is completely fine with me considering it brings back so many things that I love and missed from recent Mario Party games. Like for example, stars that cost 20 coins instead of 10, which was a big issue I had with Super Mario Party. It was just far too easy for everyone to afford stars in that game, which really hindered the actual board game strategy and placed too much importance on recruiting buddies to bolster your dice rolls. In addition, Duel Minigames are back and help make the final five turns way more exciting by giving you and your adversaries the opportunity to challenge each other to high-stakes, 1-on-1 minigames with wagered coins up for grabs. And of course, Chance Time is back as well, which introduces all sorts of chaos into the mix.. Bonus stars can also be turned on, off, and even set to the classic style of always going out to the ones who collect the most coins, win the most minigames, and/or land on the most event spaces  but the one truth of Mario Party is that even despite all of those options, luck will always be a factor. Try as you might, youll never be able to completely remove its hold over every game, and thats part of the magic. There will absolutely be times when the person who won the least amount of minigames will end up the overall victor, stealing a win from the person who held the lead for the majority of the match in the final seconds. And yeah, that may feel bad for some people in the moment, but the joy I get from Mario Party Superstars doesnt come from winning or losing. It comes from the hilarious interactions it pulls out of me and my friends, which it does with a reliability that few other games are able to match. Mario Party Superstars pulls hilarious interactions from me and my friends like few others.Playing locally in the same room is obviously ideal, but Mario Party Superstars also has a pretty solid suite of online options. The standard Party Mode has both matchmaking with random players as well as private lobbies that let you invite specific friends, and if someone drops out their character will be controlled by a bot until they are able to reconnect  an amusing selection of emote stickers can even let your rivals know exactly how you feel about Boo stealing your hard earned stars. Theres also Mt. Minigames, which offers a variety of modes that let you play minigames a la carte. In the limited amount of testing I was able to do before launch, lag certainly played a noticeable factor in one of my sessions, especially in the more reflex intensive games like Hot Rope Jump and Bill Blasters, but online play was generally fun and serviceable overall. Mario Party Superstars is more than just a collection of excellent boards and minigames from the series past: Its a complete return to form for the Mario Party series. Theres a really great mix of classic and more modern minigames, the overall quality of which is top-notch, even if some of them are a bit redundant. It really could have used one more board, and the balance of the 1v3 minigames isnt the greatest, but with solid online play acting as the icing on the proverbial Peachs Birthday Cake, its easy to say that this is the best Mario Party has been in at least a decade.", "date": "Oct. 28, 2021,"}
