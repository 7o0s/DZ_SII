At a glance you can see it's beautiful. This ~dieselpunk~ shoot 'em up provides some of the most fascinating vistas and set pieces I've seen. It also boasts a trick that sets it apart from other arcade shooters: Instead of lives or a health bar, you have seconds on the clock. Shooting down enemies earns you more time while taking fire slices time away from you. As long as the clock is still ticking, you're still playing. Sine Mora packs many 2D shooter conventions like power-ups, bombs, and amazing bosses. The interesting time mechanic, though, makes Sine Mora its own game and redirects the player's attention from just bullet dodging. As the clock loses its last few seconds and you feverishly try to shoot down something -- anything -- Sine Mora achieves a new level of tension. There are other welcome changes of pace, too, like a short stealth section where you must hide in a pile of trash in order to sneak by the enemy's defenses. You possess a limited ability to manipulate time in your favor, be it slowing the action while you maneuver through a spray of bullets, or rewinding after being destroyed, Prince of Persia-style. But the effect truly is restricted, and you have to earn every brief second of time manipulation, so don't worry about it making the game too easy. In fact, don't worry about that in general. Sine Mora is hard as balls. You can probably get through the Story Mode on normal difficulty without too much trouble, but when you switch over to the more advanced Arcade Mode for leaderboard glory you'll realize you're actually no good at it at all. It's a game I'm compelled to keep working at to improve my performance, though. Rounding out the available modes are Score Attack and Boss Training, the latter of which should prove quite useful to serious players. Sine Mora tells a much more complex story than most arcade shooters. A group of animal pilots is trying to stop some sort of genocide, but I found the out-of-order tale rather hard to follow. This band of furry men and women is considerably more hardcore than the Starfox crew -- one of my favorite quotes is ~F***ing g**d*****, f***!~ It gets a little too talky talky for me, but Arcade Mode drops all that exposition so you can focus on pure gameplay. Achievements are tied to reaching new ranks as a pilot and you can watch your rank rise and fall as you play, making for very engaging Achievement hunting and leaderboard competition. This is how closely Sine Mora's graphics match the original concept art. You only ever control your ship on a 2D plane, but Sine Mora never misses an opportunity to spin the camera around and present a new angle on the war. As grand as some of these spectacles are, it's the little details that often impress the most -- you can see each individual shell drop from your ship as you fire, for instance. Bosses impress, from a several-screens-high humanoid robot to an enormous mechanical squid (think the Sentinels from The Matrix). Each enjoys a grand introduction as the game slows to a drag and its title is imprinted on the screen with a thud. This game has style. CLOSING COMMENTS It's time for a new 2D shooter. Everything fans expect is here in Sine Mora (giant bosses, flashy explosions, serious challenge), but the entertaining time mechanic should prove a welcome surprise. It tweaks the recipe just enough to create an uncommon shooter. The visuals set a new standard for the genre, providing sights heretofore unseen in an arcade shoot 'em up. With a relatively manageable Story Mode and a ridiculously difficult Arcade Mode, pilots of all skill levels should check out Sine Mora.
