Its as if Madden, a franchise thats taken itself so seriously in the past, has loosened up a bit. It features a defensive player  Super Bowl Champion Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks  on the cover for the first time since Troy Polamalu in Madden 10, and the start screen is filled with his teammates in various states of flexing, bringing a lighthearted attitude along with them. It might seem like a small thing, but it sets a new tone, one thats drastically different than any other Madden game of the past. Defense wasn't a major focus before, but that cant really be the case anymore when you have arguably the most polarizing (defensive or otherwise) player of last year on the cover. Madden fans rejoice, theres finally been some changes made to the underlying defensive systems here. In previous years, being on defense would have you playing from the same camera viewpoint as you do when on offense. This year, the new defensive camera shifts the viewpoint almost 45 degrees, facing the opposing QB as if to single out your one primary focus. The sprint button flashes when the play is set in motion, prompting you to sprint at the QB while mashing a face button to try and break through the offensive line. It works really well and actually pushes the offensive game to be better when given shorter time constraints due to a more aggressive pass rush. Switching your targeted player mid-play is another important improvement. Previously, defensive players would tend to stick to offensive players in the same slot and, while you could break free and roam the field, it never really had a good system for choosing a new player to cover. Now, the right analog stick can be used to attach to a different offensive player, creating a more directed tackle. This results in more dynamic and realistic plays that doesnt come off as a video game interpretation of how real football is supposed to work, something the series previously struggled with. With these new systems, its easier to apply an effective pass rush, make dynamic defensive decisions post-snap, and end plays in a more realistic-looking fashion. These might sound like small changes, but they totally re-define how defense works in a series that has traditionally put priority on the offensive side of the sport. Play Call is the newest attempt at creating an efficient and non-convoluted play calling system that doesn't just give you a few options and remove all skill in choosing a play. Maddens play calling system has gone through many iterations over the last few years, with none seeming to stick around or be well received by long-time fans. With Play Call, they've finally found the sweet spot between new and pro styles of play calling. Using community-facilitated feedback, Madden suggests plays based on a variety of factors, but also allows you to modify the suggestions based on your intuition and even pop out to the traditional play calling menu if thats more your thing. Say its -and-7, Madden might suggest you run a HB Draw based on the success youve had with the play, the play the defense has been calling in similar situations, and the average yards gained by other players using the same play/team combination. The new system is situational and extremely in-depth, which makes for good awareness and play variations. It works really well, and once fans get a chance to see how dynamic it truly is, I think it will stick around for a while. Its a prime instance of community-sourced systems done right. Dont take this to be entirely positive though, Ive still encountered some longstanding issues that have yet to be addressed despite their occurrence year after year. The physics hiccups that have been present in the last two releases are still alive and well, leading to some ridiculous tackles and after-play madness. Thankfully, their impact on the gameplay has been reduced significantly and only seem to come into play during rare in-air tackles or moments where players get bunched together. In addition, the presentation and commentary still isnt great. Youll still hear the same commentary tracks again and again, especially if you stick with a team throughout most of your playtime. Halftime highlights were added that are designed to add to the overall presentation, but the game often loses track of whats happening, which causes it to stop producing commentary and leave nothing but an awkward silence, at which point you might as well skip it. The fact that Im already starting on my second season (as the now two-time world champion Seattle Seahawks) in career franchise mode should be an indication that this years Madden is one you dont want to miss, pending any surprising revelations with Ultimate Team and local play. In the meantime, youll have to excuse me. Its time to get back to my Super Bowl legacy. Pros Defense mattersGreat graphicsImproved play calling Cons Physics bugsMediocre commentary After the letdown of Madden 25 last year, Madden 15 feels like a mostly fresh start for the series. The increased emphasis on defensive play, a great new play-calling system, and the return of long-time favorites makes this years Madden one of the best in recent memory, even if it could still use work in regards to its stale commentary and longstanding bugs. As a lifelong Madden and football fan, Im impressed. This years game is both exciting and reassuring that EA Sports isnt wasting opportunities to improve the series.", "date": "Aug. 21, 2014,"}
