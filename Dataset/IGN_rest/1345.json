From combing through emails, watching tons of YouTube clips, doodling on Facebook  okay fine, I dont do a lot of productive things on my iPad after all. But I dont tend to play a lot of games on my iPad in all honesty  Id rather leave that to my consoles or PC. However this week I made an exception, when I was asked to give a game called Tapforss a spin on my iPad. What initially began as quick ten minutes of gameplay stretched out to an hour and a half of me desperately trying to beat each level. Tapforss has a very simple concept behind it  you control a floating pink sphere that rests in a nest, and the objective is to guide the sphere to a nest at the end of the level. While that sounds almost trivial, its in fact harder than it sounds. The levels are filled with sharp spikes and other hazards that can harm or instantly destroy your sphere. While you do have three lives in each level, you need to finish each level with at least one life left, a feat that seems almost impossible in later levels. Controls are bound to three on-screen buttons  tap one button to float your sphere upwards, and tap the other two to go left or right. While the first ten levels or so let you get used to the concept and controls, the difficulty quickly ramps up with the introduction of various switches that affect your gameplay. Some switches reverse gravity, other flip your controls, some can teleport you, while others fade your screen to black for a few perilous seconds. There are plenty of more complicated obstacles in later levels, including a wall that can only be deactivated by repeating a particular tone (anyone remember Simon Says?). The free version of the game has the first ten levels to play, and you can then pay $0.99 to unlock the next forty levels, which is really where some of the more challenging levels lie. While the game only comes with one planet to start with, more content should be released in the future. Your score in Tapforss is affected by a number of things, such as how many lives you have at the end, how many times youve tapped, as well as how long youve taken to finish a level. You then get a level rating out of three stars, which you can then post to Twitter to brag your score to the world. What makes Tapforss such a joy to play has to be in the games visuals and audio. The beautiful artwork changes with each level, and the background score is soothing without getting in the way of your gameplay. Given that the game also integrates with Game Center, theres plenty of reasons to keep on replaying the level to get the highest scores among your friends. THE VERDICT Tapforss is a great little gem that will surprise you with its simplicity and truly addictive nature. Its been a while since Ive played a game so religiously, and nearly everyone that I gave the game to wasnt able to stop playing until at least fifteen levels. If youre looking for a truly challenging puzzle game that comes with some seriously addictive gameplay, then give Tapforss a try today.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2013,"}
