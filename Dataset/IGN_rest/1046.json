If I wasnt playing it, I was thinking about it. If I wasnt thinking about it, I was humming one of its 221 songs (or so Ive been told). Its an extremely enjoyable hybrid of role-playing and rhythm-based action, and although the plot is paper-thin and some of the features a bit superfluous, I never stopped smiling while watching cute little sprites battle adorable monsters to the beat of my favorite Final Fantasy songs. Like its predecessor, Curtain Call is a celebration of over two decades worth of Final Fantasy music. As a huge fan of composers like Nobuo Uematsu, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Masashi Hamauzu, it was a joy to hear tunes like Rebel Army (Final Fantasy II) and Unavoidable Battle (Final Fantasy: Tactics) alongside more contemporary pieces like Defiers of Fate (Final Fantasy XIII). Curtain Call also includes songs not previously released for the original Theathrythm (though some were later released as DLC). My favorite additions include tracks from Final Fantasy titles such as Type-0, Tactics, and Final Fantasy XIV, but there are also new songs from titles like Mystic Quest and Lightning Returns. I have to applaud developer Indies Zero for their ambition. With so many songs piled into one compilation, I assumed there would be some type of noticeable audio compression or a drop in sound quality. Yet from what I can tell, every single song in Curtain Call has maintained its integrity. Richly orchestrated pieces like Final Fantasy XIVs On Westerly Winds sound just as good as simpler tunes like FFVIIs Gold Saucer. If my favorite thing about Curtain Call is the music, than my next favorite thing is the different ways in which I got to experience the music. It was fun tapping and sliding my stylus around the screen as cute little Final Fantasy sprites fought enemies in Battle Music Stage, connected song waves in Field Music Stage, and chased patterns of light while a music video played during Event Music Stage. The gameplay isnt all that different from the original Theatrhythm, but new songs and visuals kept things fresh and interesting. I also enjoyed the Quest Medley Mode, which let my merry band of spiky-haired heroes traverse a colorful map filled with different types of music stages and difficulty levels. It was fun being able to sample all these different types of gameplay in one mode, and I liked earning treasure and experience points by challenging a boss at the end of each quest. The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of a some type of little story to go with these missions, since without extra story content to set it apart the plot isnt all that different from its predecessors: a group of warriors must gather Rhythmia (experience points) in order to banish a being named Chaos and return light to the world. Still, I enjoyed going on these randomly generated quests. I never knew what type of music stages awaited me, and it was fun testing my skills against tough enemies or completing a stage by navigating an airship. If Im happy with Quest Medley Mode, Im somewhat indifferent to Versus Mode. I admit its fun going head-to-head with a friend to see who could score the most points in the same song, and I like the idea of racing to see who will be the first to unleash special attacks (known as EX Bursts) onto their opponent. It just felt a little repetitive after awhile, and some of the EX Burst skills (like one where notes randomly speed up and slow down) were slightly annoying. Another (very) small complaint I have is that Curtain Call never takes full advantage of its RPG roots. Dont get me wrong: I spent more than my fair share of time putting my favorite Final Fantasy characters together in different kinds of parties, equipping them with abilities like Omnislash and Firaga, and combining collectible cards in the new CollectaCard Crystarium to power up their stats. The breadth and depth of all this customization is impressive, but it never really seemed to make a difference in terms of gameplay. So long as I had a good sense of rhythm and fast reflexes, I never needed to worry about seeing the Game Over screen. In fact, the only time my party ever got wiped out was when I played on Ultimate Mode, the hardest difficulty setting. Trying to master songs like Final Fantasy IVs Battle With the Four Fiends was a serious test of my eye-hand coordination, and I was thrilled when I finally managed to get through it.  Pros Fantastic musicQuest Medley modeLots of customization Cons Paper-thin plotSuperfluous RPG stats I had a blast playing Final Fantasy: Curtain Call. Its easy to pick up and play, and the controls are smooth and responsive. (Though every once in awhile they seemed slightly finicky during field music stages.) Being able to play something that celebrates over two decades of excellent music brought me lots of joy, and serves as a reminder that Final Fantasy has some of the best music in video game history.", "date": "Sept. 15, 2014"}
