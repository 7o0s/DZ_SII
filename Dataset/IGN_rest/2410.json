Sure, new features come along like wireless functionality, noise-cancelling, or even RGB lighting to spice things up, but those have all been around for some time. So when something actually new comes along, its a reason to be excited, especially when the ~new~ is a bit off the beaten path. That's the case with the HP OMEN Mindframe headset, which is the first headset to employ active cooling technology. Yes, youre still reading about a headset and not a computer. So is it just a gimmick or is there a real benefit? I decided to find out. HP OMEN Mindframe  Design and Features Ill get right to it. The OMEN Mindframe headset features what HP has dubbed FrostCap technology. Inside each ear cup is a thermoelectric device that transfers heat from inside the ear cup to the outside, which cools the metal speaker grilles inside the cup. Its a solid-state design, so there are no moving parts and therefore no extra noise from something like a fan. It also means theres no moving air blowing on your ears distracting you from gaming. The transfer of heat does cause the plastic exterior to heat up a bit, but not to the extent that you need to worry about touching the headset while the cooling is working. Additionally, to help with any sweat around the ears from long gaming sessions, the ear cups are made from a cushy moisture-wicking fabric. The headset follows the trend of gaming-centric peripherals sporting a color scheme that's black with red accents. The wire that runs across the headband from one ear cup to the other is red as is the interior of the USB connector (I thought that was a nice touch). The outside of the ear cups have diamond-shaped RGB lighting around the OMEN emblem, and the end of the mic boom glows  you guessed it  red when its in the stowed position to show the mic is muted. The RGB lighting can be controlled by the OMEN Command Center software. The headband is a self-adjusting suspension type that does a good job of holding the headset in place without too much clamping force that can lead to headaches. As I find with almost all suspension headbands, there is the need for occasional adjustment as they tend to slip over time. Controls on the headset itself are minimal. The back of the right ear cup has a wheel to control volume. My samples wheel moved smoothly except for one sticky point. The boom mic is attached to the left side and easily swings down when you want to use it. Virtual 7.1 surround sound is enabled through Windows 10 Sonic feature, so it can be easily turned on or off according to your preference. HP Omen Mindframe  Software To get full functionality out of the OMEN Mindframe youll need to install HPs Omen Command Center software that is available through the Microsoft Store. It is only available for PC. Controls are simple. There are two tabs  one for lighting and one for cooling. The ear cups lighting can be static, or cycle through up to six colors (out of 18 choices) that you can assign, or it can react to music. The color shifting doesnt blend from one color to the next, instead its an immediate change. These lighting changes unfortunately do not affect the mic indicator color, which will always be red when the mic is muted. Cooling can be turned on or off and has three levels of cooling. The Mindframe software was straightforward, but that is mainly because there isn't much to do with it. The limited lighting options and cooling adjustment could have easily fit on one menu pane - instead of split into ~Lighting~ and ~Cooling.~ HP OMEN Mindframe  Gaming and Testing The feel of the cooling isinteresting. It definitely works, and does so pretty well. The cooling doesnt add any noise or emit any sound, so it never interrupts the audio. The sensation just takes some getting used to. If youre someone whose ears get overheated easily while wearing headphones they're great, but there are a couple things to keep in mind. If your ears stick out a little theres the potential of your helix or lobe touching the cooled metal plate. And if those ears have a metal piercing that touches it, the cooling will be conducted directly to your ear. Its not painful, but it gets uncomfortable and is very distracting. The sound of the OMEN Mindframe is biased towards the low end. The lows are a bit heavy, but dont overpower the mid or upper frequencies in music. Theres a bit of a low-end peak and then quick rolloff that makes bass lines  like the one in Love Lockdown  a little uneven. The mid frequencies are a bit forward sounding  a bit in your face  but arent too fatiguing except at higher volumes. The treble has a good snap and clarity with a slight amount of sibilance, or shushiness. That bass peak does add some nice oomph to explosions and rumbles in Battlefield 1 as tanks drive by and mortars crash. With the 7.1 virtual surround, its an incredibly enveloping experience. Placement of incoming gunfire is very accurate and helpful for quickly identifying whoever is trying to take you down. The low end boost and forward mids give a menacing aggressiveness to Darth Mauls lightsaber in Battlefront II  as if he needs to be more menacing. While using chat, those forward mids help to give clarity to your team's chatter. With the 7.1 virtual surround, it's an incredibly enveloping experience. The mic is pretty good. Youll sound a little thin to your party, especially if you have a naturally lower voice, but theres a brightness and edginess that cuts through game sounds well. Even with noise-cancelling enabled, the mic it tends to pick up some stray room noise. It doesnt detract much from your intelligibility, but its definitely present and more than other headsets. The OMEN are on the heavier side at 444g, and for context something like the SteelSeries Arctis 7 is 376g. However, I didnt find them to ever be uncomfortable. They sat well on my head and the suspension headband dispersed the weight evenly, even though it needed the occasional adjustment. The OMEN by HP Mindframe headset is great for gaming. The real allure though is the active cooling, and for someone that needs it, the technology works well. At $200, the cooling is what youre paying for as other customizable options are a bit lean and theyre only fully functional with a PC. While theyre a great set overall, if you don't need the extra cooling there are other similarly priced models that sound as good and are more versatile.", "date": "Oct. 30, 2018,"}
