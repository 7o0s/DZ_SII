This is probably the most difficult game of 2016 so far, and that may serve as a draw to some. But I found that these demanding, twitch-based torture chambers rely too much on pure precision and got in the way of enjoying the less frustrating parts. Taking control of a quip-hurling salvager named Roughshod who sounds like he grew up in Space Brooklyn, I was led by a meandering, ADD-paced story to escape the bowels of a massive starship full of hostile robots and insta-kill traps. Those traps are often placed in just the right spot to destroy you after narrowly avoiding another, which often leads to the feeling of being punished for doing what the previous obstacle suggested. That leads to a lot of death by trial and error and replaying the same areas, and that repetition is really what built up my resentment toward Rive. Dont misunderstand - I dont think its a bad game, or that being difficult is a bad thing. But I now think of it the same way as the memory of a childhood bully. Some of the platforming segments feel like outright trolling, requiring an absurd string of precise, split-second jumps that left me wanting to dismantle my controller. The difficulty all comes from tests of reflexes and timing. Rive makes it very clear what you need to do to progress, removing any need to think your way to a better solution. But it will kick you in the teeth and make you try again, over and over, until you do it exactly perfect. The margin for error in some rooms is nearly nonexistent. Completing an especially remorseless section mainly made me feel glad to be done with it rather than a great sense of accomplishment. Rive is at its best when it changes up its platforming formula. Rive is at its best when it changes up its platforming formula and introduces levels with special restrictions or new mechanics. I had a lot of fun with a stage that basically turns into a scrolling space shooter in the style of Tyrian and its relatives. Another disabled my gun completely and forced me to rely on Roughshods ability to hack certain enemy bots to make them do my work for me. I wanted more of those clever puzzles, but theyre unfortunately just short breaks from Rives six hours of strenuous platforming. Because I already know some of you will be thinking it, let me address what Rive lacks that are present in other good because its hard games Ive enjoyed a bit more. Notably, there isnt any real sense of progression for Roughshod. The rapid-fire machine gun you start with is the same one youll jam into the exhaust ports of the final boss. It never gets any power ups or alternate fire modes. The only upgrades Roughshod can make to his space tank are extra armor (which feels totally meaningless given the general deadliness of every single trap and enemy in the environment) and a magnet that helps you pick up extra loot which is only used to get more upgrades. There are some unlockable special attacks but theyre very limited in use, requiring you to pick up an ammo crate that has a random drop chance for a one-time use. They also dont get stronger as Rives campaign goes on, and in relation to one another, they are definitely side-grades rather than a progression of increasing potency. The last ~new~ enemy is introduced less than halfway through. The enemy variety also stagnates far too early. The last new enemy is introduced less than halfway through, so other than a smattering of bosses you wont be running into anything novel to fill with lead for a good majority of the campaign. Its missing all of the crazy power-ups of a Binding of Isaac, or the bite-sized levels that balm the frustration of a Super Meat Boy - the checkpoints are usually pretty forgiving, but not always. And its missing the scope and wicked, engrossing personality of either of those games. Other than an unlockable time trial mode Rive is also wanting for replayability in a big way in comparison to its more prestigious peers. Where it does compete is in areas like the level art and enemy designs, which have a charmingly grungy comic-book-like style that at least gave me something cool to look at when I was attempting the same room for the eight thousandth time. And the script attempts to soften the savage beatings with humor, but its eye-roll-inducing meme references usually fail to land. The few genuine chuckles Rive got out of me were mostly toward the end when it started making fun of its own previous attempts at comedy. The effort that went into creating Rive is apparent, from the art to the music to the precise controls, but it manages to be extremely punishing without enough sense of reward and the depth of options in combat are substandard. The story is an afterthought and the characters seeming self-awareness of that doesnt connect with enough of a comedic punch to save it. Its a side-scrolling shooter with stock parts that I dont foresee leaving a mark on the genre, but is at least worth a spin if youve got the patience for it and a thirst for a major challenge.", "date": "Sept. 15, 2016"}
