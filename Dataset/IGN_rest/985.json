It wasn't something I was supposed to do, of course, and generally frowned upon as cheating. Screencheat turns that cheat into a necessary survival tactic. Simple, colorful, and fun in short bursts, Screencheat is a multiplayer-only first-person shooter that's all about small arenas, bizarre weapons, and everyone being invisible all the time. And because everyone's invisible, you need to constantly monitor your opponents' screens to find them, turning what would otherwise be a quirky but unremarkable shooter into something absorbingly tense. Regardless of whether you're playing online or with friends in the same room, Screencheat splits the screen into two, three, or four fields of view, and then sets you loose to try and find each other. That's easier than it sounds, because Screencheat's five arenas are all split into color-coded areas, with lots of unique features (including shortcuts and jump pads) that make them a blast to explore, while also making it easy to tell at a glance where your opponents are. It's relatively unchallenging fun with two players, but can quickly turn mind-boggling with three or four. It's tempting to let your attention settle on one enemy, but that's dangerous, as it might let the other two run past you undetected  or worse, get the drop on you and send your randomized, suddenly visible avatar ragdolling to the ground. It's all in fun, though; a feeling reinforced by Screencheat's silly kill messages (in an average match, you can expect to be ~unfollowed,~ ~enveloped,~ and ~Obama'd~) and its bizarre eight-weapon arsenal. Ranging from a shotgun-like blunderbuss to a plasma cannon to a charging hobby horse to an aimlessly hopping teddy-bear bomb, each implement of death has a different degree of usefulness that might not be clear at first. The crossbow, for example, initially felt like a slow-to-reload beast that demanded pinpoint precision  until I realized it was shooting out a tether that, for a few seconds, let me clothesline any opponents it touched. And while the candelabra only works at close range, it swings in wide arcs, making it easy to clock anyone who wanders into striking distance. Be warned, though  while you may be invisible, your weapon's visual effects aren't, which means that giant fireball you're charging up will paint a big target on you for other players. Discoverable strategies notwithstanding, Screencheat keeps its action light and its pace fast. Its bite-sized matches rarely last longer than a few minutes (if that), and its best modes are simple, familiar classics: deathmatch, king of the hill (or ~Hillcampers~), and Capture the Fun, which replaces the usual flag with a confetti-spraying (and therefore visible) piata. Meanwhile, One Shot  which prevents reloading until either everyone has fired, or a constantly looping 15-second timer has counted down  is interesting but not all that enjoyable, and Murder Mystery (which assigns each player a target that must be killed with a specific weapon) sounds great on paper, but quickly turns tedious in practice. Actually, that's true of any of the modes, given enough time. Screencheat is best played in short sessions; having to keep track of multiple screens gets exhausting after a while, and once you know what you're doing, you can experience everything Screencheat has to offer in around 20 minutes. However, if you can get a few friends together in front of your PC (and your PC in front of a couch), it's much more rewarding. This is the sort of game that's best enjoyed with trash talk, temporary alliances, and elbowed controllers, which have the added benefit of making Screencheat's occasional but annoying bugs, and overall unpolished feel, less noticeable. Pros Striking map designSilly weaponsFun with friends Cons Minimal contentUnpolished and buggy Relatively simplistic compared to the N64-era shooters that inspired it, Screencheat nevertheless distinguishes itself with goofy charm, fast pacing, and a clever gameplay hook based on invisibility. Its sterile online matches tend to wear out their welcome quickly, but if you can get two to four players together in a room, hunting your friends through their own eyes is uniquely fun for at least a short while.", "date": "Oct. 27, 2014,"}
