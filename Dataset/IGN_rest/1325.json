LocoCycle embraces that idea with a rare abandon. In a vacuum, the fact that youre controlling a sentient motorcycle with an unwilling human passenger inexplicably and irreversibly stuck to the tailpipe might seem impossibly strange, but mere minutes into the accompanying short film, it becomes clear that we left Kansas back at the start menu. Its Short Circuit-esque plot is often funny, and its mix of different gameplay types can be entertaining in spots, but both suffer from a pervasive lack of consistency and cohesion that ultimately derails what could have been a delightfully crazy train. At the surface level, LocoCycle mixes equal parts arcadey driving, shooting, and brawling, but each of its 17 levels contextualizes these actions in a slew of different ways. You might be racing to bust through a nearby roadblock, or tossing your along-for-the-ride mechanic Pablo out to intercept a wing of rocket-sled-riding bombers. Youre never stuck doing the same thing for long, and as you progress through the three to four hour-long story mode, youll be regularly treated to new locations and scenery. But while the variety of gameplay types is nice, not every encounter is created equal, and when they do start repeating, its with too little variance. Any given set piece will be nearly identical in the later levels as when it was initially introduced. This would be less of an issue if so many of them didnt become rote after completing them the first time, but when certain sequences boil mostly down to mashing a single button without any regard for timing, things get monotonous quickly. It also doesnt help that both the camera and controls have a way of shifting from battle to battle, and sometimes even moment to moment, changing how IRIS (our motorcycle/protagonist) handles, and arbitrarily locking out or adding combat options without notification. At best, she feels like one of the nimble Generation 2 Transformers bikes that likely inspired her look, but just as often, she feels either too squirrely or too sluggish to get into a groove with. And for every section that worked, like the Thunderblade-style top-down shooting sequence, theres at least one that doesn't, such as the Street Fighter sequence near the story's climax. Whats worse, all these disparate parts are strung together haphazardly without any sense of progressive challenge. Some levels went on for what seemed like forever, only to unceremoniously end with an anti-climactic sequence all too similar to what had come before it. Meanwhile, the wonderfully campy live-action short film that's interwoven throughout quickly establishes a tone of absurdity that frees developer Twisted Pixel up to do just about anything: from explosive midget-tossing to grilled cheese sandwich biker gang celebrations. Theres an unhinged sort of imagination driving things forward at all times, and even when LocoCycle made mistakes (which it does regularly) its spirit of silliness kept a smile on my face. Whether youre playing or watching, LocoCycle aspires to present itself like a movie, and in this regard it mostly succeeds. Though the graphics are underwhelming for what I expected from an Xbox One game, the sound design is uniformly excellent, and slick camera transitions between quick time events and real-time gameplay sell the summer popcorn flick vibe. The 90s were the last time when sentient robotic motorcycles could possibly have been cool, and LocoCycle pays a humorous homage to the era with references to numerous D-list 90s films. Lisa Foiles threads a needle between Johnny 5 and GLaDOS with her performance as IRIS, and Robert Patrick hams it up as Spike, who plays KARR to her KITT. Both of them sound like theyre having a blast  particularly Foiles, whose energetic quips carry the proceedings. Where LocoCycle's Hollywood aspirations get into some trouble is with Pablo, IRIS Spanish-speaking mechanic. While the story manages to contextualize why he doesnt speak English, and why IRIS cant speak Spanish, he still winds up being a one-note character who simply begs for his life from beginning to end. Theres undercurrents of political satire  with shots taken at partisan politics, and U.S. hyper-nationalism - but just when I thought LocoCycle was trying to say something, it'd make a taco reference or a mental health joke and pass the commentary right by. Given Twisted Pixels track record, I want to believe there was a message here, but I couldnt quite shake the feeling that Pablo was there to be laughed at, not with, and that made me more than a little uncomfortable. If nothing else, LocoCycle earns its name. Its got not one, but two sentient motorcycles, and buckets full of loco. I imagine Ill have forgotten what LocoCycle played like long before I forget its unapologetically zany live-action bits, and its questionable treatment of Pablo. Its inconsistent gameplay becomes tedious despite its imaginative variety, and its levels lack cohesion or a sense of momentum. Like the cheesy 90's films it apes, LocoCycle is memorable, but not quite good.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2013,"}
