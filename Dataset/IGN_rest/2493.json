While Far Cry is usually known for open worlds with a lot of gameplay systems that mix and swirl together to create spontaneous insanity, the barren wasteland of Mars doesnt provide opportunity for much of anything interesting to happen. But hey, there are some pretty good Star Wars prequel jokes. While Far Cry 5 tells a story that  at its heart  is pretty serious, were in straight up goofball territory here. A cheap-looking opening cutscene establishes how you, playing as the pilot Nick Rye, and Hurk arrived on Mars to prevent an alien invasion, and how Hurk became the second talking severed head sidekick in a game this year. After that, youre sent about the straightforward work of shooting Starship Troopers-style alien bugs and collecting body parts. The new enemies like to burrow into the ground and attack if you step on loose sand. That means youll be jumping around from rock to rock, Tremors-style, to avoid it. Thankfully, youre equipped with a gravity belt  henceforth referred to as a jetpack because thats what it is in everything but name  that lets you fly for short amounts of time. Jetting around is pretty fun and creates opportunities for aerial gunfights, and thats perhaps the most inventive gameplay mechanic Lost on Mars comes up with. So its a bummer that enemies are constantly taking your best toy away: way too many of them can spit acid that grounds you for a while. When you're on the ground, Lost on Mars is a very basic first-person shooter with few surprises.And when youre on the ground, Lost on Mars is a very basic first-person shooter with few surprises in store. The aliens are your usual grunts, tanks, big boss, and flying archetypes. The liveliest thing about them is a bug where many of them dont want to stay dead  they shiver and shake in the sand, like the engine just cant decide what to do with a dead arachnid. Blasting away at them is the only way to deal with the threat because Lost on Mars completely strips out the stealth gameplay. My favorite thing to do in Far Cry games is sneak into outposts, taking out enemies stealthily one at a time. But while stealth was featured prominently in the previous DLC, Hours of Darkness, it isnt an option here. Stealth executions arent even available when it finds ways to pit you against human enemies, leaving typical shootouts that quickly become tedious. Among the laser versions of the standard pistols, shotguns, and rifles, the only gun that stands out is called the, erm, Nut Hugger. Its a ray gun that fires homing lasers. Locking onto enemies from a distance makes some of the battles against the giant queen arachnids a little less frustrating. So the nearly non-stop color commentary from Hurks disembodied head is the real draw here. Hes one of the funniest video game characters in recent memory, and hes there every step of the way, decidedly unfazed by the whole ordeal of zapping bad guys and collecting body parts across the red dunes of Mars. But of course, you could enjoy all of those jokes by watching a Lets Play, so without respectable gameplay to back him up even Hurk cant save this one. Lost On Mars is a strange choice for a Far Cry 5 expansion, and this risky change of scenery doesnt pay off. While it does feature a hilarious fan-favorite character, I just wish the gameplay was as inventive as the dialogue and gun nomenclature. Its too bad Ubisoft couldnt find a way to make an alien world feel more interesting than the Montana countryside. Even with the addition of a jetpack, lasers, and alien bugs this planet feels dull as red dirt. If you didnt buy the season pass, the trip to Mars hardly seems worth it.", "date": "July 18, 2018,"}
