I had been playing for about an hour but still struggled to care about any character other than Clementine or AJ, any actions I took, or any dialogue choice I was presented with. It all felt hollow and lifeless, a formulaic Mad Libs-esque construction in which story elements were strung together in a repetitive, predictable sequence. If anything can be said for Episode Two, its this: the seams of this series are showing, and theyre beginning to wear thin. As in previous episodes and seasons of The Walking Dead, Clementine and her relationship with AJ continues to be the strongest and most compelling part of the story. After dealing with a particularly traumatic incident at the end of the previous episode, Clementine is left to put the pieces back together and teach AJ more difficult lessons about the subtleties and nuances of life from a time when manners and niceties were socially relevant. The blunt and confused nature of AJs dialog feels very authentic to the way children normally speak in its ability to withhold nothing and bluntly address a topic on their immature minds. He asks Clementine why people bother having funerals, why people should care about remembering the lives of so-called monsters, why its okay to kill in some instances but not in others, and, in one particularly wrenching moment, whether or not theyll even continue to survive. The rest of the supporting cast struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. Clementines reactions are mostly genuine and well-executed. His questions hit a note deeper in her, forcing her to reconsider her beliefs and whether or not theyre still necessary in this deceased world. Its a familiar sensation for anyone who has been asked an unintentionally devastating existential question by a child, and Clementine and AJs interactions and reliance on each other remain a very solid backbone on which this season is built. However, the rest of the supporting cast and storyline struggle to reach any of the highs found between Clementine and AJ. This entire episode made one jarring logical leap after another, relying on the emotions and interactions of characters I barely knew to carry the drama and tension throughout, and that simply didnt work. One particularly egregious moment happened when the other kids grew upset with AJ for an action that seemed to be reasonable and appropriate given the circumstance. Despite monumental evidence to support AJs decision, a handful of characters instead doubled down on their irrational hatred of him, which made them even harder to identify with. Telltale hasn't done the work of establishing motivations. Its in moments like this where the formulaic nature of The Walking Deads storytelling begins to show. It feels templatized; time and time again, one character is inserted as the antagonist, while another stands up for Clem and AJ. Then Clementine has to choose how she reacts and is either rewarded or punished, depending on how that dialogue choice is received. That can work when characters have rational reasons to believe what they do, but here Telltale hasnt done the work of establishing their motivations, so characters instead feel like theyre going through the motions for the sake of continuing the plot. At a pivotal moment, AJ and Clementine are forced to take to the road by themselves. This goes predictably poorly and results in a contrived reunion between Clementine and a familiar face from seasons past, but their behavior here feels wildly out of character. Drama ensues, and AJ and Clem return to the compound as though theyd never left, which makes no sense given the circumstances of their departure earlier in this same episode. Moments like these were especially jarring because they dont line up with the logic the series has established (namely This person will remember that), and they negate all of the decisions and consequences made up to this point. More characters materialized who, prior to these moments, had not been an important focus for the story but suddenly became relevant to serve as plot vehicles in their very specific place within the plots formula. One strong moment in the episode focused on Clementines romance with either a female or male character in the gang of kids. This kind of interaction is a first for the Walking Dead series, and the scene in which it plays out is sweet and well-executed. Its exactly what a story like this needs: a moment of true levity in which characters have an organic interaction not tethered to the typical hopeless tropes and cliches often found within end-of-the-world stories. Gameplay felt especially slow and plodding, with brief moments of very basic action sequences mixed in with pixel-hunting around washed-out environments to collect items. Some of it works, and some of it feels frustratingly laggy and not at all satisfying. Ranged weapons are unsatisfying to use, the precise timing of quick-time events doesnt always feel clear, and even moving around in environments is laborious. It feels old and stale, like many of the mechanics have been placed merely out of obligation to The Walking Deads broader established formula instead of enhancing the overall experience. Looking back, the final season thus far feels the direct opposite of the first. Rather than surprising with clever twists and spending time developing a core set of characters, Episode 2 continues a path of sticking to a tired, formulaic layout in which characters, decisions, and moments are seemingly swapped out to lead to predictable moments and outcomes. Maybe this approach to The Walking Dead has simply become used up and exhausted after four seasons thatve run concurrently with the AMC TV show (and the comic), but Episode 2s lack of meaningful focus and development of any characters other than Clementine and AJ and rehashed situations with nonsensical outcomes are leading this season on a weak shamble toward the series finish.", "date": "Sept. 25, 2018"}
