Theres a momentary glint of intelligent commentary on the detached nature of modern war, a slow downward camera pan through a Guantanamo Bay under siege, and a somewhat indulgent solo drum performance by our hero, Ivan, as were treated to sepia-washed flashbacks of a history that still haunts him. The thing is, its all a ruse. Devils Third isnt thoughtful, subtle, or even entertaining. Its the kind of soulless, perfunctory action game I fear people judging the medium of video games by. That initial glimmer of hope flickered out quickly once I actually took control of Ivan and started doing the only thing he can do: murder fools in a comically graphic fashion with a limited, uninteresting set of abilities. To its credit, Devils Third melds melee and gunplay fairly effectively but neither is varied or even immediately satisfying enough to sustain any level of excitement. Simple doesnt have to be bad, it just is here; the repetitive melee executions come with a loss of control and a jarring camera cut, interrupting the flow of combat constantly, as if Devils Third doesnt want to be played. I dont have any problem with bald hyper-violence either, as long as its conveyed in a visually interesting way, or is used as a pay-off for good play, like in Mad World or Gears of War, but in Devils Third its neither. Its hard to imagine how Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki was involved in combat so simplistic and void of tactile joy. Melee hits have their impact blunted by tinny, cheap sound effects, and gunfire feels similarly limp. Even perennial favorites like flamethrowers, miniguns, and under-barrel grenade launchers fail to elicit a grin. A lot of this could be made up for if there were interesting decisions to make in combat, or if it was mechanically demanding in some interesting way, but neither is the case. Despite silly, inconsistent damage spikes (Ivan can shrug off RPG shells, but dies near-instantly to random swarms of bats), I found it easy to strong-arm my way through the campaign in a few hours by leaning heavily on one particular attack string with the katana. Only a couple of bullet-spongey enemies made me work, and the bosses were really just exercises in monotony  I beat most of them by spamming dodge and chipping away at them a couple of quick swipes at a time. By the time the final boss fell, the only emotion I could muster was relief that there wasnt any more to trudge through. There is a multiplayer component to Devils Third, which seems odd because the combat is nearly deep or gratifying enough for me to want to play it with other people in a competitive setting. Youll purchase equipment, choose a loadout for your character and engage in mostly pedestrian game modes, save a couple of oddball ones that dont really fit the games established tone. The real insult to injury moment comes when you realize the multiplayer is riddled with micro-transactions, giving your competition a chance to buy the best equipment while you grind tirelessly for it. Pros Mixes melee and gunplay Cons Random damage spikesSimple, repetitive combatDull presentationPay-to-win multiplayer Devils Third is an exercise in cynicism, a video game seemingly created for people who secretly hate them. Theres barely even a seed of a good idea here, let alone a fully formed one. There isnt a single part of Devils Third that does not feel as though it were ripped straight from a decade-old playbook, and its nihilistic reliance on simplistic violence reinforces that fact with every severed limb.", "date": "Aug. 29, 2015,"}
