For more, check out our review of last week's episode. After killing his Nazi dad and losing his best buddy Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), Chris Smith (John Cena) finds himself out of sorts at the beginning of the Peacemaker Season 1 finale. But, as has been the case for the majority of the season, Smiths discomfort makes for another great episode of television. While the bonds of Project Butterfly are pulled pretty tight after Adebayo followed her moms  Amanda Waller  orders and framed Peacemaker, the world doesnt have time for their bickering (and neither does the audience). Writer/director James Gunn is pretty experienced with miscreant teams who start off hating each other, so its not too surprising that the Season 1 finale has just the right amount of sniping (and fart noises) to drive home that the betrayal was unacceptable but we have more important things to handle.Perhaps more important than his experience with misfits is that Gunn knows how to inject just enough heart into the peculiar and wildly entertaining stories hes known for telling. That heart is on full display in moments like Economos (Steve Agee) begrudging admittance that he dyes his beard and why, and Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) taking mercy on Peacemaker when she sees him talking to himself in the forest. These awkward weirdos have grown to love each other, and these brief but integral illustrations make sure we, as the audience, love and root for them too. As far as action goes, theres not too much of it! There are some explosions, and we see a couple members of Project Butterfly get rocked by some bullet wounds, but theres no real knock-down drag-outs as the team works to take down the Butterflies cow to ensure the safety of Earth. This is mostly successful because our protagonists simply dont have the manpower to take on an army of superpowered aliens, and because the righteous violence Peacemaker is known for isnt the future that Gunn has in mind as the character continues to grow.Instead, we focus on introspection. (But not in a boring way!) Breaking crappy familial patterns is hard, and it cant be any easier when your dads a full-on Nazi. The finale of Peacemaker shows its title character taking the first of what will be many steps of healing his trauma and shedding the neo-fascist ideals hes been indoctrinated into his entire life. The finales emotional climax is when Peacemaker is met with the final choice. The Butterfly masquerading as Sophie Song (Annie Chang) reveals that their motives were never nefarious. The Butterflies saw humanity destroying their planet in the same way the aliens had destroyed theirs. Their intent was never to invade, but to save humans from themselves and keep Earth alive so everyone could prosper. The antagonists speech helps Peacemaker realize what the rest of the team has been trying to help him understand all along: impact matters more than intent, and an invasion is still an invasion even when youre doing it for all the right reasons. The finale growth isn't limited to the show's title character.The strongest aspect of Peacemaker has been its illustration of actual, meaningful growth wrapped in a fun to watch and easy to ingest package. The toxicity of hyper-masculine bro culture is endlessly lambasted while also sitting hilariously on a pedestal. The immediate announcement of Season 2 tells us that theres a deep understanding of what that growth means (and, yes, that WarnerMedia likes money): the progress thats nestled underneath a hefty layer of fart-noises and chauvinistic quips isnt finished yet. Growth is neither immediate nor linear, and Chris Smith is going to continue to fart-noise his way through his relationships whenever they make him uncomfortable. But hell continue to learn a thing or two along the way so long as he has a little help from his friends.Speaking of said friends, the finale growth isnt limited to the shows title character. Adebayo stands up to her mother, Economos opens himself up to friends and allows himself to care about more than just his work, Harcourts cranky heart grows three sizes, and Vigilante well, Vigilantes still a sociopath, but hes our sociopath!In a world full of franchise stories, its become less and less common that a narrative stands on its own two feet. But the Peacemaker Season 1 finale wraps up the story of this first chapter in such a perfect bow that if the series had ended today, fans would have gotten all the closure they needed. Its honestly pretty difficult to find a flaw in this delightfully weird little season of television. Performances are incredible across the board, the storys engagingOh yeah, I guess we have to talk about the Justice League cameo, huh? The party pooper has logged on: the cameo is fine. The silly, running gag of Peacemakers made up stories of actual superheroes comes to a close as Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash (actually Ezra Miller), and Aquaman (actually Jason Momoa) arrive after the mission is already complete. Is it a funny, punchy little moment? Sure. Did it elevate the story or have any emotional impact beyond dang, Gunn wasnt messing around? Not really. No ones docking any points for it, but something more connected to Peacemakers story would have packed a much harder punch. Bring me Weasel! Peacemaker successfully brings its first season to a close with an emotional, heartfelt, and hilarious finale. Theres less action than some may prefer, and the major cameo was more spectacle than substance, but this first chapter of our ride with Chris Smith was given a delightfully meaningful ending that leaves us hyped for the already announced Season 2.", "date": "Feb. 18, 2022,"}
