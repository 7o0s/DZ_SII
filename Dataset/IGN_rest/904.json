Its a short endless runner that only begins to pick up speed by the time it ends, has a very confusing story, mostly dull level design and, strangest of all, boring music. A few short text blurbs set up the vague plot: Zeus, who in this reality is a big fan of funk but not so much other music, assigns his son Perseus to fight and take down the titans of pop, rap, and rock. Its not clear why their music is bad  at one point a character admits that pop music is really catchy  or why these other genres cant peacefully coexist. But okay, lets kill them. Thats a silly, absurdist premise that mightve worked if properly developed... but Funk of Titans doesnt even seem to try. Aside from a few stone hands making rock on signs in the Rock world, the three worlds environments dont represent the genres theyre supposedly inhabited by at all. Instead, theres a stereotypical ancient Greece setting for pop, a bland frozen wasteland for rap, and a rocky underworld (but not that kind of rock) for rock. Inexplicably, the worlds dont even have background pop, rap, or rock music until you reach the boss. At least the cartoonish art style is pleasing, but only while youre zoomed out  cutscenes and close-up interactions with characters reveal ugly models with bizarrely misshapen limbs. All of that is, of course, the icing on the mostly boring cake that is Funk of Titans gameplay. Most of the first 26 of its 39 platformer levels are too easy to be a challenge for even young gamers. This is a simplistic endless runner  its just A to jump and X to attack anything in the way. Thats fine if theres an interesting series of obstacles to avoid, but there are shockingly few, and only three enemy types. Platforming through these levels virtually uncontested isnt fun or satisfying. Only the final worlds 13 levels feature many new obstacles and objects, such as levers, cannons, and elevators. Where was all this stuff for the first two snooze-worthy worlds? Pros Cool cosmetics Cons Inconsistent graphicsPoor level designSenseless storyMismatched music For almost the entirety of the two and half hours it took me to complete Funk of Titans, I was bored. The world design is awkward, and for a game about music, it lacked a variety of catchy tunes or even appropriate themes. I chuckled a bit at the silly hats and weapons, and some of the final levels showed a spark of life, but Funk of Titans is ultimately an unsatisfying experience.", "date": "Jan. 13, 2015,"}
