It turns out thats not true: this entertaining 20-hour adventure successfully combines many of Fire Emblems unique strategy elements with some good old-fashioned button mashing. Fire Emblem Warriors takes place in the Fire Emblem universe, but which one isnt entirely clear. Thats because the story  which manages to be both bare-bones and bonkers  never bothers with details. Theres some gibberish about a pair of twins having to seal away an evil dragon, and something about gathering magic stones that heroes like Marth and Chrom just happen to possess after being sucked into another dimension. No, it doesnt make any sense, but I honestly didnt care why the valiant samurai Ryoma or the hilariously loquacious Owain magically appeared out of thin air. I was just happy to have them around to help me crush my opponents, which they do quite well. I felt like the world's greatest field marshal. What sets Fire Emblem Warriors apart from other Warriors-style games is its focus on teamwork instead of a single hero curb-stomping swarms of enemies. Objectives like orchestrating a multi-pronged attack on enemy outposts or having characters simultaneously activate terrain-altering triggers that allow them to pass safely through poisonous fog require a more thoughtful approach than the usual kill everything in sight. Bigger operations also involve an avalanche of submissions, such as stopping enemy reinforcements or defending hapless villagers, so its important to keep an eye on every corner of the map to see whats going on. Unfortunately, the minimap is so crammed with enemy and ally units its hard to pick out an individual target, which makes juggling multiple objectives at once a constant struggle against the interface. But when I did manage to complete all my objectives, I felt like the worlds greatest field marshal. When you dive in to control your heroes directly, theres still plenty of satisfying button mashing (divided into weak, strong, and special Warrior attacks) involved. But thanks to the incorporation of Fire Emblems rock-paper-scissors weapon mechanic and Pair Up system (which allows characters to assist, defend, or team up with each other) it never felt simplistic or boring. I was always kept busy directing units around the battlefield or switching between them to experience their individual weapons and skills, almost all of which feel loyally translated from their respective games. Lowering an enemys defense with the Luna ability or using Fire Emblem Awakenings resident tank, Fredrick, to mow down enemies with his horse felt fantastic. Using consumable materials dropped by enemies to add buffs to weapons or raise character stats was also a fun RPG addition that enhanced the moment-to-moment action. I just wish my heroes were a little more self-reliant. I just wish my heroes were a little more self-reliant. I was proud when they managed to take down an enemy fort or defeat a mini-boss with minimal input from me (because that meant Id made a smart decision in sending them), but then theyd sometimes just stand around shuffling their feet instead of moving on, or even responding when attacked. I dont want the game to play itself, but they could take a little bit of initiative. I cant tell you how many times I hurled insults over a fort wall because I caught Camilla goldbricking or Tiki picking her nose. Playing Generalissimo while listening to rockin renditions of classic Fire Emblem tunes is fun, but that doesnt mean you can just headbutt your way to victory. Combat gets a lot more challenging in the back half of the story, especially if you ratchet up the sliding difficulty gauge to hard (which, notably, features Fire Emblems signature permadeath for added consequences to your actions). Thats when I really appreciated History Mode, a set of optional maps taken straight out of Fire Emblems of yesteryear and stacked with some truly hard-hitting baddies (to say who would spoil the surprise). Its a nice big playground where you can enjoy hack n slash to its fullest with fun time trials, acquire extra Master Seals to unlock a characters full combat abilities, and earn extra gold and experience by battling enemy waves in Arena Mode. And if you still feel like you need to do more grinding or missed the opportunity to unlock extra character buffs by collecting mural pieces from Annas traveling merchant shop (which temporarily appears on the battlefield once youve met certain combat conditions) you can use Free Mode to revisit old campaigns. Its all designed to make grinding less of a chore, and it works. Its also hard to be bored in the face of so much wonderful fan service. Fire Emblem Warriors features well over a dozen characters from Fates and Awakening, as well as the original Fire Emblem. I loved watching Chrom and Robin reunite after forging a strong bond on the battlefield, even if it was just to exchange a few heartfelt words about never giving up in the face of overwhelming odds. Its these heartfelt moments that make the series so enduring, and while their interactions were rarely deep, they were still fun to watch. I was also charmed by the art style, which translates the traditional 2D art of Fire Emblem into 3D beautifully. The world pops with color and the character models look great. The maps are fun to explore thanks to treasure chests and item-filled jars strewn about the battlefield. Theres also a nice option to prioritize visual fidelity or a smoother framerate, although I didnt see any major performance issues in either setting in either handheld or docked mode. I did notice that the Switch struggled during the fun but superfluous split-screen multiplayer mode, but it wasnt anything game breaking. The malleable quality of Fire Emblems weapons-triangle and pairing systems make them a natural fit for the hack n slash genre. Even when I could barely tell what was going on on the crowded battlefield and my troops were a little too codependent, I enjoyed directing the action and jumping in to be part of the carnage. And while Fire Emblem Warriors makes poor use of the Fire Emblem universes story and history, we still get traces of the relationships between the characters that make it memorable.", "date": "Oct. 25, 2017,"}
