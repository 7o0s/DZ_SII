We're kicking off our renewed tech coverage with deep dives into some of 2016's heavyweights. Hit up the comments below to give your feedback. We want it. The Radeon RX 480 ($175 - $250 on Amazon) is a watershed GPU for AMD, as it marks the arrival of the companys all-new and much-anticipated Polaris architecture; its first ever built on a next-gen 14nm 3D FinFET process. This is the platform the company will be using for at least the next two years, and is a massive leap forward in terms of performance-per-watt for AMDs GPUs, with the company claiming its good for a 2.8x increase over the previous generation of cards. The RX 480 GPU is based off a chip AMD calls Polaris 10, and its designed to offer more than enough power to run VR games at an affordable price, lowering the price of admission to the VR funhouse and vying for the title of best bang for the buck GPU in existence. The only thing standing in its way is stiff competition from Nvidias very own 16nm FinFET GPU; the GTX 1060. This leap to Polaris was made possible by AMD going from a 28nm process for its last two rounds of GPUs (7970, Fury X, etc.) all the way down to 14nm, skipping the 20nm process node in the middle for unknown reasons. Nvidia followed the same path from its 28nm Kepler and Maxwell GPUs to its current 16nm Pascal GPUs, so it seems like both companies took a look at 20nm and decided it wasnt worth it. The end result is the most efficient and powerful GPU AMD has ever created, and to demonstrate its effectiveness AMDs launching it directly into the most hotly contested segment of the GPU market; the $200-$240 zone for 1080p gaming. Sure mid-range performance isnt always quite as attention-grabbing as a high-end GPU like the GTX 1080, but AMDs gambit is that people want a VR-ready GPU, but dont want to have to pay $400 for it, as that was the previous cost of admission as the baseline GPUs were the GTX 970 and the Radeon R9 290. When AMD first announced that its VR-ready RX 480 would cost just $199, people were quite shocked. Of course thats the 4GB version, but still, it was an impressive announcement from AMD at the time. The RX 480 is a full-sized card that requires two PCI Express slots, and is offered in both a reference design as well as tricked-out versions from AMDs partners. The card weve tested was the reference design, which was launched by AMD in two versions; one with 8GB of GDDR5 RAM at $239, and one with 4GB of RAM for $199. This review will focus on the 8GB version, which is naturally the one AMD made available for reviews at launch. The Specs The RX 480 is a 150w GPU, which is a bit lower than the previous generation cards since the R9 380 had a TDP of 190w and the Tahiti-based R9 280X was at 250w, but 30w higher than its main competitor, the GTX 1060. The RX 480 is smallish as far as GPU dies go, measuring just 232mm (squared) and boasting 5.7 billion transistors, which is a smidge larger than the GP106 die in the GTX 1060. It features 2,304 streaming multiprocessors with 144 texture units along with 8GB of GDDR5 memory running at 8Gb/s. Its 256-bit memory bus is wide for a card of this stature and allows for up to 256GB/s of memory bandwidth. Its notable that AMD has ditched the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) it used on the Fury X, but its possible we might see it make a comeback on one of AMDs upcoming high-end GPUs, code-named Vega. Clock speeds on the RX 480 are higher than what we have seen for previous midrange Radeon cards but lower than those on the GTX 1060 due to differences in the respective architectures. The card has a base clock speed of 1,120MHz and a boost clock of 1,266MHz, which is 442MHz lower than the boost clock of the GTX 1060, but the RX 480 kind of makes up for it with more stream processors and more memory bandwidth too. Two specs that are interesting are that since its a 150w GPU it requires a single eight-pin PCIe connector, which is two more pins than is required on its baby brother, the RX 470. It also ditches the legacy DVI output, opting instead for DisplayPort and HDMI only, which might frustrate people with older monitors. Benchmarks To test the RX 480 we pulled some data from our sister site Computer Shopper, which tested it on a system featuring the following specs: Intel Core i7-4770K CPU 16GB DDR3 Gigabyte Z87X-UDH5 Socket 1150 mobo OCZ Vector 180 SSD boot drive 850-watt Thermaltake Toughpower PSU The card was tested at both 2560x1440 and 1920x1080 resolutions, and they also ran two DX12 tests too. Weve compiled the results into the following charts. Starting with the 2560x1440 results, we can see that the RX 480 is surprisingly strong at this resolution. Out of eight tests it was only able to eclipse 60fps in three of them, but was close in a fourth game - Hitman 2016. Still, in the rest of the titles it was in the 40s, which is certainly respectable for the price, and settings can always be bumped down from Ultra. Overall, wed say the RX 480 is just fine for 2560 x 1440 gaming, but of course, the GTX 1060 is a bit faster overall by between 6 and 20%, depending on the game. When we drop down to 1920x1080 we can see that the RX 480 was made for this resolution, as it soared past the magical 60fps marker in every single test, and that is with the games highest settings being tested too. In fact, in three of the eight games tested the RX 480 achieved over 100fps, which is phenomenal. Naturally, the GTX 1060 is still faster by anywhere from five to 20 percent, but it also costs more too, so thats to be expected. Though there are only three DirectX 12 benchmarks, we see the RX 480 overtaking the GTX 1060 in Hitman and tying it in Ashes of the Singularity, which is consistent with other benchmarks weve run that shows AMD with a decent advantage when it comes to DX12. In Rise of the Tomb Raider Nvidia actually increased its advantage over what it could do in DX11 though so it its still too early to definitively say whether AMD or Nvidia holds an across-the-board advantage, but things are tilting in AMDs favor at this early stage. Overclocking Going off of our sister-site Computer Shoppers tests, we see that they were able to nudge the Boost clock up from 1,266MHz to 1,340MHz using the AMD Wattman software, which is about a six percent overclock. Thats not even close to what can be achieved on the Pascal side of things, but then again AMDs GPUs have never been stellar overclockers, so it looks like that has not changed much with Polaris. Purchasing Guide This evaluation specifically focuses on the initial reference edition of the AMD Radeon RX 480, from AMD itself. In the months since its launch, a variety of marginally-improved 480ss have been released from a variety of manufacturers. Prices range from $175 - $260. You can expect slightly improved benchmarks for these 480 variants. Prices may vary, but below are a few of the best current purchasing options for the Radeon RX 480: ASUS Dual-Fan Radeon Rx 480 4GB OC Edition ASUS ROG STRIX Radeon Rx 480 8GB OC Edition Gigabyte Radeon Rx 480 G1 Gaming 8GB GDDR5 Graphics Card MSI GAMING Radeon RX 480 GDDR5 Armor 4GB OC MSI GAMING Radeon RX 480 GDDR5 4GB CrossFire Note that if you click on one of these links to buy the product, IGN may get a share of the sale. For more, read out Terms of Use. When the RX 480 launched it promptly earned the title of best GPU in its price range, but that was before Nvidia launched its counter attack with the GTX 1060. Though the GTX 1060 is faster, the RX 480 is still a fantastic GPU for the money and the $200 version seems like a hell of a bargain. The Nvidia card is faster, but the RX 480 still performs quite well. Nvidia also has an excellent software package, but AMD just recently announced a revamped software bundle for its GPUs that is designed to take compete heavily with Nvidia on this front, so its too early to tell if it will be enough to mitigate Nvidias advantage. Finally, the Nvidia GPU with the larger memory configuration is more expensive than the RX 480, so you largely get what you pay for. Regardless, the RX 480 is an impressive GPU from AMD and is a great pick for those hoping to get into the world of VR via the red team. Based on this GPUs capabilities we cant wait to see what AMD has in store for us with its big Vega GPU.", "date": "Dec. 20, 2016,"}
