Between Vicki Vales heel turn and Thomas Waynes criminal past, Telltale has not been afraid to flip the script in Gotham City. Perhaps the biggest payoff promised for Same Stitch, the finale of Batman: The Enemy Within, was that John Doe would finally become The Joker, just as weve been waiting for all season. With it, John could take his place as either your arch-nemesis or... your partner. While The Enemy Within never quite fully commits to that reversal, both the episode and the season are memorable for leaving scars on its stars  both physical and emotional. After my Batman helped John escape the police at the end of episode 4, Same Stitch opens with Amanda Waller, her hands dirtier than ever, in pursuit of both Joker and Batman  and The Riddlers virus. In fact, if this season has taught us anything, its that nobody in Telltales Batman universe is clean. The Enemy Within drives this point home by staining the soul of even the most pure and innocent of the series characters by the end of this episode and season. Same Stitch also sees Telltale getting bolder with its cinematography. Numerous fight scenes play with the camera beautifully, adding a much-needed flair to the otherwise rudimentary quick-time-event button presses in ways we havent really seen in other Telltale offerings. The writing seems to have tightened up as well. The Joker has finally found his identity at the same time his writers have. Several dark-humor lines genuinely made me laugh, like when he asks Bane, Ever thought about a second career as a pavement stain? before collapsing a concrete smokestack on top of the Venomed-out villain. Several dark-humor lines genuinely made me laugh.Indeed, the focus here is most certainly on Joker. All season long Id chosen to keep him close, to try and channel his impulses and his idolization of Bruce Wayne and Batman into a force for good. And so in the early going of Same Stitch, Joker swoops in, makeshift superhero look and all (complete with a utility belt thats sadly underutilized) to assist the Dark Knight. His methods are less-than-ideal, for which Batman can either reprimand him or tolerate him, and it sets up a fascinating What if The Joker was a good guy? scenario. And though I did my best to encourage that outcome, The Enemy Within doesnt embrace that outcome to the extent which I was hoping to see. That said, Same Stitch plays out wonderfully, with a meaningful climax and even more impactful falling action that sets up an emotionally powerful final scene. Previous episodes had left a lot of plot threads hanging, but to Telltales credit, most of them get tied up fairly nicely by the end of Same Stitch. Jim Gordon, whod been all but forgotten for the middle episodes of the season, returns to the fold with the chance for you to rebuild Batmans relationship with him, while the Suicide Squad is unveiled in practice, if not in name. But this seasons biggest payoff comes from how you choose to handle your paternal relationship with Alfred, who suffered mightily in season one and has spent this entire season wrestling with that fallout. Furthermore, if there is to be a third season  which the post-credits scene clearly teases  my outcome from The Enemy Within has me quite eager to see where my choices might lead Bruce Wayne in the future of this dark and unconventional take on the Caped Crusader. Telltales take on Batman has been nothing if not full of fun twists over its first two seasons, and it sets up an intriguing jumping-off point if there is to be a third. At about 90 minutes long, Same Stitch moves briskly, with its post-climax repercussions as interesting than the climax itself. This episode  and certainly the entire season  are very worthwhile time investments for any fan of the Dark Knight.", "date": "March 26, 2018"}
