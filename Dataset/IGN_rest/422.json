Three Space Marines clustered around an objective my Eldar Howling Banshee was helping to capture in Warhammer 40K: Eternal Crusade, their big guns aimed at my teammates in the other direction. I slipped in behind them through a door, and sliced one down with my sword in three hits. I moved to his friend, who fell in two chops. By the time his friend realized what was going on, my team's bullets were already knocking him down. Moments like these keep me coming back to Eternal Crusade, and they're usually rewarding enough that I can  temporarily  forgive its many flaws: poor optimization, sparse itemization for some races and classes, and arguable imbalance (which partly led to my victory here). But looking past those problems gets harder every day. I'd come to Eternal Crusade expecting to play an MMO in the vein of Planetside 2, as it was initially described when it was announced, but the final product is not so much that as a third-person, over-the-shoulder, arena/lobby shooter in the vein of a Battlefield or Call of Duty. That needn't be a bad thing, because that style of game is often done well (although understandably the forums are stuffed with ~founders,~ who in some cases paid huge sums early on, protesting that the game we ended up with is not the one that was promised). Not So Massive The strange thing is it's clear that developer Behaviour Interactive is trying to hold on to some of its original vision, even if it makes no sense in Eternal Crusade's current form. Bring up the map before each match, for instance, and you'll see the zones currently in conflict across the world of Arkhona. But you can't click on them to visit; instead, all you can do is queue up for ~Grand Battles~ with up to 60 combatants, ~Skirmishes~ with up to 40, and a five-man ~Lair~ mode to battle against AI-controlled Tyranids (that no one ever seems to join). Why even include the map at all? Eternal Crusade isn't so much an MMO as it is a third-person arena shooter. So, for now, the persistent world is out of the question. But how does it hold up as a objective-based shooter? Right now, getting the most out of the $50 asking price (complete with an in-game cash shop) largely depends on your investment in the Warhammer universe; on how much its rough vocabulary of ~bolters~ and ~chainswords~ and ~sluggas~ inspire you to yell ~Waaaaaagh!~ If you thought of any of those words before I finished that sentence, you'll likely find some fun here in the faithful reverence of the source material in the look and feel, even if you balk at the way Orks can more or less hold their own against lone Space Marines for balance purposes. The Flavor of War A few poor textures aside, Eternal Crusade certainly looks like 40K, with the four playable factions of Space and Chaos Marines, Orks, and Eldar all spouting individualized Warhammery battlecries with a touch of the T key. But some unpolished areas still poke through here and there: sometimes, particularly in the case of the Eldar, the combat animations appear to be missing a couple of key frames, and too many of the classes feel too much like what you'll find in the other races, leading to less of a feel of diversity between sides. Even so, I could never argue any of that takes away the fun of driving a sword through an Ork's chest with a Marine. If 40K flavor means little to you, though, Eternal Crusade will come off as a fairly ordinary lobby shooter with a lopsided emphasis on melee. It often feels and looks like Relics 2011's Warhammer 40K: Space Marine, but it lacks much of its polish. It's intense, though, and always-on friendly fire adds to that. Most of the fun I got out of it was by playing melee-oriented classes, which deliver swift deaths and can slay opponents during their brief bleed-out phase with satisfying execution animations. I'll admit, though, that a lock-on ability makes melee almost stupidly easy, but it's especially fun to play as a class like the Wolf Priest, which can fly across parts of the map and swoop down to slice up gunners dishing out annoying suppression fire. If 40K flavor means little to you though, Eternal Crusade will come off as a fairly ordinary lobby shooter. Balance problems appear to be growing, though. As of the time of writing, the Eldar are a little too good at everything, as they can attack faster and their lithe frames make them harder to target. Ranged combat all around seems intentionally weak and inaccurate in order to make melee shine, often leaving bullets on smaller weapons feeling as effective as softballs in comparison. Meanwhile, the poor Orks feel underpowered at everything (although I loved how players tend to chat in ork-speak during matches). You can also jump into vehicles for a change of pace, but their massive pile of hit points mean leave them as boring to take down as they usually are to play and control because of their straightforward and bland weaponry. Except when playing on maps more or less requiring tanks to take out doors, most players just seem to leave them sitting at the stations. Still, it's fun enough, or at least it's the kind of fun you might expect from a decent free-to-play shooter. As it turns out, Eternal Crusade costs $50 and comes with an in-game cash shop. Many (but not all) items like guns and armor can fortunately be bought with the in-game ~requisition~ currency, and most premium-only weapons aren't quite as good as their requisition-friendly counterparts. Yet the store comes with other annoyances of its own, such as the way most items cost 10,000 premium credits but the store sells those credits in weird packages like 9,000 for $10 bucks or 4,000 for $5. So if you want that sweet, roughly $11 Torrent Reaper Launcher for your Eldar Dark Reaper, you're going to have to fork out $15 to get it. And if Im going to spend that money, I at least want the store to look finished, but this one certainly doesnt seem to be fully fleshed out. The Eldar and Orks particularly have it bad, as the items they can get from requisition chests amount to only half the variety the two Marine variants have access to. All this presupposes you can even run Eternal Crusade. When it first launched, it was such a slideshow that I couldn't even play it on my primary PC, which runs on a GeForce GTX 980. Even while playing it on a subpar laptop that could nevertheless run the thing, I saw frequent rubberbanding, disconnects every few minutes, and server lag that made it almost impossible to use the rock-paper-scissors melee system of light and heavy attacks as intended. At least some of that's better now, following a recent patch addressing the server issues (and my following some forum tips for AMD CPUs, which Eternal Crusade apparently has trouble with across the board). I can now play on Ultra settings with few issues, although framerates still dip in the most crowded battles. It's such a massive turnaround in quality that it gives me some faith that the dev team really intends to address existing issues and continue improving it. And as the development chief said in a statement last week, they plan on rolling out ~a patch this week, a patch next week,~ and so forth. More speed to them; I can't imagine they have an eternity to fix it before players jump ship. Warhammer 40K: Eternal Crusades big multiplayer battles create some fun combat that captures the feel of the Warhammer 40K universe enough, but it currently doesn't offer the amount of content Id expect from a $50 game. Balance and optimization issues also complicate the fun, as do missing elements in the shop and unfinished features that all suggest Eternal Crusade was released a bit too soon.", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
