You see, the system relied on an add-on to provide that service, which would cost $40 and release some time later. But thankfully, that time has passed. The Xbox One audio adapter is now available for purchase, which means companies like Turtle Beach can release their own solutions that offer superior sound and chat capability than the included mono piece. The Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Seven is the companys latest premium Xbox One headset which promises an all-round performance not just with gaming, but for movies and music as well. Design The XO Seven is designed to be an Xbox One companion through and through, so unsurprisingly it has adopted a similar color scheme as well. As a result, the headset features a pleasant non-glossy black finish with green stripes accentuating the ear cups and the head band. Other than that though, the XO Seven sticks close to Turtle Beachs guidebook and looks pretty similar to the companys previous offerings. This new lineup does allow a bit of customization with its swappable speaker plates. You can buy the plates from Turtle Beachs website and they come in a variety of comics and video game designs. They are quite steep though, with prices ranging from $20-$25, so if you have the pocket for it you can certainly make your XO Seven feature Professor Xs bald head. It would be great if Turtle Beach would allow 3D printing in the future for those who have access to it and would like a more personal touch to the final look. The XO Seven is a lot more accommodating than its branding would suggest. Its sufficiently lengthy black and green cord ends at a 3.5mm jack (where audio and mic is combined into a single jack) which can be used on just about anything that supports it, including the PC, the TV, and yes even the PlayStation 4 via the DualShock 4. You can even use the mic on your PC with a splitter - like this one. For mobile use, Turtle Beach includes a swappable cord with an inline call button, although neither of the cords feature any sort of inline controls, so one has to depend entirely on the system they are using for volume and mic adjustments. Pairing the headset with the Xbox One is a relatively painless process. Turtle Beach has thoughtfully included the Xbox One audio adapter with the package so you dont have to buy it separately. This allows you to immediately plug and play, and the simplicity of the adapter means that you can set it up without complications. Simply plug the adapter at the bottom of your controller, jack-in the headset into its 3.5mm hole, and you are ready to go (the adapter does require a mandatory update, however). The adapter can balance chat and game audio separately, so if you want to hear your teammates above the game audio, you can do so by pressing the user icon on the device till you find a good spot, and vice versa. Alternatively, you can press the giant mute button in the middle to cancel out chat entirely. Comfort At first glance, the XO Seven looks and feels quite uncomfortable due to its slightly rigid head band. But surprisingly, the headset fits snugly and offers hours of comfort, even though it does get a bit hot at times. This is mostly thanks to the soft pleather padding on the ear cups which works greatly to reduce the head bands clamp force and fit gently around your ears. In my two weeks of use, I have played a ton of games and watched a lot of movies, and not once have I felt any sort of discomfort. For example, I watched Schindlers List in one go with this headset on, and thats a three hour plus movie. Performance Great sound quality has always been Turtle Beachs strongest suit, and it uses the same high-end technology to deliver excellent overall sound with the XO Seven. The large 50mm drivers creates an impressive soundstage and are balanced capably to tackle any kind of content there is. Above everything else, the XO Seven excels in sound positioning. Games like Titanfall came to life with it placing the cracking of the guns, whizzing bullets, and giant, angry mechs all around me, engulfing me in the screams of explosions and crashing metal. I was able to accurately pinpoint the location of the sound and anticipate any advancement from the enemy team with absolute clarity. The XO Seven is also fairly capable of delivering detail and punch to the sound effects, although it does favor the highs a bit unlike Sennheiser G4ME Ones balanced sound levels which is always preferable. It also lacks the deep rumbling bass of the Steelseries Siberia Elite, and while it does not create any deficit in audio quality in games or movies, you can feel the lack of richness during music playback. For online chat, Turtle Beach employs a high grade microphone for the XO Seven, and the quality is loud and clear. To demonstrate, here's me reading a passage from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Pros Great controllerLots of media and peripheral optionsEasy gameplay sharing Cons Interface needs refinementNo DVR integration At the Xbox Ones launch, Microsoft took the position of wanting to be the console that offered everything in one place, but it didnt fully deliver on that. Now, a year later, the Xbox Ones major features have been strengthened enough so they clearly stand out, and the media-saturated environment they live in has also been nurtured and grown. Whether you come to your living room to watch video content or TV, listen to music, or play games, theres a lot to choose from in each category.<br><br> That said, there are still areas that need to be honed. The Xbox Ones interface needs refinement to make controller-only navigation feel simple; it cant rely on its alternative controls (SmartGlass, the optional Media Remote accessory) to shore up the gaps. And it wouldnt hurt if Microsoft worked with developers to eliminate lower resolutions and framerates in third-party games, as it currently makes the Xbox harder to choose for people who want to play the likes of Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age: Inquisition. But if Microsoft pushes out the same amount of substantial updates between now and next yearas it did between last year and nowthe Xbox Ones poised to become an amazing system by November 2015, no matter if it has Kinect or not.", "date": "May 28, 2014,"}
