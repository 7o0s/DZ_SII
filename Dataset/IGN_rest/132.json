This major expansion is a wonderfully challenging 15-hour adventure thats peppered with creative side quests, a thoughtful story, and the best battles Aloys seen to date. Its story integrates with the main game and can be played after finishing the main quest, so it works both for completionists and those who never quite finished the story quests. You can travel to a new, gorgeous area on the existing map as soon as you install it, though youd risk crossing the line between bravery and stupidity to attempt it before level 30. In this terrain, youll explore the mysteries surrounding the nomadic Banuk tribe  mysteries which made for one of the most memorable side quests in Zero Dawn. The Frozen Wilds delves deeper into into the fascinating intricacies of their structure and spirituality. Specifically, it zooms in on the compelling idea of gods and demons as the explanation for the apocalyptic world full of dinosaur-like robots. Though its story occasionally veers into jargon-heavy convolution - speak English, people! - by the end I had been asked some genuinely thought-provoking questions on the place faith has in such a brutal world. For her part, Aloy remains an endearingly warm character. At this point in the story shes strong and skilled enough to pull rank when the situation demands it, and her personality fills that role nicely. Shes also the voice of reason, and whenever The Frozen Wilds stumbles into silliness, Aloy is there to point it out with dry quips delivered with bite by voice actress Ashly Burch. Shes well matched by a new supporting cast, the most interesting and eccentric of whom appear in the many side quests peppered throughout the expansion. These adventures are some of the best weve seen yet, with a particular focus on Uncharted/Tomb Raider-style platforming as you climb up ominously vertical playgrounds, breathless battles, and hilarious banter. Killer Instinct Theyre worth it on a practical level, too, as youll want to keep levelling up (if youre not level 50 already) to get stronger weapons and materials. Though mostly familiar from Zero Dawn, the monsters that roam The Frozen Wilds are not playing around; if youre ganged up on, expect to have an extremely tough fight on your hands. Developer Guerilla has justified this major stat boost by means of a daemonic force that has infiltrated the robots systems, so fighting a daemonic thunderjaw is going to be a much more frightening proposition than fighting its regular counterpart. Its just as large and imposing, but deadly enough to restore the fear thatd been lost. These battles are the most fun Ive had in Horizon to date. Between levels 40 and 50 in Zero Dawn Id found myself fighting complacently, especially equipped with the Shield Weaver armour that gives Aloy a regenerating shield, but The Frozen Wilds brought back the sense of danger. Even fully upgraded, I found fighting groups of Daemonic machines overwhelming (the only reason I didnt repeatedly die was the absurd number of health potions and metal shards Id collected during my 40 hours with Zero Dawn), and a handful of completely new machines that primarily serve as bosses of sorts tested my roll at the very last second twitch reflexes to their limits. I loved feeling like I was genuinely fighting for my life, even with my skill tree maxed out. To make fights more frantic, The Frozen Wilds also introduces Control Towers, which are spindly, tentacular machines that blast out a purple pulse of energy that lowers your shield resistance and heals hostile machines in the vicinity. Overriding or destroying these towers takes concentration and time, resulting in nail-biting tension as you try to take them down before the machines tear you apart. This all lends a real sense of danger while moving across the world. If Zero Dawn was like playing in Jurassic Park, The Frozen Wilds is like playing through The Lost World: its untamed and unregulated. Because even a Daemonic Watcher now proves as much of a threat as it did in the first few hours of the campaign, I was frequently spooked by rustling sounds in the bushes, or approaching roars, particularly while playing during one of its eerie night cycles. Let it Snow It helps that The Frozen Wilds far-north terrain is dauntingly beautiful. Its snow-blanketed mountains, ravines, and fields are peppered with day-glo lakes and framed by gorgeous blue-red sunsets. It may sound like a small thing, but considering how much time youll spend in it if you play to the end, the its important that the Frozen Wilds snow feels crunchy and real. When Aloy comments on how cold it is, I could feel it. The Frozen Wilds other major point of difference from Zero Dawn is the addition of a new branch to Aloys skill tree, referred to as The Traveller. With a focus on ease of movement while mounted on an overridden machine and making the most of your inventory, The Traveller doesnt feel vital to the expansion itself, but rather to the longevity of Horizon as a whole. Being able to pick up resources while on the back of a broadhead or learning to disassemble resources and mods into 50% of their metal shard values feel like no-brainer ideas, and Im glad Guerrilla finally included them. Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds is an excellent addition to an amazing game. Developer Guerrilla has doubled down on the thrill of the hunt with more challenging machines and testing side quests that are added to the original map through an intriguing new storyline that delves into the mystical side of this post-apocalyptic world. It left me wanting start a brand new game, just to wander around the world, marveling at it.", "date": "Nov. 7, 2017,"}
