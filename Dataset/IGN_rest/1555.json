If Dynasty Warriors Next is a little different from what fans are used to, that's no technical complaint  this is the first handheld Warriors title not to be compromised by the format. Instead, it seems positively invigorated by its move to Sony's new console. Many accuse the series of going through the motions with each sequel; here Koei has done just that - and this time it isn't a criticism. That's because we're talking about the touch and gyroscope controls which Koei has applied here at every opportunity. You'll tilt your Vita to aim Musou attacks or pinpoint enemy weak points, circle your finger on the touchscreen to swing an axe, swipe to deflect arrows or aim projectiles of your own, and tap to block during leader duels or to open up a shielded enemy to attack. Even the rear touchpad gets a workout during sections where you'll man a turret to defend an important stronghold. These interludes - which occur during ambushes or special encounters and thankfully not during the flow of regular combat  are at times reminiscent of the first wave of DS games where developers tried to cram in as many of the unique features of Nintendo's console as possible, merely for the sake of using them. Yes, they feel a little tacked on in one sense, but they're framed with a typical Koei sense of theatre, punctuating the flow of play without truly disrupting them. Besides, they provide an injection of variety in a series often accused of lacking it. Fight for your life in Dynasty Warriors Purists will be happy to learn that motion and touch controls are entirely optional, though most will welcome their addition, even if the duels, which bear more than a faint echo of Chair's iOS hit Infinity Blade, all play out in a similar fashion. A diagonal flick blocks your rival's attack, you'll quickly tap flashing touch points to break their resistance when weapons clash, then you'll rapidly swipe away to finish them off. They're put to better use during normal play, where you can swipe the map to zoom in, then drag your subordinate officers to attack enemy bases or defend the ones you've already captured. While on the default difficulty setting and below you can happily let them follow you into battle, on the higher levels, you'll need to make sure your territory is well defended. Before you start each skirmish, you'll need to set up a stratagem. This involves spending the gold you've earned on cards representing the officers of your current kingdom, each of which provides a certain buff during combat. Select Sun Quan, for example, and you'll start the battle with more bases, while Xiahou Dun raises the playable officer's offensive and defensive stats. You can choose more than one per encounter if you have enough gold, but the least expensive officers usually have a weakness  pick Lianshi and the Attack level of both your and the enemy's army will be substantially higher. The Campaign mode is classic Dynasty Warriors, a series of battles across multiple territories of China as you take turns to play as the rival kingdoms vying for control of the land. On occasion you'll get a choice of which territory to invade next, but for the most part you follow a prescribed path. You'll often get to choose which officer to take into battle, though for the sake of historical accuracy, during certain key conflicts you're restricted to one. As your army marches onward, gradually turning the map over to your kingdom's colours, you'll unlock additional weapons, new saddles for mounted combat, orbs which convey elemental effects and various other stat-enhancing items, of which five can be equipped at any time. You'll also unlock costumes which can be used to clothe a user-created officer in Edit mode. These characters can fight alongside the Three Kingdoms' generals in Conquest mode, which proves marginally less restrictive in terms of your choice of route. You'll only be able to invade adjacent territories with a level lower than the one your army is currently in, though a random region of your own will get a single-level boost before each turn. You can, however, capture several territories in one move when you venture into the realm of a ruler  liberate the land and you'll obtain all areas previously under that leader's control. Minigames you've unlocked during play can be attempted in Gala mode if you want to beat your best score or time, and there's an extra Calligrapher option where you try to reveal hidden kanji using the rear touch pad before tracing the character by swiping the touchscreen at the front. These might be fleeting novelties, but it's heartening to see Koei make the effort for the series' Vita debut. The developer has even found time to squeeze in some Augmented Reality silliness in Musou Snapshots, so if you've ever wanted a physique like Dong Zhuo, you can superimpose his body onto your own. Visually, Dynasty Warriors Next looks on a par with the home console games, and on the Vita's OLED screen, the character models look even sharper and more detailed. The frame-rate is consistent even when tigers, bears and wolves enter the fray, though you shouldn't expect that draw distance to improve. Again, it's disappointing to hear repeated voice samples and the same old guitar riffs, but that can be forgiven in the light of everything Koei gets right here. It might even pick up a few new fans  with interstitial story sequences kept brisk and the addition of motion-controlled content, not to mention the shorter, portable-friendly battles, it's arguably the most immediate Warriors for some time. CLOSING COMMENTS Even so, this is Dynasty Warriors through and through, and if the new content might convince a few newcomers to take the plunge, anyone who hated the previous games will find little to love here. Though if its been a while since you played a Warriors game, perhaps its time to reconsider: it works as both a cathartically satisfying hack-and-slash on the easier difficulties, and a surprisingly thoughtful action-based strategy game on the higher levels. If youre looking for something a little different to accompany your new handheld, you could do a lot worse than pick up Dynasty Warriors Next.
