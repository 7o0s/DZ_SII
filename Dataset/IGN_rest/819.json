Its an episode wounded by character inconsistencies, frequently terrible dialogue, and tedious puzzles, but the finale brings the series strongest story moments together in a heartbreaking way -- and you can't do anything to undo it. Main character Max Caulfields choices from both Episodes 1 and 2 come to a head and really have substantial meaning to the people around her. In turn, suddenly Life is Strange has meaning to me. I criticized Life is Strange: Episode 1 - Chrysalis, for failing to create convincing, compelling characters, and developer Dontnod has almost entirely rectified this issue in Out of Time. The writing and character performances remain problematic, but the humanity hidden beneath the awkward delivery of out-of-place lines bursts free in Episode 2. For the first time, Im interested in character arcs and mysteries that arent directly about Max Caulfield. Characters that didnt work before now have more meaningful time in the spotlight, and they have a huge effect on Maxs future. All of this feeds back into a likable, relatable protagonist I continue to enjoy playing. The figure at the front of this is Kate Marsh, a devout Catholic with no memory of certain humiliating events that have gone viral. In Episode 2, which is ultimately her story, Kates position as the schools least-liked student grows into something more dramatic. I was receptive to that. I did everything in my power to support Kate because Life is Strange creates brutal situations that made me want to. Hints of drugs, mental illness, and potential sexual abuse make for a nasty combo. Still, I would understand why a player may not pick up on these subtle, quiet elements of Kates story, and prioritize other characters and choices instead. After all, Max has other problems (and closer friends) to worry about, too. Chloe, Maxs old friend who became a rebellious troublemaker, brings us closer to the mystery of Rachel Amber, a fellow student whos been missing for a concerning amount of time. Exploring the junkyard where Rachel and Chloe spent time together showed a sad, almost jealous side of Max I didnt know existed. We also get a look at what Rachel meant to Chloe, who felt abandoned when she and Max lost touch in the years before the series started. Life is Strange succeeds most with meaningful moments like this. Episode 1 dabbled in creating an effective relationship, and tapping into the volatility of teenage emotion, but Episode 2 makes it count. These great scenes happen despite (and partially because of) weak puzzle-solving sections. Life is Strange: Episode 2 has a couple scenarios that rely on more conventional video game design than its story-centric sequences. By the end, though, I really appreciated what these limp scenarios led to. A tedious sequence meant to expose Chloe to Maxs time-rewinding powers has unexpected meaning later on, as does the time-consuming fetch-quest that follows. It just isnt clear until youre blindsided by its significance. Everything in Out of Time just feels important in a way Chrysalis didnt. I would rewind time to undo choices, regret it, rewind again, regret it, and eventually settle on something I wasnt sure about. When circumstances prevented rewinding at one point, the series' heaviest scene so far carried that much more weight. By Episode 3, itll be too late to change what I did in Episode 2, and I cant wait to see what mess I made for myself during its stressful finale. The emotional gravity of those moments also leads into a great cliffhanger, and Im genuinely upset I cant see the rest of the story through right now. If the rest of the series capitalizes on the strengths of Episode 2, and abandons the failures of the premiere, it could really be something special after all. Pros Improved arcsTough choicesInteresting relationshipsSuperb ending Cons Problematic writing/acting The ramifications of my actions in Life is Strange: Episode 2 - Out of Time have more than earned my interest in the rest of the season, even if it means enduring the inconsistent character performances and awkward writing. Even though I sometimes don't believe in the way these characters speak to each other, I buy into them as people. I care about Chloe even though I dont like her -- shes troubled, has feelings, and needs to lean on Max even though she wont admit it. I let people down to help others, and discovered interesting and unexpected aspects of Maxs life. Out of Time is a big step in the right direction for this series, and it says something that I'm willing to endure its worst bits to enjoy its best.", "date": "March 25, 2015"}
