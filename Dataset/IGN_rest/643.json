After killing mind-wolves with a swarm of nano-bees in the new campaign, Im happy to say Black Ops 3 not only continues that trend, but smartly embraces its sci-fi oddities more than ever before. But the most remarkable thing about Black Ops 3 isnt its tone; its the sheer amount of content which, at its best, is some of the greatest Ive seen in Call of Duty. Multiplayer still has the depth fans expect by now, but the addition of unique Specialists makes every player more important. Likewise, the option for four-player co-op and the new focus on playing how you want make the campaign and Zombies modes more rewarding and fun to play than theyve ever been. Mind Games The six-hour story is set in the not-too-distant future, and, like most similar sci-fi fare, it includes its own techno-gibberish to get used to. Black Ops 3 settles on Direct Neural Interface, or DNI for short. This ubiquitous technology allows humans to mentally interact with computers, weapons, and other people. It introduces both terrific new abilities and important new limitations that changed the way I thought about playing Call of Duty. For example, you cant use enemies dropped weapons because theyre registered to someone elses brain  hence Black Ops 3s focus on cool new combat powers. Without getting into spoilers, Ill say that Black Ops 3 didnt spend enough time making me care about its characters before it tried to cash them in for an emotional payoff. Its disappointing, because Black Ops 3 begins to explore some genuinely interesting and taboo topics: What happens when people no longer own their thoughts, or when they dont receive the mental health care they need? The answer: kill more robots! With Our Powers Combined... Killing more robots (and other enemies) is actually quite fun thanks to the new powers, which come in three flavors: blow things up, beat things up, or control your enemies and have them blow things up for you. Each power tree promotes a certain style of play, and you dont earn enough points to level up all three paths unless you choose to sacrifice extra perks, weapon upgrades, and more. Even then, you can usually only use one type per level, so committing to one path is important. Plus, this leaves enough points to beef up your trusty primary weapon, which feels more important than it ever has. The gun you pick will likely stay in your hands for the entire level. My powers of choice enhanced my up-close-and-personal combat skills  an altogether underexplored style in Call of Duty. My most-used skill was a charge ability that sent me flying across the battlefield at incredible speeds, killing weaker enemies and staggering the big ones. Other favorites include an area-of-effect ground pound, which was especially satisfying to use after leaping from up high. Invisibility was fun for sneaking into better cover and useful for giving me time to revive downed allies. I havent seen this kind of utility in a Call of Duty game before, but its a terrific addition. These powers really shine when you throw another player or three into the mix. In my playthrough, my co-op partner was the blow things up guy  a ranged damage dealer and disabler. He could ignite enemies with the wave of a hand, set loose a swarm of bees, and more. When we needed specific enemies dead as soon as possible, his powers took care of it. Also, his bees distracted enemies, giving me time to line up my charge ability (which can be tough to steer) and hit multiple enemies in one blast. A more general tactic was for me to charge to the other side of the battlefield and flank the enemy from a spot that I couldnt have made it to at normal running speeds. Many of the levels accommodate tactics like this, and using the environments, powers, and good ol cooperation satisfied me in a way a Call of Duty campaign never has before. Powers are on a cooldown, so they dont make Black Ops 3s excellently refined shooting obsolete. By design or by coincidence, it often felt like my powers came off cooldown right when my guns ran out of ammo. This let me continue the fight, find cover, or survive long enough for my allies to save the day. Black Ops 3s enemies are varied and competent, but when I replayed a few campaign missions they acted pretty much the same as they did before. Without the new abilities, there wouldnt be much of a gameplay reason to replay the story. On your first run, youll commit to one style. On a second or third run, your character will unlock the ability to switch between different power types in the middle of a mission, opening the door for fun new combinations. The first time I played through one area, I charged around the battlefield, slaying as I went. The second time I sat behind cover, happily hacking drones and using them to clear the way. Its refreshing to play a Call of Duty level and have more options than shoot that guy again, but with a different gun. Using powers effectively is pretty much mandatory if you want to even try to survive the new Realistic difficulty mode, where one bullet is often enough to take you out. Im not up for the challenge, but if you want to fight for every single inch, Realistic mode is excellent at running you through the wringer. The Good Old Days I was surprised and disappointed to find that many of the great high-mobility mechanics Treyarch revealed for Black Ops 3s multiplayer, such as firing while performing other actions or wall-running, at first seemed disabled in campaign. On closer inspection, I found them locked away in an odd part of the tech tree. On one hand its commendable that Treyarch wants to give us the option to ignore the new mobility skills and play a more classic style of Call of Duty  theres even a tech upgrade that allows you pick up any weapon you find, just like the old days. On the other, it wouldve been better if they werent so easy to miss that I didnt even get a double-jump for my whole first playthrough. In multiplayer, everyone has a thruster pack regardless of their loadout  similar but different enough from last years Advanced Warfare that learning to use it effectively was a new challenge. The new thruster pack movements feel smooth, easy to control, and offer tons of precision. Theyre great for chasing down or escaping from enemies, reaching objectives quickly, and navigating levels without overshooting your target. Because you can always fire your weapon, theres often no need to think twice about bouncing off walls like a caffeinated hamster. Being out of cover makes you a big target, but at least youre a target who can fight back. This makes for fast battles that can start at any time and from any angle, thanks to maps that were built with enough paths and shortcuts to make use of your skills. Complex motions like running along a wall, firing at an enemy, and then hopping to a different wall are difficult to perfect, but Black Ops 3 includes four excellent American Gladiators-style Free Run courses to test your skills outside of live multiplayer. It records your best completion times too, so this mode will have legs. Everyone is Special Black Ops 3s competitive multiplayer brings back the same reliable Pick-10 loadouts, which let you select 10 weapon attachments, perks, grenades, and more to take into battle. This isnt anything new, but its still a solid system that ensures you can go into a match with exactly the gear you want, and nothing more. Multiplayer includes a huge array of unlockable guns, perks, and gear that let you mold a playstyle of your own. Its excellent, but at this point Call of Duty fans should expect nothing less. The important new change for multiplayer is that you no longer play as generic soldiers. Before a match begins, you pick a Specialist to play as  anything from a murderous robot to an elite archer. Each Specialist has one exclusive power and one exclusive weapon, and you get to take one of the two into battle. This is one of the best decisions Treyarch made for Black Ops 3s multiplayer. Because each character is useful, and because there are nine Specialists, theres no way for a team to have every power and every weapon available. So more than ever before, you have a chance to be useful even if youre not the most skilled player. If you pick the character who can see enemies through walls for a short time, you are invaluable for warning your team about incoming foes. If you grab the new Hive weapon, you can set up proximity traps to cover the weak points in an otherwise strong defense. Special powers and guns arent a free win button, though. If you pop your special and get killed a second later you need to wait for it to recharge, even after a respawn. Octopi vs. Zombies The new Zombies co-op mode, Shadows of Evil, is the best version of the undead slaying mode in Call of Duty yet. It has its own progression system, the 1940s urban-style setting is gorgeous, and its a place where a magician played by none other than Jeff Goldblum says lines like With each subsequent transformation I grow ever more confident with my tentacles. Shadows of Evils four noir-esque characters  a magician, a boxer, a cop, and a burlesque dancer  are liars and killers thrown together against their will, and each is introduced with a great short video that shows them at their worst. Its interesting to see what kind of information they do and dont share with their new companions. It plays much like the Zombies mode has before, with players earning money for repairing barricades, killing enemies, and more, then using it to buy upgrades to survive the next wave. However, thanks to a new persistent XP and perks system, you can customize weapons and abilities before a match begins  you wont likely see everybody running around with the same guns this time. The mode lasts as long as you can hold out, so specializing your characters becomes more important as the difficulty ramps up. One big new addition to Zombies is the ability to Become the Beast. At certain fiery shrines, you can transform into a tentacled, lightning-spewing monster that rips the undead apart. Its incredibly powerful, but it doesnt last long, and you cant use it very often. Some of the best and most tense moments in Shadows of Evil come from quickly having to decide as a group whether you can handle the current wave, or whether youll die without using the Beast. Pros Fun powersGreat co-opTons to unlockSmooth mobilityFull Zombies mode From its four-player co-op campaign to the brand-new powers and a fleshed-out Zombies mode, Black Ops 3 meaningfully pushes the Call of Duty series forward on several fronts. Even where it doesn't innovate, it still meets the high bar Call of Duty fans should expect. Black Ops 3 isn't the best Call of Duty game ever, but it's the biggest and most feature-packed game we've seen out of the series yet.", "date": "Nov. 6, 2015,"}
