Surprise surprise: despite jumping and punching through over 160 levels in the original League of Evil, gamers didn't quite stop the evil scientists' malevolent plans. The only thing to do? Punch, double-jump, and wall-jump through 100 more fast-paced 2D stages, across five distinct environments. Like the original, League of Evil 2's difficulty is sky-high, but the challenge is eased thanks to the precise touch controls and each level's bite-sized length. Akin to Super Meat Boy, League of Evil 2 is all about pulling off a few seconds of 2D platforming perfection. Did we like it? League of Evil 2 is an excellent and polished 2D platformer. It stands above the pack and deserves a home screen slot from anyone that ever gets those hard-to-satisfy run 'n jump cravings. Regardless, the sequel disappoints in a few small ways. The slick new HD graphics feel soulless compared to the original's chunky pixel art. Additionally, the boss fights, LoE 2's only other major addition, feel rote and repetitive. It would be a better game without them. Should you buy it? League of Evil 2 is destined to take its place in the upper echelon of App Store platformers. The original is the slightly better game, but that doesn't mean this sequel can be overlooked. For $1 - $3, the package is a great value. Over 100 levels are included, each with aggressive three-star times to achieve, and optional hidden briefcases to collect. Game Center achievements and customizable costumes round out the package. CLOSING COMMENTS League of Evil 2 is another platforming hit from Ravenous Games. The games sharp 2D platforming touch controls should be a model for others, and its huge amount of content will keep gamers busy for days. The sequel doesnt quite live up to the original, but I still thoroughly enjoyed punching all 100 stage-ending scientists in the face.
