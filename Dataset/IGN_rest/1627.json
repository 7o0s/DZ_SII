Its striking art-style may initially draw the eye, but ScaryGirl stands proudly on a foundation of tried and true gameplay. Several mechanics fumble, but the quirky platformer is a good game and worth a look for anyone who loves old-school challenges. ScaryGirl Video Review Animated 2D cut-scenes tell the tale of ScaryGirl's giant octopus guardian, a floating bunny who lives under her house, and a mysterious dream keeping ScaryGirl up at night. Overall the chase to the oblong-headed villain doesn't play a large role in the experience, but the art highlights the journey. ScaryGirl's stylish visuals paint imaginative characters and a diverse world of mountaintops, cities, oceans, and caves in a 2.5D style. Stark colors pop from the varied levels, and elements like traffic racing out of the background help shake up the monotony of side to side gameplay. While the animation doesn't hit that cartoon-come-to-life feeling, the overall aesthetics are beautiful. In action, ScaryGirl's gameplay doesn't explode in the same stylish fashion its art does. This doesn't mean its stale, rather, it falls into the vein of loose-platformers like Donkey Kong Country where the precision of Mario doesn't factor in. With her tentacle-arm's ability to hover and grapple certain environmental objects, missing a jump doesn't mean certain death. Tentacle augments allow ScaryGirl to float across longer distances (to nab elusive heart containers and gems) or attack with more power. These abilities come from an in-game shop curated by an odd, green beast. Gem pick-ups throughout every level act as immediate currency, so the shop beast's absence on some levels makes upgrading difficult. Boss fights require timing, normal fights are chaos. The loose control aspects operate well for movement, but they haunt other elements of the experience. Combat, for instance, never feels precise. While fighting-game-style combos make for powerful attacks, no scenario feels escapable without taking damage. While one or two enemies make for manageable fodder, large groups end up causing a chaotic rumble. When situations require a well-placed rock toss, ScaryGirl's controls make target practice a difficult undertaking. A lengthy and expandable health bar makes the most trying battles possible, but when boss fights require old-school pattern memorization to stay alive, the rest of the game needs a similar sense of dodge-perfection. Late game levels ramp up the difficulty, and with floating platform survival fights and Mega Man-style boss rematches, ScaryGirl elicits a nostalgic kind of triumph only a barely-survived scenario can. On top of tough gameplay, collecting gems, destroying evil plants, and not dying reward players with ~Perfection.~ Early levels make Perfection an easy feat, but the divergent paths, tough fights, and hidden gems of the latter stages make this an insanely difficult undertaking. The drive toward completionism adds longevity to the game. A vivid world. While there's no online play, convenient drop-in, drop-out local co-op makes the whole fight more fun. Not only are large-scale fights easier, but Bunniguru, the second character, features badass kung fu moves ScaryGirl doesn't -- though he can't grapple enemies and environmental objects like his counterpart. CLOSING COMMENTS ScaryGirl looks great and plays well, even if enemy gangs cause cheap hits and target-based switches are annoying to hit. If you like a challenge, love finding collectables, and want a constantly evolving journey through 21 platforming levels, give ScaryGirl a chance. It rides that old-school balance of fun and frustrating down to the final boss fight.
