There survives a thirst for overtly provocative humor outside the domain of criticism, a thirst the animated series Hoops hopes to quench. Releasing off-color country-infused comedy albums under his alter-ego, Wheeler Walker Jr, Hoops creator Ben Hoffman has ruled the politically incorrect for years. Apart from his incendiary records, Hoffman's The Ben Show, which aired on Comedy Central for one season, might be inferred as the showrunner's primary inspiration for this new series. Executive produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, through ten half-hour episodes, Hoops similarly shoots for laughs with loud, trashy humor. Based in Kentucky, Coach Ben Hopkins (Jake Johnson) helms the Lenwood High School Colts: a basketball team so terrible, if they lose by forty its a win. Ben throws chairs and referees routinely eject him from games for his colorful language. Along with Hoffmans uncensored football coach sketch from The Ben Show, Bobby Knight likely serves as the closest inspiration for the character. Bens life hangs in tatters: His estranged wife Shannon (Natasha Leggero)  an equestrian  is dating his Black assistant coach and ~best friend~ Ron (Ron Funches). Ben lives in the spare room of his best friends place; and withers under the shadow of his retired-ABA, steakhouse-owning father Barry (Rob Riggle). With a character like Ben exhibiting such a depth of misery, Hoops should be a sure-fire winner. Instead, the animated series lacks anything resembling a memorable punchline. Each episode follows Ben finding an edge to win. In the premiere  in a scene ripped from Hoosiers  to save his job, Ben tries to recruit the lone seven-foot kid in town Matty (A. D. Miles), a tragically lonely teen dressed in a black overcoat. He does so by promising the high schooler penetration with a sex worker in return for playing time. In the episode Ethics, Ben pressures Mattys ethics teacher to pass him so hell be eligible to play. For Matty Gets a Girlfriend, fearing Mattys new relationship will adversely affect his playing, Ben plots to end the couples burgeoning love. The respective arcs are thin and infrequently funny, with one exception being The F***ing Sponsor. There, Bens dad bets against his sons team. Expecting the team to lose, he becomes a sponsor and promises free steaks if the team wins a game. The story allows for Ben to connect with his young players  in a hilarious and affecting way  over the shared hate for their fathers. The conclusion gives Ben and his dad a brief chance at poignancy. Unfortunately, Hoffman rarely offers much emotion beyond anger. Even the most invective-laden animated shows gave their characters moments for reflection. Peter Griffin might be a selfish oaf, but his family often breaks through his juvenile blabberings for heartfelt scenes. No matter how callous, South Park typically ends on an endearing  if sharply ironic  message. The list continues through The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Ren & Stimpy, and countless others. But Hoops never approaches the same depth. For instance, the relationship between Ben and his estranged wife Shannon operates on a single plane: Bens selfishness. He tries to win her back in every episode, but often bungles his opportunities. In episode 2, in an attempt to woo her back and make his dad jealous, he crashes her equestrian party. He further turns off Shannon when he undermines his best friend Ron or disregards her boundaries. The character neednt require a life-changing event to experience a moment of pathos  the aforementioned shows all demonstrate sincere, profound moments on occasion, but the characters remain their same flawed selves. A series cant survive under a slew of slander; even animated shows require some emotional realness beyond the artifice. Worse yet, Hoops lacks resonant supporting characters. For instance, the schools principal Opa (Cleo King) fits into the stereotypical sitcom role of sassy Black woman. Often fighting with Ben over budgetary issues, she sometimes sings about her sexual urges in graphic detail... and thats the extent of the character. Bens father wishes his son werent his. Ron floats around Bens tantrums with zen calmness, and might be the series best personality, if he were more Ned Flanders and less clueless. None of the kids on the ragtag basketball team, save for Matty, are narratively impactful. Theyre more a revolving carousel of punching bags for low-hanging fatphobic, homophobic, and antisemitic jokes, which often lack inventiveness. Hoops too often confuses the shocking with the ingenious. Moreover, the recurring bits arent memorable either. Ben routinely references Little Man Tate, the Jodie Foster-directed family drama, but the novelty of him referring to a little-seen movie wears thin once you realize its a little-seen movie. Self-loathing, Ben quips about his penis size; his lack of physical acumen for basketball; and his propensity for losing - hes at least an equal opportunist. But the punchlines lack contemporaneousness. Much like the Little Man Tate bit, Hoops builds jests around Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, Lisa Nowak, Joey Greco, and Guy Fieri. And thats just in the second episode. Ultimately, Hoops is a series that feels more at home in 2007 than in 2020. Though Hoops dark humor sometimes engineers comedic surprises, the inconsistent, unoriginal writing hampers the animated series. The barrage of incendiary insults spouting from Bens raspy voice isn't a substitute for coherent character building. Instead, like the Comedy Central skit the series most likely takes inspiration from, Hoops never evolves past the confines of a sketch. While the world could use risqu, adventurous laughs without the fear of reprisal right now, Hoffmans animated series is without adventure or laughs, mostly ending up as banal as an after-dark Hoosiers spoof.", "date": "Aug. 23, 2020,"}
