For all of the money Apple has been pumping into its still-infant delivery service, weve yet to see many shows that radiate with enough creativity to pull our attention from Apple TV+s more established competitors. Central Park, though, is one of those shows. Its an animated comedy, which is nothing new in itself, but get this: Its also a full-blown musical with all only a handful of spoken lines dropped before its cast bursts into songs about everything from superheroes to scooping poop. Its art style is an instant tip-off that its from some of the same folks who gave us Bobs Burgers, but Apples massive cash piles allow it to be animated with a fluidity we never saw in co-producer Loren Bouchards previous show. For one of the first times on Apple TV, heres an example of Apple putting all that money to excellent use. As in Bobs Burgers, a lot of the action centers on a quirky family, in this case the family of Central Park manager Owen (Leslie Odom, Jr.), who lives in a sweet ~castle~ in the parks heart. We also meet Paige, his journalist wife (Kathryn Hahn)who works for ~the number one most left-on-the-subway paper in the city,~ his two kids (Kristen Bell and Tituss Burgess), and a lovable busker (Josh Gad) who creeps on them by peeping through their houses windows. (Its totally cool, he tells us; after all, hes the narrator!) Considering how many songs drop in each episode, Im impressed by how catchy they are. Its hard enough to come up with a single good musical episode  as The Magicians did so memorably in 2018  but the two episodes I saw included everything from the showboating numbers expected from musicals to lightweight raps. Much of Central Parks humor, in fact, comes from silly couplets like this: ~Papa, I believe this puppys heaven-sent / I promise to pick up his every excrement.~ Yes, in true Bobs Burgers fashion, the poop jokes are as plentiful as gritty gum on Manhattan sidewalks. Beyond that, the musical approach works so well because the actual singing is delightful, which shouldnt come as much of a surprise as Kristen Bell famously voiced Frozens Anna, while Odom and Daveed Diggs (who plays a dour woman) established themselves in the hit musical Hamilton. Some of the songs are better than others  Bells ~Weirdoes Make Good Superheroes~ is an especially memorable standout  but none of them left me longing for everyone to start chatting normally again. Its worth watching Central Park for the quality of its animation and its pun-laden musical numbers alone. It deserves critical attention, though, for the way it uses these elements to tackle important contemporary issues. Central Park tends to start with a foundation of familiar and comfortable concepts like teenage love and job dissatisfaction and then uses them to springboard into commentaries on the ways that, say, some of our most precious institutions exist only thanks to a fragile thread of legislation. To its great credit, Central Park never knocks you over the head with these messages. Much as Apple TV+ did with its wonderful series Little America, it instead subtly communicates these ideas through empathy and shared experiences with the characters rather than through direct lecturing. The approach works more often than not. In this era of social distancing and general uncertainty, Central Park also works as a powerful reminder of the importance and vitality of shared public spaces and, for that matter, the messy compromises we sometimes need to make in order for our communities to flourish. Sometimes, Central Park suggests, you simply have to deal with the fact that youre going to have to pick up some trash. On the other hand, I admire that Central Park seems to be building to a conclusion that argues that some things shouldnt be compromised. If theres one thing that almost all of Apple TV+ shows have had in common until this point, its that they take a couple of episodes to put the pieces in place and then the really good episodes  the ones that leave the best impressions  drop later in the season. Based on the two episodes of Central Park available at premiere, thats true of this series, too. The difference is that few of Apple TV+s shows have pulled off that approach so successfully, to the point that Im now eager to see what Bouchard and his buddies have in store for us for the next few Fridays going forward. This is a beautiful and rewatchable setup, filled as much with heart as it is with scatological jokes. Its also optimistic, and right now, thats a welcome gift. Central Park kicks off with a similar narrative and stylistic foundation as Bobs Burgers, but it distinguishes itself with an enthusiastic musical format thats packed with humor and catchy tunes. The first two episodes focus too heavily on scene-setting to determine much of whats in store for the rest of the season, but they exude enough warmth and heart to suggest the following episodes might make this a series to remember.", "date": "June 1, 2020,"}
