All 13 episodes are available to stream right now. Etheria's fearless savior returns to television in dazzling animated form with She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, a reboot of the 1985 series that stays true to its roots while simultaneously reimagining the titular heroine for a new generation. Her twin brother He-Man is nowhere to be found, and that's OK, because Adora/She-Ra (Aimee Carrero) effectively carries the narrative weight of the series on her mighty shoulders. Raised by the evil Horde and mentored by the villainess Shadow Weaver - Hordak's second-in-command - Adora was taught how to be a formidable soldier, hell-bent on conquering Etheria. The diabolical group's base of operations is located in the aptly named Fright Zone (which tells you everything you need to know) and the cyber-punk inspired animation effectively portrays the enemy's hideout, looking akin to something you might find in Blade Runner or an old Judge Dredd comic book. In contrast to the Fright Zone, the rest of Etheria has never been more imaginatively conceived, with brilliantly-colored animation that offers distinct terrain for each of the respective kingdoms. Once Adora discovers The Sword of Protection that transforms her into the warrior princess She-Ra, her journey takes her to a dazzling array of locales throughout Etheria, as she embarks on a quest to bring a group of magical princesses together, with the sole purpose of defeating her former allies, the Horde. Adora's complicated relationship with the Horde and her ex-best friend, Catra (AJ Michalka), is the show's emotional anchor. After Adora discovers that she can transform into She-Ra, she quickly (perhaps too quickly) leaves her life as an aspiring Force Captain in Hordak's army behind, preferring to spend time with her new good-guy friends: Glimmer, Bow, and Seahawk. Due to Adora's impulsive actions, Catra rightly feels betrayed, which is the catalyst for their compelling love/hate relationship. While Adora and Catra's dynamic is engaging, the warrior princess' sudden lifestyle change feels rushed, like we needed a few more episodes of her mentally wrestling with the implications of it all. Fortunately, the rest of the show's heroes receive the character development they deserve, with many of the princesses having entire episodes dedicated to their quirky, sassy, and often comedic, personas. A few standouts include Mermista (Vella Lovell), a water-wielder who acts like she's too cool for school, but harbors hidden depths. There's also Entrapta (Christine Woods), a tech-loving genius who favors machines over people, with a youthful exuberance and curiosity that's palpable. No princess feels like the other, which is a credit to the strong writing by creator Noelle Stevenson (DuckTales) and her team. The deep mythology surrounding She-Ra and her abilities is also enticing. Each 30-minute adventure delves deeper into the Masters of the Universe lore, leaving plenty of room for new storylines to explore if the series is picked up for a second season. Even the planet of Etheria feels like a fully fleshed-out character by the finale, but to reveal any details beyond that would risk spoilers. When the drama ramps up to ten, there are plenty of action-packed sequences that allow the princesses to show off their unique abilities in a thrilling way. Glimmer's teleportation and ~sparkle powers,~ mixed with Perfuma's ability to control the planet's flora, make for a dynamic duo against Hordak's war machine. It's comical (in a good way) to see these beautiful powers used as a means to decimate enemies. One of the show's shortcomings is evident in She-Ra's seemingly unparalleled strength, which often makes her seem more like One Punch Woman and robs the show of much of its suspense once Adora transforms. She-Ra can be out-smarted every now and then, but it's disappointing that the show doesn't provide her an equal match on the battlefield. Thankfully, the series' strong ensemble picks up this narrative slack, resulting in a solid debut for Adora and her comrades on Netflix. She-Ra and the Princesses of Power successfully reboots the 30-year-old franchise for a new generation, with a more diverse group of heroines this time around, each with their own distinct personalities and unique abilities on the battlefield. Adora could have used more time with the Horde to help develop her character further, but her complicated relationship with Catra is captivating.", "date": "Nov. 14, 2018,"}
