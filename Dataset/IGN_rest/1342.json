From tangling with the Hydra at the beginning of the first game to facing the Colossus of Rhodes to the more recent breathless, brutal battle against Poseidon in God of War III, Kratos first steps into a new adventure are never forgettable. So its somewhat surprising  and indeed disappointing  that the beginning of God of War Ascension kicks off with more of a muted hand-clap than the usual rib-shattering bang. Having broken a blood oath with the Gods, Kratos becomes the target for three demonic sisters known as The Furies. The opening fight against one Fury, Megaera, is essentially a string of small-scale scraps punctuated with the occasional QTE battle against bigger beasts. While it serves as a palatable introduction, it doesnt quite have the breathtaking scale and gut-punching action that GoW3 delivered in spades. Yes, youre fighting mythological beasts the size of a house, and that may sound pretty damn incredible, but after the Titan-felling intro from the last game, it doesnt impress in quite the same way. Thankfully the tempo ramps up quickly, and Ascension rapidly settles into the high-octane groove fans will be familiar with. Its business as usual when it comes to combat, and therefore, its as satisfying as ever. Weapon upgrades provide much-needed depth and variety without ever becoming overwhelming; so while its possible to punch and kick your way through most of the campaign using just a handful of basic moves, there are countless combo-strings to discover should you wish to experiment further. There have been tweaks to the combat however, with Kratos now only using the Blades of Chaos rather than discovering new weapons along the way. Its no great loss though, because instead variety comes as you imbibe different powers into the Blades along the way  the Fire of Ares torches enemies alive; Ice of Poseidon freezes foes; Lightning of Zeus delivers a vicious electric attack and the Soul of Hades calls upon the undead for help. Learning how to use each power effectively is another source of depth. For example, vaporise an enemy using lightning and youre rewarded with magic-restoring blue orbs; do the same with the Soul of Hades and green health-giving orbs are yours for the taking. Its a subtle but effective way of getting us to mix and match our attacks, but also provides a strategic lifeline when theres no energy re-gen chest nearby. There are secondary weapons, too  limited-use additions to your arsenal like the javelin, which is useful for ranged attacks, or the attack-blocking shield. While I found them useful in the early stages, they rapidly became superfluous as my Blades got upgraded. The magic system has changed slightly, too: super-powerful magic attacks are locked away much further down the weapon upgrade tree, meaning you cannot rely on them as heavily as you mightve done in previous games. Its a positive step because it really encourages you to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset. Often, its moments when Kratos is overwhelmed with enemies that magic provides his only lifeline. Difficulty throughout is, for the most part, balanced and well-considered. Checkpoints are in abundance and health chests are generously scattered around, so much so this is probably the easiest of all the God of War games overall. But at times Ascension takes challenge to the next level  not necessarily by making enemies tougher to kill, but by throwing so many bad guys on screen its hard to actually figure out whats going on. Dying in such situations feels cheap and frustrating. Then there's one section  the Trials of Archimedes  that will likely frustrate even the most skillful of players. Many of the crutches I'd relied upon earlier  the ability to save often or top off my energy  are suddenly pulled from under our feet, and the resulting chapter is tougher than anything Ive played in a God of War game before. Its not just that its hard  God of War games have always been tough, and a stiff challenge is something I relish whenever I spend more time with Kratos  but there are times when it actually feels unfair, because occasionally theres literally nothing you can do to avoid death. To put it into context, I spent just over nine hours getting to that point in the game, then six hours straight trying to beat wave after wave of enemies. Of course, its not impossible, and the sense of achievement I got from actually beating it is immense, but the fact its difficulty is so out of line with the rest of Ascension is strange. While hardcore God of War fans will no doubt lap up the challenge, for many it could be off-putting. Elsewhere, the story isnt as compelling as it has been in previous games. Kratos will always hold a special place in my heart, but second-string villains like the Furies dont quite cut it after youre used to going toe-to-toe with Zeus and Ares. Indeed, I didnt rally behind Kratos cause in quite the same way I did when it was him versus the Gods, and while the narrative is meticulously delivered  it always has been in God of War  the story felt a bit incidental. That's not helped by a relatively scarcity of ~Wow~ moments. Credit where it's due  there are occasions when the sheer scale of what I was looking at made my eyes pop, the finale is a spectacle Ill never forget, and Kratos fight through the Statue of Apollo is a real highlight. Now and then youll stand up and scream, This is exactly what a God of War game should be like, but these are often outweighed and outnumbered by the times when the action is by-the-numbers and feels like the same thing we've played countless times before. The same criticism cannot be aimed at Ascensions multiplayer, however. Its a genuinely fresh addition to the series that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player. Players align with one of four Gods, which gift them different abilities. Followers of Ares are all-out warriors, the minions of Hades favour stealth kills, and Zeus warriors are battle mages. The differences between each are subtle though, so rather than forcing you to completely change your play-style when switching allegiances its more a case of knowing your characters strengths and playing to them. Favour of the Gods is the most enjoyable of the modes on offer, with two teams going toe-to-toe to catch the eye of Olympus elite. Its essentially a high-score race, with points awarded capturing bases, opening chests, collecting valuable items, and of course killing your opponents. There are environment-specific items to play around with too, like the Spear of Olympus, which is the only way to kill off the Polyphemus Cyclops that plagues one of the maps  and in doing so awards your team a lot of points. While multiplayer has its moments, the combat doesnt really offer the depth to make it a truly engaging experience. Mastering the attack-block-parry system  which is the foundation on which combat is built  is at times rewarding, but too often battles revert into button-mashing scraps where skill is rarely rewarded. In fact, the only real way to prove your dominance in the multiplayer arena is through the countless unlocks and weapon upgrades available, but because XP is dished out so generously  simply finishing a match is enough to level up in the early stages  theres no real reason to experiment or play skilfully. As a result multiplayer feels more like a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition. THE VERDICT Unfortunately its a criticism that can be aimed at Ascension as a whole  its an enjoyable game, but one that doesnt quite live up to the pedigree of its predecessors. The story, which promised so much by revealing a more emotional side to Kratos, stumbles along and is so flimsy its almost incidental. The combat has been refined and is therefore as satisfying as ever, but the lack of any really memorable set-pieces  combined with its tiresome reliance on carbon copy battles against waves of exactly the same enemy  result in a game that is at times spectacular but all too often forgettable. Kratos fanatics will no doubt revel in the challenge it presents, especially the gruelling Trials of Archimedes, but theres no escaping the fact Ascension is the weakest in the series.", "date": "March 14, 2013"}
