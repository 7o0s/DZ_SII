Harley Quinn was voiced by Arleen Sorkin in that series, and Tara Strong has voiced Harley Quinn in subsequent projects. This reference has been omitted from the written version. We regret the error. Playing through LEGO DC Super-Villains, I couldnt help but make comparisons to 2016s Suicide Squad film. Whereas the critically-panned movie favored style over substance, LEGO DC Super-Villains is both stylish and jam-packed full of fun action. With a surprisingly engaging plot,a huge amount of variety, and enjoyable fan service there is a ton to love in Traveller's Tales latest LEGO game. What's more impressive, the longtime developer of LEGO games somehow figured out a way to, for the most part, keep things fresh. Of all mediums out there, comics have always had some of the best villains ever imagined with deep backstories and booming personalities so infectious that they often rival the very heroes theyre meant to foil. There can be no Batman without The Joker and no Superman without Lex Luthor. To carry on this legacy, LEGO DC Super-Villains draws from comics to put you in control of its massive roster of evil-doers from DCs multi-decade history of fantastic characters. Plus, for the first time ever, LEGO DC Super-Villains sticks your own custom creation at the center of the story. In LEGO DC Super-Villains the Justice League has officially gone missing. A mysterious group of Justice League-esque villains show up and call themselves the Justice Syndicate, but in actuality, theyre the reason for The Justice Leagues disappearance and theyre only here to assist Darkseid in his evil plans for obliteration. Similar to the plot of the Suicide Squad film, LEGO DC Super-Villains is all about teamwork in the face of disagreement and adversity, but this time it actually works better. It eschews the grimdark tone for something full of whimsical humor and fun gags to push the story along. LEGO DC Super-Villains has one of the best voice casts of any game in recent memory. In addition to Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Tara Strong reprising their iconic roles as Batman, The Joker, and Harley Quinn from Batman: The Animated Series respectively, Michael Ironside is back as Darkseid for the first time in over a decade, since his days voicing the character in Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League cartoons. In fact, even Nathan Drake voice actor Nolan North joins the cast to voice Ultraman, the Justice Syndicates alternate dimension version of Superman. The writing is excellent and this cast really elevates an otherwise by-the-numbers comic story into something special for the LEGO series. Your hand-crafted villain really is at the core of the story. While some other LEGO games have experimented with character creation a bit, in LEGO DC Super-Villains your hand-crafted villain really is at the core of the story. Your character is a silent protagonist (antagonist?) and consequently the frequent butt of jokes from Catwoman, The Joker, Harley Quinn, which evoked some genuine meta-level chuckles from me. You have a ton of power over your character's design, from how he or she looks cosmetically, to the supervillain powers that affect gameplay. My baddy, named Jagger, carries an axe and has glowy hands, because obviously. But if Id wanted, he could have just been in his underwear without any weapons or glowing hands, or no cape and a sword. The system is quite flexible because you can pick options inspired by existing villains, or create something from scratch. But if you dont care much about crafting your own custom rule-breaker, fear not: You won't be stuck with your creation the whole time. You can hold down a button to bring up character selection and switch to a collection of other villains on the fly. Character-swapping is something I used often both by choice and necessity. The Jokers powerful exploding pies and handguns are great fun, but sometimes I just wanted to roller skate around as Harley Quinn carrying a boombox, walloping enemies with her hammer because it made me smile. Pretending to be a good guy and playing as Nightwing is fine, but switching to Clayface and growing twice my size to clear a room is thrilling in its own way. Only certain characters have the ability to recruit henchmen to do their bidding, which is necessary to solve some puzzles. Many of LEGO DC Super Villains puzzles can only be solved by one or two characters, as indicated very clearly by character portraits above the puzzles. Unfortunately, puzzle solving is pretty shallow. When the solution to 90% of your puzzles is just do what you just tried to do, but with this character instead there really isnt much challenge there. Though the character selection helps keep things interesting, the combat in LEGO DC Super-Villains is simple and repetitive -- a longtime LEGO series problem. All of the over-160 characters look distinct but share the same basic melee-type attacks, area-of-effect-type attacks, and chargeable range attacks. The combat in LEGO DC Super-Villains is simple and repetitive. Like all other LEGO games, LEGO DC Super-Villains feels like it was created with kids in mind. Combat is simple, puzzles are easy, and the plot is relatively straightforward. Even the jokes are written so that a young child can keep up. That isnt to say it isnt good, but its just juvenile from top to bottom with little complexity. Since this is a game about playing as evil characters, youd expect them to do some pretty twisted things. Since its all kid-friendly and told through the lens of LEGO blocks, theres no actual mature content here that isnt softened by the LEGO presentation. For example, as a bad guy, the evil part of my GTA-trained brain engaged and got bloodthirsty. I got a kick out of watching police officers explode into a confetti of LEGO brick body parts and seeing pedestrians flail as I ran them over with their own stolen car. But it never jived well with the tone and style; it feels like a slight identity issue. For the most part, all of the things that would result in an M rating (wanton violence) is replaced with LEGO silliness. In this way, it feels like more of a LEGO game than a DC game which isnt necessarily bad but does come off as more of a presentation mismatch than in past LEGO games. Like LEGO Marvel Superheroes and LEGO Batman 2: DC Superheroes before it, LEGO DC Super-Villains is an open-world game with missions that like to whisk you away to segmented levels and interior destinations. You can explore both Gotham and Metropolis, as well as many iconic DC universe locations, as you complete missions and challenges all across the overworld. There are tons of collectibles to find, but I never felt much desire to go out of my way to find them. Brick collecting may appeal to fans hunting for Trophies or Achievements, but it feels like filler rather than anything meaningful this time around. Driving around the open world fun, and you can summon vehicles just as easily as you change characters if you dont feel like stealing something on the street. Co-op works great, like in previous LEGO adventures, and leads to some really fun team-ups that you wouldnt normally expect in any other official DC-branded content, such as Captain Cold and Wonder Woman adventuring together. It reminds me a bit of playing with action figures as a kid and imagining partnerships that Id never see on the big screen. If you enjoy DC heroes and villains as characters and dont mind the simplistic gameplay and kid-friendly tone, then you'll like LEGO DC Super-Villains's super-powered romp through Gotham and Metropolis. Other than the shift in focus to villains (greater and lesser), this doesnt reinvent the LEGO wheel. The massive list of playable characters doing LEGO things in big cities is a familiar formula, but the all-star voice cast helps elevate the story and action to make this a bit more than just kid-pandering fan service.", "date": "Oct. 18, 2018,"}
