After nearly two years, the mantra for Kinect has proven to be more like, The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Though the gamepad-free gaming device conjured up wondrous images of slick, gesture-driven, Minority Report-style user interfaces upon its introduction, its realities have borne far less ambition -- and even shoddier execution. Pioneering title Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor is a rare Kinect case where ambition is hardly the problem. Kinects first dedicated hybrid game -- meaning the camera works in concert with the Xbox 360 controller at all times -- puts you in the cockpit of a Vertical Tank (read: mech) in a near-future America where a silicon-eating virus has destroyed all of the worlds computers, leaving a global battle with a Korean superpower to be fought using low-tech, analog walking tanks. You pilot one of these VTs from the first-person perspective of silent protagonist Winfield Powers -- alongside the three crew members who also reside in the belly of your metallic beast. What dogs see when they look out through your front-door mail slot... Youll move the VT and fire its weapons systems entirely with the controller using typical first-person shooter controls, while Kinect gestures operate all of the tanks other bells and whistles. For example, extend both arms straight ahead to look out the slot-sized viewport (youll spend much of your time here); raise your right hand straight up to bring down the long-range periscope; extend one hand or the other to pull out either the left or right access panels, which let you check your external cameras and radar or activate the cockpit ventilation system; swipe in either direction to turn and interact with one of your crew members; or stand up to pop out of the top hatch and survey the battlefield. Truly, moving from classic Steel Battalions proprietary 100-button joystick system to one with virtually no physical inputs is a bold and equally outside-the-box move. (The irony, of course, is that Heavy Armor costs the same $200 as its cult-classic progenitor did if you combine the $150 price tag of Kinect with $50 for a copy of the game.) But while the impressive original was an impeccable, hardcore giant-robot sim that gained instant infamy for its amazing immersion-boosting control system, Heavy Armor is just plain hard -- though it too will probably live on in Xbox lore for all the wrong reasons. Why should your crew get to bail out when you're stuck here? Sit down, Natch! Woefully, Heavy Armor is, in practice, a nightmare in nearly all aspects. As weve unfortunately come to expect from most Kinect titles, the motion controls are terrible. If we so much as flinched on our couch, the game asked us to re-calibrate the Kinect sensor, and in the heat of battle we had constant issues both at home and in the office with accidentally closing the viewport hatch when we were trying to simply look out the view panel. Why did we constantly have to keep doing that? Because, in what is likely an attempt to simulate the guttural force of having your VT get rocked by a missile, youll be reset to the cockpit view every time youre hit, meaning youll have to scramble just to get back into a viewing angle where you can counterattack before youre killed. We'll be comin' round the mountain when we come... Kinect again frustrates when youre hit so hard that toxic smoke fills the cockpit. In order to vent it, you have to extend your right hand to grab the control panel, pull back to bring it out to where its accessible, then wave your hand around in the air again and hope you can successfully get a grip on the cord you need to yank in order to clear out the smoke before you choke and die. Instead, we were frequently hitting other buttons on that panel or, worse, unable to pull out the panel all the way at all. Believe it or not, however, Heavy Armors Kinect functionality isnt even the primary culprit of its numerous failings. If this were a controller-based game, it would still be atrocious. The mailslot-sized viewport boasts an old-school iron-sights aiming reticule, and in what we presume is a decision made in the name of simulating the low-tech nature of the VTs, its damn near impossible to hit anything at any range beyond point-blank (at which point youre usually toast) using either the machinegun or the missiles. That means youll spend an inordinate amount of time in the periscope. This becomes a problem when you get hit and have your periscope glass cracked and can no longer fire accurately, leaving you exactly zero precision targeting options. Select missions let you invite three friends to share in the pain with. Furthermore, were not sure we can recall worse examples of mission design than whats on offer here. One early stage tasks you with lying in wait to ambush a single enemy VT. You must stand up in your living room and peer out from your cockpit to do this, waiting over three real-life minutes (standing the entire time, and yes, we timed it) before finally being allowed to fire up your VT and take him out. And when you drop your lone target, the mission ends! But dont fail, because then youll have to do the whole thing over again. Another level has you shooting a few foes, then hopping out of your mech in a scripted sequence and using Kinect to literally pry intel from an allys cold, dead hand. Total mission time: approximately two minutes. Compounding matters, Heavy Armor is often very vague about what exactly your mission objectives are. Other stages are so painfully, brutally, frustratingly difficult -- a five-minute, timed race against the clock to destroy endless waves of bad guys and a freeway overpass fight against a virtually unstoppable super-mech are among the low-lights -- that we defy anyone to get through them without having the strong urge to shatter their controller and/or throw their Kinect out the window. The awful, inaccurate Kinect controls only make the bad situations worse, leaving Heavy Armor as a great idea fatally crippled by its own technical and design failings. CLOSING COMMENTS Heavy Armor might be Kinects most spectacular failure, but its precisely because its so ambitious. The game genuinely tries to go where Kinect has never gone before, not only attempting to build a hardcore game around the device, but fully committing to do so in an immersive way. That its so disappointing is due in large part to us genuinely wanting it to be fun and functional. Where so many Kinect games are wont to take the easy way out by slapping a few voice commands in there and calling it a Better With Kinect product, Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor deserves a lot of credit for sticking its neck out in an effort to craft a fresh videogame experience. Its one of the best ideas on Xbox this year, but ultimately its also one of the systems worst games. IGN RATINGS FOR STEEL BATTALION: HEAVY ARMOR (XBOX 360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 3.0 Presentation A World War II meets giant robots aesthetic -- though most of the time youre only viewing the world through a small rectangular hole or a cracked periscope lens. 4.0 Graphics Lousy character lip-synching pairs with graphics that are either too-dark or washed out most of the time. 5.0 Sound Hope you like profanity, because youll be hearing plenty of it from both your comrades and yourself. At least your pals have their own distinct personalities, however. 2.0 Gameplay Missions are either too short or too painful, and you cant even kick back on your couch because Kinect requires you to sit up straight -- when Kinect works at all, that is. 1.0 Lasting Appeal Good luck finishing the campaign without possessing a serious masochistic streak. Also, select missions are playable in four-player online co-op, but why share in this misery? 3.0 OVERALL Awful (out of 10)", "date": "June 19, 2012,"}
