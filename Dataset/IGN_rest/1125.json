{"name": "Daylight", "name_review": "Daylight Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/daylight-zombie-studios/24020/review/daylight-review", "text": "It took me three hours to finish Daylights randomly generated maze of horror. While two of those hours managed to be somewhat spooky, one was pure frustration, spent wandering aimlessly through hallways in first-person perspective, looking for a collectible item Id missed. In that time, the well-constructed atmosphere and story drained away and revealed Daylights true frame: a formulaic find-the-hidden-object game padded out with some meaningless crate puzzles. Whats scarier than being hunted in the dark? Being hunted in the dark and lost, thats what. Daylights abandoned hospital is a great horror environment, complete with powerfully unsettling creaks and whispers and groans, spontaneously moving objects, foreboding narration, and all the other trappings I expected from a quality horror game. Finding your way around by the light of a smartphone (which is also your minimap) gives it a nice contemporary touch, too, and it shows off some impressive lighting effects. The foundation is sound. But Daylight puts too much stock into its atmosphere, and neglects to actually do something to keep my attention and drive me forward. Because of a general lack of direction, which probably has something to do with the first halfs procedurally generated corridors, and a general lack of things to do except look for hidden items, it lost me early and never recovered. After running in circles for 20 minutes trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, the bad things were no longer scary. The enemies, called shadows, appear from nowhere and lurch toward you, mouths agape. Their design is creepy, but they dont even pose a threat in the early hours, and when they do they soon became little more than moving obstacles, easily chased away with the large number of flares littered throughout the world. Once my tolerance to their jump scares built up, they just werent frightening at all for the duration. Worse, the hospital is full of tedious box-pushing puzzles. Theyre so uninspired they felt like they only exist to keep you from seeing the credits roll in under two hours. To make progress in Daylight you have to find a number of remnants, which are well-written and sometimes genuinely creepy written tidbits or images that fill in the overall mystery. This is the main delivery method for the story, and piecing together the events that landed me here feels satisfyingly like putting together a puzzle. But theyre not enough of a reward to make the weak exploration and the frustrating search for the final pieces worthwhile. Even with the magic glow sticks that highlight interactive objects, scrounging around is a pain. Its a shame the earlier environments become so repetitive, because the forest areas toward the end are much better and more varied, and they make more sense within Daylights randomized design. In a maze of poorly lit gray corridors clues can be anywhere  nailed to walls or hidden in boxes  and I had to search every uninteresting corner to make sure I hadnt missed something. In the forest, they were generally stashed in places that made sense, generally in one of the broken-down buildings. That kept me moving at a more enjoyable pace. It moved along so fast, in fact, that when I finished I didnt feel like I was anywhere near the ending. Thats a disappointment, because I was ready to play more once the level design opened up. The ending itself is a satisfactory horror-story twist that didnt blow my mind, but does make sense. That brings up a question: a big part of Daylights appeal was supposed to be that its procedural generation would inspire replayability, but without lasting horror or events that make use of the shifting environment in interesting ways, whats the point in playing it again? I saw all I needed to see the first time through, and the second time didnt even have the fear of the unknown going for it. Pros Scary atmosphereStory fragments Cons Corridors look the sameTedious box puzzlesWeak enemies Daylight has a good foundation of scary atmosphere and interesting bits of story. All of that is squandered by the first half, where poor level design, unnecessary box-pushing puzzles, and impotent enemies deflate the scares before it even gets going. By the time I reached the more interesting second act, Id grown immune to its tricks and could only see it as a mediocre series of fetch quests.<br/><Br/> <em>Editors Note: Two former IGN employees worked on Daylights development.
