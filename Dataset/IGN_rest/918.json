In fact, this mildly entertaining Witcher universe offshoot is a faithful translation of the tabletop board game of the same name by Fantasy Flight Games; its all dice-rolling and card-flipping instead of sword fighting and puzzle-solving. Designed for board-game purists, its a no-frills, repetitive experience that offers just a brief diversion during the wait for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Getting into a game can be a challenge for newcomers to tabletop gaming. A collection of tutorial videos shows how to play and a glossary defines the rules, but an interactive tutorial wouldve been much handier in understanding the nuances of gameplay and the differences between the four playable characters: Geralt, the Witchers eponymous monster-slayer; Triss Merigold, the sorceress; Yarpen Zigrin, the dwarven warrior; and Dandelion, the roguish bard. While it supports up to four players in online play, the great news is that it also allows CPU-controlled opponents to fill out the extra spots online or offline - a much-needed feature for when the number of online players is slim. Theres not a lot of variety to gameplay, though. At the start of a match, each player selects their main quest from two randomly selected quest cards. (The winner is whoever is first to complete either one, three, or five main quests, depending on the setting selected.) Though theres some story flavor text outlining the main quest, and the optional support and side-quests, completing a main quest always comes down to having a set number of red, blue, or purple points and traveling to a particular city. These simplistic main quests tend to be interchangeable; all that differs is the city and the number and color of points. Strategy lies in choosing how to accumulate points, whether by selecting to Investigate (drawing an investigation card may assign tasks, traits, combat scenarios, or bonuses/setbacks) or Develop (drawing a development card usually gives a card to augment your dice throws in combat). It feels more like youre playing alongside the other characters rather than truly against them, though. Most cards only negatively affect other players (and usually you as well) by luck of the draw rather than conscious effort, so winning a match becomes little more than a race to clear quests as quickly as possible. Admittedly, that could describe a bajillion other board games on the planet, but Id hoped that the competition in The Witcher Adventure Gamewould be as brutal as its namesake. The digital version of The Witcher Adventure Game is strikingly faithful to the tabletop experience, which is admirable in a purist sort of way, but I was a bit disappointed that it doesnt leverage the medium to make the presentation more exciting. For example, when confronted by a monster at the end of a turn, the only monster you see is the one that appears as a drawing on the card, and there is no graphic depiction of your triumph or defeat at its claws. Click on the card and all that happens is a handful of dice drop across the screen, revealing your fate. The board itself does offer a few nice visual animations that you wont see in the tabletop version, though, like rain and snow effects, smoking chimneys, and rustling leaves. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is appropriately stirring, conveying the epic fantasy gravitas of its setting. The grandiose dom-DOM that closes out each turn implies something big has just happened -- even when all you did was rest to heal your wounds. Given how long matches can go when four players are competing to win five quests (roughly two hours or more), the most frustrating thing about how faithful this adaptation is may be that you cant fast-forward through computerized players turns. No, you have to sit and wait while the computer thinks, draws cards, and throws dice. Some may enjoy seeing how each hero handles their turns, but I wouldve preferred an option to get on with it. I can do without the extra dom-DOMs. Pros Smart AI opponentsFaithful tabletop experience Cons Repetitive questsLittle player interactionFew bells/whistles The Witcher Adventure Game is a faithful (perhaps too faithful) translation of a mildly fun tabletop experience saddled with simplistic, repetitive objectives. Learning the strategies behind playing each of the four heroes is where the fun lies, though it often feels like youre just playing alongside other players - not against them. It doesnt try to be more than a digital board game, either, so if youre hoping for outrageous battle scenes and visual splendor, its best to hold out for The Witcher 3.", "date": "Dec. 18, 2014,"}
