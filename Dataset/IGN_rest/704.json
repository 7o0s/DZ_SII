{"name": "Mad Max", "name_review": "Mad Max Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/mad-max/110975/review/mad-max-review", "text": "At its core, Mad Max is a game about the death of hope. Its about learning to find something to cling to in a pointless existence of murder and regret, and then watching it turn to ash in your hands. But that kernel of anguish is buried deep down in an adventure that demands to be explored through sheepish smiles and wide-eyed amazement as each combustive, sickening, and awesome moment of Maxs warpath consumes every foot of wasteland. But for Max, the reluctant hero, the wasteland is something to escape. Hes lost his car and nearly his life at the hands of Scabrous Scrotus, the resident Warlord of the refinery-city Gas Town. Fortunately, the deformed, sun-soaked blackfinger, Chumbucket, sees Max as the ordained prophet of his car-based religion, sent from the Angel of Combustion to help build and drive the Magnum Opus - the greatest vehicle the wasteland will ever know. Wasteland Wares For all this engaging premise, most of the traditional storytelling disappears until the near-end, when it ultimately, surprisingly succeeds. By the closing credits, I had a genuine reaction to Avalanches tale of Max, but I wish more of it had been peppered throughout my 30-40 hours of play time. Yet in the space between the premise and climax, Max is about your progression and domination of a world full of striking, ugly beauty, and incredible atmosphere. Nearly everything and everyone youll meet fits the purpose and lore of the wasteland; its alive with personality and indifference. And it may be the true star of Mad Max, despite the unsteady frame rate, texture popping, and physics quirkiness. If not the wasteland, then the excellent layers of systems that drive Mad Maxs gameplay are the real draw. Its progression mechanisms urge you to complete an exhaustive list of challenges to increase your Legend, which you cash in with Griffa  a sort of wasteland therapist  to increase base attributes. But youll also collect Scrap  the wastelands currency  to upgrade individual pieces of armor, weapons, tools, combat moves, and even Maxs look. And thats all just Max. The same attention is offered to the Magnum Opus - where youll literally build the car from scrap and purchase things like nitro boosters, a harpoon, explosive javelins, spikes, armor, tires, and even side-mounted flame cannons. You are always earning something that directly changes your experience, and its incredibly rewarding. And fortunately, for us, the players who visit this violent husk of a world, leaving our treadmarks on its scorched earth and igniting all we touch, there are many, many things to do. In the lengthy process of wrestling control of the wasteland from its brutal, established warlords, youll destroy their refineries, kill their Top Dogs, burn their fuel depots, and topple their gruesome intimidation totems. All of these activities are great, and engaging in their own right, but they begin to suffer from diminishing returns as their rinse/repeat nature sinks in down the stretch. The Road Warrior But Mad Maxs combat is the great promise at each of these destinations. Both behind the wheel and on foot, theres an exciting flourish to the familiar feel that comes with murdering the roaming war parties of the Roadkill, Buzzard, and Scrotus War Boy factions. Melee combat is an instantly recognizable, absolutely brutal dance of attacks and timed-counters, though some added depth can be found in the addition of weapons, executions, chain attacks, and Fury Mode  Maxs bloodlust that turns him into a one-man wrecking crew. Vehicle combat is a high-speed gnashing of metal and the best part of Mad Maxs overflowing action. Ramming and sideswiping, using your harpoon to pull armor, wheels, and even drivers from enemy vehicles, or detonating exposed fuel drums with your gun blast - theres simply no shortage of creative ways to annihilate on the road. And thats necessary, as random patrols strike quickly, and the hulking convoys of wasteland machines that snake through dirt roads are challenging, but well worth the effort to take down. Pros Gorgeous SandboxHonest, Savage ToneCathartic Combat Cons Visual IrregularitiesRepetitive Objectives Mad Max is a juxtaposition of exciting, thrilling fun set in a world of disgusting, primal depravity  like a singing telegram informing you of a death in the family, or an ice-cream cake with your terminal test results written in frosting. Its a conflicting place of despair, a personal playground of explosive action and compulsive, unending progression that I cant wait to get back to, and one hell of a ride.", "date": "Sept. 1, 2015,"}
