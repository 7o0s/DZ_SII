We continue to be impressed by amazing games through the service, offering incredibly deep gameplay and lush aesthetic at a huge value. Therefore, it's increasingly sad to see a game hit XBLA that simply misses the mark, shooting for retail levels of production and detail, but falling well short of a fun and engaging experience. Bloodforge is one such game. Bloodforge in action. Bloodforge casts you in the ever-shouting role of Crom, a Celtic warrior seeking revenge on those responsible for him having murdered his own wife. If this premise sounds familiar it's because God of War did the same thing years ago. Crom opts to shout almost everything he says in lieu of showcasing any real type of growth or development as the story progresses, and even with a ~twist~ or two thrown in towards the end, the ~been there, done that~ plot underwhelms during its brief three to four hour running time. Bloodforge nails a striking art design and looks very good doing it. The environments are nicely varied, and the game's use of desaturated colors, coupled with copious amounts of red (from bloodletting, naturally), give it an interesting graphic novel look. The character models sport a fine amount of detail as well, even if the standard enemies recycle a bit too much. Unfortunately, Bloodforge's camera is simply atrocious, ranking as one of the worst seen in a long time. Never mind its incessant, seasick wobble as Crom runs from one place to another; once you get into to battle the camera runs the gamut of obstructive and cumbersome to downright worthless. It's constantly getting caught up on environmental objects (even when they're not directly in the way). Any goodwill offered by Bloodforge's interesting art design and graphics is all but dashed by horrible camera issues. There will be blood. If you've played a third-person action game within the past decade, you've likely touched upon every gameplay mechanic in Bloodforge. From the collection of items and power-ups and weapon/magic upgrades to the structure of isolated skirmishes, it's all been done ad nauseam (and better) by other games in the genre. The boss battles could've been some of the game's most exciting elements, with cool looking bosses that unfortunately devolve into ~beat me up for a little bit, then kill off the four or five enemies I throw at you~ affairs. The controls lack the finesse and smooth feel of other actioners as well. To be sure, Crom is a mass of muscle clearly meant to take and dish out damage, but Bloodforge lacks a block function. This means Crom has to be much more nimble on his feet than Bloodforge actually allows. Your evade move doesn't evade very well at all, and a brief delay after dodging will, more often than not, leave you wide open for a second attack, and can make some of the more concentrated battles very frustrating. The boss battles have potential, but are far too repetitive. Bloodforge's attempt at any longevity outside its brief story mode is the ability to repeat stages in order to earn better scores for facing off with your friends on leaderboards. However, considering the lackluster gameplay involved, chances are one playthrough will be more than enough. Additionally, you can issue challenges to your friends through a Horde-style series of wave-based challenges. As you complete each wave, you'll be able to add in another modifier either making the subsequent wave easier or more difficult. Once you've completed the series of waves, you can then challenge your buddy to do the same. Unfortunately, as interesting as this may seem, it falls prey to the lousy gameplay and dismal camera that both of you will be dealing with. Additionally, there's a Blood Duel feature that compares the amount of blood spilled by you and your friends for each completed stage. The bar increases the more times you revisit a stage and shed more blood, and you can compare your performance against your friends; it's a gimmicky feature, and not one that really adds much to the gameplay. CLOSING COMMENTS While it gets props for an interesting visual style and graphics, Bloodforge also brings with it an awful camera, weak story, and extremely derivative gameplay. Bloodforges gameplay never strives to attain more than me too status, bringing nothing new or interesting to the table. At only 1200 Microsoft Points, its fair to say that Bloodforge simply isnt trying to compete against the likes of God of War, Darksiders, or any number of the fully-priced retail third-person action games that its aping. Still, considering how Xbox LIVE Arcade is chockfull of amazing gameplay experiences like Trials HD, Fez, Shadow Complex, and more, its very difficult to recommend Bloodforge to anyone at any price.
