Timing is everything as I glide along a futuristic track, soaring through the air at a breakneck speed and swerving to avoid collision with the tracks walls. My eyes are constantly focused on whats rapidly approaching in the foreground. I veer right. I edge slightly left. Meanwhile, the scenery around my vehicle rushes past, making it difficult to even see the other racers on the track until Im right on top of them. Its a tense racing game, one that thrills while simultaneously mounting a great deal of stress on the player. In order to win, youll have to manage the vehicles movement, collect orbs to fill your boost meter, and  perhaps the most unique mechanic  switch the engine color between orange and blue to match the quickly approaching boost pads scattered strategically around the track. For its strengths, however, NEO still feels a tad sterile thanks to a lack of customization options, and its difficulty is not at all friendly. The Blink of an Eye As I progress through the different circuits, Fast Racing Neo goes from challenging to brutally difficult. Opponent AI gradually grows smarter, the speed almost doubles, and the margin of error shrinks to a thin, unforgiving sliver. Youll have to complete a near-perfect run in order to take first, and the smallest mistake  be it a missed boost pad, bumping into the wall, or hitting an obstruction  is the difference between first place and dead last. In order to achieve success, its absolutely necessary to play through circuits multiple times in order to memorize the tracks and embed the movements deep into your muscle memory. Its only when you know the layout of the track well that you can start to fully capitalize on the advanced boosting and handling functionalities offered. This demand of skill and patience often toes the line between satisfying and maddening, almost daring a player to take the skills theyve honed and return to try again, and again, and again. I had to virtually memorize every part of a track from the twists and turns to the location of boost pads to fine-tune my timing and reaction properly. Executing a flawless run feels fantastic, but it only slightly eases the pain of ten failed attempts from before. A bit of leniency on the part of the AI - especially in the opening difficulty - would make it slightly more palatable and allow for a player to better internalize the mechanics. Pedigree of Speed Fast Racing Neo apes ideas from the classic Nintendo racing series F-Zero, but injects enough difference to retain its own personality. The sleek, futuristic design of the 16 tracks are coupled with a variety of settings, including a snowy forest, bubbling lava pits, industrial yards, and a deep cityscape resembling the Star Wars planet Coruscant. Each setting provides thematically appropriate challenges and advantages, be it alternate routes, massive ice formations blocking the way, and frequent gaps in the track sending a racer airborne. The variety keeps it visually interesting and offers tactical options in every race. NEOs audio and visual design form an impressive production, a credit to attention paid to the smallest detail. Bursts of blurred color surround vehicles mid-boost, bumping into barriers causes the screen to violently shake, orbs make pleasant dings when collected, and a snarky announcer coupled with a throbbing, intense soundtrack give it a pleasing feel not unlike classic 3D racing games found in arcades. Unfortunately, it wont take long to see all Fast Racing NEO has to offer. The vehicles have a great design and unique look for each selection, but there are only a handful of them to unlock and I rarely found any noticeable differences between how each handled. More stats on vehicles beyond acceleration and top speed might have facilitated a wider variety of play styles, but as is, there are scant few ways for players to personalize their vehicle and overall experience. The same could be said of the actual racing, which is somewhat plagued by a dearth of options. Additional modes and options beyond career circuits, time trials, and an ultra-fast mirrored circuit called Hero Mode are very apparent in their absence, and once youve dug through the core circuits, theres not much left enticing players to return. Pros Great visual designSatisfying challengeUnique color-changing mechanic Cons Limited customization optionsVehicles feel too samey Fast Racing Neo is a grueling, rewarding racer. The temptation to chuck a controller across the room after instantly jumping from first to last will likely strike a handful of times, and it's a bit thin on customization options, but when all of its high notes line up, Fast Racing Neo is an exhilarating, devilishly grueling game that absolutely pulses with energy.", "date": "Jan. 5, 2016,"}
