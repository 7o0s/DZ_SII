Then again, while that mechanic is novel, it doesn't always play out quite as planned. Super Time Force isn't only about shooting bad guys, but about manipulating the very fabric of spacetime. You're given 30 lives per stage and are ultimately encouraged to die, die, and die again, because here, lives simply aren't that precious. What's more important is speed. You only have 60 seconds to get through each level, and maximizing not only time spent -- but lives used -- is the name of the game. You simply can't play Super Time Force in a conventional way. You really need to use your noggin, something about the experience of playing it that I adored. You may have died, but now you can be saved in an alternate timeline! The beauty of ripping back and forth through time while creating persistent copies of yourself is how it allows you to reinforce what you've already done while rectifying unfortunate mistakes. The way the different characters play and combine with each other adds a thick layer of strategy. You could, for instance, have Jean Rambois take down aerial foes with his spread shot, while Aimy McKillin takes rows of ground-based enemies out from behind the safety of Shieldy Blockersons bubble shield. This is part of Super Time Force's beauty. With over a dozen characters with unique abilities -- most of them totally hidden and up to you to find -- the combinations are seemingly (though not literally) endless. Unfortunately, this system -- while different and enjoyable -- can also be overly chaotic and utterly frustrating. I had moments of complete elation, like shaving seconds off of my time with some clever rewinding and reworking, or figuring out some new, epic combination of characters that did exactly what I needed them to do. But there were other moments where I would respawn into bullets without realizing it or run into an enemy after a split-second of being on-screen. Chaos is in Super Time Force's blood, and it's unfortunate how it inherently conflicts with being able to play it cleanly. Unlike so many old-school classics, Super Time Force lacks something very significant: elegance. You can play it astutely -- in fact, you pretty much have to -- but you'll be hard-pressed to play it elegantly. I was never in danger of failing or of not being able to proceed; all I needed to do was rewind, spawn more characters, and force my way through, one way or another. This speaks to a somewhat optional component of Super Time Force, which allows you to get through the game in an incredible number of ways. It's a short, largely non-linear affair -- its six primary worlds can be played in any order, Mega Man style, and it won't take more than three hours total to beat -- but you can always backtrack to bring new characters into the mix to see if a new technique will work better than an older one. There's real depth here if you want to find it, but the challenge comes more from increasing your speed and narrowing your runtime, which will surely appeal to speedrunners, but certainly not gamers that like to do things at their own pace. A battle against time to make use of your mind. I thoroughly enjoyed Super Time Force's zany sense of humor and cast of characters, like main antagonist Dr. Infinity, who half-heartedly hides his identity by holding a tablet over his face, or Colonel Repeatski, who wears not one, but two eye patches. The dialogue is also pleasantly corny, and the plot is full of enough time travel-related paradoxes to make Stephen Hawkings' head spin. It's clear that developer Capy Games doesn't want you to walk away with even the slightest feeling that something in Super Time Force -- anything at all -- is actually serious. And that's a good thing. Pros Great conceptFantastic charactersSilly story Cons Uneven gameplayOccasionally frustrating I enjoyed playing Super Time Force. It was refreshing to experience something truly different, even in the well-worn territory of the old-school. I was especially impressed by its dedication to its strange and novel mechanic, one that makes it so much more than yet another retro-inspired side-scroller. Still, Super Time Force's strength is also its weakness, and the chaos inherent in its time traveling mechanics caused its share of unavoidable frustration. Throughout the three hour campaign, I was never able to develop a rhythm without finding something to be annoyed at, even after playing parts of it a second time. I love what it's trying to do -- and I'd recommend playing it -- but I also can't help but wonder if it's everything it could have been. In fact, I'm certain that it isn't.", "date": "May 15, 2014,"}
