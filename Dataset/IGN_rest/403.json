South Parks brief, random hiatus last week wound up coming at a really fortuitous time. This season has focused a great deal of attention on the civil war between the boys and girls at South Park Elementary, as the girls cry out against online harassment and the boys firs back with the South Park equivalent of #NotAllMen. But now, with that infamous Donald Trump tape leaking last week, suddenly this storyline feels all the more relevant. It serves as yet another reminder that South Park is at its best when it manages to be timely without tying itself too specifically to any one news item or controversy. The show avoided any direct references to the Presidential election this week (suggesting all the more that Trey Parker and Matt Stone simply arent interested in trying to compete with real life). Instead, Wieners Out divided its focus between the worsening situation at the school and Geralds struggle to leave Skankhunt42 behind him. That narrower focus alone helped give this episode a sense of structure thats sometimes been lacking this season. Im hard-pressed to think of any other show on basic cable that could get away with having a group of ten-year-old boys flaunt their genitals. Probably, the shows crude animation style is the only reason this episode made it through Comedy Centrals approval process. Its certainly nice to know that after 20 years, Parker and Stone can still find ways to be shockingly inappropriate. It was funny to see the situation at South Park Elementary take such a bizarre turn. It was funnier still that Butters of all people was the one to instigate the Wieners Out movement. He might be slow to anger, but Butters knows how to stir up some trouble when the situation calls for it. I also enjoyed the PC Principal scene this week. Its good that the character has such a small role relative to last season, but his aggressive tolerance still has some mileage to it. His explanation that hes trapped in a PC pretzel was amusing, and it promises further escalation to come in the weeks ahead. Cartman is the only one who knows how to treat a lady. Surprisingly, Cartman is proving to be the real weak link this season. Following his tragic social media death Cartman has morphed into a surprisingly well-adjusted young man, complete with a loving relationship and a newfound optimism in the future of mankind. As weird as it is seeing this kinder, gentler Cartman last for several episodes, the novelty factor has pretty much worn off. The Cartman scenes arent really that entertaining, and whatever show is bound to drop with the character needs to happen soon. While the girls vs. boys storyline had ample shock value going for it, Geralds story was the highlight of this episode. Here we saw him struggle to live a life without trolling. It seems abusing women online was the only thing keeping him sane in his day-to-day life. It was hilarious to watch Geralds situation gradually deteriorate, first as he tried to find solace in a Member Berries support group and then when he accidentally roped his wife into a golden shower session. The shot of Kyle and Ike staring in horror at their parents will probably go down in history as one of the best moments of this season. In the end, Gerald couldnt leave his trolling ways behind. And now hes been roped into a bizarre conflict where he and his fellow trolls (a group that includes the gamer from Make Love, Not Warcraft and the obligatory Anonymous member) are fighting against the Danish government and its high-tech new anti-troll website. This entire trolling plotline has been shaping up nicely so far, and it looks like its about to get a whole lot bigger as the season unfolds. Overall, this was a pretty cohesive episode that managed to feel timely without leaning too heavily on any particular news item. However, this season continues to suffer a bit from the overemphasis on continuity. Theres such a direct flow from one episode to the next that it really feels more like watching chunks of a longer movie than episodes of a show. As great as it is to see these episodes continually build on each other and reference whats come before, it would be nice to see each one develop its own identity. South Park still seems to be finding its voice in Season 20. ~Wieners Out~ made some crucial steps as it narrowed the focus to two main storylines and combined a gleefully inappropriate protest movement with a look at Gerald's rapidly deteriorating life. This season's critique of social media culture feels more relevant every week, but there remains a uniformity to every episode that's a little troubling.", "date": "Oct. 13, 2016,"}
