Like previous Telltale Walking Dead series, Michonnes first episode highlights the horrors of both walkers and people. This time around, however, the focus is almost entirely on Michonne herself, and while that works well, my confidence in the larger storys long-term potential suffers as a result. Despite plot shortfalls, though, this is a tense, well-paced introduction to one of my favorite characters in the series. The episode opens strong, with a powerful look at the source of Michonnes pain and how she copes with it. Shes running from past trauma, distractedly killing walkers, almost as if they arent there. Its haunting, and it drew me in immediately. Her suffering does not make her weak, but being good at killing walkers doesnt make her strong, either. Instead, staying busy and distracting herself keeps her from falling apart, and that makes her more interesting than someone whos just good at surviving. Her struggle with PTSD symptoms and how she deals with them is the most impactful part of the episode. She sees the ghosts of the people shes lost everywhere, and how she reacts to that trauma is handled well and respectfully  she doesnt seem silly or like shes overreacting, even though the people around her are confused by her outbursts. Seeing the almost too-familiar world of The Walking Dead through Michonnes eyes keeps it from getting stale, since I genuinely care about her story. The overall plot that begins in this episode, however, isnt terribly unique, especially by Walking Dead standards. The antagonists are the typical morally dubious leaders of a makeshift settlement, and everyones a little messed up from the whole apocalypse thing. Randall in particular is over-the-top evil, and although it sort of seems like a setup for an important reveal later, its also not new. It's tired, and The Walking Dead has done all of this better before. Additionally, Michonne basically carries the entire episode herself, though she does it well. Talking to each of the other main characters generally serves one purpose: furthering Michonnes captivating development. Interactions with Pete, her more optimistic companion, feel the most important, since his undying compassion in a bleak world helps to reveal that her own still exists. While Pete himself isnt necessarily flat, and neither were most of the other characters, I only cared about them as much as they affected Michonne. Though the typical Telltale-style quick time event combat can be as awkward as ever, the fights they initiate are wonderfully choreographed and visually striking. Having to react quickly in fights kept me invested for the full hour and a half, beginning with Michonne seamlessly slipping between reality and her traumatic memories as shes fighting walkers. Point-and-click exploration provides a respite from intense zombie scenes, and this episode is paced so that it remains suspenseful throughout. Pros MichonneFight sequencesPacing Cons Bland storyLimited characters True to its title, The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1 is all about one character, somewhat to the detriment of the story and other characters. Michonne is so well done, though, from her impressive survival skills to the hollow look in her eyes, that she easily carries the entire episode. Even though I wasnt invested in the story, I did care about Michonne  everything she said, every walker she killed, and what will happen to her moving forward.", "date": "Feb. 23, 2016,"}
