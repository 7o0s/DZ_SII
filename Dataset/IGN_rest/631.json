Its a much better example of how a story-driven Minecraft adventure can deliver family-friendly thrills than the disappointing Episode 2. Watch the first minutes of Episode 3 above. Things start off with a bang, thanks to the lengthy opening credits serving as one giant interactive action sequence where Jesse and the gang must fight their way through a group of enemies to avoid being caught in a giant monster grinder. Although The Last Place You Look contains a couple of decent puzzles, this action emphasis continues throughout the episode. An underwater escape, multiple tense encounters with Minecrafts always-creepy Endermen, and a climactic encounter with Story Modes big baddie are just a few of the action sequences included. Action for Action's Sake Although I applaud Episode 3 for giving us more to do, the button-prompt quick time events themselves remain so-so. There isnt any consistency into which button corresponds to which action - attack, jump, or any other scripted action can be mapped to any face button or trigger seemingly at random. Story Modes forgiving difficulty - you can fail one or two button prompts and your character will still succeed on-screen, with only repeated failures resulting in a game over screen - also contributes to the the overall unsatisfying feeling of much of the action. It feels loose and a little random. Still, letting us participate in the on-screen drama is always preferable to passively absorbing it for minutes at a time, with no need to touch the controller. Thankfully, with one notable exception, Episode 3s storytelling bounces back from Episode 2s lows. Its funnier, thanks in large part to the introduction of the eccentric, hermit-like Soren. Sorens obsession with Endermen and inability to talk to people without making things super awkward quickly made him my favorite member of The Order of the Stone. Most of the dramatic turns, including one particular moment at the episodes close, also kept me invested. Jesses super cool / semi-rival friend Lukas feels like he was written by an entirely different team in this episode, though. The change in tone was so abrupt and extreme that it made me feel like I was missing something. Why is he suddenly acting like a completely different person? Is it a weird side-effect of Telltales branching storylines rejoining in a weird way? Im not sure. But a lot of Episode 3 revolves around this interpersonal drama, and in my story it seems to come out of nowhere. Lukass behavior might have left me scratching my head, but solid character moments with Petra and even your pet pig Reuben make up for this oddness. The Last Place You Looks excellent pacing makes it tough to dwell on these concerns for long, thankfully. It introduces and resolves episode-specific obstacles, almost all involving Endermen, to great effect, while deftly balancing and advancing the over-arching story at the same time. Its an impressive balancing act. And as always, Story Modes sets remain a highlight. The massive monster grinder and Sorens impressive constructions made the Minecraft fan in me marvel at their size and complexity. Pros Lots of actionSolid laughsSurprising storySuper creepy Endermen Cons Out-of-Character moments The Last Place You Look effectively gets Story Mode back on track. The action, humor, and drama are all improved, and Story Mode continues to use Minecraft elements like mob grinders and Endermen to great effect. More improvements need to be made for Story Mode to be considered one of Telltales greats, but for now it is moving in the right direction.", "date": "Nov. 26, 2015,"}
