Its not to say it hasnt been successful with taking on trending modes and mechanics, like when Treyarchs Black Ops 4 ditched the campaign and introduced an amazing battle royale mode. This year, though, Infinity Ward pulls from its own history for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. And as a result, its delivered excellent gunplay to pair with an intense and effective campaign and a fantastic weapon customization system in multiplayer. Something it didnt learn, though, is that even a great arsenal cant make up for poor map design, especially when theres such a limited selection available at launch. Missteps in multiplayer and Spec Ops are like suppression fire that keep Modern Warfare from taking the high ground of its classic namesake, but everything else suggests that the series is now heading in a promising direction. Weve done separate, in-depth reviews for the single-player campaign and multiplayer. Heres what Ryan McCaffrey said about this years Call of Duty campaign in his review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Single-player Campaign Review As someone whos played every single Call of Duty campaign and really missed it last year, the new Modern Warfare is exactly the kind of single-player revival Ive been looking for. It introduces welcome new kinds of gameplay moments while executing familiar ones exceptionally well. Sure, its story may not be as provocative as it seems to want to be, but it reestablishes a strong identity for this 16-year-old franchise with a showcase solo shooter experience. Amidst a growing pile of battle royales and looter shooters that just dont scratch that same itchy trigger finger, it felt just like old times. Score: 8.2 You can read Ryans full review of the campaign here. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Multiplayer Review Call of Duty: Modern Warfares scaled-up version of Ground War is a chaotic good time, and Realism quiets things down a bit to present a uniquely delightful challenge. The rest of Modern Warfare's multiplayer ranges from great additions like Gunfight and its in-depth weapon customization, to mediocre with modes like Spec Ops. Across most of them, unfortunately, mediocre maps make spawn camping a frustrating problem and escaping the ones where you know you'll have a bad time is more challenging with removed map voting. But there sure is a lot to do in Modern Warfare, and that variety is important to keep things feeling fresh after the occasional unexpected low points.
