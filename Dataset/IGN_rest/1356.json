It strives for chaotic combat in a lawless world ruled by violent brutes. In that respect, it largely succeeds, but it comes at the expense of the freedom Anarchy Reigns initially presents  at first, it carries itself as an open-world action game ruled by chaos, but slowly reveals its farce. As a result, the restrictive, repetitive campaign gets in the way of a multiplayer engineered for the skilled and patient. Anarchy Reigns narrows its appeal at every turn, leaving a small, specific audience to enjoy what will likely make the less patient players blood boil in frustration. At its core, Anarchy Reigns is a third-person brawler where the multiplayer comes first and the single-player suffers for it. The multiplayer characters that make the online mode interesting sit locked behind the single-player story, creating a vicious cycle  youll want Anarchy Reigns for its multiplayer, but cant make the most of it without suffering through its two solo campaigns, each telling the same empty find-a-guy story from two perspectives. But Ill get to that. Anarchy Reigns fist-fighting is at its best online. Multiplayer is the main draw, and it makes the most of its simple yet satisfying and varied combat. The input is the same for each of the 16 playable characters, but their outputs vary by their distinct weapons and fighting styles, so even the basic commands feel different depending on which brawler youre using. Air combos and evasive techniques flesh out the combos, special weapons, and specialty items (rockets, mines) to add complexity thats simply not necessary in the Dynasty Warriors-levels-of-mindless campaign encounters. Familiar multiplayer concepts like capture the flag and American football (yes, really) work surprisingly well when applied to the brawler framework. Without guns, taking down a flag carrier means getting close to someone wielding a large metal stick. Closing gaps and distracting defenders lends known (if slightly more murderous) tactics to Deathball. The decent football variant comes with one annoying quirk: The end zone doesnt open until youve maintained control of the ball for an extended period of time, meaning you can miss out on points even after a perfect interception. These shake up the all-out battle royale of cage fights and team deathmatch. The madness of 16 players punishing each other with various weapons and area-of-effect attacks can be overwhelming, and definitely aggravating if youre caught in an enemy or twos combo you cant block or escape. Although that kind of chaos is largely responsible for what makes Anarchy Reigns interesting. These dudes are lame story characters, but great fighters. The smartest thing about Anarchy Reigns is its unpredictable variables, but the anarchy of it all is as much of an annoyance as an asset. Out-of-control trucks smashing through the world, planes crashing, bridges exploding, and enemy A.I. spawning keep you on your toes during multiplayer matches. These random events contribute additional layers to whichever modes they crop up in, encouraging you to be more aware of your surroundings, defend more, or use their destructive force to your advantage. On the downside of this madness, the camera here struggles to keep up during battle, and often spins out of control at awkward moments. The special effects can cause confusion too  the particle effects look awful, and when theres a lot of gushing water or fiery explosions, the framerate can drop severely. All this occurs during the campaign, too, but because the world is hollow the effect isnt as significant. Online, where people are smashing, cutting, exploding, throwing, and suplexing each other, it creates moments more memorable than anything youll see in the entire single-player story, which unfolds in a bothersome way. Points access missions, and missions are the main way to earn points. Fail to earn enough to proceed and youll find yourself repeating objectives. Killing X enemies in Y time, racing a clunky cart around a makeshift racing circuit, and escorting A.I. across enemy-occupied space feel like the beat-em-up equivalent of mini-games, and they make up the majority of Anarchy Reigns single-player DNA. Tonally, the cutscenes waver between silly and serious, but never strike a comfortable balance. Poop puns and internet meme references occur just minutes apart from dead daughters and daddy issues. The narratives meandering melodrama is confusing, inconsistent, and ultimately just an excuse to introduce the 16 multiplayer characters. THE VERDICT Rarely does the solo action do anything to challenge Anarchy Reigns subtle combat mechanics. The mindless enemy encounters in the empty open world arent why you want to play this, but its almost necessary to make the most of the multiplayers exciting madness and unpredictability. Online matches can be irritating for those who havent taken the time to learn the ins and outs of their characters, certainly, but the novelty of slaughtering each other in football arenas or fighting over flags makes the multiplayer a worthwhile use of time. Even if you only enjoy half of Anarchy Reigns, at least its appropriately priced at $30.", "date": "Jan. 14, 2013,"}
