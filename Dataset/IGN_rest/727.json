{"name": "The Magic Circle", "name_review": "The Magic Circle Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/the-magic-circle/109722/review/the-magic-circle-review", "text": "The Magic Circle drops you into the skeleton of an unfinished video game trapped in development hell, hands you a toolset of enticing powers, and asks you to repair a broken universe torn apart by years of overly cynical design-team infighting. The puzzle challenges are imaginative, the world artfully realized, the mysteries intriguing, and the unpredictable plot is crammed with wonderful surprises. Most of the brief time spent in The Magic Circles virtual world is invested decoding clever environmental puzzles. The main weapon is a sort of quick-hacking tool which allows you to burrow into the programming architecture of game objects, reshaping their characteristics to your liking. I could grab robots, corpses, mushrooms, teleporters, and a wide assortment of other game-world denizens and items, and reprogram them to serve me, or just strip them of their powers and then bind their stolen abilities to my other allies. Properly manipulating captured servants is the key element to solving The Magic Circles many challenges, and I was happy to discover that some situations could be tackled from multiple angles. I came upon an abyss brimming with lava, and quickly came up with a couple of solutions: fireproof, floating enemies forming a partial bridge, or perhaps a hijacked pair of nifty teleporters that, positioned just so, could warp me across the trench. There are probably more possibilities, too, and overcoming most puzzles in The Magic Circle made me feel smart, resourceful, and inventive -- a sure sign of good design. Only once did I find myself flummoxed, stuck during one early-game puzzle segment where I completely misinterpreted what I was being asked to do. I wandered around in frustration for some time before stumbling on the obvious solution. Thankfully, the vast majority of the tricks and traps are better constructed. If I couldnt solve a puzzle, I moved on in a different direction and inevitably discovered new tools which would help me overcome challenges Id bypassed, lending a welcome action/adventure vibe to the proceedings. And just when I thought Id mastered the systems, The Magic Circle threw a terrific curve ball my way, springing an impressive twist that completely changed my goals, outlook, and the entire premise of the moment-to-moment gameplay. The opening sections of The Magic Circle are mostly linear, but the environment gradually expands into a small open world ripe for exploration, though I found the rewards for that exploration reduced the charm somewhat. As I searched the shattered landscape unlocking audio files and design notes, I discovered the disturbing legacy of a game company at war with itself. Artists, designers, programmers, community members, fans, and management were uniformly presented as entitled, immature egotists squabbling over turf, brands, rights issues, and design philosophy. The farcical peek behind the development curtain highlights a number of valid satirical arguments about questionable aspects of the games industry, but the delivery is rarely nuanced and almost completely humorless. At one point, The Magic Circle stops everything to spend several minutes yelling at me like an incensed preacher berating a wayward flock. The core of wrath behind the cynicism sometimes makes it hard to swallow. Yet moving past that, I enjoyed The Magic Circle more and more as I progressed, impressed by the surprises that unlocked as I continued through the three-hour story. I never learned to like the pedantic human characters, though I grew a little more fond of my gruff A.I. mentor as time passed. He isnt all that charming, but hes far more likable than any of the insufferably narcissistic human beings I met on my journey. Despite some attempts to flesh out their motivations, I couldnt generate a shred of empathy for any of them. The Magic Circles satire suffers from this point. If you want me to sympathize with a perspective, you must give me someone relatable to sympathize with; in a universe where everyone is a jerk, that doesnt work. Pros Unique puzzle mechanicsGreat twistsThoughtful critique Cons Annoying charactersHumorless satire The Magic Circle continuously surprised me with puzzles, twists, and a great hacking mechanic which gradually placed more and more creative power into my hands. As my skills grew, the possibilities continuously expanded around me, building toward a rewarding and satisfying conclusion. Its a shame there wasnt more to laugh at, and that some worthwhile commentary and criticism of gaming culture is obscured by a virulent delivery, but this superb, inventive method of puzzle design  delightfully unlike anything else Ive ever played  is where the real magic comes from.", "date": "Aug. 2, 2015,"}
