Sure, it has RGB lighting, a high-DPI laser sensor, six programmable buttons, and no-slip side grips, but it also brings a pair of joysticks to the party along with incredibly smooth gliding action by way of its six ceramic pads. The two joysticks are what truly make the mouse unique. Theres one mini-joystick on the left-edge of the mouse thats meant to be controlled with your thumb. The other joystick is hiding in plain sight: the body of the mouse itself can be tilted side-to-side and front-to-back. The Lexip Pu94 is built for gaming but its genesis comes from an earlier mouse from Lexip that was designed for CAD and other 3D modeling work where the two joysticks let you manipulate 3D objects without using your keyboard or needing to click and drag with your mouse. Is all of this just a gimmick, or is Lexip actually on to something here? We put it through its paces to find out. Lexip Pu94 - Ergonomics and Design When I read that the Lexip Pu94 was initially funded by a Kickstarter campaign, I was worried that it might look and feel like an amateur effort. I can happily report this is not the case. The mouse is solid and made from quality materials. The palm rest and left and right mouse buttons feature a soft-touch coating thats pleasing to the touch, and the side grips have a rubber coating thats extra grippy. The rubberized sides are the most non-slip side grips on a mouse that Ive come across. There are higher-profile mice from much more well-known companies that don't make a first impression this positive. The Pu94 features the standard six-button layout for a mouse. On the top of the mouse are left- and right-mouse click buttons, a clickable scroll wheel, and a button behind the scroll wheel labeled as the Lexip button. This button acts as a DPI switch on most mice, but its disabled by default here. (You can reprogram it to act as a DPI switch button via the companion Lexip software, and you can set up to four different DPI stops to cycle through.) On the left side are two thumb buttons that act as forward and back buttons by default. All of the buttons are programmable, including the left- and right-mouse buttons that most mice dont allow to be customized -- a nice bonus for power users. Heres where we depart from the standard mouse review -- the Pu94s two joysticks. There is a mini-joystick on the left side. It sits just in front of and above your thumb but is still well within reach when you want to use it. The other joystick is the mouse itself. Or rather, the shell that sits on top of the mouse. Turn the mouse over and youll see that its made up from two pieces -- the bottom piece with the sensor and ceramic feet and the top shell. The top shell can tilt 20 degrees in all directions. You can use it as a regular mouse and it feels almost normal, though it tilts ever so slightly when quickly moving the mouse left and right. To keep you from accidentally engaging the left- and right-mouse buttons when using the internal top-shell joystick, the mouse has a little border that runs along its front edge in front of the mouse buttons -- it acts as a little shelf to rest your fingers while keeping them off of the mouse buttons. If not for the side buttons and mini-joystick, the mouse would almost be ambidextrous. Its shape is nearly neutral with an ergonomic shape that slightly favors the right hand. The palm rest is fairly flat, which makes the mouse a more natural fit for claw grips than palm grips, but the most effective grip for using the mouses internal joystick is via a palm grip, which makes me wish the Pu94 offered a bigger palm-rest bump. Lexip eschews the plastic glide pads commonly found on the underside of mice for six ceramic feet. They create the most friction-less gliding of any mouse Ive used. They offer a super-smooth feel on a mouse pad and also made my desk feel like a sheet of glass when I tossed aside my mouse pad. In the middle of ceramic feet is a 12,00- DPI laser sensor. The braided USB cable is detachable, but youll need it to operate the mouse; the Pu94 cannot be used wirelessly. Lexip Pu94 - Software The free Lexip Control Panel software lets you fully customize your mouse. The software is a little buggy but still straightforward for changing the DPI setting, reassigning the six programmable buttons, and customizing the RGB lighting. You simply drag a slider to change the DPI level of the mouse, use drop-down menus to reprogram the buttons, and use a color picker to set the color for the lighting. The RGB lighting illuminates the logo as well as the gap between the top and bottom pieces of the mouse. There is only one zone of RGB lighting, so you cant pick a different color for each. There is a Two Colors option, but it just cycles both areas between two colors. The area in the software for customizing the actions for the two joysticks is less straightforward. On the Axis tab of the Options menu, youll find four drop-down menus -- two for the internal joystick and two for the mini-joystick on the side. And to the right is another drop-down for the apps and games that support the Lexip mouse. You can also add your own, but youll need to paste in the file path to the game in order to do so. Whether the game was pre-selected or added manually, you are oddly left to guess at what the commands for the joysticks do. For example, I wanted to set the side joystick to duck when I pushed the joystick down and reload when I pulled it back for CS:GO. There are no such options listed in the Lexip software. No matter which game or app you select, the options listed remain the same and leave you to guess at what vague actions do such as Joystick button 1, Joystick axis Rx, and Joystick axis Dial. Finding no luck with the Lexip software, I went into settings for CS:GO and was able to set up my joystick customizations because the game recognized the Pu945 as a controller. I had less luck with the spaceship shooter, House of the Dying Sun. After my attempts to set the two joysticks to control the roll and pitch of the spacecraft with the Lexip software, I went into settings for the game. I was happy to discover the game had already listed Lexip Gaming as an assigned controller. My good feelings were soon dashed, however, when the game failed to recognize any joystick actions I attempted to set. I tried using both the Mouse and Controller areas of games settings and neither took. Lexip Pu94 - Gaming To test the Lexip Pu94, I used it with a variety of games, from shooters CS:GO and Overwatch to MOBAs like League of Legends and finally a couple flight sims, House of the Dying Sun and Flight Simulator X. Overall I had mixed results. For the two shooters, I was able to program the joysticks for CS:GO, but not for Overwatch as it would not recognize any joystick commands. With CS:GO, however, the mini-joystick was helpful for ducking and reloading because it replaced two common keyboard commands, which allowed me to stay more immersed in the game by using the mouse more and the keyboard less. The mouse also felt accurate for moving and targeting. The smooth gliding on the ceramic feet made my swipes feel extra-quick, but I didnt like that the top shell rocked and tilted slightly when I moved the mouse. Id love to be able to lock it in place for games where I wasnt using the internal joystick. With League of Legends, I didnt use the internal joystick but enjoyed using the mini-joystick for spell combinations. It was more fun to cast them by cranking the joystick than pressing keys on my keyboard, and higher level players could undoubtedly find a good use case for mapping something critical to your right thumb. The internal joystick is a natural fit for moving an object in 3D space, which makes flight sims an obvious choice for the Pu94. This made it all the more disappointing that I couldnt get the mouse to work with House of the Dying Sun. I was able to set up the mouse with Flight Simulator X, however, using not the Lexip software but the games own settings. Using the Pu94 to control the planes roll and pitch was so much more fun than using the keyboard because it wasnt an all-or-nothing keystroke but just subtle movements that really helped take me out of my desk chair and into the cockpit. Its not often you see real innovation in a mouse, but Lexip Pu94 Gaming Mouse really pushes the envelope for what a mouse can do. The product itself is well conceived and solidly constructed, but game support needs to grow and the software needs to mature before it reaches a larger audience.", "date": "Sept. 23, 2019"}
