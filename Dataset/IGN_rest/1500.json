Grasshopper Manufacture's latest release, an experimental Kinect shooter with wacko themes, carries itself with confidence. Diabolical Pitch knows how inexplicable it truly is, but it doesn't just revel in its own absurdity. It's aware of what's cool about its aesthetic, too, and makes the most of it. When it tries to translate that out-there entertainment to its motion-based gameplay, Diabolical Pitch fails. The result of rudimentary mechanics and inaccurate input is a limp action game that's equal parts interesting and frustrating. This leaves little room for excitement. Watch the video review to see this nonsense. For a brief time, Diabolical Pitch's entertaining ideas and progression system deserve attention. What's not to love about throwing baseballs at evil, anthropomorphic animals' heads? The gestures involve aiming with your weak hand and pitching with your strong arm. Firing wildly works, locking on helps, and playing co-op presents cool new opportunities for group or team-based kills. Pitching balls rapidly and on point builds combos and earns money. In turn, players can purchase new abilities, character buffs, and combo bonuses in the form of collectible cards. Diabolical Pitches, the screen-clearing special moves, are the main draw, though. These hilarious and extravagant methods of overkill include chucking a ball the size of a mini-van or using electric balls to fry groups. The gameplay and unlocks play well into each other's hands, which creates an enjoyable cycle of playing, earning, and replaying to place higher on the leaderboards. You made this happen five seconds ago. Wait, watch, continue. Eventually (and this doesn't take very long) Diabolical Pitch starts struggling to stay interesting. It rarely crosses the threshold to ~bad,~ but the novelty of lighting bipedal elephants on fire starts to wane as Diabolical Pitch refuses to change. Jumping and ducking to evade enemy attacks is only a slight diversion from the waves of enemies appearing in unsurprising patterns. By the time you've earned enough to own a respectable number of bonuses, there's little reason to carry on using them. This is where the aesthetic starts to drift from the gameplay. As a player, it's not enjoyable to endure the mundane, repetitive interactions in a world so rich with ridiculous things going on. Baboons riding UFOs in a space amusement park? Incredible. But the sad truth about Diabolical Pitch is that it's nothing more than whack-a-mole with deep-cutting control issues. There they are. Get 'em before they walk at you to death. Kinect feels like an afterthought, which is strange considering Grasshopper build Diabolical Pitch around it. There's only a basic correlation between player actions and the on-screen result. Aside from aiming and throwing, every other motion, such as jumping, ducking, or catching, triggers something you watch. Worse, the Kinect detection just isn't ideal. The aiming reticule wanders off-screen or in inappropriate directions against the player's control, sometimes. Sometimes it flat-out doesn't recognize a jump or duck, which can kill the main character and send you back to the beginning of a stage. Sure, they're only a few minutes each, but it still sucks to have to restart for reasons out of your hands. Ultimately, the inconsistency between thematic presentation and gameplay structure leads to a sterile, unremarkable game. It's certainly worth seeing in some capacity, if only in the free XBLA trial. The dark but vibrant art is a strong complement to the themes, which must have been borne out of a what-if meeting where nobody was allowed to say ~no.~ Diabolical Pitch has more fun with itself than most of us will have with it, which is likable enough for those who aren't looking for anything more. CLOSING COMMENTS The messy clash of themes, gameplay, and controls in Diabolical Pitch undoes everything. Brief bursts of entertainment occur only early on, and theyre almost exclusively a result of the self-aware absurdity in Grasshopper Manufactures presentation. The unchanging whack-a-mole structure holds back any potential Diabolical Pitch had, which is a real shame. This had all the makings of an unforgettable experience, but will most likely fade into obscurity. Also, why bother creating a physically involving Kinect experience if Diabolical Pitch is going to keep cutting the player out of it? Grasshopper Manufacture knows what makes a fun game, but not a great Kinect title.
