Its a humiliating exercise in trial-and-error where failure and repetition power success. Eventually you come to a point where youre suddenly good enough, and thats when your grueling effort comes to life. Dance Central 3 mimics this real-life process as well as the Kinect-only dance series ever has, which is both empowering and exhausting  and not just in the typical way Kinect games make you tired. After the first hour or so, repeating routines in rehearsal mode starts to feel like a grind, largely because its something you absolutely must do to stand a chance at succeeding. Long term, and as I found my rhythm again, I remembered why I love Dance Central so much, not only as a Kinect series, but as a hobby. In the same way Rock Band turned your living room into a stage, Dance Central 3 transforms it into a nightclub, disco joint, or house party,. And like Rock Band and a dance rehearsal, this is starting to feel like a repetitive routine youre tired of  regardless of its excellence. The greatest strength in Dance Central 3s arsenal is its story  not the narrative quality, which is consciously serious, deliberately absurd, and amusingly unfunny , but its approach to style. As a secret agent for Dance Central Intelligence, its your job to travel through time, lock onto a periods craze, and use it to stop a dastardly doctors oppressive reign over the art of dance. Yup. Its nonsensical, but it actually serves an important purpose in giving Dance Central 3 a different identity from its predecessors. Musical diversity is a natural, wonderful consequence of quantum leaping to the 70s, 80s, 90s and 00s. Dance Central 1 and 2 focused primarily on modern music  Lady Gaga, Cascada, Benny Benassi, and other club favorites  with older songs peppered in for good measure. Dance Central 3 is all about a greater balance that speaks to a wider audience. I strongly prefer the kinetic maneuvers of Ushers Scream compared to The Hustle or Ice Ice Baby, but its fun to master the moves in all of them because, from one era to the next, theres a different flow. The 70s songs are relatively easy because their dances are less complicated. Yet they establish a core set of rules youll bring with you when you learn how to Electric Slide in the 80s. That said, the story mode is almost completely impenetrable if you havent rehearsed these songs ahead of time  especially given that the starting tune, the one that proves your worth to your secret agent superiors in 2012, is Bass Down Low, an inexplicable choice given that its one of the most challenging tracks in the Dance Central 3 library. Consequently, the campaign is restrictive. It was off limits until I practiced the majority of music elsewhere. Why not start simple? And so begins the vicious cycle of wanting to dance but needing to rehearse until its perfect. Kinect voice commands make it easy to retry a difficult dance move or slow down the instructions, but the main issue with Dance Central tutorials remains in Dance Central 3. Red lights around a characters limbs communicate where a problem exists as you try various dance moves, but leave you unsure what youre doing wrong. It was an annoying oversight two years ago, and now its just inexcusable. And so the cycle continues. In hindsight, as Ive developed the skill necessary to spin, shake, and shuffle to Dance Central stardom, I see those tutorials as necessary evils, minor inconveniences on the way to having a blast boppin around my living room. The intoxicating feeling that comes with scoring huge points amplifies when you add other dancers to the mix. Multiplayer in Dance Central allows for up to eight to compete in the Crew Throwdown mode, which pits two teams head-to-head in various activities. Keeping the beat and striking poses in throwaway minigames arent nearly as fun as rotating players through a series of songs. Straight-up dancing trumps everything else in Dance Central 3  obviously this is where its at its best. Whether thats better or worse than past Dance Centrals depends on your tolerance for disco and boy bands vs. club hits and hip hop, but the open-minded dancer will find the a fulfilling and interesting mix in Dance Central 3. Plus all of your previous Dance Central tracks work here too, add-on content included, so youre only getting more here. At this point, though, that more is just the same thing weve been doing for two years. THE VERDICT Dance Central 3 continues to proves Harmonix is one of too-few developers that understands why Kinect can be special. The track list is varied and playful in a way that works with its terrific, tough story mode, and no matter how much time you spend banging your head against tutorial walls, your effort pays off in spades. The choreography here is complex, as well as diverse in genre, style, and energy  and nailing a routine feels incredible.", "date": "Oct. 15, 2012,"}
