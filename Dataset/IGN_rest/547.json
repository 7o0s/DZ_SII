Its maybe a little too natural, because once the novelty of playing in VR wore off, I saw it for what it really is: a very short, very conventional game loaded with unnecessary repetition. Most of Luckys Tale could have been an N64-era platformer. Its that same kind of straightforward double-jumping, ground-pounding platforming while collecting coins and avoiding simple enemies weve seen for decades, but easier than most and lacking interesting puzzles or secrets to find. Theres no difficulty progression to speak of, either  the first level teaches you pretty much everything you need to know to get through the entire story mode and rescue Luckys pig buddy, and it rarely tries to compound on those simple skills to make its platforming more challenging or exciting. The few boss battles are the most fun, since they take the most advantage of action and platforming with a faster pace than the action in the regular levels. The 14 levels wouldve only taken me about an hour and a half to complete, except every few levels Luckys Tale forces you to go back and replay the same levels over again in an alternate mode to progress. Thats some blatantly repetitive padding. That said, the Time Trials mode is my favorite way to play, since going for speed made it a little harder and definitely more fun than the slow and steady story levels. The other mode, a coin-collecting game, doesnt feel significantly different from playing through the first time. Luckys Tale is a VR platformer, but VR doesnt add much. Looking up at a vertical stretch of platforming or physically moving my head to see around corners adds a little novelty to an otherwise familiar experience, but that didnt translate into actual gameplay I hadnt seen before  just a new camera angle. The only time I was really happy to have the Oculus on was in a very dark level, where my head became the light source. Moving my face forward without moving Lucky at all helped me avoid enemies hidden in the dark, which is a cool concept and the most innovative VR aspect of Luckys Tale. All the other camera movement could have been done just as well with the controller  I would have preferred it, even, because the camera sometimes auto-scrolls forward in an awkward way that occasionally made me feel dizzy because I wasnt in control. Other times, Id advance Lucky faster than that scrolling overworld camera could even move, and Id have to crane my neck or stand up a little to see where I was going. It doesnt seem intentional, and I wouldnt have had those awkward breaks in my movement had I just been able to manually control the camera position and movement speed myself. It makes the VR part of the experience feel forced rather than adding anything to the platforming. Thats a miss on its own, because the Rifts stereoscopic 3D effect could have been a great way to play with depth perception and mess with what we expect from a 3D platformer. Instead, I didnt even notice a difference in my ability to gauge my jumps. That doesnt make the platforming bad  Luckys Tale is well done in general, though simple  but it doesnt make it good, either. Pros PolishedGood, clean fun Cons VR adds littleRepetitiveConventional Theres some charm to Luckys Tales simplicity. Its not exciting, but its finely polished. Old-fashioned 3D platforming is still fun, especially some of the boss battles, which require more precise jumping and dodging than any of the more slowly paced levels. Its just not remarkable, especially as a showcase for VR.", "date": "April 7, 2016,"}
