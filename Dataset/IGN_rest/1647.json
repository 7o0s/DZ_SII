I've said it before and I'll say it again, but Nintendo's doing nothing but harming the image of its systems by letting this garbage go live. But I digress. Let's discuss WiiWare's latest masterpiece, Zombii Attack. In this offensively unpolished and rudimentarily designed download you're presented with a video game opponent that absolutely no one is tired of yet -- zombies. Hordes of the undead, assaulting you. Again. But your method of fighting back is at least original this time around, as in this umpteenth zombie apocalypse game your human warrior is equipped with a comically large slingshot. This is an official screenshot. Yeah. You direct the aim of the slingshot by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen, then hold down the A Button to prep some preposterous type of ordnance -- anvils, old rubber tires, anything that'll knock down a shambling walker. Fire something weird, hit a zombie, adjust your aim and do it all over again. Additionally, each level also tasks you with a bit of zombie-collecting work, as your massive slinging weapon is equipped with a tractor beam as well. (Of course it is.) You're supposed to allow certain colors of zombie to approach you without attacking them, so that you can suck them up and use the slingshot to launch them bodily through the air and into a basket suspended underneath a nearby, hovering helicopter. Yes, it's absolutely absurd. And there have been plenty of games before that have hit upon a kind of campy appeal by throwing together similar scattered assortments of oddball ideas -- but this just isn't one of them. The weirdness never makes it into that enjoyable territory -- it just stays weird. CLOSING COMMENTS So let this latest zombie killer moan and shuffle its way right past you. It had a chance to do something noteworthy, perhaps -- but it's destined now to just tarnish the Wii Shop's reputation a little bit more and then be lost in the sea of other forgettable zombie games.
