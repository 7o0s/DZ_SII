In the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the Skylanders developer has rekindled the spark of the original PlayStation mascots first three adventures. With a gorgeous new coat of paint, a score that modernizes the iconic soundtrack, and quality of life improvements, this collection is a reminder of why these charming platformers were  and still are so loved. Toys for Bob has nailed the feel of controlling Spyro. He leaps, glides, and charges with the momentum I remember, but with much more adorable animations. His charm and personality has been there from the start  well, ever since Tom Kenny, who reprises his performance, jumped into the role with Spyro 2: Riptos Rage. But Toys for Bob has used two decades of technological advancements to give him a delightful hybrid of cat and dog mannerisms both in cutscenes and while roaming the realms. Updated characters feel plucked straight from a Saturday morning cartoon.The developers havent tweaked what isnt broken when it comes to the gameplay, though. Levels still play well thanks to Insomniac Games original design, but Toys for Bob gives modern depth and life to them. Levels amongst the clouds have gorgeous horizons surrounding them, the sheen and cracks of ice in frozen tundras sparks, and characters, both friend and foe alike, feel like theyre plucked straight from a Saturday morning cartoon. The only real hindrances cramping the trilogys style are the annoying load times in the first Spyro the Dragon and some slight screen tearing into the worlds of Spyro 2: Riptos Rage. But, on the whole, the visual update has not only brought the trilogy up to speed with how my brain remembers them, its surpassed those colorful memories. Thankfully, Toys for Bob has made sure the gameplay is up to snuff with what I see though my rose-tinted glasses, too. Simple changes like movement and camera controls being mapped to the analog sticks make for such a better experience, though the purist in me occasionally felt it robbed jumps of their former difficulty. Navigating the worlds and completing puzzles still works well on the whole, with Insomniacs original intention maintained and only amplified by the new, easily readable look. Keeping levels layouts pristine and accurate to the original allowed me to easily re-find secret side challenges and solve (or still have trouble with) puzzles two decades after I first beat them. All the little, sharply drawn details bring such distinct life to these worlds.Along with the improved controls come welcome tracking tools to soothe my inner collector. With gems, idols, eggs, and more to collect, the guidebooks built into all three games (a concept first only used in Riptos Rage) offer helpful records of your progress through each hub and level. Theyre also handy fast-travel tools when I find myself in the late game of Spyro the Dragon, for example, and need to hop back to a level in the Artisans Homeworld to collect some more gems. And I wanted to backtrack in order to scour every inch of these worlds because the entire trilogy is gorgeous. Thats not just in the obvious updates, but in the tiny little details that breathe fresh life into everything. The monks of Colossus in Riptos Rage have selfies from their trips, while cowardly enemies in Sunny Villa are much sillier scaredy cats. And I adore the revamped dragons of the original Spyro. What used to be a handful of repeated models have become an individual, personality-driven design for each dragon. One wears clocks on his belt, headband, and wrists, while another artistic-minded one has paintings hanging in the halls of his home. They bring such variety to the world in just a few seconds of screentime that I practically want to write fanfic about them. All of these areas and characters are complemented by a great modernization of Stewart Copelands soundtrack. Toys for Bob has retained the iconic melodies and beats and honored them by adding to their sound with more fuller instrumentation. Ive swapped back and forth a host of times while playing and often distinctly notice the instrumental additions, but appreciate how closely they hue to the main melodies of Copelands work. Though for purists, its nice to have that handy feature of swapping back and forth with the old score. Voicework is equally both nostalgic and appreciably updated. Many voices return to fill out the Realms, both Dragon and Forgotten, as well as Avalar, and Kennys return to Spyro just captures the pluckish attitude of the character so well. Spyros first three adventures can be completed in about 20 hours, with 100% completion somewhere in the 30-40 range. Theyre all definitely easier to complete as an adult, but I think kids jumping into these specific Spyro adventures for the first time will find plenty to delight them. As someone returning to them, its nice to have the skill points added to the guidebook, which unlock concept art, to give me an extra bit of challenge while completing levels I once knew by heart. The trophy and achievement design also smartly isnt built around level completion  instead, its about trying to solve each one under specific circumstances or by seeking out certain set dressing in the world, like burning down all the trees. Its completely optional to chase those, of course, but given Spyros collectathon nature, its nice to have that added layer of goals to shoot for. Toys for Bob has done a great job of filling Spyros first three adventures with such reinvigorated life. Worlds a are packed to the brim with more detail, animations are consistently endearing, and the quality of life improvements make revisiting these once analog stick-less platformers a joy to play. Theyre definitely easier thanks to some of those changes, but no less charming to play. Its great to see Spyros return treated with such love and care, and I hope renewed interest in his past can light the way for his future.", "date": "Nov. 13, 2018,"}
