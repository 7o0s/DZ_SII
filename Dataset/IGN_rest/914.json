Because it's largely identical across PC and consoles, Lucy OBriens original review still applies and is summarized here in the verdict. This review focuses on the PC version's unique features.] Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes diverges from series conventions in numerous ways, most notably in its open-ended approach to stealth, and minor enhancements to the interface improve this on PC. Ground Zeroes main mission, a rescue op to free two captured allies, isnt very long, but the vast compound in which its set allows for diverse play styles that are emphasized in smart, silly, and satisfying unlockable objectives. IGNs original reviewer Lucy OBrien illustrated what makes Ground Zeroes a great stealth-action game. She explained, Ground Zeroes is so adept at generating tension that at times it felt like I was playing a survival horror game. While [main character Big Boss] has never been more flexible; able to roll and jump and shoot in line with todays top third-person action-adventure games, enemies are smart and plentiful. In the harsh light of day - and played on Hard mode - they possess cruel 20/20 vision, and react to every little movement or shifting shadow by becoming more efficacious in their patrolling. On PC, this tension can be amplified by minimizing the HUD elements -- disabling visual notifications cleans up the screen, makes Ground Zeroes more challenging, and leaves more room to appreciate its commendable visual fidelity. It exceeds even the terrific graphics of the new-gen consoles on maximum settings; the rainy nighttime map is gorgeous, with slick roads reflecting the glaring lights of truck headlights, and characters clothing dripping in the storm. The daytime variant highlights different high-quality lighting effects, with immaculate environmental detail creating a convincing sense of place. I found myself reducing the screen-filtering effects to minimize the default, sometimes overbearing blur and depth of field, however; this caused the foreground to look too washed out, like the camera is way out of focus. The frame rate is uncapped, but locking it at 30fps allowed for more reliable performance when cranking up the model, texture, and shadow detail on an older PC, but Ground Zeroes is stunning on a respectable rig -- I played mostly on a Core i5-4670 and a GTX 780, with 8GB RAM) -- with no need for compromise. Keyboard and mouse controls work well with Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, but a controller is slightly stronger for stealth precision. Its more similar to Splinter Cell: Blacklist than any other Metal Gear game, using an analog stick to measure walking speed has more precision, but its adequate using WASD and customizable, all of which can be set to your preference. The PC version is content-identical to the console versions, which means Ground Zeroes ending remains tonally problematic, with a tone-deaf and brash representation of violence thats never earned. It attempts to hit a darker point for the series, but its discomforting violation is misguided, gross, and hopefully a one-time thing. Pros Highly replaybleEnticing open worldTough enemiesStrong PC features Cons Tone-deaf ending Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes is a short but challenging game, and those willing to cast aside conventional expectations will find a lot more here than first glance might suggest. Aside from its problematic ending, Ground Zeroes mostly represents a new, more sophisticated era for Metal Gear, particularly given its attention to what matters on PC. A Big Boss/Snake adventure has never looked or played better, and in it lies incredible promise for its enormous big brother -- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.", "date": "Dec. 23, 2014,"}
