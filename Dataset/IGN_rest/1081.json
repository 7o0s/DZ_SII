It provides some of the most interesting and difficult challenges that From Software has ever created. Your gorgeous adventure takes you to forgotten cities, labyrinthine tombs, and ancient lakes, all of which are predictably littered with a slew of things wanting you dead. As the first chapter in the Lost Crowns Trilogy, Sunken King makes Dark Souls 2 tougher than ever, and thats saying something. The ledges are narrow, a huge number of enemies carry poison weapons, and the entire thing is infested with giant insects that spew corrosive mist. More so than ever, youll have to juggle each encounter with managing your inventory and curing status and equipment ailments. The combats just as tough, but fair as ever, but make no mistake  this DLC is going to squash anybody who isnt comfortable with being outnumbered five to one. Crowd control and the ability to draw in enemies one at a time is key to your survival. The Sunken King took me about four hours to complete, though one of those hours was devoted entirely to a particularly nasty boss. Speaking of, the big baddies do not disappoint  theyre crazy tough, and range from groups of human warriors to something far more ancient and dangerous. I wont go into too much detail, but lets just say this guys up there with some of the toughest bosses in the whole Souls series. The biggest addition in this DLC is the introduction of puzzles in the form of dozens of pillars that you can raise and lower using their corresponding levers. These pillars can be used to access new areas, provide cover from enemy arrows, but haphazardly throwing every switch can also remove the only obstacle between you and a group of ghouls. Its a level of environmental interactivity that hasnt really been seen in the Souls series, but certainly a welcome addition. But while the interactivity is great, the environment itself doesnt enough visual cues to make puzzle solving fun. I felt like I was stumbling across the solutions, as opposed to discovering them by figuring something out. This is particularly problematic in the second area. Even once Id cleared all of the enemies from the aforementioned tomb, I was consistently lost thanks to the ocean of gray and unremarkable rooms. Nothing takes me down from the high of killing a few dozen ghouls quite like having to draw a scratch-paper map to find the nearest bonfire. Pros Great boss fightsTense combatHigh-level challengeInteresting puzzles Cons Confusing level layout Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Sunken King is a brutal, but entertaining opening to a coming trilogy of DLC. Though I wasnt wild about some of the level design, the emphasis on puzzle solving added a welcome new layer to the already-deep Souls gameplay. Within its four hours, I played through a handful of encounters that were as tense, challenging, and rewarding as anything in the entire Souls series, and thats saying something.", "date": "July 22, 2014,"}
