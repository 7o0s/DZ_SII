They fill every corner of its big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax thats genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: its bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series. Smash Bros. Wii U wraps more than 30 years of gaming history together into an approachable brawler. Every fighter in the 49-strong roster uses the same button-presses to execute attacks and special moves, but each has their own distinct style thats fun to learn. It makes them simple to pick up and play, but also challenging to master. Bowser, for example, uses burly strikes and kicks to pummel foes into submission, while Smash Bros. newcomer Duck Hunt uses a tricky move set of clay-pigeon projectiles, explosive barrels, and attacks that make playful references to the 8-bit era. Add in iconic characters like Mega Man, Samus Aran, Captain Falcon, Fox McCloud, Animal Crossings Villager, Pac-Man, Wii Fit Trainer, Link, Mario himself, and dozens of others, and youve got something for pretty much anybody whos ever loved a video game. The attention to detail in every part of Super Smash Bros. is fantastic, and all of it is delivered at a speedy and smooth 60 frames per second. Mega Man walks using his signature awkward sideways-shuffle, and the new Mario Kart Circuit arena captures the zero-gravity look and feel of a Mario Kart 8 track. Items like the deadly Bullet Bill or POW Block stir up old-school Super Mario Bros. memories while also sending a satisfying wallop to opponents. With so many tiny details and references to observe, itll take lots of hours to see everything Smash Wii U has to offer. Excellent moment-to-moment combat is the real jewel of this game, and the many ways it can be played, from the Wii U GamePad to classic GameCube controllers with an adapter, make it a gift that keeps on giving. The action scales incredibly well: two-player duels are tense, while eight players all trying to Smash each other out of the ring is complete chaos. Turning items off removes the random element, turning it into more of a test of skill. But thats just the beginning. The constant variety of the multiple modes keeps me playing. Event mode, for instance, makes learning new characters moves easy by putting them in playful solo adventures. One of these is Keep Em Off the Ship, in which you play as Falco and go up to smash a squad of parachuting Mr. Game & Watch enemies out of the ring, and it provided me some great training for how to use the speedy characters aerial attacks. The mission text makes some hilarious references to video game history, but the skills I picked up hold equal value, and the addition of two-player co-op makes it even more fun. Modes like Classic, Special Orders, and All-Star take a similar approach, using diverse matches, fun scenarios, and specific rules to set up creative encounters, but each allows you to choose the level of risk and reward. Special Orders allow you to spend accumulated Smash coins on special event matches, where winning unlocks another trophy or a handy piece of custom equipment; the higher the difficulty, the better the prizes. However, losing comes at a hefty price torching most (or in some cases all) of the stakes, giving these matches special tension. Nearly every mode of Super Smash Bros. offers a set of unlockable rewards, and the only parts about unlocking them that arent satisfying are the awkward menus and, more importantly, the stingy drop rates for custom special moves. Those swappable special moves alter the speed of Marios Fireball or the properties of other special attacks, so theyre pretty important and fun to mess with. The prospect of new custom equipment, special moves, beautifully rendered trophies, and more kept me playing for hours, even though Super Smash Bros. didnt really give me enough direction for how to actually unlock the prizes I wanted The only mode thats a snooze is Smash Tour, which is effectively a mediocre virtual board game with too many boring parts. Four players take turns gathering up stat buffs, items, and characters in a build up to a final battle, which is a cool concept, but Smash Tours approach distills the essence of this amazing brawler game into painfully short matches full of random elements that just dont have the same satisfying payoff or feeling of accomplishment. Super Smash Wii Us online modes offer lots of match types to play with, from tense 1-on-1 showdowns without items, to 2v2 faceoffs in Team Smash, with up to two fighters playing from the same console. Just like in Mario Kart 8, getting friends together can be a little bit of a hassle involving text messages because Nintendos system doesnt allow for notifications. But once youre all set up, you can launch private matches with friends and unleash characters with customized movesets, or watch other players strategies through handy replay and spectator modes. Sadly, eight-player Smash doesnt make the cut online, but four players is more than enough for a good brawl. This is also the first game to integrate with Nintendos new toys-to-life, called amiibo. There are no figures in the box, so this is an extra purchase, but if you do buy in theyll add another, much smaller avenue of variety to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Computer-controlled figure players will stand in as opponents, and each one learns to defend itself as it levels over time. The investment required to reach max level is small (maybe three hours) and having a brutally tuned A.I. to unleash on your friends is fun to watch  but of course, sometimes my amiibo made some questionable decisions. Ive seen my fully leveled Mario figure wreck opponents, but Ive also watched in horror as it totally gave away the match. Im proud of my amiibo, but sometimes its like dealing with a child that only listens half the time. Pros Easy controlsGreat modesLots of unlockablesExcellent replay valueEight-player brawls Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only to appeal to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players. Once theyre hooked, it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards. Theres just so much here, and Ive rarely seen a game with so many enjoyable and replayable ideas in a single package. Playing eight-player matches and classic four-player brawls are only the beginning, and I dont see a reason to stop playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U for a long time.", "date": "Nov. 24, 2014,"}
