Here's what I said then: ~The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an amazing achievement. Its story is powerful, its freedom is liberating, and its world is one of the most beautiful Ive ever wandered around. Heres to more games not holding your hand.~ Make sure to read that review, because nearly a year later, my thoughts on this atmospheric adventure game still stand. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played when I reviewed it on PC back in 2014, and now that its on PlayStation 4, I can give it the same high praise on this system. The autumnal foliage looks gorgeous, the lighting helps create the beautiful but unsettling atmosphere, and gazing out onto the scenic vistas adds a great sense of place the whole setting. In short, Ethan Carter is a fantastic first-person exploration game that focuses on tone, freedom, and environmental storytelling in lieu of combat. You play a supernaturally powered detective on the trail of the titular missing boy in rural Wisconsin, and must piece together memory fragments to solve some great puzzles. These smart challenges reward you with bits of backstory, and the actual act of solving them fits in with the eerie Lovecraftian tone created by its beautiful environments. Check out our original video review for the PC version of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter above. Aside from maintaining the same incredible visuals and great storytelling, Ethan Carter doesnt require twitch reflexes, so the move from mouse and keyboard to the DualShock 4 doesnt detract from the adventure at all. Pros Absolutely gorgeousSmart writingInteresting puzzlesGreat ending Cons The mines The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an amazing achievement on PC, and remains just as great on PS4. Despite already knowing the solution to all of Carters puzzles, I still had a blast venturing back into its world and experiencing its powerful story once again. The writing is great, the atmosphere is effective, and emotional payoff at the ending remains satisfying. Heres to more games not holding your hand.", "date": "July 25, 2015,"}
