And thats what Logitech have been aiming to do with its steering wheels - to deliver a realistic driving experience by releasing the G27 racing wheel back in 2010 and now with its successor the G29 Drive Force Steering wheel. Build, Design and setup When you purchase Logitech G29 Force Drive steering wheel you will find in the package the steering wheel, pedals, power adaptor and documentation. The wheel at first might look like a toy especially with it being not that heavy (2.25kg). The wheel is covered with a high-quality hand-stitched leather, giving it the look and feel of a professional racing wheel. Unlike the Logitech G27, this steering wheel is designed mainly for a PlayStation console but you can still use it with a PC as well. The D-Pad looks more like the one found on a traditional PlayStation controller and its compatible with PS4/PS3 consoles. You can easily configure it to be used with each console with a flip of switch on the top of the steering wheel. The D-Pad also contains an LED indicator that helps to know when to shift gears if you enjoy manual shift controls. It also has a 24 point selection dial to navigate easier with a game or the PlayStation interface and a +/- button to change the view of the camera while driving. The pedal board is slightly heavier than the steering wheel, weighing in at about 3.1kg. The pedal faces are made out of brushed stainless steel and the frames and arms are made out of cold rolled steel. Its a three Pedal setup (acceleration, brake and clutch) and its patented with a carpet grip system for easy use if you dont have a racing rig. Installing the G29 is a piece of cake. The integrated table clamps make it easy to be attached to desks, tables or even your racing rig. Its also totally plug and play - just connect the pedals to the steering wheel and then to your console. Once connected the wheel will turn twice to the left and then right for collaboration purposes, and you are good to hit the road. Performance The Logitech G29 Drive Force Steering Wheel has a force feedback dual motor that makes you feel every move and turn in whatever game youre playing. But while playing Project Cars and DRIVECLUB the force feedback failed to respond sometimes to my actions and it led the car to start slipping left and right on the track. The wheel has a 900 degree steering allowing you to turn the wheel two and half times which makes controlling the car while driving relatively easy. If you enjoy long gaming sessions then the G29 will be your perfect companion - thanks to the high-quality hand stitched leather, the wheel wont easily warm up or become slippery while using it. And overall the steering wheel is quiet thanks to the helical gearing and anti-backlash systems in place. Unlike a few other steering wheels, the G29 doesnt come with a shift stick. If you enjoy a spot of manual driving, youll still be able to shift between gears by using a racing-style paddles on the backside of the wheel. But if you will be more satisfied with a manual stick then you can add $60 extra and get the Driving Force Shifter. As for the pedals, I found their usage a bit more realistic. The brake pressure sensitive system changes accordingly as per the car youre driving and it gives you an accurate response according to your force usage. Pros Durable designPowerful force feedback Cons Force Feedback gets glitchy at timesGearshift sold separately The Logitech G29 Force drive steering wheel is quite powerful, easy to use and durable. With the dual force feedback motors it manages to deliver a realistic driving experience that might be a bit glitchy at times but wont ruin your overall gaming experience. <br><br> <p><a href=~https://gear-up.me/logitech-g29-racing-wheel-driving-force-pc-ps3-ps4.html?utm_source=tbreak%20&amp;utm_medium=banner_tbreak_review&amp;utm_campaign=rev_ban_12~><img alt=~~ class=~image SCREENSHOT~ data-model=~image~ data-pk=~139241~ src=~http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_me/screenshot/default/7825a5fd-766b-4578-92f6-dd67f87f095b_2mws.jpg~ /></a></p>", "date": "Jan. 3, 2016,"}
