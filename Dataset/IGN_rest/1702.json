I could copy and paste my review like last year, but unlike some of the folks at EA I dont take much satisfaction in reusing material.For the THIRD year in a row, EA Sports has released a virtually unchanged edition of FIFA onto the Nintendo Switch. As stated on the games official website, FIFA 22 Legacy Edition will feature the same gameplay innovation from FIFA 21 without any new development or significant enhancements.As a reminder, heres what was written there for last years game: FIFA 21 Legacy Edition will feature the same gameplay innovation from FIFA 20 without any new development or significant enhancements.Oh, and the year before: FIFA 20 Legacy Edition will feature the same gameplay innovation from FIFA 19 without any new development or significant enhancements.And let me remind you that FIFA 19 on Switch wasnt exactly great in the first placeFIFA 19 Legacy Edition VerdictFIFA 19 is a threadbare experience on the Switch. The inclusion of the Champions League and a significant graphical upgrade goes some way to approaching the levels of presentation found on the PS4, Xbox One, and PC version, but on the pitch its a mile away from being a premium football simulation and fails to build on last years game. I can see myself having some fun playing the new House Rules modes locally with friends, but in most single-player modes there is no doubt that it is a repetitive and unfulfilling experience.So thats three years in a row where all that has been added each time are squad updates, new kits, broadcast packages and menu screens. No genuine attempt has been made to deliver an improved product, in any tangible way whatsoever, and FIFA on Switch really is just plain insulting at this point (if it wasnt already, which it definitely was). There is some good news, if you can call it that. Youll only be getting ripped off for 34.99/$39.99 this year compared to the 44.99/$49.99 previously. Honestly, if you want a less than mediocre football game for your Switch and havent bought FIFA in the past four years then maybe youll find something to enjoy here. I, though, happen to find the whole affair to be sad, joyless, and a shining example of capitalism at its worst. What could surely at this point be a low-cost downloadable update is instead presented as an expensive, cynical money grab. EA, please stop this. FIFA 22 on Switch is the latest example of little to no respect being paid towards a fanbase being asked to pay a premium price for a virtually unchanged product. Its just not good enough.", "date": "Oct. 1, 2021,"}
