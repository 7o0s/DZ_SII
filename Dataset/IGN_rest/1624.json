Well, it's more than ~evident~ -- it's blatant. Just like Incredible Machine, a series started in the early '90s, each Crazy Machines Elements level gives you a physics-based objective like getting a ball to roll across some planks and fall through a hoop. It's up to you to use your smarts and the preset toolbox items (toy cars, ropes and so on) to complete the task at hand. All of that is cool. Studying fireworks-based puzzles and creating chain reactions between candles and teapots in an attempt to get bowling balls into shopping carts makes for an interesting hook. The challenge that comes with filling in the blank spots to make a machine work is like a Mad Libs episode of Mythbusters. Most of the game's 100 puzzles are fun, but the whole experience never becomes anything more than a simple distraction with an inflated $10 price tag. Crazy Machines Elements could be a bit more challenging, though. There's no penalty for taking an exorbitant amount of time on a puzzle or trying a solution over and over again. You're only goal beyond polishing off a given objective to unlock the next is collecting however many bolts are hovering in the level. Once you know a solution, figuring out how to make objects collide to collect the bolts isn't all that tough, either. Developer FAKT Software, which has released multiple versions of Crazy Machines on various platforms, tries to add value to the digital download by including leaderboards (which do take your time spent on a puzzle into consideration), challenges and the promise of downloadable content, but none of this makes Crazy Machines Elements any more enticing as the same problems plague these modes. There's the option to create your own challenges, but the game doesn't pack a way to share them so it's useless. Could be crazier... Adding to the feeling that you're just not getting your money's worth is the fact that Crazy Machines Elements feels like a bad port. The controls are sluggish (even when using PlayStation Move), saving takes far too long and there's slowdown and screen tearing with the goofy looking professor who just stands on the menu screens. CLOSING COMMENTS There's fun to be had in Crazy Machine Elements, but it's wrapped in a rather mediocre package. It takes a while to save, doesn't look that great and just doesn't feel like a $10 game. If you're looking for a puzzler, cool, but wait for a price drop.
