As of this writing, she has completed the level 10 programming skill, felt sad once and happy 232 times, WooHooed only nine times, and had two kids with the husband she met at a bar. Im having a hard time saying goodbye to her, admittedly, so I have her drinking anti-aging potions. I encounter this problem with a lot of Sims games, and this time its even worse (because a lot of things are better). But at the same time, The Sims 4s lack of features and small world hasnt let Jess live her life to the fullest. Even though its fun, its a big letdown that this sequel doesnt inspire the same wow factor that The Sims 3 did when I first played it years ago. When I created Jess, I was immediately impressed by the appearance-customization options. Picking a Sims walk style, which can vary from tough to feminine, does a lot to express personality (and itll change to a slouch if theyre tired or an I have to pee walk when their bladders are uncomfortably full). The new Create-a-Sim in general is really intuitive, allowing you to push and pull at different parts of a Sims body in order to get the exact size and shape youre looking for. Im a huge believer in body positivity and beauty in all bodies, so seeing more realistic representations of various body types was really encouraging. I gave Jess thick thighs and hips and kept her upper body lean, because I finally could. I was disappointed, however, that I could give her only four total traits  three, if you dont count the trait associated with her lifetime aspiration. Thats one fewer than The Sims 3 allows, or two if you have the University Life expansion. It turned out to be less of a problem than Id imagined, though, because the addition of emotions makes a lot out of a little. Trying to get Jess a date was my first brush with the new emotional axis to Sims personalities, a system that successfully supplants traits as a more realistic way for Sims to live and interact. I quickly learned that Jess, who I gave the romantic trait, very easily swung into flirty feelings. Feeling flirty unlocked several fun interaction options, like posing seductively or taking a cold shower to quell thoughts of WooHoo. (Pro tip: Use some of the flirty options before jumping straight to WooHoo. In the spirit of realism, Sims will get a better mood boost from it afterward.) On the other hand, going too long without flirting made her tense, which opened up another set of actions. Thats the best thing about emotions in The Sims 4: They provide new contextual opportunities to Sims, like being able to tell a self-deprecating joke when embarrassed, and make a lot more sense than just having static interactions based on personality traits. It was a lot of fun to watch an energized Jess mop like mad! and kind of touching to see her inspired husband tell her about his dreams. It took me about 15 hours of playing with my crew of Sims to fully appreciate the complexity of Sim emotions, but now Im really enjoying it. Of course, to get the most out of these interactions, you need to socialize, and to socialize, you need to leave the house. Thats why Im so extremely disappointed with The Sims 4s small, stifling world  every trip, even to a next-door neighbors house, brings up a short but jarring loading screen. It feels like a high-res version of The Sims 2, at least in this sense. Its not a deal-breaker, but it is a shock to the system after exploring an entire town seamlessly in The Sims 3. Exacerbating that, there are only 10 public venues to visit between the two available neighborhoods, and most of them are duplicated. There are three variations on bars, two museums, two parks, two gyms, and a library, and because the world is so small, it felt like I kept running into the same few people no matter where I went. I thought Jess would be able to meet new people through work, but nope! Coworkers dont really exist, as far as I can tell, even the ones Jess supposedly flirted with at work. In keeping with the tiny neighborhoods, careers are complete rabbit-holes  your Sim just vanishes from the curb in front of their house when its time to go to work. After meeting Jess future husband, Jamari, and deciding that he was the most eligible bachelor she was going to find (he had the family-oriented trait), I ended up keeping her at the house most of the time, which makes everything feel even smaller On the bright side, thanks to the new-and-improved Sim multitasking, being a bit of a recluse wasnt so bad. My second Sim creation, Juniper, would walk her bouncy self up to Jess door and keep her company as she worked on one programming project or another. Jess could code while chatting with Juniper, then eat while watching TV with Juniper and text Jamari while on the toilet (presumably about Juniper). Conversations, it follows, have a similar ease of flow. Jamari, a line cook, would come home and make food for Jess and Juniper while having a conversation with both of them, easily switching between blowing kisses at the former and telling jokes to the latter. Its really nice to not have to micromanage Sims interactions at every turn, and its especially fun to watch where these more intelligent conversations go when youre not interfering. On more than one occasion, Ive watched Sims gain the embarrassed emotion while chatting because of a misguided romantic advance or a joke that no one really got. Are you ready for a break from the feels? Me too! On the absolutely non-emotional side of The Sims 4, Build Mode has been significantly improved over The Sims 3s version. I was particularly excited about cabinet and counter customization; you can have super-cool half-counters to end a kitchen in a less abrupt way or half-cabinets for over the fridge. Trust me, its really cool. Probably more universally exciting are the ability to pick up entire rooms and move them anywhere on the lot without razing them to the ground and rebuilding them, and the push-and-pull tool (similar to body mod in Create-a-Sim) which allows you to move or resize an entire length of wall all at once. Some of the new tools are quirky, however  foundations are now applied retroactively, which is cool if youre like me and dont feel like demolishing an entire house just to add a porch, but they apply to every structure on the entire lot. This means no split-levels and no garages, but since there arent any cars in The Sims 4, the latter isnt a huge deal. Except no cars in The Sims 4 is a huge deal, because this is supposed to be a people simulation, and people very often have cars. People also dont erupt from the bassinet and immediately enter childhood, but Sims in The Sims 4 do, since there are no toddlers. The Sims 3s Create-a-Style tool is also history, a bit of a letdown for my interior design sensibilities. Granted, I was successfully able to give Jess and Jamari a matching, cohesive space-age house with the tools available, but Im still sad that I cant make cool pajamas in the exact print I want or buy a couch in the style Id like while also picking a nice color. Pools, though, are perhaps the most conspicuous and ridiculous omission. For a decade-plus theyve been well-known as the most popular way to murder Sims, if youre into that. Both build options and furnishing options seem really barren at this point, but knowing The Sims, that will be remedied in one way or another eventually (for a fee, of course). Pros Build Mode improvedGreat emotionsStrong Create-a-Sim Cons Frequent loadingLacks content Transitioning from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4 is a little rough. The Sims 4 seems barren of content and features by comparison, especially with regard to the severely limited scope of the world and frequent (but much shorter) loading screens and noticeable absence of toddlers, pools, and cars. Its not so much that Maxis didnt recreate all the same features, but rather that there arent enough cool new things to replace whats missing. Yet The Sims 4 does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential. The emotions system and its contextual actions are really strong and added to my investment in my Sims as well as my enjoyment from watching ridiculousness unfold. Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever. Overall, its a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but its not there yet.", "date": "Sept. 10, 2014"}
