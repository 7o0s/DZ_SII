The massive construction includes twin 65-inch 1080p TVs linked together  a 21st-century version of the classic X-Men arcade cabinet  forming a giant, ultra-widescreen play area. Four padded seats fill the pod, which is enclosed by glowing Halo rings; each chair is equipped with a heavyweight mounted gun turret controller thats lavishly decked out with LED strips that change color when you pull the trigger. It certainly looks the part. And, thankfully, the light-gun game within largely lives up to the presentation. Halo: Fireteam Raven  currently exclusive to Dave and Busters  is a fun, four-player romp across the original Halo ring from Combat Evolved that mixed in enough weapon variety to leave me smiling at the end of a run through the 45-minute campaign. I played through all six missions in four-player mode, and then played through the first half of it again with just two of us. Like any co-op game its clearly a better experience with every seat filled  but the AI that substitutes for missing players keeps your flanks just safe enough to not feel like a burden. It doesnt demand any real coordination between players beyond keeping whatever area of the screen you decide is your territory clear of threats, so no inside knowledge of Halo is needed in order to be successful. Fireteam Raven largely satisfies by recreating Halo's iconic arsenal. Sequences within each level last, in true arcade fashion, just a few minutes each. Youll go from fighting Elites to Grunts to Jackals to Banshees to Flood, sampling a staple of classic Halo weapons along the way. I really enjoyed revisiting the original Halo ring, and many locations will look familiar from Master Chiefs first adventure. Graphics are fine, if a noticeable step down from Halo 5, but look appropriately Halo-y and the framerate never falters from what appeared to be 60 frames per second. As a light gun game, the feel of weapons matters more than usual (since shooting is literally all you can do), and Fireteam Raven largely satisfies by recreating Halos iconic arsenal. The assault rifle replicates its Xbox cousin nicely, lighting up and popping the shields of Elites in the same time and manner youve come to expect. (No doubt for the purposes of the arcade, magazine sizes have been inflated, so dont expect an exact 1:1 conversion from the Xbox to the arcade.) And the rocket launcher is nigh unstoppable, and satisfyingly so. On the other hand, the shotgun fires way too fast and its sound effect lacks the oomph it has in traditional Halo games. And strangely, the pistol occupies the polar opposite position from what it does in the source material, going from the best weapon in Combat Evolved to the worst in Fireteam Raven. It feels weak and meek, and I was happy it only showed up once in the whole campaign. Thats largely because you never have a choice of weapons  each sequence has its own prescribed gun. Grenades are also lacking, in that on the rare occasion you get to use one they lack any meaningful visual indicator. I was often left wondering if I actually threw them, if I happened to be looking at the other side of the screen when they went off. Fireteam Raven is a Halo game translated into a fireworks show. There are no boss fights, really, which is disappointing. But there are infinite-ammo sequences, such as Warthog rides and Shade turrets, which allow you to take on bigger foes like evolved Flood, Wraith tanks, and Hunters. A handful of slow-motion moments, often involving explosions, also add nicely to the spectacle. The extent of employable strategy in Fireteam Raven is learning to wait for the vulnerable moments of the larger bad guys before pulling the trigger, but even so, the pace moves quickly enough that I was never bored. If Fireteam Raven is a Halo game translated into a fireworks show  complete with a couple of brief, dialogue-free Master Chief cameos  the end sequence is a flashy and highly enjoyable grand finale. However, its also comically brief, like it presses 8X fast forward on what is already an accelerated side-story which runs in parallel to Halo: Combat Evolved. As an arcade game designed to extract coins from its players, Fireteam Raven doesnt feel especially greedy. Its inevitable feed me more credits death loop is long enough that I didnt feel ripped off, despite spending what ultimately turned out to be a pretty pricey $15 or so (per person) for the eight or nine continues needed to finish the playthrough. Thanks to its impressive physical setup, rapid-fire pacing, and use of many of Halos signature weapons, Fireteam Raven had me grinning throughout and left me satisfied when it was over. It is a spectacle worth revisiting an arcade for, and its high cost-per-run is tolerable because its something youll likely only want to play through once.", "date": "July 25, 2018,"}
