So, in an ironic sort of way, Battlefront 2 is a better Star Wars game because of its initial fall to the dark side and subsequent journey back to the light. After over two years of updates and changes, EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date. Taking in all Battlefront 2 now has to offer at once is honestly a bit overwhelming. Setting aside the overly safe, short, and disappointing single-player story, theres a wealth of wave-based co-operative maps and a litany of online competitive multiplayer modes. Most of them play wonderfully and they all ooze that classic Star Wars look and feel on an unrivaled scale. Whether youre fighting on the ground with a blaster in your hands, cutting down troops with a lightsaber, or dogfighting in space, Battlefront 2 is an immensely entertaining ride through a galaxy far, far away. Crucially, DICE absolutely nailed the basics. Take the mechanics of firing a blaster: It feels just a bit chunky, as it should, with that signature sound bursting with each shot. And even though every weapon shoots similar-looking bolts, they all feel extremely distinct out of the box and can be customized further. Crucially, DICE absolutely nailed the basics.For ground troops, the four main classes are Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist. They feel about as distinct as any other classes in a multiplayer shooter, although none of them have a dedicated secondary gun to swap too. Since there are no ammo counts, just cool downs, it changes the dynamic a bit and definitely feels unique. I gravitated towards the Heavy troopers because of their powerful LMG-style weapon, mobile shield, grenade, and a special that let me shoot continuously like a minigun without overheating. Its excellent for suppressing fire, especially if youre on the defending end of the final phase in Capital Supremacy and need to keep the enemy back at all costs. In between the main classes and the big hero units are specialty units like Arc Troopers that get electric mines and dual pistols, or rolling Droidekas with heavy armor and deployable shield domes. Coordinating attacks between the practicality of the standard troops and flashiness of heroes is a lot fun and makes Battlefront 2 feel special. Microtransaction Reaction Shortly before Battlefront 2 officially launched in 2017 it was filled with egregious microtransactions that were not only greedy, but disruptive to the game as a whole. If you didnt want to grind for hours to unlock playable heroes then you had to pay actual money. Star Card upgrades were locked behind similar time-sinks and pay walls that made multiplayer feel like more of a chore than a game. Thankfully, EA listened to feedback and removed those just ahead of launch, but the grindy progression remained. Fast forward a couple of years, though, and, all of thats now been removed as well. Today, the only things you can buy are cosmetics like new outfits and emotes, so theres no hint of pay-to-win in play. Star Cards are completely gone, leveling is now based on linear XP gains, and all heroes are open from the beginning. Alternatively, you can earn these cosmetics through loot boxes you cant pay for. Its a good, fair system, and thankfully entirely separate from progression  that makes these boxes exciting to open because the cosmetics dont come at the cost of character upgrades and unlocks. Or, if you buy or upgrade to the Celebration Edition of Battlefront 2, every paid cosmetic, emote, and victory pose is unlocked from the very beginning. Whats great about Battlefront 2 is that it lets you play with all of its toys, no questions asked. Every character class and playable hero is available from the start, and the tedious unlocking grind from launch has been completely removed. Luke, Vader, Boba Fett, Rey  you name them, theyre all here. As you level up you unlock new ability cards with passive upgrades such as increased health regeneration speed or a bigger grenade blast radius. Theyre designed as ways to refine your playstyle, rather than make you dramatically stronger, and its a fulfilling system that rewards sticking with a class without forcing you to. Youll spend most of your time as Battlefronts basic soldier classes, but as you play you earn in-match points that you can eventually spend to spawn as a hero. That can seriously turn the tide. These iconic characters are absolute killing machines, and when you clash with another hero its extremely memorable. The list has been growing since launch and now includes everybody from Obi-Wan and his Force push to lesser favorites like General Grievous, including his ridiculous saber windmill attack. Pitting original trilogy Darth Vader against the prequel trilogy Anakin Skywalker hero is far more entertaining than it should be. These fights can be truly the stuff of Star Wars ~What If?~ fan-fiction, brought to life on screen.These fights can be truly the stuff of Star Wars What If? fan-fiction, brought to life on screen. During a Heroes v Villains match  a team deathmatch mode where everybody plays as a hero the entire time  I was playing as Boba Fett on the rainy planet Kamino and ran into an enemy player controlling Obi-Wan. It quickly felt like a reenactment of the Jedi Knights fight against Jango Fett in Episode II. In this version, Obi-Wan leapt through the air while I shot at him with my blasters, then he Force-pushed me and knocked me down before charging in for the kill with his lightsaber. Then, in a dramatic twist, none other than Darth Vader himself jumped in at the last second and Force-choked him before he could strike. My teammate then lifted Obi-Wan into the air for me to finish him off. It was a fantastic and memorable moment. It doesnt feel like an exaggeration to say that, in terms of scope and breadth, EA and DICE have released just as much new, free content for the multiplayer side of Battlefront 2 as it already had at launch. Theyve dished out new maps like Felucia and Geonosis, exciting new game modes, a litany of heroes and villains, new ships for aerial combat, and dozens of cosmetic skins. Battlefront 2s maps now feel like a Greatest Hits selection of the entire Star Wars galaxy, pulling from all three movie trilogies plus one-offs and the cartoons. The dense greenery of Felucia is a great contrast to the brown wastelands of Geonosis, and fighting across the Cloud City in Bespin is a blast. Naboos capital city, Theed, is one of my favorites, since its an outdoor urban setting, unlike most of the other battles, and is full of buildings that make it a great stage in the larger 40-player game modes. Every mode has an extreme level of map variety, and that makes it easy to fall into that just one more game mentality because youll see something new every time for a long while. The catch is that finding a match is hit or miss depending on the game mode and time of day. Its not very difficult to queue up for the main modes like Capital Supremacy and Galactic Assault, especially on PS4. But smaller modes, like Hero Showdown and Hero Starfighters, can take a few minutes of waiting before you can enjoy them, which is a shame. Theyre not the main attraction by any means but Ive had some good fun with them. In Hero Showdown, two teams of two heroes each face off without respawns for multiple rounds. Its a bit like Gun Fight in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, but instead of guns and knives its blasters and lightsabers. Similarly, Hero Starfighters pits two teams of four hero ships against each other, but this time dying brings you back as a standard starfighter until one team has lost all their hero ships. Letting you immediately take control of these recognizable characters is awesome, putting a fun spin on the standard modes, but they dont seem to command the same amount of popularity. Having so many different modes to choose from seems to have split the player base thinly across the best ones. The least popular modes, like the capture-based Jetpack Cargo or Blast (which is just team deathmatch), are often complete dead zones with no players at all  they were never as thrilling as the larger-scale battles, but I dont always want to spend 30-40 minutes in a single match, so having something quicker and faster-paced available would have been nice. I was never left unable to play, though, because the Quick Play option is a reliable fallback that will always drop you into whats hot if you arent picky. That said, the limited choice queues cause can occasionally be disappointing all the same. Its also a bummer when the only active mode is something you dont want to play at all, like Ewok Hunt or one of the Starfighter battles for the third time in a row. Capital Supremacy mode is both one of the busiest and one of the best.Thankfully, the recently added Capital Supremacy mode is both one of the busiest and one of the best. Its similar to the traditional Galactic Assault mode, in that theyre both large-scale battles with 40 players fighting over control points, but there are some big differences. Here, holding control points in the first phase earns you AI reinforcements, and then the winning team boards transport shuttles to try to take over the other teams capital ship. If they fail, the first phase starts over. It creates an epic tug-of-war, pushing and pulling across space and the planets surface and can easily take upwards of 30 minutes to finish a single match. The settings and power dynamic are all extremely reminiscent of both the Clone Wars and the massive battles in DICEs Battlefield series. Galactic Assault evokes a similarly grandiose feeling, but instead of changing maps partway through depending on progress, the levels are more multifaceted from the beginning. In Galactic Assault, all three types of warfare are happening at the same time: aerial fighters, ground vehicles, and foot soldiers. The objectives vary depending on the map, but usually involve capturing points, escorting large ground units like walkers, overriding systems, or planting bombs. Galactic Assault can take a while, but it's the only game mode that spans all three eras.Matches of Galactic Assault can take a while, but its the only game mode that spans all three eras across over a dozen different maps, so I really felt like I was reenacting actual movie moments. For example, trying to take out a TIE Fighter with a rocket launcher or strafing across a planets surface in an X-Wing while blowing up Storm Troopers is enormous fun. Note that while Capital Supremacy currently only covers Clone Wars locations, its getting updated in early 2020 to include sequel trilogy content in addition to other Rise of Skywalker-related updates coming to Battlefront 2. The fact that EA continues to push out updates for a game thats over two years old, especially after such a rocky launch, is extremely commendable. We havent seen that new content yet, but if its of similar caliber to past updates then it will only serve to make Battlefront 2 even better. A Lackluster Campaign The campaign in Battlefront 2 is unchanged since our original review, other than the addition of a new epilogue chapter, titled Resurrection. Unfortunately, this doesn't add much more than an extra two hours to bridge the gap between the main campaign and the sequel trilogy of films. Overall, it's no better nor worse other than being slightly longer. Everything else Tom Marks said in his original review about the campaign rings true to this day: ~It mostly follows the story of Imperial Special Forces commander Iden Versio  a fierce leader who still manages to express compassion from her position within the Empire  from the final moments of Return of the Jedi into the era of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Despite its darker choice of perspective (we havent seen much from the Imperial soldier point of view since 1994s TIE Fighter), the plot moves forward in a fairly unimaginative fashion from there. Its a shame Iden doesnt get more time to develop as a character because Battlefront 2 does a decent job of introducing her (outside of some stilted dialogue in the opening scene) as a competent, sympathetic person. But Battlefront 2s campaign doesnt really have much of a cohesive story to speak of in which for her to complete a believable arc. Instead, it feels more like a series of barely connected missions across a smattering of recognizable locations, featuring the major characters youd expect. Its essentially digital Star Wars tourism tied around the loose concept of Idens battles in the final days of the Galactic Civil War. Not enough time is devoted to Iden and her relationships to give her pivotal decisions the context they need.~ Battlefront 2 does a lot of things right, offering a Star Wars experience thats stunning to look at and wonderfully faithful to the source material, but it stumbles hard on the delivery. The campaign is amusing but scatterbrained, and worse, in multiplayer the randomized progression systems are downright hostile toward its players. EA has already made two big adjustments to this system in the week leading up to launch alone, and we can only hope that more significant changes are on the way. But right now, the Star Cards systems frustrating progression is actively driving me away from the multiplayer battles.", "date": "Dec. 18, 2019,"}
