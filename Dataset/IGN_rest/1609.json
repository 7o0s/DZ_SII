And by done it, I don't mean announced a Psychonauts sequel. That would please us to no end. No, I mean they've just released another charming tiny Xbox Live Arcade experience, this time even more compact and immediate than Costume Quest or Stacking. Happy Action Theater Video Review Double Fine Happy Action Theater represents a giant step for Kinect gaming as it eschews any type of gamey exterior trappings. No menus, no consistent scoring system, no winners or losers, just play. That considered, we figured we'd get input from some real experts on playing, people who've never heard of words like 'eschew', or any back-of-the-box terms like 'innovative' 'revolutionary', 'unprecedented' and the like. I'm talking about children, and in particular, mine: Ryan and Madison Lynch. Ryan Lynch, 7 years-old  I really like Happy Action Theater. It's easy to play and there's lots of fun games to play with. If you're lazy, you can just stand there and the game will start and just go, you don't even have to really do anything. I don't know what the games are called but it doesn't matter, I know which ones are fun. This is the first game I can play with my little sister [ed's note: Harlow Lynch, 3 years-old]. She's little and she usually gets mad when we play Super Smash Bros. and she can't play. She gets to play with us, so that's half the fun. Some of the games can get boring to me, like the pigeons and the flowers. Some of my favorite games are Kirby's Return to Dreamland, Rayman Origins and Pokemon, this is different from all of those. Most of the games don't have levels and there's no boss fights, but that's ok. Madison Lynch, 9 years-old  This is different than all the other Kinect games we play. I like Dance Central and Kinectimals, but the controls in Happy Action Theater are so much easier to use. It's really weird how it goes from a room filled with balloons to letting you blow bubbles in an aquarium. Mostly it's just a fun thing. If you let it go, it will just randomly give you different events to do. I really like the building stomp game and playing in the snow. My little sister turned into a snow man! Some of the levels have hidden things that change the way you play, so you should experiment with and play around with things. There's a level with a red dragon and you're on a moving platform in space, and everyone if shooting lasers around. We accidentally figured out if you duck down to the ground, it makes a shield pop up. Secret things like that are fun to discover. Unlocking the Achievements can give you a hint about what to do on different levels, which I like and my Dad LOVES. Casey Lynch, too old  For me, DFHAT does everything my kids detailed and more. All told, there are 18 different games a somewhat slim offering - but could be worse, though using the wordgame might be a stretch. You see, these games are more toys you play with rather than typical games you play. Using Kinect, up to six people are transported to center stage in antic-filled mini events, some really great, some not as much. But for ten bucks, it's a pretty good value. Getting burned alive has never been this fun. A few excursions don't sparkle with the same level of fidelity as others, a concern not shared by the kids. These events weren't the kids' favorites, with its low-fi of an in-store Chuck E. Cheese show (see the melting psychedelic feedback and dance floor stages). Ask me, and I could be picky about it. I could even be critical about other stages that seem to hinge on the simplest and potentially boring concepts, like the Jello. Ask the kids though, and they just shrugged and kept playing, giggling. Some of the gamier challenges, including a riff on Space Invaders starring butterflies and the fireworks bonanza, feature explosions of XP and light scoring, but this all disappears once the next thing starts. That said, that sums up everything about DFHAT. So while you can continually play the same 18 events over and over once you've done so a few times, you've played the whole game. For some people, like my family, you won't care though. It beats the cost of taking the whole family to the movies or buying any full-priced retail Kinect game. But that's not to say that the game will only appeal to kids. DFHAT makes for a great Kinect party game for anyone who's tired of dancing and playing motion-controlled virtual tennis. It's hard to say more about it given the games lack of depth, but again, its intentional. The game aims to provide instant fun from the moment it's turned on, with as little barrier to entry as possible. DFHAT succeeds on both counts, just add players. CLOSING COMMENTS Double Fine Productions are a trusted name in video game development for audiences both core and family. Tim Schafer and team extend that legacy with Double Fine Happy Action Theater, delivering a fun collection of playful diversions well worth the moderate asking price.
