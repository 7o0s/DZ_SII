As it tracked my scent and inched closer, I felt my heart rate rise with every step I took towards my escape  and when Id finally made it to safety I breathed deep a sigh of relief. Just like Far Cry 4 before it, this expansion did an excellent job of immersing me in its new setting, and manages to be a raucous good time in the process. However, while Valley of the Yetis presents some interesting changes and its gameplay fundamentals are still fun, when the short campaign is over theres not much left to do. While basics of Far Crys first-person exploration remain unchanged, there are a few mainstays that have been done away with here. The most notable omission in this new location is the need to liberate any outposts. Instead, it places you (as Ajay Gale) in a single relay station that you must defend from nightly attacks. Forgoing the organic day-night cycle, assaults are triggered by advancing time. When the sun goes down, waves of soldiers - and eventually yetis - begin their onslaught, and the balance of fortification and frantic action feels just right. The ability to add defenses like machine gun nests or minefields  available either by completing side missions or by purchasing them for in-game cash  gave it an enjoyable tower-defense sensibility that meshes well with the horde-repelling action. This new defensive emphasis makes sense, given the relatively smaller scale of Valley of the Yetis. The snow-covered valley map is beautifully designed, and creates the impression that its much larger than it is. Sparse branches and brown leaves cover trees along the edges of snowy fields and iced-over rivers, while packs of wolves hunt high in the foothills and caves of the icy Himalayas. This is one of the best environments seen in a Far Cry game yet, to the point where Im somewhat upset there werent more areas like this in Far Cry 4. Of course, wolves are hardly the most dangerous creature in this icy playground. As the title implies, mythical beasts roam these hills - and they are both fun and frightening opponents in combat. Since theyre essentially 10-foot gorillas, the yetis are incredibly strong  usually one to two hits and youre dead  but theyre also alarmingly fast. I recall the first time I stumbled across the elusive beast in the open world; I had (foolishly) attempted to bring it down with a bow, and it gave chase. Assuming Id be safe, I hopped onto my snowmobile and sped off only to look behind me and see that the monster was gaining on me. Thankfully, it was distracted by a passing jeep full of human enemies and decided to focus on de-socketing some of their limbs instead of mine. It was organic moments like these that made me forgive the campaign's lackluster story. The core conceit of Expedition Finds Monsters, Goes Insane is good, but that was never the focus of the plot. Instead, were forced to listen to Ajay argue with the antagonist via radio, and any backstory I gleaned was from picking up various notes and journals around the world  many of which I missed or didnt feel compelled to collect at all. It wasnt until the final missions that I found myself even somewhat invested in my fight against the cult-like Disciples of Yalung, and even then that interest dissipated when I blasted my way through to the less-than-satisfying ending. Its a shame, too, because while the campaign missions themselves are fun and the nightly defenses and upgrade quests are a cool addition, theres not much else to do in the Valley aside from collect weapons and animal skins. You might say to yourself, Why should I bother picking up weapons? Ive already unlocked all the signatures! While in the main game youd be correct, in Valley Ajay is reset to zero  youll need to re-acquire all of his weapons, re-craft all of his bags, and re-earn all of his skills and abilities. Thankfully, this is made easier by the fact that XP is far easier to earn, and unlocking items and weapons are now done by finding chests and caches on the map instead of liberating bell towers. I understand that forcing us to re-spec our skills and loadouts may add a sense of progression and a couple of hours of playtime, but it begs the question: If youre going to make it so easy to re-earn everything Id previously unlocked, why bother making me repeat myself at all? Pros Cool new locationYetis are awesomeNight assaults Cons Reset progressionFew side activities While Valley of the Yetis fails to provide a truly engaging story or a convincing reason why we should go through the hassle of unlocking our weapons and skills for a second time, its new defensive missions and monsters add some depth to the already excellent core gameplay of Far Cry 4. Despite not having much to do outside of the campaign new defense missions, exploring the Valley of the Yetis is good fun - both as the hunter and as the hunted.", "date": "March 10, 2015"}
