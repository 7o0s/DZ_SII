The latest in developer Frogwares adventure series uses Unreal Engine 3 for a much-needed graphics upgrade. The more disappointing news is that Holmes final deductions are based largely on a web of circumstantial evidence. Crimes and Punishments takes place over the course of six perplexing, well-written cases that give Holmes ample opportunities to do what Holmes does best: Snoop around crime scenes for clues, interrogate suspects, and talk down to just about everyone he meets. Murder is afoot in each of the cases, but that doesnt stop them from being diverse; from a gruesome death by whaling harpoon to an Egyptian-style ritual killing, the plots had me riveted. And like a good winding mystery, the person who did it is rarely the one you suspect initially. My one criticism about the structure of these cases is that theyre all standalone stories, with nothing really linking them together except for the involvement of Holmes and his trusty chronicler, Dr. Watson. Holmes brother Mycroft, a British government official, shows up early on to foreshadow the concluding case, but otherwise the anthology just...ends. No overarching mystery, no grand denouement. Controlling Holmes from a third- or first-person perspective, discovering clues by searching crime scenes for evidence and questioning suspects is pretty easy and straightforward. Objects of interest are clearly marked by floating text boxes; some may require activating Holmes detective vision (similar to Batmans in the Arkham series) which uncovers secrets that would go unnoticed by lesser sleuths. Its a bit limited, since there are no secret areas or unlockables to uncover  but on the bright side, because detective vision didnt need to be activated unless I was prompted to do so I didnt waste time hunting for hidden clues that werent there. Some clues will require further research, such as consulting an archive of old newspapers and encyclopedias, while others may need to be tested in Holmes lab. Testing and picking locks present mini-puzzles that range from dreadfully easy to brutally difficult. A plus is that overly challenging puzzles can be skipped without penalty. While its easy to find clues, making the right sense of them can be another matter. Clues can be combined to make deductions, leading to the final deduction of the murderers identity. The problem here is that each case has more than one possible conclusion -- with only one being the correct one. Since many deductions are based on very circumstantial evidence (a rope was tied with a sailors knot, so a sailor must have been present!), theres rarely a proverbial smoking gun that clearly points toward any one suspect. Like a game of Clue, several possible outcomes are plausible, but only the final conclusion screen reveals whether the right call was made. Luckily you can go back and replay the conclusion until you make the right selection...IF youre able to combine the clues in the right way. Conclusions also come with a moral choice: Should the suspect be arrested or absolved of their crime? From what I could see, theres no reason for this feature to exist except to slightly alter the final cutscene; it doesnt change the gameplay for future cases or alter how people interact with Holmes. Its a mildly interesting inclusion, and I hope its fleshed out more in future installments, but the morality system is wasted here. Brief and, in relation to the rest of the gameplay, unexpected action sequences punctuate the climax of each case. Unfortunately, these sequences cannot be replayed; if a suspect commits suicide before you can shoot the gun from their hand, theyre dead permanently -- no backsies. On the plus side, these sequences showcase Sherlocks boxing skills and Watsons marksmanship, while also giving each story an extra rush of adrenaline and finality. What really sets Crimes and Punishments apart from its predecessors, though, is its sparkling new look. Its gorgeous on PS4 and PC; every character is rendered in rich detail -- so much so that you can see individual stubble and facial blemishes. Its one of the most beautiful adventures Ive played. Likewise, the voice acting is well done and pitch-perfect to Crimes style and time period. Pros Gorgeous visualsArresting casesVaried puzzles Cons Circumstantial conclusionsMorality system unnecessary Crimes and Punishments offers a huge advance in graphics and gameplay for the Sherlock Holmes adventure series, and is well worth playing for longtime fans -- especially if theyre playing on a new-gen console or PC. The cases are thoroughly enjoyable, but deducing the murderer can be nebulous and unsatisfying due to a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.", "date": "Oct. 1, 2014,"}
