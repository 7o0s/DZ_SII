But it doesn't have much in the way of, well, an actual game. What starts of as a novel premise quickly devolves into a sometimes mind-numbing grind, souring the initial promise of this quirky little indie game. More Pineapple Smash Crew Videos Pineapple Smash Crew puts you in control of four adorable looking mercenaries. No, really, their bulging armor and tiny heads  done up in charmingly old-school graphics  can't help but draw out a smile. The mercs only goal in life is to get money, done through smashing enemies in one randomly generated level after the next. Eventually they'll gain enough ~coordinates~ through completing missions to unlock the final stage, after which point you can do it all over again. Though why you'd want to keep going is beyond me. The missions just don't vary enough  in looks, design or enemy types  to keep it feeling exciting. Moreover money, ostensibly the reason you're doing what you're doing, is only used to buy respawns for your mercenaries. The gameplay hook that makes Pineapple Smash Crew stand out is its take on ~squad combat~ and weaponry. You control all four of your mercs at once, moving them about as a little unit, and firing all their guns in sync. In reality they operate as one avatar with four, slightly spaced out, limbs but it's nonetheless a smart way to make it feel different. Its take on grenades, which really just means all deployable secondary weapons in this instance, also makes for some initially satisfying action. Levels are littered with secondary items, and as you level up by gathering experience orbs you unlock even more. Some examples of what falls under the ~grenade~ moniker in Pineapple Smash Crew include an item that allows you to teleport to its location, killing everything in a line in between, a deployable flame thrower, as well as more traditional explosives. What they have in common is that they can all be tossed out at will, then later activated with a right click of the mouse. It allows you to, say, toss a machine gun grenade past a wall, activating it so it kills a bunch of enemies who can't get to you. Every member of your unit can carry a grenade at any one time, allowing you to quickly mouse wheel through them in order to, in principle, get the right grenade for the situation at hand. There are a lot of grenades to unlock, but none of them alter gameplay enough to feel all that significant. Plenty of games such as Tetris, Plants vs. Zombies and Angry Birds manage to be fun despite their repetition, most likely due to the slight, but important, tweaks they introduce to the gameplay. For instance a new zombie or offensive weapon might completely change up the tactics you use. More often these types of games might even introduce a new enemy type and grenade simultaneously, forcing you to adapt. Pineapple Smash Crew also introduces new weapons and minor alterations to enemies throughout its campaign, but they really change up how you play. A scarce few foes challenge you by having immunities to certain weapon types, with the rest just having a bit more health or armor. At no point did I unlock a new grenade that corresponded with enemies that made me mix up my tactics. Start to finish the gameplay was just run, shoot and blow up anything I saw in levels that quickly blended together. CLOSING COMMENTS Levels quickly went from being charming, engaging experiences to something I raced through as fast as I could. An hour into Pineapple Smash Crew I found I just wanted it to be over. And its not even long. There just isnt enough variation in any of its mechanics or level design to make it all that much fun for more than a few minutes, which makes the US $10 price tag feel a bit high. IGN RATINGS FOR PINEAPPLE SMASH CREW (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.5 Presentation The main menu looks great, but the rest of the game is bare bones. 8.0 Graphics The retro game look lends Pineapple Smash Crew some much needed charm, and helps it stand out. 8.0 Sound The music combines modern styles like dubstep with chiptunes, creating something that perfectly suits the mindless action. Id listen to this outside of the game. 5.5 Gameplay While initially fun, all the good ideas and mechanics are squandered in a game with so little variation in its level design that it becomes boring. 6.0 Lasting Appeal Randomly generated levels mean you could play this indefinitely, but it becomes tiresome after only a few minutes. 5.5 OVERALL Mediocre (out of 10) Levels quickly went from being charming, engaging experiences to something I raced through as fast as I could. An hour into Pineapple Smash Crew I found I just wanted it to be over. And its not even long. There just isnt enough variation in any of its mechanics or level design to make it all that much fun for more than a few minutes, which makes the US $10 price tag feel a bit high.", "date": "Feb. 10, 2012,"}
