Spanning four short, monster-filled alien worlds, Xeodrifter's quasi-8-bit art style, moody sci-fi trappings, and nonlinear, item-driven exploration all seem clearly meant to evoke Samus Aran's 2D adventures. Flexible weapon upgrades and clever ideas for interacting with the background elevate it above derivative-clone status, but it also fails to live up to its inspirations standards for enemy and boss-battle variety. Xeodrifter revolves around a little astronaut whose warp engine dies around a cluster of four planets, forcing him to scour their caves them in search of a replacement. Its four to six hours of the usual stuff - if water's blocking your way, for example, you need to be able to turn into a submarine, while scaling the heights of tall shafts usually requires a jetpack. The cool platforming twist is that you can jump into the distant background, which is actually a parallel plane, turning you into a tiny astronaut fighting tiny monsters until you can work your way past whatever obstacle has been set in front of you and leap back into the foreground. This puts the Nintendo 3DS 3D effect to excellent use, which - along with being able to see level maps and tweak your guns on the touchscreen, rather than a less-elegant pause screen - edges it ahead of the PC version. Xeodrifter takes an interesting approach to weapon upgrades, too. Scattered around its four worlds are health points and gun points, and the latter can be redistributed freely across five different categories. These can make your shots faster, more powerful, or more frequent, as well as scattering them in three different directions or making them move in wavelike patterns, letting you tinker with your starting pea-shooter until it suits your play style. (And you'll need to tinker, because apart from some vague icons, there's no clear indicator of what each category does.) You can also re-spec your gun at any time, as well as store three different configurations for fast switching. It's a fun feature, and it kept me experimenting and searching for hidden gun points even after the credits rolled. While gun points just lie around in the open, however, the six exploration-enabling abilities are earned through boss fights  and here's where things start to feel unambitious. Xeodrifter's a pretty short game, but even so, its pool of enemies is pretty small. Not only will you frequently encounter the same handful of palette-swapped creatures from world to world, which diminishes the distinctness created by their different environments, but the bosses are always the same type of monster: a giant, semi-adorable mantis-hedgehog thing with easy-to-spot attack patterns. These patterns stay the same from boss to boss; each subsequent creature adds something new, like a seemingly impenetrable energy shield that emits gigantic laser blasts, or the ability to belch miniature versions of itself into existence, but it also retains all of the previous bosses' abilities. It's a strangely fun approach  dodging a familiar attack from a new boss and dealing a ton of damage in return is awfully satisfying  but the lack of variety also means there's very little thought involved. Knowing enough tricks to quickly smash the final boss might make you feel like a badass, but it's only because you've already had too much practice for the beast to be much of a challenge. Xeodrifter also pads its four- to six-hour runtime with what feels like artificially high difficulty. There are checkpoints before and after boss fights, and you can save in your ship outside each level's entrance, but that's it. Dying after any amount of exploration or item-gathering can erase a lot of progress, which is especially frustrating when you're just backtracking all the way to the level entrance so you can move on after a boss fight. This is different from the challenge of a roguelike, since the levels arent randomized, and it gets repetitive when you have to retrace your steps frequently. It's also worth pointing out that monsters are usually placed in ways that make them very easy to run into if you're not keeping a careful eye out for them (one particularly annoying stretch puts a huge, powerful enemy right at the end of a long lake of magma that you have to dash across at high speed, making a collision almost unavoidable). And even if you're being cautious, there's always a chance an enemy will suddenly rocket into you from an off-screen hiding place, particularly when you're moving slowly underwater or navigating a hard-to-see background cavern. Pros Metroid-esque explorationTweakable weaponry Cons Repetitive bossesStingy checkpointsTedious backtracking Xeodrifter's mix of old-school 2D platformer sensibilities and new-school visual effects is charming, and finding a new ability that unlocks a new area tickles the same pleasure centers that Metroid does. Even when it felt like a pale imitation because of severely deficient enemy variety, the fun of experimenting with different gun behaviors and revisiting old areas to find new secrets kept my interest buoyed beyond its short runtime.<br><br> <em>Editors Note: IGNs Brian Altano contributed original music to Xeodrifter.
