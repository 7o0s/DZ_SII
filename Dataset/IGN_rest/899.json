Heres what we said then: With its recycled map and wildly overpowered abilities, playing Saints Row IV feels a lot like enabling god-like cheat codes in Saints Row The Third and going nuts. Its ridiculous story, goofy characters, self-aware humor, and amazing character editor make it all work, especially for those of us whove played the previous games and can appreciate its in-jokes. But its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge. It's just as much fun in Saints Row IV: Re-Elected for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, which repackages the old-gen original with all of its DLC and a strangely paced but creative new standalone adventure, Gat Out of Hell. Visually, Re-Elected offers a small but noticeable improvement over the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Saints Row IV. Obviously its higher resolution, the lighting's a bit nicer, character models are slightly more detailed, and everything moves a little more smoothly as you glide past at high speeds. It's not a huge bump, though, and it's still not quite as good-looking as the PC version was in 2013. Also, Re-Elected's only new gameplay features are a spate of neat-but-superfluous voice commands  which save you the trouble of using the d-pad to switch powers, or the pause menu to summon AI partners  and the option to use the PS4's touchpad during quick-time events, so theres no real replay value if you played the original. Then again, Saints Row IV was never notable as a technical marvel. Its appeal comes more from bounding through its familiar, bland city of Steelport  now with an alien, intentionally glitchy-looking makeover  with upgradable superpowers that make its highly customizable vehicles completely obsolete after just a couple of hours. Its weapons are bizarre (and occasionally obscene), its character-customization options are wildly varied, and its map is littered with destructively fun things to do. And while its story missions annoyingly strip you of your powers, they compensate with unique and unexpected experiences that range from quasi-2D beat-'em-ups to narrated text adventures. Interestingly, Gat Out of Hell doesn't really feature traditional story missions. Instead, it tasks you with completing handfuls of side activities for its condemned supporting characters, and triggers cutscenes once you've finished a certain number of them. It's an odd, somewhat repetitive approach, although making side tasks key to story progression does make them feel a lot more worthwhile. Especially because said story  which involves dead historical figures, fourth wall-breaking cameos, and a Disney-esque musical number -- is one of the more entertaining to come out of the series since, well, Saints Row IV itself. It's just a shame that Gat doesn't stand up quite as well as Re-Elected, performance-wise; not only does it look similarly last-gen, but at one point it bugged out badly on PlayStation 4, stuttering and halting until I reset it. It's also worth noting that while Gat comes on the Xbox One version's disc, playing it on PS4 requires a 7GB download using an included voucher. Pros Tons of contentFun superpowersAbsurd comedy Cons Looks last-genOccasional bugs Saints Row IV is just as much silly, largely challenge-free fun in Re-Elected as it was originally, even if it doesn't look as impressive as other recent remasters. Gat out of Hells short but fun demonic adventure doesnt really justify re-buying the whole thing, but the Re-Elected package is the best way to experience Saints Row IVs power trip for the first time.", "date": "Jan. 19, 2015,"}
