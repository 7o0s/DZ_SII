With killer clowns, skull motorcycles, and a hearse that launches exploding coffins, some might dismiss Twisted Metal at first glance. Doing so means missing some of the most fun, most ridiculous competition you can find on the PlayStation 3. Jaffe and his team at Eat Sleep Play have not only embraced the madness of car combat, but married it with the thoughtful, intricate balance found in fighting and real-time strategy games. Like the past installments in the series, Twisted Metal revolves around a deadly competition by the same name. Run by the enigmatic Calypso, the best and worst of humanity enter the competition to win a single wish. This competition plays out in a series of battles across the world that use cars outfitted with fiendish weapons. Twisted Metal Video Review But this Twisted Metal tournament is a little different. Unlike past games, only three main competitors enroll in Calypso's content: Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm, and Doll Face. Each of the demented drivers bring along henchmen to compete with, forming three gangs that wage war across suburbs and cities alike. All three groups (and a fourth group in the multiplayer modes) have access to every vehicle, meaning the iconic Sweet Tooth can drive other cars besides his ice cream truck. This three-party dynamic splits the single-player campaign up into three chapters. Each chapter comes filled with increasingly difficult, interesting challenges, and ends with a different boss encounter -- all of which rock with increasing degrees of hardness. The big question that comes out of this single-player campaign: why use live action cutscenes? Twisted Metal looks great, from the outrageous cars to the massive environments, so the live action segments do little besides invoke the lost endings shot for the first Twisted Metal. Granted, these cinematics look much better, but they feel out of place and -- more importantly -- they tell weak stories filled with holes. Also, can anyone explain why the Preacher shows up? When the proper battles begin, getting behind the wheel also means getting behind a tricky control scheme that takes time to learn. But Twisted Metal rewards those gamers patient enough to stick with it. Combat in Twisted Metal brims with old-school, arcade flavor. Besides the cars themselves, which all have unique abilities and stats, the wealth of power-ups littering each map feed traditional gaming sensibilities. Even the ~health semi,~ which drives around the level and rewards players with full repairs, tingles with the same energy as Spy Hunter's weapons van from 1983. The Clowns open fire on the competition. This arcade flavor complements Twisted Metal's overall intricacy. Cars boast different rankings for speed, armor, and the potency of their special weapons. Some cars have fairly basic abilities, like Death Warrant's Chain Gun special. Others, like Reaper's Chainsaw ability, feature exciting variations that require a little more skill but reward the effort. Add on the always useful power-ups scattered around and almost any car stands a chance, assuming the driver has the skill and know-how to earn a kill. In fact, much of the fun in Twisted Metal comes from the weapon variation. Outside of the eccentric and lethal special weapons, the standard power-ups have tremendous destructive potential. From standard missiles to remote mines, these power-ups delight and destroy in the same instant. Some require special care, including the sniper rifle that has a long ~lock-on time~ but rewards a steady aim with an instant kill. The freezing blast, shield, and landmine techniques also return, which deplete a special gauge that refills over time. These techniques give every car an extra set of abilities that fulfill both offensive and defensive needs. The single-player campaign only takes a day of dedicated play to complete, if not less. The majority of the experience comes from multiplayer. Split-screen and LAN support join the online suite, and these local options make for instant fun. After the initial appeal of ~so much chaos~ wears off, the strategy and finesse of the weapons set in and real competition takes hold. Doll Face, as portrayed in a live action cutscene. The online arena of Twisted Metal, even in its infancy, already has tremendous potential. Besides the occasional network error when joining a game, online matches run with sublime smoothness. Even though the AI puts up one hell of a fight in the single-player game, the most entertaining battles come from facing off against fellow Twisted Metal fans. With a nice assortment of game modes across both ranked and unranked match types, Twisted Metal multiplayer proves its worth within minutes of play. Earning experience by competing also nets you special rewards in ranked matches, such as unlocking new cars, sidearms, and even skin packs. Play enough and you can even earn augmented techniques to employ in the field. When it comes to Twisted Metal, complaints rarely spring up. As mentioned above, the controls require some acclimation because Twisted Metal feels different from its action-packed peers. The automated lock-on system, used with certain special abilities and power-ups, can frustrate from time to time. Frantic chases that require precise timing often fail thanks to the lock-on system that selects the wrong target. Clicking in the right analog stick -- which forces a target switch -- does alleviate the issue somewhat, but costs valuable seconds in a heated fight. Also troubling are the armor points of smaller, faster cars like Crimson Fury and Reaper. Although these cars do benefit from super speed and effective special weapons, they seem to fall quickly in battle, even against mid-armored vehicles. A player's extreme skill might keep Reaper alive for a while in the middle of all the madness, but death comes quickly for the weaker rides. CLOSING COMMENTS Like its predecessor from more than 15 years ago, Twisted Metal celebrates an eccentric kind of action that shoves fun down the collective throat of the gaming masses. It includes an enjoyable, challenging single-player campaign and incredible multiplayer support for both on and offline. Twisted Metal only falters when it comes to its storytelling and an occasionally stubborn lock-on system. Even with a transforming ice cream truck in its roster, Twisted Metal deserves some respect.
