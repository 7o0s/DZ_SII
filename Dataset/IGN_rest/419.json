Well, partly. Thanks to using the PlayStation Move controllers to interact with the environment I felt more like a detective searching for clues, but having my hands pass through other characters without them noticing left the physical side of being the Dark Knight conspicuously absent. I will keep this short, because this game is first and foremost a story and I wouldn't want to ruin its surprises  you only get one shot at experiencing it and being awed by the way it lets you experience developer Rocksteady's Arkham universe firsthand. Getting to stand face to face with characters that seem so small on a screen is a big jump  its a VR cliche now, but you wont believe the difference it makes until youre looking Oswald Cobblepot in the eye. Likewise, even though the detective work in this roughly 90-minute story is mechanically exactly the same as what weve seen in Arkham City and Arkham Knight, it feels more intimate in VR. Especially when I was using the move controller to examine bodies in the morgue, running the device in my hand over them to scan for clues, it felt great  like I was getting my hands dirty. It felt great  like I was getting my hands dirty. At the same time, all of the gameplay is very simple stuff, and much of the way you move around and interact with the world doesn't feel like a great fit for a character like Batman. What I love most about the actual Arkham games is the way Batman moves as I control him in combat and stealth. That makes me feel like a master ninja. But here, Batman teleports from place to place (which is more or less standard in VR games) but when he does move he's is just as much of a klutz as I am. And even though my hands are Batmans hands, I didnt get to punch anybody. The only hand-to-hand combat happens without your participation, so thats a disappointing lack of interactivity. Using the three gadgets is fun for a couple of minutes. You get to grab the Batarangs, scanner, and grapnel gun off your utility belt and aim them and shoot or throw, just like Batman would. Thats cool until you realize theyll only interact with very specific things in very specific ways, and the Batarangs have some crazy auto-aim that makes it all but impossible to miss as long as you're throwing it in the general direction of your target. Also, Alfreds face is impervious to being shot repeatedly by a grapnel gun. The appeal of the gadgets runs out quickly. The story (which again, I will describe in only the vaguest of terms) of Arkham VR is a fun murder-mystery spinoff to experience from a real first-person perspective, even if its a little predictable. Be aware that the events that occur make it completely incompatible with Rocksteadys established Arkham lore, so dont go in expecting to fill in any missing pieces or to learn what really happened to Batman at the end. This is its own thing. Arkham VR is mostly a one-and-done deal. Exploring the Batcave reveals a few more things to do, such as a Batarang target range, Riddler puzzles in which you reassemble fragmented statues, and browsing character profiles with holograms that appear in front of you as though they were really there. The Batcave has a few scattered references you can spot from its handful of vantage points, too. But beyond that, Arkham VR is a one-and-done deal. When I'd finished the story once, some of the most fun I had when going through a second time was fooling around in front of a mirror and making Batman look like a dancing moron. Being Batman in Akrham VR is a great way to more intimately experience Rocksteady's universe and to search for clues in this brief mystery. However, the world and characters around you are largely rigid and unresponsive to your actions, which leaves a lot on the table for a game about a character known as much for his brawn as he is for his brains.", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
