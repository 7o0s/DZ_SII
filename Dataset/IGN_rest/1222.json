Such scenarios are typical of The Guided Fate Paradox though, where a Japanese high-schooler-turned-Fairy Godmother named Renya is forced to grant the wishes of all manner of mythical creatures. Don't let the levity of the premise fool you though, because while its a unique dungeon crawler with lots of interesting tactical decisions to make, it will also punch you in the mouth. In essence, The Guided Fate Paradox is two games; one a light-hearted graphical adventure, the other a tough-as-nails isometric dungeon crawler. The two are essentially bolted together into one RPG, presenting a story via simple cutscenes sandwiched between the exploration. Each chapter of the story presents a problem of some sort, which is slowly resolved via cutscene over the course of the dungeon. Its the sort of thing that has the potential to become rote and boring very quickly, but The Guided Fate Paradox manages to keep things interesting by leaping from genre to genre, one chapter indulging in a light deconstruction of Cinderella, another featuring a Helms Deep-style battle against a charging horde of demons. It never goes anywhere particularly meaningful in its exploration of these tropes, but scenes like the one in which Renya coaches a timid zombie on the ins and outs of horror conventions are funny on their own merits. The story is also aided by a sharp localization peppered with winking double entendres that won't win any prizes for subtlety, but nevertheless accomplishes the important feat of not being gross. In fact, compared to the likes of Project x Zone and Ar tonelico, The Guided Fate Paradox feels like a paragon of self-restraint in the way that it generally favors wit over gratuitous panty shots. And if youre uncomfortable with your angelic assistant wearing a costume that wouldnt be out of place in a Japanese maid cafe, you can always dress her in a fish head and put her in tank tread boots. The Guided Fate Paradox is strange (but fun) like that. Its also quite deep, which means that players have plenty of tools with which to navigate its dangerous corridors. For instance, when dealing with enemies, its possible to use one of Renyas sharp-looking special attacks, throw one of the objects scattered around each level, induce status via various orbs that can be purchased at the store, or go into Renyas super saiyan form. All of these abilities must be put to good use too, because if they arent, the enemy forces can quickly become overwhelming. The net effect is that each encounter in The Guided Fate Paradox feels like an interesting puzzle. Every step represents a turn -- when you move, so do all the enemies -- making the action slow and methodical, encouraging you to deal with encounters efficiently rather than brute forcing it. This is especially true during boss fights, which are frequently loaded with basic enemies that must be dealt with by any means necessary, quickly becoming an extended chess match in which the final checkmate is often very satisfying. Its the sort of combat that seems really simple at first, but has a lot going on beneath the surface, making it much more than a simple grind. Its all pretty great, at least until the gloves come off around Chapter 4, at which point The Guided Fate Paradox starts to show its true colors a bit. A ten floor marathon with no breaks in between, Chapter 4 is loaded with tough enemies, which ratchets up the difficulty significantly. Compounding the issue is a really nasty death penalty in which you lose half your money and all of your items, with no way to save in the middle of a floor. You can always reload and try again, but its frustrating to screw up against a boss and lose all your progress. To be clear, its not that its hard so much as unevenly paced and overly punitive. Chapter 4 actually has one of the toughest boss fights in the whole game -- an enemy rush in which you must defend an NPC -- making it something of a bottleneck for progression. Each floor in The Guided Fate Paradox is also randomly generated, so it's quite possible to have a bad run in which you cross paths with every trap and abomination imaginable and die within minutes of reaching a floor, or to get catapulted into a crowd of enemies with no real hope of escape outside of an Exit item Just your typical god trainee folks. The customization also reflects The Guided Fate Paradoxs somewhat schizophrenic nature. Its actually pretty deep, and a series of tutorials do a great job of taking you through it step-by-step, but its still a bit of a mess, the main problem being that its never quite clear how powerful you actually are. You lay out these stat tiles on a grid, which can be enhanced by directing energy through them and laying out various Holy Artifacts; but because you dont unlock abilities as well, theres only a vague sense of becoming more powerful. Compounding the confusion is the fact that you reset to Level 1 when you die, but retain your enhanced base stats, meaning that youre technically more powerful than before sort of. Its a system that would have benefited from some editing to sharpen the sense of progression, especially since its really frustrating to be stuck in one dungeon, mired by the sense that you will never be powerful enough to overcome it. But its uneven difficulty and vague, overly-complicated progression dont keep its fun sense of humor, engaging combat, and attractive graphics from shining through. This is a JRPG that prioritizes good, sound tactical dungeon crawling over fan service, which is not something that can be said for the Hyperdimension Neptunias and Ar tonelicos of the world. Its a positive throwback to the days of the PlayStation 2, when niche offerings like Disgaea could become bonafide cult hits. Those middle-tier RPGs arent nearly as prevalent today, making The Guided Fate Paradox a nice surprise. Pros Sharp localizationUnique sense of humorRewarding strategy Cons Vague progressionUneven difficulty The Guided Fate Paradox suffers from uneven difficulty and customization that could charitably be called ~byzantine,~ but it manages to overcome many of these flaws with its over-the-top sense of humor and rewarding strategy. Though it's often unforgiving, it's a good RPG, and a fine addition to the PlayStation 3 library.", "date": "Dec. 8, 2013,"}
