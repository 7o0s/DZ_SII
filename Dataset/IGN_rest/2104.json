Chris The Boulder Redfield or Leon The Hair S. Kennedy? Could Hunk take Ada Wong? What would happen if Claire Redfield fought Jill Valentine? What if one of them could transform into a Tyrant when they died? Those are the kinds of questions that Resident Evil Re:Verse seems to exist to answer in the form of a third-person deathmatch shooter thats launched as a free bonus for owners of Resident Evil Village. It definitely has its moments, thanks in large part to its surprising death mechanic that transforms heroes into iconic monsters. The most frustrating part is how unfinished it feels, with the precious little content it has suffering from some noticeable balance problems and some bad monetization habits. Sony Playstation 5 Console Standard Edition . . 2,498.00 View on Amazon  The concept is simple: choose from one of six Resident Evil heroes and enter a six-player free-for-all. The small roster is a whos who of the series lore: Chris and Claire Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy, Ada Wong and, for some reason, Hunk. Sorry, Winters fans  pun-enjoyer and Father of the Year candidate Ethan Winters is nowhere to be found (likely because he doesnt have a face) nor is his daughter Rose. Were only rolling with the classics, apparently  which is fine for purists, but this meatgrinder could definitely use more fresh blood. What We Said About Resident Evil Village Roaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors. I got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as I did retracing my steps through the gradually revealed recesses of its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast. Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode. The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads. But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistfull of Lady Dimitrescus freakish fingernails. - Tristan Ogilvie, May 5, 2021 Score: 8 Read the full Resident Evil Village review. Each character has a unique loadout composed of two guns (a pistol with unlimited ammunition and a special weapon) and two unique skills. Chris is a close-range killer armed with a hell of a right hook and Indomitable Spirit, which prevents him from being knocked down, staggered, or even dying while its active. Combine that with his assault rifle and a passive skill that makes him deal more damage as his health goes down and hes a menace at close to mid-range. Jill, by contrast, is more of a specialist: she trades survivability for higher damage output and increased damage after dodging, and can lay down mines and attack with a knife at close range. Leons your all-arounder. His health regenerates when it gets low, and he rocks a shotgun and a roundhouse kick for close encounters. Hes weaker at mid-range but compensates with an ability that lets him dual-wield his pistols. Claire comes equipped with a revolver and a passive that means she reloads when she dodges, a quick heal in the form of an adrenaline shot, and an alternator that shocks nearby enemies. Well get to Ada and Hunk a bit later, but all the characters offer distinct playstyles and their loadouts line up nicely with their portrayals in their respective games. Re:Verse can be surprisingly fun until its other issues get in the way. Once youve chosen your character, youre dumped into one of just two maps: the RCPD or the Baker House. They both look great, courtesy of the RE Engine at least, they do after you turn off the comic book filter that looks like someone stretched a fishing net over the screen. Deathmatch is the name of the game here  literally, in that its the only game mode Re:Verse has to offer. The goal is simple: kill as many people as you can before the five-minute timer expires. And, strangely enough, it can be surprisingly fun  at least until Re:Verses other issues get in the way. While Re:Verse is primarily based in the mold of a hero shooter, it does incorporate classic arena shooter ideas. Power weapons spawn on the map after a minute passes. Usually a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, or a lightning gun, these weapons only give you one shot but do tremendous amounts of damage if you land a hit. Ammo for special weapons is also scattered around the map, as are health-restoring green herbs, which are essential for long-term survival if youre not playing Leon or Claire. These additions reward smart play by adding an element of strategy to how you navigate the map and encouraging you to venture into otherwise dangerous areas to nab a power-up that can change the outcome of a match. The real game-changer, however, is that in typical Resident Evil fashion, death isnt the end. If youre killed right off the bat youll come back as a Fat Molded, one of the basic enemies from Resident Evil 7, and chase survivors around until youre killed for good, building energy all the while for a self-destruct that can take out everyone around you, if you play your cards right. However, if you manage to pick up a Virus Canister item before someone takes you out, it will increase the damage you deal while youre alive and then transform you into a more powerful creature once you shuffle off this mortal coil. With one Virus Canister youll become either Resident Evil 7s Jack Baker, complete with chainsaw scissors, or the Hunter Gamma from Resident Evil 3. Picking up two canisters (the most any character can hold) means transforming into either Resident Evil 2s Super Tyrant or Resident Evil 3s Nemesis. Because the transformation happens almost instantaneously on death and theres no way to know which of the monsters will emerge from the corpse of your victim looking for revenge, every fight with a survivor is a tense experience. This uncertainty generally means youll be running for your life the moment they go down. Awkwardly, though, theres no sprint button, so everyone moves at a weird half-trot unless theyre dodging. Who wins is more complicated than simply racking up the most kills. When youre on the transforming end, creatures are very powerful and a blast to play. They can see other characters through walls and, in addition to their regular attacks, come equipped with two special abilities of their own. The first, like the Super Tyrants Leaping Strike or the Fat Moldeds Enrage, is generally meant to close distance. The second, such as the Hunter Gammas Devour or the Nemesiss Pursuing Tentacle, either knocks down or executes a target, depending on how much health they have left. Any of the creatures can clear a room in a few seconds, and each one is appropriately scary. A Fat Moldeds small size, speed, and ability to explode mean that it always has a chance when creature combat devolves into an all-out brawl, even against a Tyrant. The only downside is that creatures lose health over time and will eventually die no matter what  the question is how many people you can take with you before you go. Who comes out on top of the scoreboard, though, is more complicated than simply racking up the most kills. Killing someone in the current top three, maintaining kill streaks, getting revenge kills, and executing targets award more points than a regular kill, while dying costs you five points. As a result, matches can turn on a dime if someone goes on a run. In one match, I went from last to second place because I managed to put together a good minute as a survivor and follow that up with a killstreak as a creature. Since the top three players at the end of the match are considered winners, its fairly easy to pull games out of the fire at the last minute, especially if you happen to be playing the right character for the situation you find yourself in. It adds tension to each match, but it can also make the results feel more luck-based than you want in a competitive game. Its not all down to chance, though, because while its too early to have definitive knowledge of character power, at the moment Ada and Hunk seem to simply be better than everyone else. Ada deals enormous damage and has more dodges than the other characters, and can even dodge while being hit at low health. Hunk has above-average weapon damage, can turn invisible, and has a backstab that does more damage while cloaked. The other characters can win; Ive been in matches where the top three, including myself, were all playing as Leon. But those are outliers, and the difference in character power and usage is already fairly noticeable and doesnt feel good with a roster this small. Jill, Chris, and Claire are rare, while Ada and Hunk are constants in nearly every match Ive played. Its not uncommon to see the top three be entirely Ada and Hunk. Theyre that good. Dead Money Playing matches earns you points which can be spent to buy perks for your characters  five for a survivor, and three per creature. These can increase the damage or duration of skills, add critical hit damage to weapons, buff a characters passives, and so on. Its standard stuff, but theyre quick and easy to unlock and allow for a lot of player expression  and unless the perk in question is character specific, unlocking it for one character opens it up for everyone. Perks also have upgradeable levels, but as far as I can tell that functionality isnt available yet. Theres a battle pass, naturally. It costs $9.99 and, as you might expect, you dont get much for staying in the free tier  a minor reward every other level. If you want to customize your characters looks, youll basically have to open your wallet. The bigger problem is that several of the best perks, like the ones that allow you to see virus canisters, herbs, and ammo from further away, or boost damage from standard creature attacks, are locked behind the battle pass. All of these are available in the free tier, but they are substantial gameplay advantages locked behind a system that rewards you for paying money; you earn 50% more points and unlock an additional challenge to complete once youve paid for the Premium Pass. Aggressive monetization in a game like this isnt surprising, but the lack of content is. Six survivors, five creatures, two maps, and a single game mode just isnt much to play with. Worse still, theres no way to play casual matches unless youve brought your own friends to play them with in a passcode-protected private lobby. Theres no option to simply create a room and let people join, or search for one yourself. Capcom has promised more content is coming, and balance changes will have to happen if Re:Verse is to survive, but as it stands, this feels like a beta that really wants you to spend money on it. Its a shame, because Re:Verse can be a lot of fun to play. Running around as Jack Baker and welcoming people to the family by punching them in the face, whipping out two pistols as Leon and going to town on someone youve snuck up behind, or nailing someone with the Nemesiss rocket launcher are all great moments of Resident Evil-flavored action. And while there are only two maps, theyre both fairly well designed, with lots of areas of obstacles to navigate and set up ambushes in. Theres even a pretty clear skill ceiling here for those who want to dedicate themselves. Good players can stay alive for a long time, racking up killstreaks and making sure they have enough virus canisters to transform into a powerful creature when they go down. Its just a shame that everything here feels so rushed and incomplete. Theres a good multiplayer game somewhere within Resident Evil Re:Verse, but whats here now is in desperate need of balance changes and more content. This third-person deathmatch is an interesting take on the franchises most iconic locations and characters, and it has some good ideas  especially giving you a second life as a fan-favorite monster. That can be fun in short bursts, but nearly every match made me wince at its unbalanced roster, lack of variety, and monetization methods that make better perks more easily available to those willing to spend cash. Resident Evil Re:Verse will need to grow into a lot more than this if it wants to become something better than a novelty for completionist Resident Evil fans.", "date": "Nov. 4, 2022,"}
