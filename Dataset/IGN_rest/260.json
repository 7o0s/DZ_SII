While it suffers from a couple of pacing problems and some finicky navigation issues, its careful - and sadistic - manipulation of my fight-or-flight reflex had me experiencing an overwhelming sense of dread throughout, which abated only once the credits were rolling. The ending, however, stayed with me for days. Outlast 2 benefits from ditching the somewhat tired mental asylum setting of the original and travelling the less-trodden road of the Sonoran Desert, where protagonist Blake Langermann is searching for his wife Lynn after crash landing in the cult-ridden Supai region during an investigative journalism assignment. Outlast 2 is deep South horror, but without the trappings of domesticity we saw in Resident Evil 7; Supai is untamed cornfields, dilapidated shacks, and  go figure  gory remnants of unspeakable religious rites. Its a lot more open than the original, which adds to an authentic horror experience. With multiple labyrinthian structures and outdoor environments like tall grass and rivers to hide in, its easier to simply run from enemies, but its also harder to see them coming. I felt constantly disorientated while blindly running to a half-glimpsed place of safety, and while this might look like bad game design on paper, its effective in practice when the goal is to create a sense of desperation. Developer Red Barrels has created a world where linearity exists but is deceptive, where each escape feels skin-of-your-teeth frantic thanks to smart world building. Much of this comes down to Outlast 2s use of lighting. Youre armed only with your camcorders battery-reliant night vision mode to make your way through the omnipresent darkness, and because you spend most of your time being chased at a clip you have to rely on the most basic of visual signals to stay on the right path. Here, fires, dim lamp-posts, and flickering fluorescent bulbs mark the way, but never obviously enough to dim your panic. Overall, traditional video game elements in Outlast 2 have been kept to a minimum, which kindles the minute-to-minute sense that youre surviving by your own scared wits with little to help you along the way. Bloody handprints indicate that someone has crawled up a ledge before you, for example, but you have to look hard to spot them. Batteries for your camera  Outlast 2s most vital resource  are few and far enough between to be believable, but not to a crippling extent, as I was only without a handful of times. Mostly I just feared running out. Even Outlast 2s occasional puzzles, the most traditional staple in the survival horror genre, feel vital to your progress rather than busywork to keep you occupied. Turning off electricity and finding rope to access an out-of-reach area are not unfamiliar objectives, but theres euphoria to be found in small conquests that inch you forward in the face of dozens of angry cultists. The only real aspect of Outlast 2 that breaks the illusion of authenticity is Blakes limited maneuverability. While making him move like an all-star athlete would go against the limitations that tend to define the survival horror genre, its frustrating how context-sensitive and inconsistent his movements are. Although he can jump across wide gaps if theyre there to be jumped across, he cant leap over small objects on the ground, and while he can clamber over some waist-high obstacles, he cant climb over others of similar height. Couple these limitations with your own frantic panic, and youve got a recipe for instant death when you run toward an obstacle that appears surmountable but isnt. The Evil Within And you will very likely die in the 13-odd hours of Outlast 2, as I did multiple times. Like the original, you are completely (and lets face it, inexplicably) unable to defend yourself, so fleeing or hiding from enemies are your only options. The garden-variety enemy - a mix of deranged and deformed religious cultists and heathens  are dangerous, but you can take a few knocks from them before you die and not all will attack if you keep a respectable distance. Among these, however, are a handful of creatures who pursue you relentlessly and kill you much faster  think the Xenomorph in 2015s Alien: Isolation. These monsters  and one utterly terrifying human(?) woman  are faster and smarter than the aforementioned rabble, so while you can evade them for a while by hiding, they have a curious tendency of digging you out of your hole. These enemies make for Outlast 2s most frustrating moments, as your encounters with them tend to have instant-win and fail states, and therefore encourage dogged trial and error rather than on-your-feet thinking. Take the time I was being chased through an empty school by a creature with a lacerating tongue, for example: there was only one way to escape, but as it wasnt immediately obvious to me, I died over and over again (complete with one tongue-through-the-crotch impalement) until the horror of the moment had entirely dissipated, and I was too annoyed by the creature to be afraid of it. On the other hand, they also make for Outlast 2s most frightening moments, as Red Barrels has built wonderfully creative scenarios around them to maximise their impact. Being pursued by the tongue creature in the dark in a labyrinthian library comes to mind, or slowly inching a cart forward that will allow you to climb over a wall to escape the Tall Woman while she gurgles her malicious prayers at your heels. These are some of the most terrifying moments Ive experienced in a horror video game, ever. Mind Games Throughout all of it, Red Barrels has explored giddy themes of struggling with ones faith and the extremities of belief to varying degrees of impact. Outlast 2 jumps semi-regularly from the present to the past, where we revisit the heavily Catholic school of Blakes childhood. These more quiet sections start off as welcome reprieves from the mayhem of the present day, but gradually take on a far more sinister turn as the events of the past begin to unravel themselves. Some of Outlast 2s most effective  and at times, touching  moments occur in the fluorescent-flickered corridors of Blakes school. However, there are simply too many of them with too much repetition, and during the middle of the story, they drag down the pace significantly. More, to understand the deepest nuance of these sequences, you must record certain vistas and objects around the world and then play them back complete with Blakes commentary to gain an insight into his head. Considering how horrific the world is, the impetus to voluntarily explore more of it is low. Still, the messaging in Outlast 2 is broadly effective, and I applaud Red Barrels for tackling such ambitious subject matter. Its bold ending, in particular, will inevitably divide players opinions; as for me, I thought it was a tour-de-force that made me laugh in disbelief. Outlast 2 is a terrifying sequel that builds upon the scares of the 2013 original. Even if its ambitious themes dont always land and navigating through its world can be frustratingly inconsistent, theres more wicked creativity at play here than Ive seen in a horror game in a long time.
