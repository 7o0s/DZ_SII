If you microwaved your copies Kingdom of Heaven and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade and made a scented candle out of the molten goop you might get a whiff of what developer Kite Games is going for here. However, while the result is a competent strategy game overall, its also a bit repetitive and shallow  and subsequently not quite as fun as that previous fusion sounds. MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 LHR 12GB . . 3,260.00 See it  An adequate way to quickly describe The Valiant might be as a 13th century Company of Heroes. A more accurate parallel, however, might be 2018s Ancestors Legacy thanks to its broadly comparable Middle Ages setting and its very similar range of unit types. They differ considerably in terms of story, though; while Ancestors Legacy is more overtly inspired by historical events (albeit loosely), The Valiant is a the tale of a retired crusader knight, Theoderich von Akenburg, and his search for an ancient and dangerously powerful relic  which hes racing against an equally dangerous Templar of doom to recover. Joining Theoderich along the way is a brave band of medieval expendables, plucked from several corners of the post-classical world. Praise the Sword The Valiant is the kind of RTS that takes a more intimate approach to tactical, top-down combat by focussing on individually managing a handful of units rather than an enormous army. This approach brings with it a fair degree of initial accessibility, because juggling the actions of a half-dozen or so small squads is certainly a lot more straightforward than managing giant swarms of them in something like StarCraft 2. The Valiant also does quite well at pacing its 20-hour campaign to slowly and organically teach us how each of the units tick, rather than handing over the keys to the castle from the first mission. The campaign definitely gets a bit samey in stretches, with a lot of identical encounters staged one after the other, but it was engaging to be exposed to brand-new squads, like the healing War Priests, even late in the main story. Even though certain missions are built around specific units' abilities, there's still some inviting flexibility here in terms of how we can approach each mission. Even though certain missions are built around specific units abilities, theres still some inviting flexibility here in terms of how we can approach each mission  and that really opens up in the closing stages of the campaign when all the unit types are unlocked. Only a finite selection of the main heroes and the backup mercenary squads can be taken into each battle, which is a smart way to compel us to find and embrace the tactics that work for our own style instead of being tempted to simply enlist one of each and toss them all into the grinder. For instance, my playstyle is slow and methodical, and thus I found myself gravitating towards doubling down on archers whenever I could. Archers dole out piles of damage from afar but are cut down in any sort of close quarter combat, so my approach was to draw the enemy into battle with my tank-like heroes up front and then rain arrows upon them from a distance. I found cavalry handy, too, for quick hit-and-run strikes against enemy archers  but mounted units are, in turn, vulnerable to spearmen and shieldbearers. This scissors-paper-rock philosophy is obviously typical of the genre but its something that The Valiant not only does well, but also communicates clearly in its menu screens. The aggressive micromanagement required can get a little boring and exhausting at times. However, things do become a little more cumbersome once you layer on the special abilities and various supernatural powers The Valiants heroes possess, or earn as they level up. The aggressive micromanagement required can get a little boring and exhausting at times  and personally I got pretty numb to all the math disguised as magic when success regularly comes down to fastidiously spamming special attacks and boosts, watching them cool down, and then spamming them again. There are some keyboard shortcuts that speed it up a fraction, but it can feel like a bit of a grind. Outside of combat, the need to backtrack considerable distances to replenish squads at camps tends to bog things down, too  and the lack of a manual save option is very annoying when you need to replay lengthy battles that couldve easily had one or more extra checkpoints. Theres some very basic base building in The Valiant, but only in a few siege missions, and its limited to a trio of defensive towers and the chance to build catapults and trebuchets. These missions arent quite as fun as they seem, as they dont seem totally suited to the deliberately constrained squad limit of The Valiant. That is, you need to take over resource facilities around the map in order to build a modest camp and the necessary siege engines  but you cant really protect all your resource facilities and your camp with your limited squads. You have to traipse back and forth, retreating to your camp every couple of minutes as the castle sends out an attack. Theres a decent variety of locations  even if the combat is all effectively the same whether youre fighting on snowy mountains, dense swamps, or blazing deserts  and they do look nice at a distance. Character models arent exactly brimming with detail when you zoom in, but to be fair theyre designed to be seen at a few millimetres tall. Some of the missions let us tackle objectives in the order we choose but outside of that The Valiant mostly channels us through a specific, linear series of encounters. There are 16 story missions, and there are additional challenges you can toggle on when redoing them, but there arent any Im desperately keen to play again  especially following the infuriating final boss fight. This last clash  which inexplicably strips away every perk, buff, and weapon The Valiant spends the entire campaign encouraging you to select and curate  is absolutely awful and bafflingly hard. Its deeply unsatisfying to suddenly have bog-standard enemies shrugging off blows from the trash weapons I discarded a dozen missions ago, and having all but one of the special abilities youve earned arbitrarily removed doesnt just feel anticlimactic  The Valiant is outright cheating against you at this point. One Knight Stands Its a shame the stench of the final battle lingers like a fart in a suit of armour, because I otherwise enjoyed the story overall. Theres a fair bit of filler in the middle, and The Valiant has a habit of sidetracking Theoderich with the needs of random royals interrupting his own quest, but the writing is earnest and the voice acting is very good. Right now the multiplayer is deader than a medieval monarch with an ambitious, knife-wielding nephew. The Valiants story campaign isnt the only mode available  technically, theres also PVP play for two or four players, and a cooperative PVE horde mode for three players called Last Man Standing  but its really the only scene at the moment. Right now the multiplayer is deader than a medieval monarch with an ambitious, knife-wielding nephew, making it all but impossible to get much out of it unless youve brought your own opponents. The Valiant is a serviceable, squad-based RTS that serves up some usually well-balanced sword-clanging action for its heroes and their small bands of merry men, though it wears a bit thin once its evident how repetitive and backtrack-heavy the battles can get. Theres a sturdy story to drive it forward, though it too is let down at the last moment by an ill-considered final battle that renders all your decision-making throughout the campaign worthless. And while The Valiant does have multiplayer, dont count on being able to find any opponents to clash with online.", "date": "Nov. 1, 2022,"}
