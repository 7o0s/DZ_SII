Miles Morales journey from zero to hero is brought to life with jaw-dropping animation, whimsical callbacks to previous Spider-Man media, and memorable side characters from the multiverse that range from fan-favorite Spider-Gwen to the outright bizarre Spider-Ham. The unique and often brilliant 3D animation style is a fantastic aspect of the movie, though it does take some time to get used to. Its like watching a comic book being brought to life, complete with vibrant colors, a few KAPOWS, and some actual thought bubbles sprinkled in for dramatic effect. With so many American animated films resembling Pixar nowadays, Into the Spider-Verse is a visual experience unlike anything weve seen before. Those one-of-a-kind visuals add an otherworldly look, which is appropriate since the story is not set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Into the Spider-Verse is a visual experience unlike anything we've seen before. Into the Spider-Verse wisely takes its time when it comes to rolling out its story, allowing for strong character development as we learn more about Miles (Shameik Moore) and his family life before the web-swinging begins. The Morales family is genuinely engaging, especially in the complex relationship the creative Miles has with his hard-nosed police officer father Jefferson and his estranged uncle Aaron. Miles search for the right kind of mentor is a big part of his character arc. On the superhero side of things, after Miles is bitten by a genetically-modified spider, the story gets crazy in a good way. In typical comic book bad-guy fashion, Kingpin creates tears in the space-time continuum and gains access to an infinite supply of alternate Earths  and their Spider-Men. As over-the-top as that is, writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman create a deeply personal story for the infamous villain that feels more authentic than the easy I want to take over the city for no reason approach. The character design for Kingpin looks appropriately menacing, too, and feels distinct from his recent appearances in other Marvel projects, including Netflixs Daredevil TV show and Insomniacs Spider-Man game. Here, hes a gigantic and physically intimidating blocky mass in a black suit, with Liev Schreibers deep booming voice emitting from it. Into the Spider-Verse would have benefited from spending more time with its intriguingly deep villain instead of focusing the majority of its time on its spandex-wearing heroes. Kingpins dastardly deed brings a diverse group of Spider-People to Miles Earth. The best of the bunch is an older, more jaded version of Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) who enjoys burgers and bagels more than exercise. Miles and Peter are the perfect odd couple: one guy doesnt want to be a superhero anymore, while the other passionately wants to learn how to be one. The unlikely duo is entertaining, especially in the first half when Miles is still learning how to use his powers. Peter is no Yoda, and his lack of patience with Miles allows for some hilarious banter, which is bolstered by Johnsons charismatic performance as the elder webslinger. Peters frustrations are not unfounded since Miles journey to superhero status is a slow one, and thats a good thing. Instead of a rushed training montage, a good chunk centers on Miles struggle to accept and trust his new abilities. Its a refreshing take on an origin story and adds a nice bit of suspense, making Miles legitimately doubt if he has what it takes to join the superhero elite. Once Miles does figure it all out, his youthful exuberance is palpable whenever hes swinging through the brightly lit New York City streets, thanks to Moores strong voice work. As a superhero, Miles embraces many of the characteristics that Peter exhibits: bravery, kindness, and a strong connection to his family. But Miles way of being Spider-Man is different enough to not make him seem like a copycat, and helps this feel like a fresh, new Spider-Man story instead of a retread of familiar material. When hes in action, Miles distinctive set of superpowers - his ability to stun opponents and use camouflage to become all but invisible, to name a few - are thrilling to see on display. Into the Spider-Verse helps set Miles story apart in more ways than just his personality, layering on aspects that feel uniquely Miles. Rather than solely relying on orchestral accompaniment, we hear the melodic beats of contemporary artists like Post Malone and Swae Lee to tie into his love of music and hip-hop. Even Miles style of clothing is unique, with his red-and-white unlaced Nikes and spraypainted spider emblem on his costume. Miles definitely has swag. Though this story is Miles, the other members of Team Spider-Verse each have their moments to shine, particularly in the larger action-packed fight scenes. Apart from Peter, Spider-Gwen, (Hailee Steinfeld) has the biggest and most compelling character arc here. Spider-Man Noir (brilliantly voiced by Nicolas Cage) is particularly memorable, as is Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), whose Looney Toons-inspired animation is charming. Rounding out the team is the futuristic, anime-inspired Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and her trusty SP//dr suit thats bonkers, and a lot of fun to watch. Spider-Man Noir (brilliantly voiced by Nicolas Cage) is particularly memorable Each new Spider-Person is introduced with an amusing montage, offering a glimpse at the respective heros origin story. A few of these scenes offer humorous callbacks to old Spider-Man cartoons, comic books, and even video games. In the same way that The LEGO Batman Movie paid homage to and even poked fun at previous portrayals, Into the Spider-Verse follows suit by embracing both the good and the cliche aspects of Spidey over his 50-year existence. Into the Spider-Verse is confident that its not going to be audiences first time experiencing a Spider-Man story and leans into that, striving to at the very least show us a story weve never seen from him  or rather, them  before. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hits all the marks to be an all-around moviegoing blast. Miles Morales has a memorable big-screen debut thanks to a compelling story and strong performances from its heroes and villain. Alongside Peter Parker, Miles journey from everyday teenager to a genuine city-saving superhero is one of the best Spider-Man movie stories ever. The addition of other multiverse characters doesnt overshadow Miles story, though Kingpin does get a bit shortchanged. Taking a bold departure from the Pixar animation style weve come to expect from mainstream animated films, Into the Spider-Verse delivers a dynamic visual experience unlike any other.", "date": "Nov. 29, 2018,"}
