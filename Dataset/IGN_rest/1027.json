Its got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is whats going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning. A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as Talion, a former Ranger of Gondor, is ritually executed along with his family. Talions spirit is then bound to an amnesiac elf ghost and returned to Middle-earth for vengeance against Saurons forces. Its a story that doesnt make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars, but its well-acted. It makes decent use of Gollum, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly Ratbag the comic-relief uruk, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army. My interest in the plot dwindled toward the end, but it does a fair job of explaining why Talion has such sweet supernatural powers with his sword, dagger, and bow. Much like in the Batman: Arkham games, you can choose to stealthily pick off enemies one at a time, or dive head-first into a brawl with dozens of opponents and beat the crap out of them with a smoothly animated series of attacks and counters. Unlike Batman, of course, Mordors involve great, gory decapitation and stabbing animations, and outside of the scripted story missions, there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas. Its enticingly freeform. Acrobatically slaughtering Saurons ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jacksons movies, and its more fun to do than to watch. Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman  which is to say its amazing. Mordors take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that youre almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what hes doing and counter instantly. Its extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though its kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, its great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know youre there. What really sets the feel of Mordors combat apart from the Batman games is that its really easy to get into trouble, especially early on. If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds, or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map, you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle. Picking out the shield bearers and ax-wielding berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when youre completely surrounded, and it goes downhill from there. Health doesnt recharge much on its own, and until you can upgrade your health pool, you may find yourself succumbing to death by a thousand pinpricks if you dont retreat. Things got a lot easier a few hours in when Id leveled up and unlocked more of Talions skill tree so that I could build up combos quicker, execute two enemies for the price of one, and even fight mounted on a huge, rancor-like graug who pops uruks into his mouth like jellybeans. It feels powerful, but I still dont feel invincible even with everything nearly maxed out. And whats really cool about Mordor is that whether you win or lose a fight, something interesting happens. If you kill an uruk captain, he drops a rune that can be slotted into one of your weapons for bonuses. Some of them changed the way I played, like the legendary rune that extended the amount of time I have to score another hit before my combo count resets by 10 seconds, and one that made me immune to poison attacks. If any uruk kills you, even if hes a random grunt, he levels up and earns new abilities and some cooler armor. Maybe he gets promoted up the chain of command. Youll definitely run into him again later to settle the score, and hell have a new introduction taunt about his victory when you meet. It makes each death feel meaningful. Most uruk captains do tend to die too quickly to really become memorable, but some definitely did. (Sometimes theyll survive being apparently killed by you and come back with a scarred face.) For that reason, and to identify the arrival of a significant threat, I never really got tired of the action-pausing cutscenes that play when a captain shows up. There are enough different voices and multiple possible lines that I rarely saw repeats, and the uruk faces are surprisingly well animated and expressive. Even though the hierarchy is a pretty simple system when you understand what its doing, and realize that these uruk captains arent actually roaming the map in real time, its great to play with. Uruks have an internal power struggle for rank, and you can interrupt their duels, feasts, hunts, and more to pick fights and kill off Uruk captains and ultimately the powerful Warchiefs. Each captain has his own randomized strengths and vulnerabilities, so every fight is at least a little different. I ran into a couple of guys who seemed invulnerable to almost everything, which was a little annoying  one fight took me about 15 minutes of repeatedly chasing down a captain who was invulnerable to my sword and dagger and filling him with arrows trying to damage him faster than his health regenerated. Eventually, though, they all went down. In the second act, you transition from the bleak, brown map to a refreshingly greener-looking area of Mordor. There, Talion and his elf-ghost buddy suddenly realize he can mind-control uruks and turn them against each other. (It feels like something mightve been cut out there.) Thats even more fun, because the ability to brand an enemy gives you the choice of either killing a captain for a rune reward or controlling him and siccing him on one of his former allies. Taking an uruk alive can be trickier than lopping off his head, though, so its more challenging to accomplish the new goal of mind-controlling five Warchiefs. I love how you have the option to mind-control a Warchiefs lieutenants, then kill the Warchief, to watch your minion become the new Warchief. I did notice that the mind-control visual effect caused some slowdown on the PlayStation 4 version (the Xbox One version has yet to arrive for testing), but it didnt interfere much with combat. Charging through the decent but less-exciting story missions would probably take around 12 hours, but the goal of killing or dominating the Warchiefs is much more time-consuming and interesting. I spent around 25 hours to reach the end, and theres still a lot of challenging side missions based around testing sword, bow, and dagger skills left to do. And, of course, lots of collectables and wildlife-hunting challenges. 6GB? Now THOSE are textures! On the PC side Mordor also compares to the Batman games, in that its of good quality. There are even some enhanced graphics settings, including an ultra-high texture setting that requires a full 6GB of video memory. My only issue with it is some awkward menu controls, but most of those are customizable and those that arent arent too inconvenient to get used to. Pros Great combatEnemy progressionLosing mattersMind control Cons Unexciting campaign missions Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies. Ive had many more memorable and unpredictable battles with its randomized Warchiefs and captains than I did in the scripted campaign missions, and I expect those to keep on coming.", "date": "Sept. 26, 2014"}
