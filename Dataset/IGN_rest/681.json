This journey through the legends of Norse mythology is supported by utterly beautiful hand-drawn animation and a rousing soundtrack that all comes together to create a place steeped in mysticism and reverence. As Thora, the battle-hardened viking warrior who unceremoniously drowns one stormy night at sea, youre given a second chance to prove your courage to the gods. And even while the larger story of a battle against elemental giants called Jotuns unfolds, Thoras backstory and stoic personality shine through in her narration, fantastically delivered in her strong voice and native language. Each themed level of the Jotun realms is spectacular, not only for the beautiful atmosphere, sweeping backdrops and vistas, and environmental dangers, but for the thoughtful inclusion of mythology ingrained in their design. Youll engage lightning-pylon puzzles in the clouds to recreate constellations and connect sky bridges of light. Youll slide down the roots and climb the branches of Yggdrasil, the world-connecting tree. Youll travel through vignettes to learn the Norse myth of creation, and evade attacks from Jormungar, the colossal sea serpent that encircles the entire world. And though actually moving through these levels isnt particularly difficult, exploring them for hidden items like the life-bar extending Apples of Ithunn, braving the occasional enemy, and collecting the runes from each region never felt boring or unengaging. Jotun is a slow experience, to be sure, but its roughly 10 hours are best appreciated and savored for its artistry, rather than completed as quickly as possible. That is until you confront each realms Jotun, where the priority becomes memorizing complex attack patterns in the erupting chaos of the colossal encounters. And they are colossal. Jotuns amazing use of scale successfully instills the feeling of insignificance against the hugeness of the Norse world. Defeating the titanic Jotuns is the fast-paced, action-heavy storm to the calm of exploration that precedes them. Thoras arsenal is modest by comparison  an axe with a light and heavy attack, and a dodge. And though you do earn the blessings of the Norse pantheon by discovering each deity's shrine  Thor's power increases your heavy-attack damage, Freya augments your speed, Heimdall lends you his protective shield and Frigg bestows upon you her gift of healing  you're limited in the number of times you can rely on these abilities. Each encounter sparks a hectic dance of avoiding massive attacks while navigating environmental pitfalls. Picking the right moment to strike back is almost always a tough challenge. And though much of the fights revolve around memorizing their attack patterns, do to their sheer size and prowess, avoiding the barrage of elemental death is still a complex proposition. Pros Beautiful animationRousing soundtrackThoughtful designExcellent atmosphere Cons Minor visual hiccups At the end of my journey through Jotun, I was left wanting more of the excellent mythological world to explore and experience. Despite very minor frame rate dips and the occasional glitchy element, the beauty and wonder of Jotun unfolds like a storybook and deserves attention.", "date": "Oct. 1, 2015,"}
