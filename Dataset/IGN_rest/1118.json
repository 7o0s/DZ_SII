But if subverting expectations is a core tenant of horror, Whistleblower drops the ball by making every second of your adventure feel like deja-vu. As the title suggests, you play as the man who tipped Miles Upshur off to the horrific goings-on at the asylum. Shortly after sending the inflammatory email, youre captured and forced to endure the horrors of the crumbling institution. Whistleblower acts as both a prologue and epilogue to the main game, and contains some genuinely interesting story beats that help flesh out just what the hell has been happening. Once again, there are also documents scattered about that provide well-written bits of information on world and its inhabitants. Sadly, a lot of the environments in the expansion feel like retreads of places we've already been to. Your journey is ostensibly the inverse of the main game -- you start in the underground laboratories, and eventually make your way to the asylum-proper. But wrecked offices, disgusting bathrooms, and foggy exteriors lose their evocative power the the second time around, and this general sense of familiarity really works against Whistleblower. The DLC still maintains Outlast's impeccably gruesome visuals and sound design, but doesn't ever manage to deliver anything truly refreshing. Enemy encounters and scare patterns feel exactly the same, removing quite a bit of suspense. Sure, the jump scares still got me 100% of the time, but Whistleblower failed to build that great sense of tension that the opening hour of the original did so successfully. A strange thing about a lot of these jump scares is that they appeared to me as audio-only. Whether because I had my night-vision off, or perhaps I was facing the wrong way, I was often greeted with a loud bang, a violin snap, and no visual clues whatsoever. Moments like this come across less as terrifying, and more just straight-up confusing. You're still powerless against the ghouls that roam the asylum, so you'll have to run and hide anytime you're spotted. This is where a lot of Whistleblower's problems come to surface. Mission objectives are vague, and the level layout is more labyrinthine than ever. This led to a lot of frustration when I was trying to run away from a pursuer without any clue where I needed to go. There's also a heavy emphasis placed on climbing up very specific and easily missable surfaces, which only compounds the confusion. It gets even worse thanks to a slew of narrow hallways that often forbid you from maneuvering around your attacker when cornered. Even more so than the original, I found myself dying over and over until I figured out where the game wanted me to go, and what it wanted me to do. Nothing kills horror and tension quite as swiftly as frustration. Pros New narrative bitsGreat sound design Cons Repetitive scaresBland environmentsAnnoying enemy encounters Outlast: Whistleblower delivers more of the same gruesome locales and jump-scares as the core game, but doesn't introduce much new to the horror experience. Its sound design is still top notch, and it took me to some dark places that few video games ever dare to go. But while Whistleblower sheds a bit of light on the mysteries of the original, but ultimately feels far too familiar, far too often.", "date": "May 11, 2014,"}
