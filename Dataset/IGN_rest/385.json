I've sent out some of the new workers to clear the brush away in an attempt to quiet it, but they're taking their sweet time and poor Enoch just can't handle it. Right as he's lugging the first meat he's ever cooked over to the community stockpile, the madness takes him and he drops the meat and runs babbling into the woods. And that's how it goes in Clockwork Empires. It's a colony-building simulation that's at its most interesting when the comfy clockwork of daily life gets jammed and things go almost literally to Hell. If it weren't so dull and cumbersome the rest of the time, I could lose myself in it for months. On paper, at least, the setting's fantastic (in both senses of the word). It casts you as the representative of a steampunky incarnation of Victorian Britain who's tasked with founding a colony in the dark places of a randomly generated Earth. Here there be no dragons, but there are bandits and anthropomorphic fishmen and cultists who dream of becoming them skulking in the isometric shadows. In its best moments Clockwork Empires thrives on these dangers, as each new building threatens to disturb ~That Which Is Best Undisturbed.~ The Lovecraftian layers are thick and welcome, although I usually had to scrounge for the steampunk references suggested in the title. When they do show themselves, it's usually merely through endearing monikers like ~Ebenezer Peleg~ or weapons like the Leyden rifle. The most steampunk thing about it is the ability to make units called ~steam knights,~ but the colonies already start looking like proper cities by the time they come into play. That's a shame, as a stronger dose of that flashy brass-and-leather steampunk personality could work wonders for Clockwork Empires. As it is, its world winds into action around a fairly by-the-numbers colonization sim in the style of Dwarf Fortress, where packs of settlers rummage for resources while I tell them what buildings to toss up. There's no multiplayer, but a wide selection of different biomes with different starting conditions allow for variations that create some replayability and challenge. But you have to dig for it, because almost without exception, the first 30 minutes of a new map ooze to life with all the hurry of a fog menacing the banks of Lovecraft's Miskatonic River. These intrepid colonists rarely choose truly ideal places like breezy meadows; instead, they plop down in thickets littered with scattered resources on lumpy terrain that must be laboriously leveled before any buildings of consequence can go up. It doesn't help that you can't directly boss around your people: the best you can do is stamp a grove with the ~Chop Trees~ command and hope someone wanders over to do it. Thats a style that goes all the way back to Dungeon Keeper, but in that revered game and others like it the AI was trustworthy enough to pull it off. In Clockwork Empires, often your people will take the hint, but sometimes they don't. Sometimes I'll have to cancel the action entirely and re-issue it to get someone to help out. This battle with the AI never fully ceases. Push the speed into double time (the only time-compression option) and you can actually see the people hiccuping around as the AI tries to figure out what to do next. Most of the villagers seem somewhat like real people, though, thanks to a Sims-style personality system that reflects the current goings-on, sometimes with humorous effect. My ill-fated first attempt found Everett Glazier, ceramicist extraordinaire, mumbling about with a sickle and hammer over his head in protest of my initial failure to keep the pantries stocked. I laughed at Nellie Rivetson when I learned she'd taken an interest in genealogy and just as quickly realized her people never amounted to much. The great humor that developer Gaslamp Games previously showed off in Dungeons of Dredmor shines in such moments, although it's never really clear if these interactions really amount to much aside from fluff. Brother, you've got a stew going. Such uncertainty hangs heavily over Clockwork Empires, and it's not all because of the monsters lurking in the mist. A text-heavy tutorial with diminished monster events does a good job of explaining the system of assigning overseers and workers to buildings to boost their production, but it's nearly useless for learning how to juggle the user interface, which grows more unwieldy as matches lurch on and the population counters increase. Finding that perfect playthrough where most of this stuff handles like clockwork can be rewarding. I found the gears locked nicely into place more often than not, as even in playthroughs with the tutorial disabled I could usually fend off whatever threats slithered in from the shadows until many days in. By that time, I usually found myself more interested in the lightweight economic strategy through the trading post as I catered to rival powers who'd stop by to buy and sell. Night is particularly dull as nothing usually goes on while I wait for my people to wake and work again. The music in such moments evokes visions of blubbery things that go bump in the night, but in truth the monsters here strangely tend to be morning people. Reaching this point largely entails embracing the surprising freedom Clockwork Empires' construction provides. I could build a tiny, cozy kitchen with one stove, for instance, or I could make a veritable food factory where multiple ovens crank out deliciousness and keep settlers' minds off cults and the like. It helps that the visual details of decorative and utilitarian objects are just as fun to look at as the people when zoomed in close, even if the simplistic structures themselves seem to come from a different era entirety. It'd almost be dull if it weren't for the constant threat of something ending it all, and if the fishmen don't get you, play long enough and you'll fall prey to the near-inescapable likes of meteor showers, crashing zeppelins, and giant, tentacled horrors. Something's cooking in the kitchen. I was one of those kids who used to build ornate sand castles with the intention of watching them erode with the tide, so I find some satisfaction in this. But even with its wonky AI and its barely intuitive menus, I find myself admiring Clockwork Empires for the way it emphasizes keeping your head about you while earth is slipping into madness all around. For better or for worse, it's a game for our times. Most of the time, though, it's just a little too normal. It certainly doesn't help that the pacing is slow as a whole, with long stretches passing by with nothing significant happening, even when running at double speed. Thats partly because its Lovecraftian elements also don't always shake things up like they should. In one attempt, the horror-themed events were so rare that for hours the only real horror was the mundane worry of trying to make enough food to feed everyone. Other attempts balanced them better, but never quite enough to offset the annoyances of the AI and the interface. There's a lot to love in the way Clockwork Empires attempts to break up the construction sim framework with Lovecraftian creatures and almost assured destruction, but it often takes too long to get to the best parts and fills that time with dull busywork. For most of the hours spent, it's largely a standard colonization simulator that's hampered with an unwieldy user interface and weak AI.", "date": "Oct. 27, 2016,"}
