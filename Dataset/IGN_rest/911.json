And to give credit where its due, it isnt just doing it for the sake of it. Their products have always had an interesting hook, be it a feature or an eccentric design, their desire to differentiate itself from others have yielded many an interesting result. Although admittedly, not all of them have hit their mark (the Strix gaming headset comes to mind). Coming from the same mold is the Asus Gladius - named after the swords of Roman Gladiators - a top of the range gaming rodent that manages to tick all the correct boxes for anyone looking for a proper gaming device. Its got familiar aesthetics and features, with the unique hook being that it allows you to change its left and right click switches, which very few mice have offered yet, if ever. So, lets throw this mouse into the Colosseum and see how the rest of it holds up. Design Having reviewed the Razer DeathAdder Chroma recently, I can immediately notice the similarities between it and the Gladius. Thats not necessarily a bad thing as the classic design lends familiarity and comfort for all types of grips to the device. Asus has tweaked the design only slightly, providing more belly support and curvaceous buttons for better grip. Whats entirely new is how the left and right click buttons behave. Unlike most gaming mice, the two buttons are not part of the main body mold. Instead, they are fitted independently from each other, something Asus claims increases responsiveness. Another reason for going with this design is that the Gladius allows you to change the left and right click switches if ever the default ones wear out. Asus has thrown in an extra pair of Japanese-made Omron switches which are dependable for approx. 2 million clicks. Replacing the switches is as easy as popping out the teflon pads to access the four screws underneath them and removing the top shell. However be warned, doing so will make your default teflon pads pretty useless and you will have to replace them with another set (which thankfully, has been provided in the package). Its a shame Asus could not come up with a better solution for this. Not only will you have to invest in a new set of teflon pads if you ever want to replace the switches a second time, but you also have just one shot in aligning them correctly. Aside from ergonomics, Asus has kept an eye on the style and portability of the device as well. Asus always has a knack of making great looking products and the Gladius has received some of that love as well, with a sleek bullet-color top shell and cool asymmetric lines on the body. The overall look is accentuated well by the funky Mayan-inspired square lines on the side grips and the ROG logo at the bottom of the device. Asus has also ensured great portability allowing Gladius to detach from its cable, and has also provided a nice little bag for easy carry. The best part about this is that the cable is not proprietary so you can use any data cable with it if the one provided is damaged. When it comes to build quality, the Asus Gladius has some big shoes to fill what with being named after the swords used by the Roman Gladiators. I am happy to report that while it may not survive an actual death match, it will more than hold up in virtual ones. It doesn't feel as sturdy as the DeathAdder or the Steelseries Rivals though, but I doubt it will buckle easily. Performance The Asus Gladius uses the Avago ADNS-3988 sensor, which incidentally is the same one used in the Razer DeathAdder. Considered to be one of the best and most reliable, the sensor is capable of pushing to 6400 DPI, with 50G acceleration and a staggering 2000 Mhz polling rote. As such, the Gladius has its basics covered, employing a top sensor that is known to get the job done. To further unleash the power of the Gladius, Asus suggests the use of the ROG Armory Suite, a software package that thankfully is robust and extremely easy to use. It features the usual suspects: the ability to customize each button to your liking, two sensitivity stages, angle snapping, and polling rate. It also features separate sliders for acceleration and deceleration of movements which I am sure many pro-players will immediately appreciate. Through the panels, you can also control the illumination on the scroll wheel and the logo, although unlike the DeathAdder Chroma, it doesnt allow you to change colors. Also included are support for macros, and mouse pad calibration with the software carrying separate presets for different types of pads like cloth, glass, metal, wood, etc. In terms of actual performance, the Gladius aced at whatever was thrown at it. Apart from an intensive workout with TitanFall, I also used the mouse as my daily driver at the office to do a myriad of different task including Photoshop, Premiere Pro editing, and browser-based activities. The Gladius remained comfortable and accurate on long sessions, and held fast even during the most erratic movements. Pros Great design and ergonomicsFantastic performanceSwappable Omron switchesGood customization Cons Swapping switches can prove to be complicated I have no qualms in recommending the Asus Gladius for those looking for a high-end gaming-grade mouse. At approx AED 400, the Gladius is competitively priced and offers more than most gaming mice at that price range. Its got excellent ergonomics, style and portability, and its use of a true and tested sensor means that its a champion performer as well. The ability to change the left and right click switches is an added benefit that prolongs the use of the device than most others.", "date": "Jan. 1, 2015,"}
