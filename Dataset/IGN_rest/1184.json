Fighters flip off walls, clang their swords in midair, then weave between deadly traps until, finally, only one is left standing. But none of it is choreographed. Great duels break out time and time again, and whether I won or lost, I was having too much fun to really notice. But its local-only multiplayer means its couch co-op or nothing. High-stakes Smash Brothers isnt a perfect analogy, but its close. One tiny arena contains up to four combatants, each armed with a sword and a gun with three rounds. Any strike, be it from bullet or from blade, is enough to end your life. You can jump off walls and other platforms in a tiny, two-dimensional arena. Its mechanically simple, but that creates plenty of room for fake-outs and other satisfying mind games. Its all about tactics. Say your opponents have three bullets and you have none. You could try to maneuver in close enough for the kill, or you could try to fake your assaults until they waste their shots in order to even the playing field. Talented or highly confident players could even try to deflect incoming bullets back with perfectly timed sword swings. Samurai Gunns arenas are small and its characters are quick, meaning you dont have much time to alter your tactics on the fly. The fast-paced, always-on sort of mentality I had to adopt while playing is stressful, but exciting and rewarding. Of course, sometimes youll just jump around like lunatics and mash on the attack button until one tiny, squarish character explodes into a pool of pixelated gore. Thats one of the Samurai Gunns best qualities: it requires essentially zero commitment. The controls are minimal and simple. Matches usually last only a few minutes, and though there are several different characters and skins, theyre all functionally identical. You can hop into a game, slice eight foes apart, and get back to the kitchen before the microwave beeps to tell you your hot chocolate is ready. While there isnt a ton of level variety aesthetically, the shapes they take add twists to your standard combat. One map is lined with icicles that can be dropped onto unsuspecting enemies; another is packed with plants that have to be cut away before you can reach your enemies. It lets you shape your battlefield, and the patterns and tunnels you carve into it by the end of the match  like a memento of the destruction you caused together  are always a neat to see. Playing bot matches in survival mode, while not nearly as satisfying as facing off against real opponents, is your only option if youre alone. You defend against waves of deadly enemies, and their AI is impressive enough to give you a challenge while youre learning the ropes but after playing with friends, this solo mode feels empty. Firing an upward shot and catching a wayward jumper just isnt as satisfying when theres nobody to turn to and taunt. Thats its biggest problem: Samurai Gunn may be quick to pick up and easy to play, but the convenience of its gameplay is counterbalanced by the inconvenience of getting four friends together with four gamepads plugged into your PC. The fact that theres no online multiplayer mode feels like unboxing a puzzle to find half of the pieces missing. Pros Tight quick combatEasy to pick upInteresting levels Cons No online multiplayerWeak single player Samurai Gunn is an excellent example of how games can do more with less. Its combat is deceptively simple, there are no character advantages, and the tight, dangerous environments each feel unique. However, the lack of an online multiplayer mode will likely keep it relegated to great party game status. One warrior is simply not enough.", "date": "Dec. 19, 2013,"}
