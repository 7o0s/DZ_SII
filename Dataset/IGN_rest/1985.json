And to that extent, Asus deserves credit where its due  its latest gaming laptop, the Zephyrus Duo 15 features two screens encased in a surprisingly slim and lightweight exterior. The dual-screen setup may not necessarily serve its intended purpose all the time  and just might be an expensive add-on to many  it is easily one of the more interesting ideas to be implemented in a largely stagnated product category. Design and Features Before I dive deeper into the two displays, let's talk about the overall design. Without the second screen, the Duo 15 looks like most other gaming laptops. It has a gray exterior, with the ROG logo on the lid. It's not a giant laptop, by any means, measuring 14.2 x 10.6 x 0.8-inches and weighing 5.5-pounds. It's not a portable machine, of course, but you'll have no issues lugging it around your home or office, and occasionally tossing it in your bag to take over to a friends house for a gaming session. There are ports on three sides  a design feature I absolutely love. Being able to plug things like power, Ethernet or HDMI into the back of a laptop and out of sight provides a clean look on my desk. On the rear here, you'll find I/O ports for Ethernet, USB 3.2 Gen 2 and HDMI 2.0b. On the left side is where the two audio jacks live, one for mic in and another for audio out, along with the charging adapter. On the right side is a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 Thunderbolt 3 port, and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports. The USB-C port not only makes it easy to connect newer smartphones and accessories but you can also use it to connect to any DisplayPort 1.4, Thunderbolt 3, and Power Delivery devices. You can also use it to charge and power the Duo 15 at up to 65W and use the laptop for everyday tasks. ScreenPad Plus The Duo 15 comes with two displays  a 15.6 UHD (3840x2160) display, and a 14.09 3840x1100 touchscreen secondary display. The main display is expectedly great - as it is the case with most Asus gaming laptops - with colors, brightness and response time being up to the normal standards. I received the 60Hz model which I would recommend against, as the faster Hz displays are always worth sacrificing a bit of image quality over. Truly, once you experience what 120Hz or 240Hz displays have to offer, there is no going back; 60Hz almost feels ancient technology then. The star attraction of the Duo 15 is, of course, the secondary display, called the ScreenPad Plus. It behaves like a 14 ultra-wide screen where you can switch from its default below-4K resolution to 1080p for better viewability. When you open the lid of the laptop, the screen lifts to a 13-degree viewing angle. The angle is more than steep enough to view whatever's on the touch-capable panel without having to worry about glare or readability if you're sitting up and over it. At arms length, however, it's not quite steep enough for me to read it without leaning in. Its also tasking on your neck after using it consistently for an hour or two. I would almost always come away with a sore neck and shoulders from using the ScreenPad Plus extensively. I wish it was a little bit more adjustable where I could bring it closer to myself or angle it further for better readability.  Asus envisions users to use the ScreenPad Plus to place toolbars and supplementary apps on it, giving them full use of the main display while adding functionality through the narrower touchscreen just below it. Or if you stream and use Xsplit, you can have your broadcast controls and video feed below the main display. I, however, mostly used the screen to host my Microsoft Teams and Whatsapp chats, as placing Photoshop or Premiere Pro toolbars would either get confusing or painful after extensive use. Maybe I just need to get used to it, but in my two weeks of time with the laptop, I mostly used the screen to host apps that I only needed to focus on for a short period of time at once, like chats, or a video feed during transcribing an interview. The ScreenPad Plus has its own set of tools that, thankfully, makes using it a breeze. The pre-installed Screen Xpert software adds some much-needed functionality that is simply absent in Windows for dual-screen setups. When you move a window around in the main display, a small pop-up gives you the option to move or pin that window to the ScreenPad Plus, or force the window to go full screen across both the screens. The software also allows you to create any number of shortcuts to your favorite apps and folders, which you can launch by simply tapping on the screen (Windows does a reasonably good job in remembering your window position so you wont have to re-position them all the time). You can also change a few options in the Settings menu like screen brightness, default window size, hide the pop-up menu, disable keyboard, and more. Asus also includes the Armoury Crate software, which is one of the few apps that truly uses the ScreenPad Plus to its benefit. The software is able to show vital internal statistics like temperature, clock speed, and more, at a glance, and also allows you to switch between the different performance presets quickly. So how useful is the ScreenPad Plus for gaming? Not much. Unless the game natively supports this particular dual-screen setup, there is not much you can do with it otherwise. Currently, only Dying Light 2 supports the Duo 15, and if you want support for Fortnite and other online games, Asus suggests downloading Overwolf, which is not exactly intuitive or particularly useful. So, if you were looking forward to setting up some a crazy multi-screen layout for your games, it just isnt possible right now. Keyboard and Touchpad The Duo 15s keyboard features your standard chicklet style keys and is fitted with gaming-oriented features such as N-key rollover and 1.4mm travel distance to keep things nice and responsive while gaming. It took me a while to get used to the soft keys as I use a mechanic keyboard as my daily driver, but I was typing away at my regular speed soon after. The keys are responsive and accurate, and you dont necessarily miss the tactility of a mechanical keyboard all that much (which would had been difficult to fit into this body along with an additional screen). Due to the second screen, the keyboard has been pushed towards the bottom of the laptop, which means you are will have to use the included palm rest for proper comfort. This is an acceptable solution if you are using it on a desk, but on a lap or somewhere less ideal, the keyboard gets a tad bit too uncomfortable to use over longer period. Adding to the woes is the touchpad, which is quite possibly the worst I have seen on a laptop. Its narrow dimensions and sloppy detection make it a hassle to navigate around Windows, although you should be able to get through with some patience and perveance. The touchpad also doubles as a digital numpad, which is fine to use in a pinch but not something I will ever gain favor with. I would rather pull out a calculator than use that. Speakers The Duo 15 uses twin smart amp-powered speakers to pump up a wide, clear, and distortion free sound. It gets enough loud to fill the space around you, and has surprising amount of bass to enjoy some music in a pinch. Of course, its less than ideal if you want to consume any serious media, which is the case with most laptop speakers, but the Duo 15 has a decent setup if you dont feel like wearing your headset. But if you do indeed go that route, Asus has fitted the laptop with the ESS Sabre HiFi DAC with Hi-Res Audio certification, so youll get some decent audio quality if you pair it with a good quality headset. Battery Life Using IGN's battery life benchmark test, where we play a video on repeat with the display brightness set to 50% and turn off extraneous features like keyboard backlighting, Bluetooth and location, the Duo 15's battery lasted 142 minutes or 2 hours and 22 minutes. That's right in line with other gaming laptops I've tested, and just enough to watch a movie, but that's about it. Thankfully you can use a portable battery pack and the USB-C port to keep the battery going while you're mobile. Heat and Fan Noise Asus has smartly used the 13-degree tilt of the secondary screen to its advantage by using it as a means to provide better cooling to the laptop. The tilt allows the laptop to open a larger 28.5mm air intake which ideally should increase the airflow by up to 30%. This coupled with the liquid metal thermal compound used on the internals means that the laptop should run sufficiently cool for longer periods. On the exterior of the laptop, the heat is barely felt. The keyboard remains cool to the touch even after a few hours of gaming, although it being pushed away from mid-section of the laptop due to the secondary screen also helps it remain cooler. The backside of the ScreenPad Plus does get quite hot, but the screen itself doesnt so you can use without any problems. Fan noise remains along the same levels as with other Asus gaming laptops I have tried in the past year. On the Silent and Windows performance presets, the laptop runs quiet, making it the ideal preset to browse the internet or do some lightweight work. The Performance and Turbo presets are recommended for performance oriented tasks like gaming or video rendering, and thats when the fans really kick in. They can be loud and bothersome, so youll have to either turn up the sound to drown out the noise, or plug in a headset. Performance The mighty duo of Intel i9-10980HK and Nvidia RTX 2080 Super with Max-Q tuning resulted in expectedly great performance across the board. As you can see from the benchmarks below, the laptop breezes through games at the highest settings possible at 1080p, and even pulls through with reasonable performance at 4K resolution. Gaming Benchmarks: Game 1080p 4K Far Cry 5 99fps 46fps Rise of the Tomb Raider 75.79fps 40.93fps Shadow of the Tomb Raider w/RTX 58 22 Shadow of the Tomb Raider w/o RTX 88 39 The Division 2 73 28 3D Mark: Benchmark Points Time Spy 8889 Firestrike 4K 5595 Firestrike 19770 Port Royal 5505 Sky Diver 32081 PCMark 10 6115 In real life performance, the laptop was able to produce solid and steady frame rates across a variety of games I tried, including Overwatch, Apex Legends, Warzone, Doom Eternal, etc. The 60Hz screen was a bit of downer, so I plugged the laptop to my 2K 165Hz screen to unlock the full potential of the laptop. I was easily able to 100fps+ on all of the aforementioned games at 1080p by playing them at low-medium settings. For online games, I dont really mind the lower quality graphics as I am more focused on mowing down enemies rather than marvel at the sunrays breaking through the dense forestry. Doom Eternal, as well optimized as it is, ran excellent at max settings and was a pure joy to play at higher fps. Purchasing Guide According to Asus, the laptop will be available from July 30, 2020 in the UAE from Amazon, Computronic, Emax, Noon, SharafDG and Virgin Megastores. At AED 17,999, the Asus Zephyrus Duo 15 is a pricey affair. If you want to spend that kind of money entirely depends on how you will utilize the second screen. It can be used to host your apps and productivity tools, or make your streaming life a bit easier, but outside of that there isnt much native support, especially from games (which will be a hard ask from developers to show support for such a niche product). As a gaming laptop, it's great but you can get an equally powerful laptop for far less money.", "date": "July 30, 2020,"}
