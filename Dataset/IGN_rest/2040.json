Move from left to right, punch enemies, destroy objects for points, health, and weapon pickups, punch a few more enemies, and repeat. Its simple and unadventurous, and while it expands modestly on combat with a few new skills to master, Streets of Rage 4 definitely prioritises nostalgia over any kind of big modern reinvention. The plot is wafer-thin and predictably corny, but it's beautifully presented in a comic book panel style. Mr and Ms Y, the twin offspring of series villain Mr X, are the big bads this time and their evil scheme is to control the city by corrupting everything good while looking like a couple of sub-par Scott Pilgrim villains. Its all very silly, but in a knowing, not-taking itself-too-seriously kinda way, and it just about pulls it off. Its 10 years since the events of Streets of Rage 3 and series regulars, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding, return to fight crime again despite likely being too old for this shit. To balance out the familiar with something different is the addition of two brand-new characters, Cherry Hunter (the daughter of series stalwart, Adam Hunter) and a cybernetic armed, absolute unit called Floyd Iraia. Just like in the old games, each character has a special move that does a lot more damage at the cost of taking a chunk out of your own health bar. However, an added risk-reward twist for Streets of Rage 4 is that any lost health can potentially be earnt back if you string a combo of standard attacks together on top of it. Any break in this combo results in the health being lost permanently. On my first playthrough, which took between two and three hours, I found myself avoiding special moves due to their risky nature. However, as I got the hang of combos I started using them semi-regularly in situations where I felt confident I could earn that precious health back. Its a simple but interesting minigame, and perhaps the most important addition into progressing the Streets of Rage formula as a whole. Using Star Moves on regular goons often feels unnecessary, but they're still a fun spectacle. A stronger weapon in your arsenal are Star Moves. Every characters is slightly different  Axels, for instance, is a flaming rising uppercut, while Cherrys is a Pete Townshend-inspired guitar powerslide  but triggering them will do a huge amount of damage to any Y Syndicate members unlucky enough to be in your path. At the start of every level youre given one charge, but more can be collected during your travels and theyre almost always best reserved for bosses where youll need it the most. Using them while fighting the regular goons often feels unnecessary as most situations are manageable, but theyre still a fun spectacle with Floyds screen dominating uni beam being a visual treat. Another enjoyable addition to combat is the inclusion of the weapon catch maneuver. Throw any weapon at an enemy and, if it makes contact, itll bounce back, giving you a split-second to catch it and keep whacking away with it. Like Gears of Wars active reload timed-button-press mechanic, there's a rhythm required to master it, but once youve do its supremely rewarding. However, for every moment of feeling like a deadly ninja, there are moments that are simply unfair due to factors completely out of your control. Theres one section where getting hit with a grenade bounces you into the path of another explosion, with no way to dodge or escape. I lost half my health as a result and this inability to prevent it from happening was very frustrating. Of the four starting characters, the returning duo of Axel and Blaze immediately felt familiar and fit right in place in a 90s side-scrolling beat-em up, but they do feel a little generic at this point. Theyre both well-rounded fighters who dont necessarily excel in any ability, but work best as an introductory character for new players and a recognisable sight for veterans. By contrast, Floyd and Cherry couldnt be further apart, and their movesets are by far the most exciting and fun to play. Cherry's ability to sprint and weave through attacks feels more in line with what I expected a modern Streets of Rage would play like. Cherry Hunter  despite carrying a guitar on her back  can move at a significant speed, which is (literally) a nice change of pace to the other characters, and that made her my preferred choice in my first playthrough. Her ability to sprint and weave through attacks feels more in line with what I expected a modern Streets of Rage would play like, which is also why I was initially disappointed with how sluggish the other characters felt in comparison. Floyd, for instance, is by far the slowest character, but I soon appreciated that what he lacks in speed is compensated for with strength. His ability to toss enemies around like rag dolls eventually won me over and had me experimenting with different playstyles. Within the constraints of the restricted nature of side-scrolling beat em-ups, Streets of Rage 4 at least makes an attempt to spice up the level design. Levels like Skytrain and Airplane add little bits of variety (like high-speed train signs flying at you during combat, for example) to keep the environments fresh. Weapons are no longer restricted to hand-to-hand combat either: we get giant wrecking balls, chandeliers, and plenty of destructible scenery playing its part in the violence. Theres even a level of tactics to using some of these, especially the wrecking balls. Timing your activation just right can result in dealing an extremely satisfying level of damage. Theres also a 2D sequence that conjures up memories of the hammer hallway scene from 2003s South Korean classic film, Oldboy, where mastery of the weapon catch can make you feel unstoppable. Every change of pace really adds to the enjoyment of Street of Rage 4, so much so its disappointing there isnt even more variety throughout to ensure combat is fresh from beginning to end of its short run. As it is, theyre all-too-brief moments of joy; returning to the more traditional levels is sometimes a drag. The music sets the tone and definitely feels on-brand with the iconic beats of the series. Although Id have to say that in the era of game soundtracks like Hotline Miami and the recent Final Fantasy 7 Remake, they dont quite hit the same sort of I cant get this track out of my brain status, or even its predecessors. All 12 levels predictably end in a boss fight and, for the most part, theres a good balance of variety and difficulty throughout. Most are smartly designed with often-challenging attack patterns youll need to learn, but disappointingly there are repeated enemies in later levels with arbitrary difficulty spikes like, Heres two of them now! In general though, the enemies are a good mix of old and new with neither feeling out of place, despite the 26-year age gap. I played through the first time alone, but thats only half the fun. Less, even. The two-player online co-op really shines though with the intensity and chaos increased. It also made me fully appreciate the potential character combos and the satisfaction of perfectly executing a tandem move such as Floyd throwing an enemy into Cherrys rushing flying knee. If youre looking for longevity, two-player co-op is where its at. (Streets of Rage 4 also has local four-player co-op but, due to the current isolation circumstances, I was unable to try it out.) Beyond the campaign and its five difficulty levels (Mania is exactly what it sounds like!) there's a tough boss rush mode, Arcade (which is basically the story campaign but with a consistent life count), and a PVP battle mode to mess around with. But thats it. And frankly, the story mode is better than any of these options, so if youre playing alone theres little replayability on offer. The retro characters fit nicely into the combat loop and help reinforce how the latest instalment reignites that passion for the series through nostalgia. One thing Streets of Rage 4 does offer, however, is the wealth of nostalgic choices, such as the retro Streets of Rage 1 and 2 soundtracks and old CRT filters. It takes a little grinding to unlock, but theres also a lifetime point system that gives access to faithfully recreated playable characters (and a modern version of Adam who unlocks during the story) from previous entries in the series. They arent just skins either  these characters have their own move sets, animations, and sound effects. Despite their sprites contrasting against the lush, cartoon-like world of Streets of Rage 4, these retro characters fit nicely into the combat loop and help reinforce how the latest instalment reignites that passion for the series through nostalgia. In fact, theyre so accurately recreated that, annoyingly, the characters from Streets of Rage 1 dont even have special moves and must solely rely on their basic, Call the cops for an airstrike star moves. As a result they feel at odds with the new risk-reward system and it pretty much renders them unusable on the harder difficulties. In a way, this feels like a metaphor for the entire game: instead of taking bolder steps to modernise the formula, Streets of Rage 4 sticks rigidly to the past, for little more than nostalgias sake. Streets of Rage 4 delivers the greatest hits of the classic series and is at its best when played with at least one friend. If the primary focus was delivering a traditional Streets of Rage experience with a modern coat of paint, it absolutely succeeds. But while it layers on a few new and interesting mechanics, its still a very conservative update to the quarter-century-old format that feels like a slave to the past.", "date": "April 30, 2020"}
