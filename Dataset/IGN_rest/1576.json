Now, with Playstation Vita here, Asphalt Ignition continues the tradition on Sony's latest system. While not the prettiest Vita game, Asphalt Injection is still the best game in the Asphalt series yet, though you simply can't ignore it offers almost the same content as its 99-cent iOS counterpart. Traffic is rare and easy to avoid. The Playstation Vita integration is subtle. Control schemes include tilt steering and using the back touch pad like an F1 paddle shifter. The functionality works well, especially as Asphalt Injection plays up its arcade gameplay where sheer speed trumps precision. Depending on your preferred method of control, Asphalt Injection's gameplay comes down to hitting the gas, pumping out nitros, and drifting cleanly around corners. From this core standpoint, Asphalt Injection performs well. It shares sensibilities with Burnout, but lacks the destructive detail and spectacle of that classic franchise. In addition to its simplistic arcade style, Asphalt Injection gets a full roster of top-notch cars, including BMWs, Audis, and Ferraris. While cool in appearance, each car feels the same, despite changes factoring into each vehicle's top speed. This builds upon the ease of drifting, because there's no danger of spinning out, and hitting a wall will either lead to a full-on wreck or bumping harmlessly off the side of the road. This arcade mindset makes the whole game just a little too easy. You'll be hard pressed to pull less than three stars out of any given five-star race. Drive fast, that's pretty much the idea. The races begin in classic locations like the streets of Los Angeles, but soon escalate to driving through Icelandic volcanos and icy caves. But these aren't new tracks; they popped up in previous Asphalt titles. They look better on Vita, sure, but not much else changed. Each track has shortcuts, but blatant power-ups marking each alternate route make their discovery less interesting, and oftentimes even blazing on turbo through a shortcut won't actually cut any time off a race or catch you up to a pack that's pulled ahead. For collectors, there's a lot of content here. 100 different races present an opportunity to collect up to five stars each, and at certain tiers, new tournaments and vehicles unlock. There are fifteen tracks, with five additional track variations for anyone digging deep enough into the game. Racing through all these elements with all the cars works well in both online and local multiplayer modes. With a bare bones leveling system, Asphalt Injection presents some fun multiplayer stats, with just enough impetus to keep you driving if the simplicity doesn't turn you away. Drift hard, because you can't really lose control. The odd thing is, in the car menu, you can't actually tell which cars you own and which ones are available for sale. While a padlock tells you when you don't have access to a high-level car, every other car simply sports a price tag whether you've dropped the cash already or not. Stepping into the main menu's Garage mode places you in a first-person mode in which you can walk through your collection and move the Vita in all directions to look around; a cool yet ultimately useless feature. But in the Garage you can't actually approach any vehicle to get its history, facts, or even a label stating what it is. It's a purely visual gallery with no informational detail or depth. During your time on the road, an obnoxious announcer punctuates key moments. If you want to share events from a photo standpoint, the front facing camera will snap your mug while you takeout opponents, win a race, or get big air. Unfortunately the Vita's obnoxiously loud camera makes this a distracting option during longer sessions. While many of its key elements make Asphalt Injection fun, it just isn't a good looking game. The series' entries on the iPhone market look similar. While it's not ugly, you won't pop Asphalt Injection in to justify your Vita investment to friends and loved ones. CLOSING COMMENTS Asphalt Injection is a fun racing game, but it lacks depth, precision, and doesnt push the Playstation Vita to anything resembling its true potential. Asphalt 6 costs 99 cents in the App Store while Asphalt Injection sports a price tag of $29.99. At its current tier, thats a steep price for a simplistic racing game that only benefits from tighter controls and more processing power without really washing off the sense its a really polished iPhone game. IGN RATINGS FOR ASPHALT INJECTION (VITA) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.0 Presentation The menu provides plenty of options, even if its tough to tell which cars one owns. 5.0 Graphics The Vitas capable of some great looking graphics, theyre just not here. 6.5 Sound The screech of tires and crash of two cars colliding sound good, but the announcer is simply annoying. 7.0 Gameplay The gameplay is good, but the simplistic drifting mechanic doesnt hold much challenge. Its tough to screw up. 7.0 Lasting Appeal There are a bunch of cars to buy and lots of stars to unlock and the multiplayer should keep this one alive. 6.0 OVERALL Okay (out of 10)", "date": "Feb. 14, 2012,"}
