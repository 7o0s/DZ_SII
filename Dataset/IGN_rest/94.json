It does not offer wireless connectivity, 7.1 surround sound or any extras -- not even a storage bag -- outside a splitter cable and detachable microphone, but it is offered with three different color accents: blue (PS3/4), green (Xbox), and carbon (PC). And of course there is the benefit of it being offered on-the-cheap. With its 3.5mm audio connection the Corsair HS50 is compatible with PCs and Macs, game consoles, phones and tablets. It's going up against a crowded field of budget-oriented headsets, so let's see how it compares. Design and Features The Corsair HS50 looks nothing like any of the companys VOID headsets. Where the VOID earcups have a distinct trapezoidal shape, the HD50's earcups are oval -- big ovals, in fact. Budget headsets can feel light and cheap, but the HS50 feels well-built and is on the heavier side. Part of its heft is due to its use of sturdy metal forks that hold the earcups to the headband; plastic forks are more common among budget headsets. The other part of its heft is due to the thick headband and oversized earcups. The earcups are huge and supremely comfortable, but they can get a bit toasty after prolonged use. Both the earcups and headband are heavily padded and covered in a synthetic leather material. The earcups pivot to fit comfortably flush against your head, but they do not rotate like those on more expensive Corsair headsets where they spin to rest flat on your chest when you take them off. The left earcup features an easy-to-reach volume dial along with a button to mute the microphone. The thick headband is plastic on top with synthetic leather padding underneath. The headband offers a fairly large degree of adjustment, and includes a small but appreciated detail: a numbered gauge on the internal bar of the headband that lets you know exactly where you like the height adjustment set. Having reviewed a bunch of budget headsets recently, I weighed each with an audio cable attached to see how they all compared. Along with the bulky Astro A10, the Corsair HS50 was the only headset to weigh more than 300 grams. It weighs 331 grams with the mic attached. Perhaps because the weight is spread out over the thick headband and oversized earcups, the Corsair HS50 didn't feel like a brick atop my head. Of all the budget headsets I reviewed, half the field featured 50mm drivers and the other half had 40mm drivers. The Corsair HS50 along with the HyperX Cloud Stinger and the Roccat Cross feature the larger, 50mm drivers, and the different in audio punch can be heard, which Ill cover more in-depth in the next section. There's a few extras in the box. Aside from the headset itself, there's only the microphone and a splitter cable. The mic sits on a thin, flexible boom that holds its position extremely well. The splitter cable connects to the end of the headsets long, 6-foot audio cable for use with PCs that have separate headphone and mic jacks. Gaming To test the Corsair HS50, I played some games with it on a PC and an Xbox One, and then connected it to an iPhone to test how it handled music playback. With Battlefield on a PC, the Corsair HS50 delivered powerful audio. Strong lows were evident with rumbling tanks and heavy artillery exploding, mids were clear with dialogue easy to understand, and highs were crisp with rifle fire popping. The headset boasts a strong bass response without muddying the mids and highs. In the end, the game sounded and felt immersive. Next, I played Star Wars Battlefront and NBA 2K17 on an Xbox One. The arena and game noises in NBA 2K17 sounded clear and lifelike, and Battlefront allowed the headset to show of its dynamic sound with powerful low frequencies standing out from the clear mids and highs. Next, I connected the Corsair HS50 to an iPhone 7 Plus, fired up Spotify, and used Steely Dans Dirty Work to test the high and mid-frequencies and DMXs X Gon Give It To Ya to get a sense of the headsets bass performance. On Dirty Work, the separation between the mids and highs wasnt as evident as with the HyperX Cloud Stinger; the snare drum didnt sound as snappy and the vocals and organ sounded duller than the Cloud Stinger. O X Gon Give It To Ya, the performance was better. The bass sounded huge and DMXs raspy vocals sounded gritty yet clear. The difference driver size could be felt and heard on X Gon Give It To Ya; the Corsair HS50, HyperX Cloud Stinger, and the Roccat Cross delivers more powerful, bass-pounding audio on this track. In the end, it was really hard to tell the difference in performance between the Corsair HS50 and the HyperX Cloud Stinger, which both sit at the top of the budget headset pack. Both were outstanding in PC and console gaming, but the Cloud Stinger offered slightly more dynamic sound with mobile music playback. Finally, I tested the mic by making a voice recording. The Corsair HS50s recording was cleanest of the bunch. My voice sounded crystal clear with no distortion. The Corsair HS50 looks, feels, and sounds like something that should cost more than $50. It boasts the best build quality of our budget headset roundup and finished a close second to the HyperX Cloud Stinger in audio performance. Its a little on the heavy side and its large earcups start to feel a bit warm after a while, but Id rather have a well-built, slightly oversized headset than a cheap, plastic unit for my $50.", "date": "Jan. 9, 2018,"}
