The lack of modes, characters, and new ideas make it a step backwards from the series debut on the Nintendo 64 back in 2000. In fact, Ultra Smash left me stretching to find any depth whatsoever. While the colorful characters and effects are definitely up to the Nintendo standard weve all come to expect, little else here is. The one new idea Ultra Smash has -- Mega Mushrooms that randomly pop onto the court and cause characters to grow in size -- is actively bad. Not only does it it seem arbitrary and imbalanced, but the giant characters obstruct the view of the court and veer matches into the bad kind of chaos. Its tough for me to understand why Mario Tennis leans so heavily into this feature when it stumbles so staggeringly. Check out Mario and Rosalina fighting Mega Bowser in the video above. While you can play classic singles or doubles matches, theres no tournament or campaign mode whatsoever. You simply set up two or four characters to play on one of a handful of courts. No records are kept, and specific match stats are erased as soon as you exit a game. In fact, Ultra Smash really doesnt give you any incentive to continue playing. Sure, there are 16 different total characters, a few of which you have to unlock by completing specific tasks or using in-game currency, but I found that they all pretty much played the same. A hulking Bowser doesnt really feel any different than a floating Rosalina, which is definitely a disappointment. The only mini-game in this spartan package is Mega Ball Rally, which is a banal scenario where you see how many times you can rally with another player until one of you messes up. The fact that Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube managed to include more characters, interesting modes, and varied courses a decade ago is a bit insulting. Contrast that with the best Mario sports games, most recently Mario Golf: World Tour. Those classics are packed with different modes and challenges that help you learn and perfect specific mechanics. Theres nothing in Ultra Smash that made me want to learn how to be better. Check out some of Mario Tennis' unlockable characters above. Even worse: If you cant find pals to play with, prepare for a slog. The computer-controlled characters in Ultra Smash range from passable to flat-out frustrating. In Knockout Challenge, a mode where you train an amiibo, I found having an A.I. partner actively made winning matches more difficult. I cant count the number of times my little Mario buddy hit a ball straight into my back. Its also frustrating that training an amiibo feels so binary. Compared to Smash Bros. Wii U, where the A.I. seemed to learn how you played and adapted and grew based on that, Ultra Smash simply levels up your partner after every five matches, and randomly assigns them an unnoticeable stat increase at each notch. One thing Ultra Smash has going for it is that its definitely gorgeous. Seeing iconic Nintendo characters frolicking around the court is always a treat, and the effects that pop up throughout matches make the each game visually stimulating, even if it's not quite mentally there. Pros Pretty and colorful Cons Lack of modesDumb A.I.Useless hookNothing new Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is as stripped-down a Nintendo sports game as Ive ever played. The absence of modes, unimpressive unlockables, and tiring hook offer very little reason to keep playing. Sure, its pretty, but thats about all it has going for it.", "date": "Nov. 19, 2015,"}
