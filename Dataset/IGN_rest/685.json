While the most obvious change is that Skylanders SuperChargers features a brand-new line of car toys and levels full of fast-paced, Mario Kart-esque racing, it also has some of the most visually appealing and mechanically diverse levels the series has to offer, with plenty of hidden areas to explore. Ready to Roll (and Fly and Boat) The 20-or-so vehicle missions offer a lot of variety over the roughly 12 hours of gameplay, too, with tense chase sequences having you frantically dart across the back of a dragon, to three-step, weapon-based boss fights in arenas full of nasty obstacles. There are some interesting attempts at car-platforming, particularly in levels where you have to use an item to raise a jump at the right time, but the vehicle sequences blatantly try to rush you towards the end, totally forgetting about all the collectables youll have to miss as a result. The air and sea vehicles, which dont come with starter packs, are optional extras  but highly recommended ones. Youre locked out of any sea or sky missions without purchasing the extra vehicles, as opposed to being locked out of levels based on Skylanders individual elements as in previous games. This is certainly more of a positive for value-conscious people (like myself) whod much prefer to purchase two extra vehicles than 10 extra Skylanders And those two vehicles certainly do add a lot to that experience, because there are whole sections of levels designed completely underwater or completely in the air. Cleverly, the vehicles pair with specific types of Skylander drivers, too. If you put the right driver in the right vehicle, you get a special SuperCharged enhancement, giving both the Skylander and the vehicle aesthetic and statistical upgrades, are a pretty big help when it comes to successfully navigating the courses. Theres an abundance of shiny stuff to collect scattered throughout each of the levels to upgrade your ride with, but the customization system is very, very simple, and really only adds value to the surprisingly fun cooperative play. Vehicle co-op in Skylanders SuperChargers sees one player controlling the car, and another in charge of the weapons in high-speed, chaotic action. All of the single player missions can be played co-op, too, but some of the item-based puzzles can be difficult when two people jump to use those items at the same time, and cancel each other out by doing so. It also gets a little frustrating when the fixed camera makes it a little hard for both players to see exactly what theyd like to. All Over The Place In fact, the all of SuperChargers is beautifully animated, from the genuinely funny, somewhat dorky team of characters who help you along the way through its disappointingly bland story, to the oddly adorable returning villain, Kaos. Even aesthetically sinister levels are so creatively designed that the vibe of the game doesnt often veer far from charming. One level plays around with gravity, with different hallways flipping you on different corners of your TV screen, sometimes forcing you to navigate through its various portals completely upside-down. Another has a shrink/grow ray, allowing you to change the size of obstacles - shrinking your enemies, or making things so large they topple them over. The diversity of gameplay mechanics is near constant, but consistently easy to come to terms with, making it impressive for adults but totally understandable for kids. If thats not enough for you, theres also a hub that you can loosely decorate with Legendary Items like trampolines and soccer balls, which also acts as the center for most of your missions. It houses the kart racing side-missions, a store with some admittedly pretty cute purchasable hats for your Skylander to wear around in-game, and some characters to play Skystones with. (Thats the surprisingly challenging, addictive collectable card game that has returned for the third time since its debut in Skylanders Giants.) Theres certainly no shortage of things to do in Skylanders SuperChargers, and everything you can do is highly polished, however simple it all might be. Pros Creative level designUnique vehicle controlsLots of content Cons Bland storyVery basic customization Adding three different and fun vehicles and extremely creative level designs to the series simple but reliably enjoyable action platforming gives Skylanders SuperChargers a healthy boost. Every level has you switching between approaches based on the vehicle youre piloting, which is great for variety. That said, both the story and the approaches to boss fights are very predictable, and some things - like vehicle customization - are overly-simplified, even considering the young target audience.", "date": "Sept. 29, 2015"}
