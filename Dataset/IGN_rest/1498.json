Not a Pinball FX nerd, mind you. The sort of players who discovered or reconnected with the classic real-world arcade game via modern video game pinball probably won't understand the importance of these Williams, Bally, Gottlieb, and Stern boards. Perhaps this is the greatest asset in the Pinball Arcade arsenal. Although its digitized ports don't do much to shake up the genre, they contribute to what's becoming a growing trend and worthwhile new obsession on Xbox Live Arcade. It's bringing back the origin of species to show fans new, old, or undiscovered why pinball rules. This genie is a jerk. Smash him with balls. Given their heritage, the Ripley's Believe It or Not, Black Hole, Theatre of Magic, and Tales of the Arabian Nights machines don't share the luxury of modern pinball boards. At times, the dense, garish imagery obscures the ball locations. In digging through the menus and discovering the original ads and information about each, it's clear this was always the case. A lesser developer prioritizing accessibility over preservation may have cleaned this up a bit. Farsight Studios is clearly committed to the history, even if it means an imperfect gameplay experience at times. Even then, the issues are microscopic. There are only three camera options, none of which are static; tracking the ball can be disorienting. The ball slips by the flippers or through the sides withsuspicious regularity, which gets frustrating. Quests end with unceremonious praise. Such issues only stand out because there aren't any upsetting issues worth addressing in Pinball Arcade. The Black Hole table has a miniature table inside the main board. After all, these tables are awesome. The joyous warbling and ding-dong sound effects, appropriate physics, and through instructions for each table meet the mandatory minimum expectations. Meanwhile, the inner-workings of the complex table designs present a deep and satisfying challenge for players dedicated to completing elaborate goals. Each table has an advanced tier for hardcore players who seek additional goals -- hitting holes, ramps, and objects in a time limit, for example. The usual stuff, as expected, since these are the tables that inspired what we now understand as the basics. Welcome back. CLOSING COMMENTS The Pinball Arcade is a reminder and a reassertion. It establishes itself as a major player in a mostly monopolized space on XBLA. Farsight aims to release more real-world machines in digital form long-term, and for tournament play, and it's clear why: We're going to want to play these. It's an admirable goal: The developer is manufacturing a museum full of terrific, timeless proxies. Whether you're obsessed with the old-school or still waiting to discover it, playing four pieces of history for $10 is absolutely worthwhile.
