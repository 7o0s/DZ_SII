You probably also haven't played Valkyria Chronicles, but don't feel too bad  lots of people haven't, even though this vibrant tactical RPG has amassed a cult following since it debuted on PlayStation 3 six years ago. If you missed it the first time, the long-overdue PC port is a great way to correct that mistake: it's just as beautiful, challenging, and involving as the original. Re-imagining World War II as a fantasy-tinged clash between a sinister, vaguely German empire and the scrappy little country of Gallia, Valkyria focuses on a single militia squad fighting small-scale battles in a much bigger war. It shares a few similarities with XCOM  turn-based combat, distinct heroes divided into classes, and a base where you can research new equipment and level up troops between missions, to name a few  but it infuses its battles with shooter elements, letting you freely move individual soldiers and aim their shots. You're limited only by their Action Points  actually a meter that shrinks as you move  and their ability to snap off just one attack per move. And while enemies can't move during your turn, they'll open fire if your active soldier is in range (unless he or she is aiming, which is weird), making quick reflexes almost as vital as strategic thinking to keeping your troops alive. Quickly aiming or exiting a move to keep a soldier from being shot at feels strange and artificial at first, but eventually Valkyria's unusual combat rhythms become second nature. That's not to undersell the importance of strategy, though. Valkyria's 30-odd missions (including non-story skirmishes and side missions) are elaborate, smartly designed, and frequently pit you against seemingly impossible odds and unique threats that include giant supertanks, indestructible machine gun nests, and a gauntlet of mines and searchlights that you'll have to navigate while injured. Careful pre-mission squad selection, teamwork, and creative thinking are all encouraged. You might, for example, endlessly hammer a powerful enemy with your Lancer rocket troops, only to realize that it's a better idea to simply group your lighter troops closer together so they all lay down supporting fire when one of them is actively shooting. Sudden realizations like that can lead to some incredibly satisfying victories, but in the meantime, mistakes are costly. Not only does correcting them eat into your limited supply of moves per turn, but errors tend to get your troops shot down  and if an enemy reaches them before you can, they'll die for good. All this risk adds up to some incredibly satisfying victories, but it also leads to a lot of frustration in the meantime  particularly if you realize, halfway through a long and grueling battle, that you've been pursuing a wrongheaded strategy the whole time, or left yourself totally unprepared for a second-stage surprise attack. There's also no auto-saving or checkpoints, although you can save manually at any time, which lets you create little safety nets before risky moves. On the other hand, if you don't remember to save frequently, failure could fling you right back to the mission's start. Valkyria is not for rage-quitters. Outside of combat, Valkyria puts an enormous emphasis on story and character. Each recruitable squad member has their own personality, backstory, and idiosyncrasies, from head-in-the-clouds student-turned-tank commander Welkin Gunther, to panic-prone would-be actress Edy Nelson. Individual quirks can also affect their combat prowess: someone with a pollen allergy will lose health if they get too close to plants, for example, while characters identified as ~city kids~ will have higher defense when standing on paved roads. Practically speaking, these are really just brief, barely noticeable bonuses or debuffs (except for extreme cases, like a pacifist arbitrarily refusing an order to shoot), but they're a neat touch nonetheless. The downside of the heavy focus on story is that it translates into tons of lengthy cutscenes, most of which are just conversations between talking heads. Thankfully, many of them are fun or at least interesting to watch, especially if you're invested in the characters and how they develop over Valkyria's 30-40-hour runtime  and odds are you will be, because Valkyria manages to wring some unexpectedly emotional moments out of what at first seems like a fairly formulaic war story. However, it's not unusual to have to sit through 10-15 minutes of cutscenes before and after missions, and that quickly leads to a feeling that you're watching more than you're playing  particularly at the beginning, when Valkyria intersperses short tutorial skirmishes with piles of non-interactive dialogue and character exposition. Pros Looks amazingUnique battlesInvolving storyline Cons So. Many. Cutscenes.No auto-saving Valkyria Chronicles is gorgeous, engrossing, and not for the impatient. In other words, it's a greatt fit for PC gamers, who'll hopefully give the underappreciated Valkyria a wider audience than it found on PS3. With tons of content to explore and mostly top-notch performance on display, this isn't just a fantastic port  it's a fantastic game at its very best.", "date": "Nov. 27, 2014,"}
