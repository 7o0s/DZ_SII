The premise is pretty simple. McCarthy plays hard-hearted and hard-assed businesswoman Michelle Darnell -- think Martha Stewart with a mouth like a sailor -- who gets locked up for insider trading. When she gets out, her life is nothing, shes lost everything, and the only person she can turn to is her former employee, Claire (Kristen Bell). While staying with Claire and her young daughter, she comes up with a new business idea - a Brownie empire. Together they start the new business venture but among the obstacles in the way are Darnells personal issues and any she screwed over in the past. Among the wronged is the (mildly annoying but also irksomely entertaining) broken-hearted ex and former business rival Ronald (Peter Dinklage), or Renault as he likes to be known, who is now obsessed with the samurai. The Boss sees McCarthy reteam with her husband, Ben Falcone, who co-wrote the script. This is the second time hes directed her, the first being Tammy, a film that was clearly far funnier on paper than it sadly ended up being on screen. This time it feels much more natural, works far better and, although the comedy can lull at times, when its funny, its really funny. If this is the leap forward in quality they can bring into play as a team on just their second project, I genuinely look forward to seeing what they can achieve with their third. Aside from McCarthys performance, which isnt her finest but is still extremely entertaining, the rest of the cast fill their roles out nicely even if they are overshadowed. Bell is a great foil-cum-leveler for the headline star but Veeps Timothy Stephens as Renault/Ronalds assistant is criminally underused as is Kristen Schaal as Scout Leader Sandy. Sadly the material they are given isnt strong enough but they do the best they can with what theyve got. The real winner in the co-star stakes is Tyler Labine as Bells love interest, Mike Beals. Again, a lot of the material hes given is quite basic but the way he delivers it, verbally and physically, is comedy gold. This performance should make him the films breakout star and will hopefully do for him what Bridesmaids did for McCarthy. There are also a few solid, standout scenes and set pieces nestled in amongst the rest of the film - a deftly handled street fight, a shower scene, bra-related banter and an 80s throwback all deserve special mention  that give the film water cooler talkability. The real jewel in the crown here though is the creative swearing and, like Spy and The Heat before it, The Boss is littered with it. McCarthy delivers filth like no one else in the business and it lands perfectly. Its an art in itself and she is a potty-mouthed Picasso. When she lets rip, its game on and her game is strong.", "date": "April 10, 2016"}
