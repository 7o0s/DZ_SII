After such a strong and emotional showing last episode, its a bummer to watch Bizarro and see it all fall apart. While this episode manages to capture the endearing compassion of the Supergirl character and some of the inherent tragedy of the Bizarro character, its ultimately rife with melodrama, hammy acting, odd character choices, and relationships we simply arent invested in. I enjoyed Supergirls inner conflict when it came to taking down Bizarro. She was clearly aware of the ethical dubiousness with which she was created and was hesitant to get violent. It felt true to the character, as did Alexs harsh opinion that Kara was acting as though [Bizarro] is a person and not an experiment. Cruel, yes, but also highlights the stark difference between the two sisters. Its an interesting dynamic, considering that the alien is by far more human. Another great example of this is Alex going off the reservation to arrest Maxwell Lord and hold him against his will. No doubt it will come back to haunt her, but it was a solid showing of her stone cold demeanor that I wish wed see more of. Bizarro herself was handled fairly well (despite the disappointing lack of Bizarro-speak) and given the tragic treatment that serves the character (whether male or female) so well. Its a not-so-subtle nod to the Frankenstein story, but theres a reason Frankensteins monster is such a beloved archetype in fiction: it works. The effects for Bizarros face once exposed to Kryptonite were also pretty impressive, even if the climactic Supergirl/Bizarro fight disappointed in comparison. There were some funny lines, too, particularly with Kara saying that Bizarro talked like Cookie Monster and Jonn saying that the skirt was surprisingly comfortable when he shapeshifted into Kara. Unfortunately, the enjoyment stops there. The relationship drama between Kara and Adam was painful, mostly because it was annoying to watch Kara fall for all the stereotypically lame nice-guy lines from Adam (and rebuff them completely from Winn in episodes previous). Plus, isnt it a bit creepy that Adam is infatuated with Kara because of the letter she wrote pretending to be his mother? The guys got Mommy issues for sure, but it ultimately comes down to the fact that we only met Adam an episode ago. The way Bizarro handles their break-up is as though weve been invested in these two for a season or more, like its some really high stakes relationship. But its not; they met a week ago and now hes gone (hopefully forever). The sickening love stories didnt stop there, though, as James and Winn stumbled through an incredibly odd conversation about who should get Kara. Its an awkward scene to watch, and not because the characters are feeling uncomfortable. James and Winn are ostensibly objectifying Kara in a way that theyve seemingly been so careful not to before, presumably only because theres a third party (Adam) involved. Id be interested to see them both be jealous (and not just at each other), but this came off as creepy and a betrayal of Karas friendship. James later admission of his love for Kara just makes it worse, especially knowing that Lucy is still in the picture. I want to root for Jimmy Olsen, not be repulsed by him. The last piece of the puzzle that solidified this episode as a stinker was Maxwell Lord. For an episode all about doppelgangers, Lord might as well have been renamed Lex Luthor. Hes a cackling, scene-chewing mad scientist that is more insufferable than he is threatening. In small doses, hes tolerable. But with Bizarro focused so intently on his antics, its painful to watch him ham it up when hes brainwashing his creation or threatening Supergirl. Its as though Peter Facinelli is playing camp when the show is trying its hardest to avoid it. There were other disappointments, too. Jonn was basically brushed to the side after focusing on him for a bulk of the last episode (even though hes by far the most interesting character outside of Kara), and Cat had very little to do other than pump the brakes on her friendly relationship with Kara. Pros Bizarros tragedySupergirls compassion Cons Maxwell Lord feels like hes from a different showAdam is the worstNo investment in Adam/KaraCreepy Winn and James The interesting twists of Bizarro  Alex arresting Lord, Lord knowing Supergirls secret identity, James confessing his love for Kara  are undercut by the unbearably relationship drama and the over-the-top characterization of Maxwell Lord. While the portrayal of Bizarro and Supergirls compassion for her was spot-on, this episode was a failure on all other fronts.", "date": "Feb. 2, 2016,"}
