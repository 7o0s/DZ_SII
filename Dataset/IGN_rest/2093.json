When Capcom announced it was making an expansion, I knew it would be a tough act to follow. Unfortunately, the three parts of the Winters' Expansion arent up to it. Its new campaign is extremely short, rushed, and does little to improve on Villages story, and the new way to play the main game makes it less scary than it was the first time around. The main bright spot is the update to Mercenaries, which gives the people more of what we want: Lady Dimitrescu. Resident Evil Village (PS5) . . 96.00 See it  Shadows of Rose is the extremely short new single-player story campaign included in the Winters' Expansion, is set 16 years after Village's events, but does little to move Villages story forward. For less than three hours, you play Ethan Winters' daughter, Rose, as she tries to find a cure to remove her mold powers. Seeing and learning more of Rose's struggles while growing up was interesting, and you do get to revisit abridged versions of iconic locations from Village (most notably Castle Dimitrescu), but there are no critical revelations that wouldve changed the context of Villages story or made Roses feel essential. Even the puzzles are more straightforward than those in the main game. Maybe this expansion is helping to set up the next Resident Evil story, but as of now, it feels like an afterthought at best. Unlike Resident Evil 7 and Village, Shadows of Rose is played in a third-person perspective, which was a nice change of pace, but I was disappointed at the lack of fluidity the controls have. Compared to the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3, the Rose doesnt feel anywhere near as responsive when shooting at enemies or interacting with most objects. Combat suffers as well. Rose is equipped with a pistol, a shotgun, and her ability to shoot magic at enemies and temporarily stun them or push off certain enemies that get too close. Your guns cannot be upgraded at any point, though her powers can, and they make good tools for conserving ammo or achieving a no-damage or stealth-type run through the campaign that you couldnt do in the base game. I just wish they were used more creatively, especially considering one of her more interesting powers does not come along until the end of the story when theres barely any time left to make use of it. Theres not much enemy variety in play, either. What we thought of Resident Evil Village: Roaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors. I got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as I did retracing my steps through the gradually revealed recesses of its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast. Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode. The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads. But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistfull of Lady Dimitrescus freakish fingernails. - Tristan Ogilvie May 5, 2021 Score: 8 Read the full Resident Evil Village Review. Fortunately, Shadows of Rose is not the only thing included in the Winters' Expansion; it also includes a new option in the settings that lets you play Village's entire story from start to finish in the third-person perspective. While it is great for those that prefer the over-the-shoulder gameplay, my issues with it are the same as they were in Shadows of Rose, with two additional frustrations: one, all the cutscenes are still played in first-person perspective, making it feel less than seamlessly integrated; and two, some of the jump scares and more terrifying moments in Village were dialed back drastically because of the change of the camera. Seeing the baby in House Beneviento in third-person, for example, was not nearly as frightening, if only because the change in perspective meant I had a broader view of Ethan's surroundings. Mercenaries feels a lot more complete than it did at launch. The third (and final) new piece of content included in the Winters' Expansion is Mercenaries Additional Orders, which adds new stages that increase the difficulty for those of us who steamrolled through the original batch, and three new characters. We get to play as Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and everyone's favorite tall vampire lady. Chris is unlocked from the start, but you have to S-rank one of the maps before you can put yourself in the shoes of Lady Dimitrescu. Mercenaries feels a lot more complete than it did at launch, as each of the four characters has their own weapons and abilities that improve the mode immensely. I especially enjoyed Chris ability to suckerpunch enemies and do some decent damage, making it a good last-minute offensive move you can use instead of blocking. The Winters' Expansion is mostly an underwhelming follow-up to Resident Evil Village. While Mercenaries Additional Orders has some valuable new maps and characters that help flesh out the time-attack mode and give Lady Dimitrescu another chance to enchant us, the disappointingly short and inessential Shadows of Rose story campaign and somewhat awkward third-person option for the main game left me feeling unseasonably lukewarm on the Winters.", "date": "Nov. 4, 2022,"}
