But the company has another flagship-level phone out now that could tempt some away from its main line: the LG G Flex 2. Last year's G Flex was an interesting phone, certainly, but one that felt like a gimmick brought to life for the sake of itand the mediocre screen didn't help. Luckily, the sequel is better in all regards, offering a much sharper display and a slightly smaller design that's more comfortable in the hand. But other issues have emerged this time around that might make you take pause when considering the G Flex 2, especially with so many major Android flagships on the horizon. The G Flex 2 is conceptually the same as last year's device: it's a lightly curved, large-screened Android phone. The top and bottom are sloped forward to give the device its curve, although the phone essentially functions the same as a non-curved phone would. It's not a dramatic change over a flat display, and to be quite honest, I didn't see any real benefit or downside to the curve. At 5.5 inches, it's not large enough to make games or movies seem more immersive. It's a unique shape, but once you get used to it, the difference seems more presentational than anything. The phone does feels really great in the hand, though: it's thin, sleek, and rounded along the edges, plus the display lost half an inch from the original, so it's a much more reasonable one-handed device now (but still large). As with the G3 and other recent LG handsets, the power and volume buttons are located on the back, beneath the camera. That's an odd shift to get accustomed to if you're used to other phones, but it starts to feel like second nature after a few days of fumbling around the frame. And as the name suggests, the phone can be flexed a little or pushed nearly flat (screen down) on a hard surface without fear of damage, so you can rest easier if you plan to keep it in a back pocket. The G Flex 2 also brings back the ~self-healing~ backing, which is supposed to miraculously fix light scratches via a coating that expands to fill in gaps. It'll keep small nicks out of sight, but deeper cuts are harder to nixour review unit arrived with a couple, thanks to whoever had the phone before us. At least the crisscross silver pattern helps mask any marks. The backing is a little slippery out of the box, but once you've had your hands all over it for a couple days, your hand oils give it a little bit of grip. It's a total fingerprint magnet, however. Not only is the G Flex 2's screen smaller this time around, but it's also sharper: it's now a 1080p P-OLED display, running at just over 400 pixels per inch (ppi), which means you can expect very crisp visuals throughout. It's a step down from the Quad HD screen found on the LG G3 as well as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, however. At that high of a resolution, the difference isn't dramatic, although it's surprising that the G Flex 2 has a lower-resolution screen than last year's G3. Still, the G Flex 2's screen delivers impressive results, with vivid coloring and excellent contrast. And if you prefer screen clarity to battery life, be sure to disable the ~Auto-adjust screen tone~ option, which can make it appear oddly dim in certain lighting scenarios. If you've heard about the Snapdragon 810 processor being prone to overheating, chances are likely that the chatter emerged thanks to the G Flex 2. The phone uses that high-end chipset with its octa-core, 64-bit CPU, and it definitely runs warm after several minutes of sustained use in games or high-performance apps. Physical warmth isn't a big issue, but the consequence is: the G Flex 2 automatically dims the screen brightness and won't let you bump it back up until the device cools down. I like a bright screen, so I typically keep it in the 90% range, but during overheating moments it'd drop down as low as 70% and lock the high-end cap. That's ridiculous. It may not be entirely the processor's fault, as the phone's unique build might make it tough to manage heat, but users are punished as a result. Granted, that's more an inconvenience than a total deal-breaker, but it's a recurring annoyance. With a powerful processor and 2GB RAM, the device moves through menus and multitasks with easemuch of the time. But there are odd moments of sluggishness around the UI, which seem to be caused by thermal throttling, or intentional slowdown to help combat overheating. Things tend to move a bit slowly when the phone is physically warm, but even before that point, you'll see hitches that belie its flagship branding (and price). LG's heavy skinning of Android 5.0 Lollipop might be part of the problem, as well. It's nice to have Lollipop, but the great Material Design of Google's latest OS revision is diminished; LG's version just doesn't have the same visual pop, and the tweaks don't make a big impression. Also, the Sprint handset that we received was loaded with bloatware: lots of third-party apps that you'll otherwise find in the Play Store, like NASCAR Mobile, Scout, NextRadio, NBA Game Time, and several Sprint apps (see below for a taste of it). You can clear most of that out, but it stinks to start out with messy home screens. With the smaller frame of the G Flex 2 comes a trimmed-down battery: a non-removable 3000mAh battery as opposed to 3500mAh in the original. It's a good all-day option, though; I put a heavy day of use into the phone, with plenty of app and game usage, photo and video shooting, and everything at near-max brightness, and I ended the day with about 20% left on the battery. On days with more moderate use, I'd still have 40% or so by the end of the night. It'll still require an overnight charge for most users, and with the slim build, that's no real surprise. Thankfully, the fast charger lets you top off in a hurry if you're a heavy user in need of a late afternoon refresh. On the storage front, the G Flex 2 has 32GB within, but it supports microSDHC cards up to 2TB in size. Two terabytes! You can't even buy a 2TB card yet, but the G Flex 2 will be ready for the eventual release. The 13-megapixel back camera appears to be a holdover from last year's G3, which is by no means a bad thing. Between optical image stabilization and LG's laser autofocus, it finds the subject and lets you snap a capable shot in a hurry. The camera isn't dramatically faster than other high-end Android phones, but the results are often great for well-lit shots: crisp and clear images with plenty of detail, although coloring seemed a little muted here and there. Low-light photos are solid, as well, and the 2.1MP camera up front takes decent selfies to boot. Pros Distinctive stylingComfortable designVery good display Cons Overheating issuesSluggish moments The G Flex 2's curve still isn't a game-changer, but it's a subtle tweak that gives the phone a distinctive allure. However, the excellent LG G3 offers more stable performance and a better screen at about the same full price ($600), and the G4 is weeks away from launch. LG's curved phone has a few perks, and it's a great phone in many ways, but issues like overheating and slowdown are tough to shrug off when the Android competition is so strong these days. If you can stand the issues, there's a lot to like about this uniquely shaped phone, but it's not a top-tier flagship.", "date": "April 9, 2015,"}
