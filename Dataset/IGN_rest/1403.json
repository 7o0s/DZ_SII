Within a few minutes of starting up youre dropped into fields of compulsively killable monsters. Youre shown this isn't a game about story: its about wholesale, gleeful slaughter. You burn and poison and slash at hostile beasts with sharp weapons until they die and spill gold and gear all over the ground. You scoop it all up, scan stats to see if any discovered treasure can serve as an upgrade, then move on to the next monster pack and repeat. You do this for roughly 30 hours until the final boss falls over, then you start up new game plus and repeat the whole thing. It may sound like a wearying grind of a dungeon crawl but its immensely rewarding. While Torchlight II doesnt achieve much with its bare story presentation and flat characters, it still establishes a distinct mood by blending scenes of ruthless violence with colorful, almost storybook-like visuals and a haunting soundtrack featuring ominous strings, the rolling thunder of drums and guitar drowning in reverb. It gives Torchlight II a kind of sinister charm, where despite the brightness of the colors, theres a sense of dread tugging at the corners. When mixed with the quick taps of skill rotations in gameplay, with ceaseless target prioritization and potion quaffing and crowd control and bursts of critical hit damage totals, Torchlight II becomes a mesmerizing, laser-focused action-RPG experience, a blitz on all senses, a perpetual, interactive fireworks display. Like with Diablo, item drops from monster are randomized, so youre never sure what will fall from the dead. Sometimes its a basic pistol youll never use, sometimes its a rare two-handed sword with high damage and the perfect statistical attachments to complement your play style. Playing is a constant tease, where each magic blast or arrow flurry might reward you with the ideal upgrade, which when equipped inspires confidence, a feeling of ever-growing personal power as you descend into the next dungeon and battle whatever unknown dangers await. Its an expertly paced cycle of upgrading that never leaves room for rest, as more menacing challenges are never far away, and the promise of greater reward never fades. Runic Games world design helps with this. Torchlight II feels like more an adventure than the original, as youll cross large outdoor spaces, from stony fields to deserts to poisonous bogs to the murky depths of a steampunk hellscape. All the while Runic maintains the element of surprise and ensures the action doesnt get dull. The world of Torchlight II is utterly stuffed with monsters. If theres only a speck of shadow indicating unexplored space on your minimap, chances are creatures lurk underneath, so theres never a lack of targets to swat at. Often what seemed like a small pack of monsters could double or triple in number as one summons help. Random wave-based challenges might start up around what was, at first glance, an unremarkable stone. Killing an itinerant phase beast might open a portal to a dungeon filled with gold. Monsters cast devastating area of effect spells, teleport, charge at high speed, poison, and generally make it excruciatingly obvious theyd like to kill you, forcing you to stay alert and mobile to stay alive. Throughout all this the gameplay never gets stalled in the muck of tedium, because distractions so often pop up and ensure theres no all-purpose approach to battle. Runic Games stuck with a classically-styled character progression formula, which makes sense given the studio's Blizzard North pedigree. When you level, skill and attribute points need to be manually distributed, giving you full control of your characters growth and specializations. The way you develop your class is also, for the most part, permanent, which adds tension to every interaction with the skill tree, yet a very limited respec option leaves just enough room to try out different skills. This approach to character development builds a sharply defined sense of identity for every created character, and provides an incentive to replay the same class over and over again, experimenting with new and radically different builds. In another game the process of replaying content could be dreadful, but the fantastic skill design of Torchlight II prevents this. Should you build the Outlander into a superpowered rapid-fire ranged damage cannon with duel pistols? Or should you instead build the class with crowd control skills to keep enemies away and focus on summoning, so that simply by killing enemies youre simultaneously spawning an army of shadowy helpers? Or maybe a mix? You could, theoretically, learn every skill in a class tree, but doing so would mean youre not spending those points on powering up existing skills and, with every five points, unlocking new effects for the skill. Its a system that rewards those willing to heavily invest in a handful of skills that mesh well together, specializing and creating a unique style of combat for every created character. It never lets you make a decision without feeling like youre missing out on something interesting, which strengthens the desire to replay content and makes the results feel worthwhile. Youll want to complement your skill build with the right items, which come with all sorts of attachments from elemental attack and resistance bonuses to health, mana and attribute buffs. Gear can be modified in several ways, socketed with stat-boosting gems and attached to special enchantments, a system Runic keeps flexible by allowing for enchantment and gem removal in case you make a decision that doesnt wind up working out. Like other great action-RPGs, the hunt for the perfect set of armor and weapons is really what drives motivation to continue playing, as you perfect combat techniques and adapt to Torchlight IIs quick pace when fighting against big enemy packs. Once you find a nice class-specific piece of gear, or a weapon that falls in line with the way youve built out the skill tree, its a supremely satisfying moment. Its like hitting a slot machine jackpot where all the preceding reel spins resulted in no losses, a constant hailstorm of positive reinforcement over finely honed, ultra-smooth gameplay. Along with the old-school rigidity of Runic's character development mechanics, many more modern conveniences are layered in. The pet that follows you around serves as an alternate inventory like in the first Torchlight, and can be sent off to sell unwanted gear while youre still slaying in dungeons, and even told to return with potions and scrolls. Features like these show Runics depth of experience with the genre, introducing risk, convenience and randomness in all the right areas, generating an adventure that never feels irritating and always lets you easily get into a fight. Much more than the first Torchlight, Torchlight II is built for longevity. You can play in single-player offline mode if you want, or jump into online or LAN co-operative games where enemies scale up in difficulty as more join in. Even if the online interface isnt as fully featured as something like Diablo III (you cant link items through the chat field, for example), Runic still implements smart design features, like making it so every player gets unique drops, eliminating the threat of cool stuff getting stolen in case you're playing with inconsiderate strangers. After the first playthrough is completed theres still plenty to do, too. A map room unlocks at the very end of the game, where more dungeon runs can be purchased with in-game gold, you can try out additional difficulty settings, roll a hardcore character where death is permanent, and can start up a new game+ mode where you restart the adventure with all character progress intact, letting you level to the cap against more challenging monsters and really get a sense of how powerful your class can become. Who knows whatll wind up coming out of the modding community that builds up around Torchlight II, but even without community-created content, Runics already included plenty of reasons to continue playing for many, many hours. Considering this all costs $20 on Steam, it's a pretty incredible deal. THE VERDICT Torchlight II doesnt do anything radically new, but does everything incredibly well. It fits all the pieces of varied monster behavior, interesting items, excellent skill design and random surprises together into a near-perfect formula, where the action never stops and rewards are never far away. Every level up, skill boost and item replacement flirts with a sense of invulnerability in a world obsessed with killing you, demanding continued play by teasing eventual omnipotence. The story and characters arent particularly memorable, but that hardly hurts the strength of Runics focused design in whats one of the finest loot-driven action-RPGs available.", "date": "Sept. 21, 2012"}
