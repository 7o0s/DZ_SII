Somehow, flying high above a deserted Paris in VR doesnt induce nausea. Somehow, quickly navigating tight environments using your head and neck feels smooth and responsive. Somehow, its in-flight escort missions arent frustrating, but fun. The novelty soon wears off, but whats there reaches greater heights than many PlayStation VR games accomplish. Eagle Flight has a fantastic control system thats easy to learn, comfortable to use, and responsive enough to allow for some seriously challenging level design. Looking around makes slight changes to your direction, while tilting your head results in large swoops and u-turns. A brief and effective tutorial showed me the ropes in no time at all, and soon I was soaring between buildings and through trees with no issues. Even after a few hours of non-stop play, I was nausea free. That includes time at high altitude, where everything is far enough away to feel slow, and time in some of the fastest, most narrow challenge levels, where collisions can happen at any second. Its so comfortable that Id often ignore objectives and just fly around for fun. Spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while you're flying. Your controller is used for speeding up, slowing down, and things like firing your weapon (a shriek that emits a powerful sonic blast) at enemy birds. It was smart to keep directional control entirely off the DualShock 4, as its simply not needed and might have complicated things. Plus, with less to worry about, you can spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while youre flying. In fact, I highly recommend doing that. Post-Apocalyptic Paris A great control system wouldnt mean much without a beautiful place to fly though, but post-humanity Paris is a great choice for it. In fact, Eagle Flight begins with quite the strong impression. Youre flying above a city, and as you swoop lower you see zebras and bears on the streets. Eventually, you realize the whole city is green  probably too green  and then it dawns on you: people dont live here anymore. If youre a bit slower on the realization, an overgrown Eiffel Tower should do it. Animals and cars can look blocky, but thats only really noticeable at low altitude. For much of the time I spent flying, the world looks great, and you have the best view in the house. The difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. In story mode, progression through the sections of Paris is quick enough to stay interesting, and the difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. Missions range from collecting feathers (a throwback to Ubisofts Assassins Creed if there ever was one) to navigating abandoned subways to escorting injured eagles to safety -- all while fending off pesky vultures and crows with your supersonic breath blasts. None of these activities would be exceptionally fun on their own, but the flight mechanics are so enjoyable and easy to use that adding an extra responsibility or two makes for a good challenge. A few of the modes can be unreasonably challenging thanks to a narrow field of view. For example, when the crows youre chasing learn the ability to leave behind wind traps it can be almost impossible to dodge them if the level design includes tight turns or narrow spaces. Theres also a mode that leads you through rings (yes, like Superman 64). Hitting the center of the ring gives you a speed boost, and therefore a better time and a higher leaderboard result. However, Eagle Flight only shows you the current objective ring and the next one, and the rings are often close enough together that it would be helpful to see at least the next two or three when youre moving at that speed. Losing a mission or earning fewer stars because of guesswork isnt a great feeling. Two Birds, One Stone The four-hour campaign does a fine job of preparing you for multiplayer, which definitely has the unique factor going for it. Its capture the flag as birds, and the flag is an animal carcass. Its fun, but limited. With simple controls and only a handful of defensive or offensive options, only rudimentary teamwork is possible. You can defend your flag-carrying teammate using your eagle screeches, and trying to score all alone rarely works. The lack of additional modes soon gets repetitive, but like the rest of Eagle Flight, multiplayer succeeds on the strength of its controls and just how comfortable it is to play. Just dont expect to play it for months. Eagle Flight surprised me with how quickly I felt at home flying and fighting with other birds above Paris. It features some of the best and most responsive and comfortable gameplay available on the PSVR, though like most current VR games its appeal may be short-lived if youre not a completionist whos crazy about collectibles or high scores. This is a weird idea, well executed, that soars high.", "date": "Nov. 15, 2016,"}
