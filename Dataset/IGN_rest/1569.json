Which is probably why Tecmo Koei keeps re-releasing, porting, improving, and polishing it. For the PlayStation Vita's launch, the deadliest ninja in video gaming once again graces gamers with his presence with the same, but slightly improved version of his most famous adventure. Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus is a port of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, which is an enhanced port of Ninja Gaiden Black, which is an improved version of Ninja Gaiden. Yeah, this is the fourth time this game has been available, so it's presumable that most of you who have wanted to play it already have. But if you've been holding out for the last eight years, Sigma Plus is a nice port of one of the most iconic action games of the last two generations of gaming. Yeah, go for the shins, Ryu! Ryu Hayabusa is a ninja, and as such he spends most of the game flipping out and killing everyone. Whether it's other ninjas, evil soldiers, or demonic Fiends, Ryu dispatches them with deadly combo attacks and lightning-fast swordplay. Since this is the Sigma version of Ninja Gaiden, the scantily clad Fiend-slayer Rachel is also playable for a few missions. She serves as a fun, though less exciting, foil to Ryu. Ninja Gaiden is known for being an intense, difficult action game that will test your skills and your patience. It's not for everyone, but if you're willing to learn how to master the art of ninjutsu you'll find a wickedly satisfying action game. Ninja Gaiden looks pretty good on Vita. Granted it is essentially an HD port of an Xbox game, but the game runs smoothly and quickly. Regrettably the dull and flat colors, thanks largely to the lackluster environments most of the game takes place in, are not pleasing on the eye. The cutscenes, however, still come off stellar, even if they're telling a confusing and mostly BS story. For the Vita port, Tecmo Koei added some touchscreen controls for things like projectile attacks, which makes aiming and shooting significantly easier by allowing you to tap enemies and hurl shuriken or shoot arrows. Ninpo is relegated to the rear touch panel, which will likely be hit or miss for gamers who are not used to having to reach behind their handheld just to shoot a fireball. Unfortunately, the ~Plus~ portion of Ninja Gaiden doesn't include things like fixing the game's notoriously subpar camera (which can't keep track of crazy ninjas on a killing spree). Likewise the loading issues which cause Ninja Gaiden to hiccup when entering rooms is still present, and eight years later it's starting to get annoying. CLOSING COMMENTS If you werent crazy about Ninja Gaiden the last three times, this is the same game, so keep walking. Likewise if you already played either Black or Sigma, youre probably ok to hold off, too. But for those of you that only played the 2004 original, or missed the game entirely, youve now got a beefed up, extra content edition that you can play anywhere. Thats worth flipping out and killing dudes over.
