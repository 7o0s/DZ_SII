When Konami combined the two inThe Simpsons Arcade Game, gamers everywhere were treated to a perfect storm of coin-op bliss. The game stands as one of the all-time classics from the era, and one that bizarrely never received a home console version. Until now that is, as The Simpsons Arcade is finally available, joining the ranks of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and X-Men on PSN and XBLA. This is the first console port of the game, which has seen a PC version and a ~sort-of~ port to iOS. For fans of the arcade game, The Simpsons Arcade is everything that fans of the original would hope for; it captures the look and feel of the original game perfectly, and even manages to sneak in some new features. The Simpsons: The Arcade Game Video Review For the uninitiated, The Simpsons Arcade is a four-player co-op side-scrolling beat 'em up. You play as four members of the Simpson family (Marge, Homer, Bart, and Lisa) as they fight their way through hordes of villains to save Maggie, who has been kidnapped by Smithers, who for reasons unknown has taken to diamond theft and wearing a cape (oh, Waylon). The action is divided as most arcade games from the time were; each stage has its own boss that you must face leading up to the final battle against perennial Springfield villain, Monty Burns himself. Okay, so maybe fighting against a geriatric gadzillionaire might not sound very compelling, the action in The Simpsons Arcade is tight, balanced, and very fun, especially with three friends. The Simpsons Arcade is more than just a straightforward port of the original game. There some decent unlockables, the biggest of which for arcade purists is the addition of the rare Japanese ROM (unlocked after completing the game once). The Japanese version of the game makes some general changes to the gameplay, including a different point system that offers a different take on scoring (including bonuses for remaining life at the end of each level), some new items including atom bombs that you can use in stages, the ability to stack your health and power it beyond the maximum of your health bar, and a couple of other tweaks. While many casual gamers might not notice much of a difference between the two versions, hardcore fanatics will love the inclusion. Things get pretty weird in Dreamland. You can also unlock some modest bonuses like original promotional art, music tracks, sound effects, and character art. You'll get one of each depending on which character you beat the game with, and while not very in-depth reveals about the game, they're still a nice if basic feature. One interesting inclusion comes from the game's various modes, which impose limits on how many quarters you can use. There's the standard freeplay option, but others that limit you and your friends to 40 quarters in all, one that gives you just 10, and a survival mode where you only get one life to take on the whole game. These new modes add in an extra degree of challenge for arcade purists, and are a welcome addition to the game and to arcade ports in general. The Simpsons Arcade looks and sounds just as you remember it. The soundtrack is great, and the tinny quality of the voice acting and themes is endearing. The game's animation is still solid, and the bright colorful sprites pop nicely against the game's backgrounds. You'll find some subtle nuances and in-jokes from the show littering the background, including some familiar characters making cameo appearances. The game's default ~sharp~ setting gives the characters more detail but looks pretty pixilated in HD, while the ~smooth~ setting is considerably less blocky at the cost of some detail. Neither setting is particularly hideous however, so it mostly boils down to a matter of preference. As with other arcade games that don't fill up widescreen televisions, there's the option to use a cabinet background instead of just blacked edges surrounding the screen. However, whereas other games have themes and interesting designs on their borders, The Simpsons Arcade opts to go a plainer route with a rather boring black and gray edge around the gameplay screen. While this in no way is a deal breaker for the game, it feels like a squandered opportunity given the franchise's rich artistic history. CLOSING COMMENTS The Simpsons Arcade is a throwback to a bygone era, when an arcade games ultimate goal to toss as many enemies at you as possible while pushing you along and gobbling up as many of your quarters as it possibly could. For those not weaned in the coin-op heyday, The Simpsons Arcade might feel too repetitive and too short. However, for those of us who were, The Simpsons Arcade is an absolute blast.
