Because it's largely identical across both platforms, the original review still applies and is summarized here in the verdict. This review focuses on the PC version's unique features.] Planning a turn in Frozen Synapse Prime provides the same inexplicable joy of meticulously setting dominoes on end, only to watch them topple in a fraction of the time it took to arrange them. Aside from its ability to reliably accommodate a staggering array of tactics, Primes greatest asset is the glorious tension of that moment when you bite your nails, flick the first domino, and wonder, Is this actually going to work? That consistent satisfaction makes this an excellent tactics game. Naturally, the PC version of Frozen Synapse Prime retains all the interface improvements, campaign smoothing, and gameplay additions (like tutorials and killcams) outlined above, but it also adds Arenas -- five brand- new, highly- specific multiplayer scenarios, each with its own unique hook. Chasm, for example, locks each team in a confined space that doesnt allow units in or out, turning each match into a bizarre but tense whack-a-mole standoff as each commander attempts to pick off his opponents soldiers through strategically placed windows. The other four modes remix existing game elements in similar ways, cleverly creating experiences that feel fresh despite reusing all the same key ingredients found in every other mode. And if youd rather stick with the traditional randomly generated multiplayer matches, Prime PC still effortlessly allows you to juggle multiple matches by backing out to the multiplayer menu and attending to whatever on-going matches require your immediate attention. Obviously the PC version loses the Vitas excellently implemented touch controls, but the mouse/keyboard combo once again proves to be the most precise and efficient way to play. The space bar opens the command wheel, commands are mapped to the number keys, the mouse scroll wheel zooms the camera in and out -- the whole setup is so intuitive I didnt even have to think before clicking after the first few rounds. Prime PC also offers controller support (as well as Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, of course), but seriously, stick with the keyboard. Even on PC (where many hardened fans still play the original Frozen Synapse), Prime really is the definitive version of an already excellent game. Every update is thoughtful and thorough, bolstering the core experience without compromising anything. The graphics might be grayer, but every other aspect is stronger, even if only slightly.

It deftly avoids the tedium that can sometimes plague strategy games, but still provides incredible depth for those with the patience to enjoy it.
