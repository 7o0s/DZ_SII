Super Motherload, from fledgling developer XGen Studios, sends us delving deep into the Martian surface to find precious minerals and gems to exchange for cold, hard cash. Indeed, the entire experience is predicated on a simple and repetitious  yet fairly engaging  premise, one that could prove to be addictive if not for Super Motherloads unfortunate frustrations and maddening ending. Can you dig it? After selecting your character, youre given a mining rover that can be used to dig ever deeper into Mars randomly generated red soil. Its at this point that  from the very beginning -- you see virtually everything Super Motherload has to offer, from graphics to gameplay. And thats okay, because on a mechanical level, it does what it does very well, even if it looks old and, on the periphery, quite unimpressive. Controlling your rover is simple, with movement mapped to either the directional pad or left analog stick, and digging is as simple as moving in the direction you want to excavate. The X button is used to float and fly back to areas above you, making sure youre never stranded in the bowels of the planet. As you dig, youll encounter metals and precious gems of all kinds, from cheap silver and gold to pricey diamonds and rubies, which makes you want to keep digging, since the further down you get, the more common valuable rocks become. Bringing these back to service checkpoints, of which there are several as you move your way deeper and deeper, allows you to exchange your findings for money, which can then be used to upgrade your rovers capabilities in fairly granular ways. You can increase your fuel capacity, better your drill bit, strengthen your armor, and much, much more. In this sense, Super Motherload has all of the trappings of something addictive, especially when you combine it with its rudimentary story  complete with passable voice acting  and pleasing soundtrack. Unfortunately, though, Super Motherload becomes monotonous before very long. While theres something intriguing about the experience -- something that caters to the OCD gamer in me that wants to dig up every last mineral and upgrade every little thing  its decidedly a one-trick pony. Digging down until your fuel is depleted, having to go back to the last station to refuel and deposit your findings, and then doing it all over again isnt only the core of Super Motherload. It is Super Motherload. Things do get changed up a bit when you take into account your rovers upgradeable smelter, which lets you combine minerals and gems to create more expensive items, explosives, and more. Likewise, finally passing through harder, more impervious soil types, rocks, and other materials that require better drill bits and bombs is strangely rewarding. But even with multiple characters rovers to upgrade, a few different endings to experience, and even local multiplayer to jump into, Super Motherload does very little to outright recommend it. Time to upgrade. And then theres the last boss battle. Oh, that completely deflating last boss battle! For some reason, an arcade-style digging game culminates with a final encounter that borders on the infuriating. A six-to-eight hour campaign that revolves around doing the same thing over and over again suddenly decides it wants you to fight, and fight hard. And without spoiling anything, lets just say that if you fail this battle, youll have to be prepared to delve thousands of digital feet back to the beginning of the battle while replenishing your supply of weapons and the money necessary to restore your craft to tiptop shape. For the little bursts of fun I had with Super Motherload, its last 10 minutes  which I had to play a dozen times before I completed it -- left a bad taste in my mouth. THE VERDICT Out of all of the PlayStation 4s launch games, Super Motherload may be the one least talked about, and theres a reason for that. Its a serviceable arcade game that provides its own share of fun, but its also repetitive  occasionally gratingly so  with a faade of robust customization options hiding the fact that were doing the same thing over and over again underneath. Outside of scratching that compulsive upgrade-cycle itch and a catchy soundtrack, its not really worth digging into.
