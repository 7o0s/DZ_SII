That idea, applied to a series of peculiar but engaging objectives, consistently leads to clever and oftentimes hilarious use of this puzzlers central mechanic. And those objectives are well worth tackling alongside a group of friends. Offering two sets of puzzles  one for up to two players and another set for up to four  Snipperclips simply throws you into each problem in a refreshing way. The only information it provides is a name and the basics of its snipping mechanic  characters can overlap and cut away those parts of each other. Being given so little direction is actually freeing because it prompts you and whoever youre playing with to think creatively. I found myself immediately exploring every level, testing the bouncy physics that cause items in the environment to react to whatever shapes youve created and occasionally messing with other players by cutting them to pieces before tackling the puzzlers wide away of eclectic challenges. No puzzle feels like there is a single correct solution.Experimentation is so rewarding because no puzzle, from matching a shape outline to helping a lone frog find its way to a friend, feels like there is a single correct method for solving it. Trying to get a baseball into a hoop? Maybe carefully carry it with your friend on your heads across the screen. Or, snip and clip a bowl-shaped indent onto your friends body to safely transport the ball. The Princess Power-Up minigame is a particular highlight  essentially a game within Snipperclips, you have to move an in-world joystick to control a princess who has to collect a series of diamonds. But, you must first cut the right path for her to walk, avoiding enemies along the way. I would take an entire expansion of these levels alone. I played Snipperclips while waiting for a movie at a theater, during dinner at a diner, and at home on the couch. The bite-sized approach to puzzle design delivered Snipperclips delivers a consistently fun experience no matter the setting., making good on the Switchs promise to be a console for use at home and on the go. Adding up to three more people in co-op just means more creativity from the different perspectives, and thus more fun, especially with the puzzles designed for larger groups. Make a gear out of your friend, transport sludge via a ramp made from your characters body, or pop balloons with another players head sharpened to a point. Every weird solution, or attempt at one, is a delight to work through in all of Snipperclips more than 60 puzzles. And the bright, angular art design is easily understandable and a joy to play through, so it rarely left me or other players at all confused about how to proceed throughout those challenges. The player characters ridiculous facial expressions only add to the silly nature of your tasks, as they squint under the weight of every bowling or baseball or gasp in horror as their friends snip away at them. Snipperclips is undoubtedly more fun when playing with others.Snipperclips is undoubtedly more fun when playing with others. Though just about everything can be completed alone, even the four-player challenges, taking the right steps to trap a firefly, catch some fish, or deliver a bird egg to its nest for hatching can often be more tedious than entertaining when snipping solo. And while later puzzles can get tough, most levels are forgiving, with reset buttons often included in each level and the ability to reform your character with a simple button press. Snipperclips control scheme is also simple and easy to grasp, so having two built-in controllers with the Joy-Cons makes for readymade pick-up-and-play opportunities. There are a few competitive options as well  air hockey, basketball, and a fighting dojo where whoever can snip their friends into oblivion first wins  but theyre more amusing diversions than modes worth revisiting time and again. All three are also particularly more fun with three players rather than two  the frenetic action becomes a bit of controlled chaos that is a blast in short bursts. But they dont extend Snipperclips life too long after the handful of hours it takes to beat all of the puzzles. With a clever idea for 2D physics-based puzzle solving and a bright and colorful personality, Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together! is a good experience by yourself and a great one with friends. Solving every puzzle wont take too long, but Snipperclips is continuously clever in its puzzle design and adorably fun to watch play. It left me eagerly waiting to reunite more frogs, put together more cat puzzles, and solve whatever other odd challenges developer SFB Games might have in mind.", "date": "March 7, 2017,"}
