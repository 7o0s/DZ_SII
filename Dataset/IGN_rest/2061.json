Not because I felt like I missed anything the first time around  I was as fastidious as developer Capcom encouraged me to be  but because my journey through Raccoon City was so consistently packed with tense monster moments and breakneck-paced fun, and it was so challenging throughout its six-odd hours, that I wanted to jump in and do it all over again with sharper skills and knowledge. My undying enthusiasm for it speaks volumes of the polish seen in this remake, and the finesse with which it manages to tread the tightrope between a confident modern horror and a tonal callback to the original Resident Evil trilogy. Note: This review exclusively covers the single-player campaign of Resident Evil 3. We'll follow up with a review of the multiplayer side, Resident Evil: Resistance, ASAP.Resident Evil 3 takes place nearly concurrently with the events of the equally accomplished Resident Evil 2, and follows different characters. The endearingly practical Jill Valentine  last seen in the original Resident Evil and its Directors Cut  is called upon by a roguish Umbrella Corp mercenary by the name of Carlos Oliviera to help save the remaining inhabitants of a demolished Raccoon City from the carnage spawned by the T-Virus outbreak. Of course, nothing goes to plan, and Jill finds herself in a wonderfully labyrinthine, zombie-studded playground where she  and your nerves  must also contend with the threat of an invulnerable monster called Nemesis. Its a very classic Resident Evil set up, but then, this is a remake of a classic, goofily fun Resident Evil story -- the original 1999 game. The major story events from the original Resident Evil 3 are all there, albeit rearranged, and the cheesiness the early trilogy is known for is delivered in a charmingly self-knowing way. How is it no one in the hospital ever noticed all this? Jill wonders aloud after discovering a massive underground base that isnt particularly well hidden. Resident Evil 3 is also, fortunately, very efficient in its storytelling; the villain is perfectly villainous, the heroes are all selfless and charming, and cutscenes are lean yet efficiently deliver big dramatic moments. It carries the gameplay swiftly along, in other words, and never gets bogged down in unnecessary exposition. Capcom has done an incredible job in the small details here.The chaotic, ruined Raccoon City goes a long way toward bringing Resident Evils story and the broader universe to life. Once again working within the RE Engine that powered both last years Resident Evil 2 and 2017s Resident Evil 7, Capcom has done an incredible job in the small details here; from the in-universe advertising (No Spares in This Game! reads the tagline for a movie called Sudden Death Bowling) to the detritus left by citizens who had to escape in a hurry, to Resident Evil 2-related Easter eggs (Now heres a weird f****ing door! Carlos says upon encountering the Spade Door, which is so significant in Resident Evil 2s police station) and genuinely compelling in-game notes and journals that give background context to some poor guys tragic death and/or reveal a code to open a safe. These are spaces that feel realistically inhabited and then abandoned, full of the sort of detail that had me poring every inch of a room after Id killed everything in it. This detail and polish extend to Resident Evil 3s broader environments, which are stunning. Smashed cars are piled up outside of flickering neon signs, fires lick their way across kitschy storefronts, and broad industrial spaces are eerily empty. Although you cant interact much with the world unless you are specifically instructed to (this is still a Resident Evil game and is thus inhospitably rigid with its options for touching things) the atmosphere around you is always pulling out all the stops to make you feel vulnerable and small. Not to lean too much into cliches, but I literally jumped at my own in-game shadow more than once. At the very least, every room has useful items or a secret.Like its predecessor, and indeed, every decent Resident Evil game before it, every part of Resident Evil 3s world feels deliberately put together. No enemy is thrown in for the sake of it, no room is there just because; at the very least, every room has useful items or a secret. Areas house problems to solve or clues that lead you to other areas and then back again; a fire obstructs one route, for example, and must be extinguished with the help of a part hidden in a nearby building  a building which also houses a weapon that can't be accessed without the use of a tool that's located past the area obstructed by fire. These tasks might sound video-gamey (and they are), but solving them is never a chore thanks to elegant, interlocking level design that makes backtracking easy. When I say easy, I dont mean safe, though, because that corpse on the floor in that building you were in 30 minutes ago, for example, may not be a corpse any longer. Thankfully, the Resident Evil 2 Remake map screen returns, dutifully logging exactly where you saw that locked safe and highlighting if youve missed any items after exploring a room. As long as you're careful you won't feel like you're being punished.Item micromanagement is where Resident Evil 3 leans hardest into its old-school survival horror lineage. Like the original (and in RE2), items are your lifeline and inventory is limited, and running back and forth between storage chests to make sure nothing is wasted and certain items are combined in smart ways is a must if you want to survive for long. I rarely ran out of bullets and health  at least during my first run on Standard mode  but this was due to diligent scavenging rather than items being plentiful. As long as youre careful in Resident Evil 3, you wont feel like youre being punished, and thats the mark of any good classic survival horror game. A sense of dread as you navigate Resident Evil 3s puzzle box of a world is not unfounded, as you can be easily caught unawares by a number of deadly nasties. Theres plenty of variety in enemy design here to keep things fresh, such as the spider-like Drain Deimos who will poison Jill with parasites (the cure is to eat a green herb and then throw up), Pale Heads (first seen in the Resident Evil 2 DLC) who can only be downed by a very accurate blow to the head with your most extreme weaponry, and more things trying to eat your brains beyond your garden variety zombie. Even the latter can prove deadly, especially because they feel faster and more erratic in their movements than their predecessors in Resident Evil 2 and can show up in big enough numbers to really overwhelm you. There's plenty of variety in enemies to keep things fresh.Fortunately, Jill is a lot nimbler on her feet than Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield, which gives Resident Evil 3 a more frantic, action-oriented feel than its predecessor (though its not all-out-action like Resident Evil 5 or 6, dont worry). Jill has a quick step move that allows her to sidestep an incoming attack, and when timed just right it earns you a slight slow-motion effect to help you escape. Its a move I used regularly and compulsively, and it proved as important to the minute-to-minute combat as Jills handgun. Some of its best moments involved me getting a jump scare from an unexpected zombie and dodging out of its way via pure muscle memory before lining up a headshot with my shotgun. Of course, Jill isnt limited to a single gun; she gradually unlocks the classic Resident Evil arsenal (handgun, shotgun, grenade launcher, etc.), and each weapon feels satisfyingly weighty to shoot. More importantly, I used every gun right up until the end, thanks to upgrades to basic weapons that extend their shelf-life significantly. My original shotgun, for example, was upgraded with a Shell Holder, Tactical Stock, and a Semi-Auto Barrel, which made it far more efficient against Resi 3s tougher enemies in the latter part of the campaign. I faced one of RE3's most delightfully difficult challenges as Carlos.To shake up the pace, Resident Evil 3 intermittently switches you to Carlos perspective; our merc is a little less scrappy and nimble and a little more action-forward than Jill, equipped with a powerful assault rifle that can clear a room from the get-go, at the cost of precious ammunition. That doesnt mean its easier  I faced one of Resident Evil 3s most delightfully difficult challenges as Carlos, which involved plowing down wave after wave after wave of enemies in a very confined space. It was, not to put too fine a point on it, a blast. But this is primarily Jills show, and she needs everything at her disposal. Resident Evil 3s central antagonist, Nemesis, is powerful and fast, moving like a giant, horribly disfigured cat stalking and pouncing on its prey across a series of exhilarating boss fights. These battles see you face off against him in sprawling arenas; its just you and your arsenal against whatever horrific form hes evolved into. Executing a perfect dodge as he leaps at you from afar is a wonderful feeling, as is blowing him off the side of a building with a mine grenade. Nemesis is powerful and fast, moving like a giant, horribly disfigured cat.Its a shame, then, that he doesnt show up more often. Mr. X in Resident Evil 2 is so frightening because his presence felt unexpected, which led to a feeling that you were never safe even if you were in areas you thought you could be. Nemesis apes this pattern in Resident Evil 3s first couple of hours  theres a brilliantly climactic showdown with him that involves you desperately trying to escape through a vent as he pursues you  but he soon gets relegated to big, pre-programmed boss fights. Once that happens, that sense of the looming pursuer operating under his own AI is lost. There is no New Game Plus after Resident Evil 3s campaign, but completing in-game challenges  such as collecting all bobbleheads, knocking X number of hats off a zombie, X number of kills with a certain weapon, etc  unlock a shop where you can cash in your points on useful items to be used in a second or third playthrough. These items, such as coins that make your attacks more powerful or weapons with infinite ammo, made my next playthrough on Resident Evil 3s hard mode a lot more...manageable. Like Resident Evil 2 before it, Resident Evil 3s 2020 remake does an amazing job of recapturing the horror and tension of the late 90s original while completely modernizing its gameplay. It plays like a 2020 game because it is a 2020 game. The classic world is brought to life in glorious detail, and smart level design makes exploring it a delight and replaying it almost compulsory. If only all remakes could be this good; bring on the next one.", "date": "March 30, 2020"}
