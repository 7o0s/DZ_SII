And while its lighter than its predecessors in terms of the amount of content included, Deus Ex Go is decidedly more challenging, offering stage after stage of brain-teasing and occasionally maddening puzzles that are often a joy to solve. Beating Deus Ex Gos stages requires a clever mix of stealth abilities and the movement patterns of enemies to allow Adam Jensen to slip by unnoticed. Though most abilities and foes are revealed early in the three-hour campaign, the adventures difficulty intensifies by layering on complexity to those initial ideas. (Itll last a little longer if the truly testing late-game puzzles stump you for a while  and theres no shame in that.) Lara Croft gunned down and speared foes with frequency in the last Go, but though a fulfilling robo-smackdown is called for every now and then, determining how to manipulate the hacking system is perhaps Jensens most prevalent  and satisfying  skill. Its used for apparently simple environmental puzzles where floor panels can be hacked to make them materialize or rotate, but thats made less straightforward because certain enemies can short-circuit Jensens wiring plans. Sometimes these robotic foes need to be avoided, but at other times they can be turned into an asset: you can take control of a bot and use it to cut out the power to prevent a charging guard from killing Jensen, or turn a spinning platform at just the right moment. In the best levels, determining how a hacked turret or enemy drone can be used to grant safe passage is as gratifying as the Go series has ever been. Even more so than in Lara Croft Go or Hitman Go, I found myself banging my head (and tapping my fingers) against a tough level for a while before stepping away, only to return a few minutes later with a cleared mind and solve it without a second thought. Its a much appreciated spike in difficulty after the fun but relatively breezy adventure Lara Croft journeyed on, though occasionally Jensens path is mired by poorly telegraphed twists. Often, the solution for a puzzle demanded reframing the originally taught lessons about enemy behavior and abilities, which is a good idea that can keep you from falling into a mental rut, except I didnt feel like I always had all the pieces of the puzzle. Knowing Jensens array of abilities early on is helpful, but now and then the solution lay in spotting a new concept subtly embedded in the environment. Sometimes you have to arbitrarily stumble on new concepts through experimentation, or worse, by accident. For instance, we learn about the invisibility device in the opening levels, but I had to figure out that it can double as a projectile in specific stages, and the only hint is noticing a new cue in the room. The beautiful minimalist design may be both a blessing and a curse. The beautiful minimalist design may be both a blessing and a curse in that respect. Deus Ex Go captures the signature color palette and triangular aesthetic of Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but the stripped-down modern approach can make those visual prompts easy to overlook. While the sleek, futuristic interiors of underground laboratories backed by a synth-driven score and the enjoyable crunches of mechanical foes crumbling are pleasant to run through, the lack of depth to the environments makes them easy to forget as soon as you move onto the next level. Its also a little flat. Lara Croft Go played with depth in intriguing ways by hiding treasures and creating a cohesive universe that was worth revisiting, and Hitman Go offered multiple objectives in each scenario. Deus Ex Gos world may be nice to look at, but theres little surrounding Jensens mission to invest in. (Deus Ex Go is set to receive a puzzle editor post-launch, but that feature was not available to test ahead of release.) That lack of an interesting world surrounding the puzzles goes for the story too, which includes interstitial conversations and occasional bits of dialogue peppered throughout. Less is more in the case of a Go game, as here the plot feels more like a hindrance to getting to the next puzzle than interesting ways of fleshing out the world. Almost every level of Deus Ex Go delivers a confounding but ultimately rewarding puzzle worth solving. Though the world around those puzzles is relatively empty and replay potential is limited, Square Enix Montreal has mixed a healthy stealth and hacking focus with a bit of action to create a clever and, at times, truly testing set of brain teasers.", "date": "Aug. 18, 2016,"}
