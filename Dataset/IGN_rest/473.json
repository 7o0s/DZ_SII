With electro-torture exercise bikes, spiked soda machines and other fun, twisted devices, Fallout 4s Vault-Tec Workshop DLC lets you conduct heartless experiments on weary Commonwealth refugeesbut only if you want to. For everyone else, this DLC pack offers one of the largest settlement spaces available, as well as a slew of fun and efficient new items to craft. Vault-Tec is the third workshop DLC for Fallout 4, but its the first to include any story-based missions. However, if more post-apocalyptic storytelling is what youre mainly after, youre much better off with Far Harbor or Automatron. Vault-Tecs main string of quests takes only a few hours to complete, and while it does include a few memorable characters, theyre not reason enough to jump in on their own. Look at all the unsuspecting test subjects. After discovering a radio signal on your Pip-Boy, youre led to Vault 88 and its 200-year-old Ghoul Overseer and her hilariously broken moral compass. You can kill her or make her leave if you're not into virtual sadism, or you can go along with her master plan to lure in new residents and continue Vault-Tecs devious experiments. I recommend playing along just to watch her justify her cruel beliefs. Among the things she believes are wasteful are exercise, socializing, and health care. No amount of rational, empathetic arguments can change her mind. Watching dwellers stumble around zapped out of their minds is entertaining. Aside from a few laughs, the payoff to playing her game is that youll unlock custom versions of new craftable items. Do you want to make some exercise bikes for your Vault dwellers? What about a bike that shocks people when theyre peddling too slow? Would your residents enjoy spending some time at a slot machine? How about one thats rigged to tempt and addict its users, slowly draining them of money? (Now that I think about it, Im not sure how that one is different from real life) These items are fun to build and use, and watching your dwellers stumble around high as a kite or zapped out of their minds is entertaining for a while. If you dont do the quest youll still get normal versions of the new contraptions, so youre not missing much by opting out. The real reward, which you'll get one way or the other, is the vault itself. Pedal smarter, not harder! Vault 88 is absolutely gigantic. Sure, its in ruins when you arrive, but thats actually a benefit because theres a huge amount of scrap to salvage. After clearing out just the main cavern youll have enough materials to build a substantial Vault of your own. This is a smart move, since a lot of people dont have a stockpile of materials on hand or, if playing on PC, dont want to use the console commands to cheat. You wont need to scrounge steel and concrete for hours before starting. You'll have to do a bit of enjoyable spelunking to unlock the area's full potential. If youre a builder who thinks big, Vault 88 can accommodate. When in Workshop mode, certain entire walls of rubble can be removed to allow access into deep tunnels. There you can find even more scrap, radioactive materials, and some powerful creatures that are challenging, but not prohibitiveyou can enter Vault 88 whenever you want, but Bethesda recommends being at least level 20. You cant build in the tunnels until you find the control boards for each zone, so youll have to do a bit of enjoyable spelunking to unlock the areas full potential. Vault 88 is my new home sweet home. Part of that potential is that Vault-Tec adds a ton of new craftable items, from practical to decorative. Dozens of Vault parts, from floors to walls to windows and everything in between, are available in different aesthetic versions: cafeteria, clinic, nursery, Overseers office, and more. These parts are accessible in any settlement, so if the Vault-Tec slogan of Better Living, Underground doesnt do it for you, you can take your fancy Vault parts to the surface and probably confuse a lot of people. The visual variety is great, but for hardcore builders, the real reward comes in the form of practical new items. The DLC includes the two largest power generators available (the largest provides 500 power). Aside from looking awesome, it allows you to be far cleaner and more efficient with your power management. It includes a massive water pump as well (no pun intended), meaning you can get straight to the fun parts and never worry about providing for your dwellers again. Vault-Tec Workshops wealth of new structures and tools make it essential for hardcore crafters and Overseer wannabes alike. Its handful of hilarious characters and quests dont stand up on their own, but theyre not the reason youd attend the show in the first place. This is settlement builders dream, through and through.", "date": "July 27, 2016,"}
