Its quiet and reflective: four drag-and-droppable panels act as small windows into a beautiful and dreamlike hand-drawn universe. But as you scroll, stack, layer, and zoom in or out of each scene, you get the feeling that the world inside each box is too vast and magical to be contained. Even the most static scenes burst with life, and when rearranged create new dynamics that reveal a fascinating dual nature (mysterious, sad, and even a little frightening) as panels merge together in exciting and satisfying ways. This fleeting tale takes about one to two hours to complete, but its absorbing and ambiguous story  an elegant exploration of spirituality in its most beautiful and destructive forms  will stay with you for a long time after. When first laid out, each set of seemingly unrelated images looks like random pages torn from an abstract comic or a childs storybook. These moments are sometimes compact and ordinary: an apple hanging from a branch; a lantern on a pile of dusty books; a compass; a map; a photograph. Other scenes sprawl across two interlocking panels into wide landscapes or cluttered interior shots you can then click to pan through or zoom into to reveal new, sometimes much darker moments hidden just out of sight of the original perspective: a destroyed city, a gutted toy in a pile of rubble, a glyph of meteors raining down on a temple. Scattered and mysterious in their disconnection, this stage of each puzzle feels like a story told in the logic of dreams, as alluring as it is elusive. But as you explore, rearrange, and stack its panels  sometimes stripping layers off one image to create two distinct ones  its disjointed vignettes, symbols, and scenes start to come together in increasingly surprising ways. In one sequence, I stole the glow of a distant star to light a lantern. In another, I guided a character through a series of framed photographs by stacking doorways, rotating ancient ruins, and slotting the patterns of a porcelain plate into a floating cog. In these puzzles time and space arent bound by the laws of physics, allowing old and new to merge into a singular moment. I found myself reaching far into the past and out into distant lands to enact change on the present  a clever mechanism that fuels the fresh and magical interactions behind each puzzle and acts as a bittersweet meditation on memory and loss. In this way, every exciting step in my journey also became a startling revelation about Gorogoas captivating mythology  small moments that play towards a larger, more intricate whole. Gorogoa explores the nature of spirituality, myth, and history with a wordless elegance.Like nearly all puzzle games Gorogoas imaginative puzzles sadly lose that initial spark of excitement after you learn their tricks, but its ambiguous and somber story warrants more than one playthrough, as late-game revelations lend insightful new context to its early moments. It is Gorogoas biggest, most fulfilling puzzle to piece together: you help guide a young boy on his quest to collect fruits for a majestic yet terrifying beast, but for what purpose is not immediately known. Images of war and destruction juxtapose scenes of great wealth and royalty. Lavish palaces stand tall over the crumbling ruins of a city. Between and even during the process of solving a puzzle I often found myself reading Gorogoa like a book or admiring it like you would a painting, allowing its collection of detailed landscapes, cluttered homes, and ancient artifacts to take on new meanings over time until its story became a living, breathing thing rather than just a serviceable plot. Gorogoa's puzzles never feel like obstacles to overcome one at a time  they are the means by which the story is told. Through its images, Gorogoa explores the nature and intersection of spirituality, mythology, and history  all things that can be messy and personal and hard to confront, but handled here with an impressively wordless elegance. In Gorogoas world, the small and nondescript live adjacent to the grand and the magical; not in their shadow, but as part of the very fabric of their reality. Theres a rich splendour woven through even the most mundane of its images, elevating the ordinary into something mystical and wondrous, and grounding its divine mythos into a world startlingly familiar. Gorogoa crafts its inventive, sliding-tile puzzles and magical world with a graceful simplicity across a compact but fulfilling adventure. The excitement of solving each puzzle may be lost on a repeat playthrough, but its hand-drawn art and clever payoffs are no less satisfying to watch unfold again and again. Gorogoa manages to say so much without uttering a single word, endowing it with a mystery that invites a more attentive, thoughtful revisit  and one that I was more than happy to accept.", "date": "Jan. 31, 2018,"}
