As a straight update to the 2003 classic, its content remains the same. This means Rayman 3 HD delivers a kick-ass 3D platforming experience with some good-looking HD textures, but suffers the same control and camera problems that troubled the original. Start with the instruction manual. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc was the final entry in the ~classic~ Rayman saga before the series took a detour into the land of the Rabbids (outside of a Gameboy Advance title). The flow is reminiscent of Super Mario 64 and other early 3D platformers, but the darker tones and level design feels more like American McGee's Alice (without the blood). The comedic rants of Globox, Rayman, and the varied bosses are enjoyable, and the self-reflexive humor will keep you chuckling throughout. These key elements haven't been touched, and that's one of the main reasons Rayman 3 is still a really good game. Hoodlum Havoc's most enjoyable addition to the old Rayman formula is its power-ups. By grabbing what look like colorful tin cans, Rayman jumps into a variety of colorful costumes with accessories like propeller-blade helmets, tornado-slinging fists, chain-arm gloves, and more. These suits play into the clever puzzles dotting Rayman 3's nine different worlds. A costume timer amps up the difficulty of different puzzles, though it's unlikely anything will stump a modern gamer (Rayman 3 is notoriously easier than Rayman 2). The environments do have more polish. So what does the HD in the title deliver? A lot of textures get a newfound smoothness, but this additional definition also highlights flaws smoothed over by the original pixilation. Specifically, environmental elements like toothy-textures that originally mimicked a 3D effect in their shading now look like weird, flat -- yet climbable -- walls. Also, missile explosions and certain animations pop with blocky age. The old-school pixels also show up in text like the title screen and, more noticeably, the Game Over screen. The best upgrade in this version of Rayman 3 is the smooth frame rate. While some of the cutscenes represent days gone by (with all the choppiness of the era), Rayman's jump, hover, and attack animations are clean and current. All of his power-up costumes get the same treatment, but the HD sheen distorts the difference between orange and red canisters. It's a case of technology stepping on its own foot -- though they're easily discernible once grabbed. You'll find a whole lot of Rayman targets along the way. The biggest problems in Rayman 3 HD are the camera and controls. Over and over, the camera swoops in behind Rayman only to obscure the view with a wall, or fail to show a corner he can walk around. Odd collision detection causes enemies like the Knaaren and their force fields to create additional gameplay problems. When trying to pass these creatures (which you technically aren't supposed to -- you need to draw them to nearby distractions), Rayman can get stuck in a bouncing loop between their fields and level walls until he finally pops out one side or the other. It's a dizzying effect. Taking control of an early boss monster's stomping apparatus leads to an exceedingly frustrating struggle with the controls. On top of these issues, there are level glitches where Rayman will fall through the stage, or bounce into complete blackness while his score randomly skyrockets. The glitches are rare, but apparent. These were problems in 2003 and remain so in 2012. Some worlds are quite dark. While the dialog throughout the tale is genuinely funny and the characters likeable, Rayman 3 suffers from sound issues. Volume is extremely inconsistent, making it nearly impossible to discern certain lines without having subtitles switched on. But the main drive -- high scores -- is where the action feels best. Hitting the 100% mark on each level is extremely difficult. That's one of the old-school sensibilities Rayman 3 HD brings to the table. You most likely won't ace every (if any) level on your first attempt. Due to the timing of a scoring combo system, high scores are a tough undertaking, and in order to unlock a collection of mini-games you'll need to keep adding to your tally. The mini-games are a nice diversion, but lack the HD polish the rest of the package picked up. CLOSING COMMENTS Is Rayman 3 HD for you? It all comes down to what you want out of an HD re-release. The textures are cleaner, the animations smooth, and the humor remains, but gameplay is still rooted in 2003. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is still a good game and a lot of fun for 800 Microsoft Points, but dont expect a complete overhaul of a once great platformer.
