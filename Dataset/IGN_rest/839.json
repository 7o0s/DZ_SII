Its a nice summary of this episode, as Judgement continues the twists and turns at a healthy clip. The original Revelations spent a great deal of time over-explaining the semantics of its complicated relationships; Revelations 2 is thus far content to let us sit back and enjoy the mystery, as Moira and Claire get closer to the truth, and Barry and Natalia get closer to Moira. (Whether or not it can tie up these plot threads together in a satisfying way, however, remains to be seen.) Admirably, theres a real attempt to flesh out the characters here, too. While Barry Burtons voice actor is better suited to gruff quips than spilling his guts, he has a nice little moment with Natalia that gives him a little humanity and grows him beyond his master of unlocking legacy. Claire also gets to show an emotional side, and although both stutter through awkwardly written dialogue, I found their earnestness endearing. But it's the clever riddles and traps in Judgement's (unfortunately still bland) environments I enjoyed the most here, which made me wonder why they were absent in previous episodes. Keeping with Resident Evil tradition, many of these are outright silly (like the one that causes Moira to get a little meta), but some incorporate genuinely clever level design. During one section, for instance, Barry and Natalia must move a box from one end of a level to the next. Throughout this task, you must use both characters abilities to keep enemies at bay, while placing and standing on the box to reach high spots and open gates. Its a wonderful segment, and I wish more of Revelations 2s unexciting corridor environments could have been spiced up in a similar fashion. Such inconsistency in design seems to be the common theme in Revelations 2 on the whole. Of the two boss battles in Judgement, one is a tense and thrilling affair in which Claire must face an extremely agile creature who can latch onto her like a lizard-tongue from long distances, while the other is dull and cripplingly unimaginative: Barry fights a creature with a glowing red belly that shambles at you slowly until youve plugged enough bullets into him. To me, it felt like the designers ran out of ideas, put this cheap guy in as a placeholder, and never took him out. Pros Clever puzzlesCharacter developmentSmarter level design Cons Boring boss fightsDull environments Still, Judgement gallops along at a great pace, and ends once again on a very curious cliffhanger. Im properly invested in Revelations 2s pulpy, dime-novel story, which is a great thing to be able to say at the pointy end of the series; heres hoping the final episode delivers on its many promises.", "date": "March 10, 2015"}
