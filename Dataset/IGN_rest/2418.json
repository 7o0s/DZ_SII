This year we're trying something new: because Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's modes are so different, we're reviewing them separately, followed by our overall review and score. This part covers the entirety of Black Ops 4  be sure to check out the individual reviews next. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Zombies Review Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Multiplayer Review Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review The monumental highs of victory and crushing lows of narrowly losing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4s Blackout are experiences I've had in other battle royale games before, but the road to these memorable moments highlight a significant leap in gameplay fidelity and polish for the genre. Call of Dutys responsive and forgiving gunplay, nimble movement, and creative but practical equipment fit beautifully into the trendy last man standing format. Its not just a one-way street though, as the dynamic battle royale setting provides some much-needed variance and consequence to Call of Dutys at times superficial combat loop. I did experience and see others have some technical issues that warrant concern, but when its running smoothly, Blackout is nothing short of the most enjoyable battle royale Ive played to date. Blackout is nothing short of the most enjoyable battle royale I've played to date. Blackout gets straight to what I love most about battle royales: using what Ive found for an all or nothing skirmish with an equally desperate opponent with the least amount of noise in the way. I was immediately struck by the silky smooth transition between free falling, parachuting, and landing, and the fluidity doesnt stop there. Sliding, jumping, and mantling all blend seamlessly into one another, and this momentum remains unbroken even while performing other actions. You can heal while sprinting, shoot underwater, and fire your weapon while using other equipment. These intuitive touches capitalize on an area where battle royales as a genre still have room left to grow away from the clunky controls of their military simulation progenitors. I was initially concerned that being able to heal and move at the same time would lead to comically drawn out firefights, but in practice, I never experienced a single instance of an enemy being able to out-heal the damage I was able to inflict without finding cover first. The only place where I feel depth is sacrificed in order to facilitate accessibility is the woefully under-featured inventory. Only one weapon is displayed at a time and you shockingly cant drag or reorder items at all on PC. Id like to be able to reposition equipment for easy access, as well as smoothly drag attachments from one weapon to another instead of awkwardly dumping them all on the ground. You also cant open your inventory and then pick up items based on their proximity, which makes looting an enemys corpse and moving at the same time a bit clunky. There are a few nice touches, though, like the ability to pick up ammo without filling up valuable inventory space, but PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds is still miles ahead in this department. Captivating Cache Blackout does, however, absolutely nail the concept of interesting loot. Its arsenal is rich and varied and leaves plenty of room to develop a taste for unlikely personal favorites on your way to acquiring objectively powerful weapons like the Paladin. In addition to the appearance of every primary and secondary weapon found in multiplayer (with the exception of the combat knife), there are weapons from Zombies like the Ray Gun, MP40, and the GRAV. Gold-tinted guns like the Titan Operator are scattered across the map and come equipped with a full set of attachments. Then there are perks, which offer fun and useful temporarily buffs like the ability to move silently or hear the sound of far-off enemy footsteps. But the star of the show in Blackout as far as loot is concerned is equipment. Not only is each piece of equipment fun and practical but together they keep encounters with other players feeling fresh. The grapple gun, for instance, can be used to instantly gain a vertical advantage, escape from an otherwise hopeless situation, or even close the distance to pull off an unlikely revive. Landing a well-placed sensor dart in the final circle felt almost as good as firing the game-winning shot. And the inevitable late-game barrage of flashbangs and grenades you know and love from other battle royales can even be thwarted with a well placed trophy system straight out of Jagers kit in Rainbow Six Siege. The result of this cornucopia of loot is a map littered with appealing variables that each offer unique gameplay opportunities. The result of Blackout's cornucopia of loot is a map littered with appealing variables that each offer unique gameplay opportunities. The map itself is a sort of greatest hits of the Black Ops series. Original elements are cleverly combined with iconic locales like Nuketown, Array, and Turbine that lend an unprecedented level of design fidelity to the maps overall offerings. Though it didnt always happen, I absolutely loved it when the final circle closed onto one of these locations as it effectively turned that particular match into a sudden death bout on a tried-and-true Black Ops map. In addition to conventional Call of Duty maps, locations like Verrckt and Diner from Zombies are peppered across the landscape. These spots and a few others can spawn zombies randomly, and their presence is designated with a pale blue column of light. If you kill all the zombies, youll score a mystery box! The risk and reward dynamic of going loud for some extra loot is a fun one, and since the zombies are relegated to a handful of locations, they dont get in the way of the core experience when theyre unwanted. Spray and Pray Black Ops 4s gunplay  and not some other mechanic  takes center stage in its battle royale experience. The responsive and forgiving hitscan feeling thats synonymous with the series is intact at close ranges, in spite of Blackout using a projectile-based damage calculation system complete with bullet drop and travel time. As a result, landing a distant headshot with a sniper rifle is remarkably satisfying. Though the recoil is supposedly predictable, I couldnt discern any consistent pattern on weapons like the Rampart 17, Spitfire, or Titan -- overall, I feel the recoil is more random (albeit much less pronounced) than it is in PUBG. Time to kill on PC varies from instantaneous to the outer limits of reasonable based on a number of different factors, but for the most part feels functional. The increase in effective HP conferred by the famously durable level three armor proved to be a non-issue in my experience, mostly because Blackout offers both the details needed to inform my strategy, and the tools necessary to execute it. Unlike Fortnites shields, armor is visually and audibly readable before a fight begins. And as such, I usually had no problem figuring out how to overcome this advantage with the equipment and weapons I had on me. The puzzle of adapting to change and succeeding in spite of a disadvantage is the essence of why I enjoy battle royales so much. I do, however, take issue with the fact that an enemys armor is almost always destroyed in the process of killing them. I had no problem restocking my ammo, healing items, and equipment reserves while looting a slain foe, but if I wanted armor Id have to look elsewhere. And in order to realistically keep that armor until the later stages of a match, Id have to avoid a fight. If defeated enemies instead dropped whatever armor they had on at 50% durability this wouldnt be an issue. But in its current state, I feel like being punished for partaking in my favorite part of Blackout: the combat. Time to kill on PC varies from instantaneous to the outer limits of reasonable based on a number of different factors, but for the most part feels functional. Random loot spawns are a core pillar of battle royales, and in this department, I feel that Blackout distributes do or die early-game weapons in a fair and forgiving manner with one glaring exception. The models of weapons and ammo dont render until youre on the ground, and are therefore not visible during the initial freefall, even at max settings. This makes landing in a hotly contested area much more of a dice roll than it should be, even if you land first. Id prefer the ability to steer my parachute towards what looks like the outline of a gun mid-flight. Duos and quads offered some of the most memorable moments I experienced in Blackout, but also presented the most technical issues. Getting all of my friends into the same lobby on PC proved to be a consistent struggle. The invite features would frequently either disappear after being accepted, or present the receiver with a lobby not joinable or NAT type issue error. Grouping up to a full squad of four often devolved into a round robin of who's lobby can everyone join without an error? These problems can be solved by port forwarding, which isnt too difficult to do, but its worth noting that this is an unexpectedly involved fix for a game as big as Call of Duty in 2018. The connectivity issues can persist into a match, too. A few of my squadmates suffered disconnects or crashes almost every game until they were resolved by a fair deal of troubleshooting. Some PC players have reported crashes in Black Ops 4 caused by equipping a certain weapon skin, skipping the intro cutscenes, or by conflicts with Microsoft services, older graphics drivers, and antivirus software. I personally experienced a recurring crash on startup that was resolved by scanning and repairing Black Ops 4s file. From what I can gather, neither the severity or breadth of these issues are that out of the ordinary, but for the Blackout mode specifically, any amount of instability is a big deal in the absence of reconnect functionality. The inability to rejoin a match already in progress is a sorely missed feature from PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds.If my squadmates disconnected, it meant that the entire squad could either forfeit the match instead of leaving our teammate behind or, if the match had gone on long enough, the odd man out was relegated to the lobby until we had finished. But when no one disconnected, quads and duos were remarkably fun. Here, Blackout's vehicles proved to be an unexpected treat. For a series not known for its vehicles, I was absolutely stunned that the flatbed truck and helicopter offered such a smooth ride-along experience. With a friend driving, you're free to move, jump, and shoot in the bed of the truck without the usual hitching or desynchronous experience that this might cause in many other games. Similarly, the helicopter can be a massively fun change of pace if can you manage to keep it in the air for any significant amount of time. In addition to the substantial thrill of winning, Blackout boasts additional rewarding Easter egg-like challenges in the form of fun and frantic character missions. Unlocking Crash, for instance, involves finishing a match with 15 healing items in your inventory, in addition to finding the mission to begin with. Recons mission, on the other hand, forbids you from taking any damage from the collapsing circle. I absolutely love these challenges as they threw an extra layer of complexity on the already daunting prospect of winning a match. Furthermore, sporting these skins tells the story of their acquisition to those around you, and that story is something other than I paid for this. Though victory is not a prerequisite for most, unlocking a character and winning in the same match felt incredibly good. In lieu of significant innovation, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4s Blackout instead presents a remarkably polished and intuitive take on the basic battle royale formula with a first-person shooter focus. Everything, from the creative perks and equipment to the familiar Call of Duty locations, works remarkably well in the dynamic battle royale space; and some elements like the arcade shooting are even enhanced as a result of it. The plethora of technical issues ranging from simple fixes to more involved workarounds on PC are concerning, but ultimately didnt stop me or my friends from playing and having a great time. I thoroughly look forward to playing Blackout for months to come, and hope that Call of Dutys annualized release cadence doesnt interfere with the frequency and longevity of post-launch support that I expect of the genre.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2018,"}
