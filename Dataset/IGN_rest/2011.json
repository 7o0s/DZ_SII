The Isle of Armor, the Expansion Passs first of two bundled DLC additions, provides an entertaining reason to revisit the Galar region with over 100 returning Pokemon (plus a few new ones) and an enjoyable new Wild Area. But this island getaway is otherwise pretty bare bones and disappointingly brief. Like the free-roaming Wild Area in the main Sword and Shield campaign, The Isle of Armors is complete with an excess of untamed Pokmon wandering around, dozens of dens for Max Raid Battles, and plenty of items to find and collect. Without the usual Gym structure (or even linear Routes), this DLCs main quest line instead has you running missions throughout its open space  its much more freeform than the usual Pokmon experience, which feels like a natural and not unwelcome progression after the first Wild Area showed how well an open world Pokmon could potentially work, even if the story here is too fleeting to really savor it. What We Said About the Base Game From our November 2019 Pokemon Sword and Shield review by Casey DeFreitas: ~Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything thats come before. Id still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures. And hey, if Im missing any tedious repetition, I can always get back into breeding.~ Score: 9.3 While it may not be as big as the original Wild Area in overall acreage, The Isle of Armor more than makes up for it in its diversity and in how well it uses the space. Youll find tangled forests filled with Tangela and oceans where Sharpedos pursue you with frightening speed. Even if it can all be seen in a few short hours, its undoubtedly an entertaining trek that does a great job of making the world feel alive and more fleshed out than the Wild Area from the base game. The new Wild Area makes up for its size with impressive diversity. The Isle of Armor unfortunately doesnt mark the return of the complete National Pokdex, but it does significantly expand the Pokmon available in Sword and Shield with more than 100 returning pocket monsters. Its a great selection, including some sorely needed additions like Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and most of all: Lickilicky, which is obviously the best Pokmon ever conceived. Quick Ball Unfortunately, Isle of Armor doesnt use its new, lovingly crafted area very effectively, as the DLCs campaign amounts to just a few short missions that can be finished in a couple hours, most of which are uninspired fetch quests. Youll run around looking for mushrooms and fighting off Slowpoke on a decidedly low stakes adventure that feels like a fairly by-the-numbers RPG side quest. There are certainly some highlights, like the part where you need to befriend and level up the brand new and pretty darn lovable Kubfu to unlock one of its two legendary evolutions. But it all feels very shallow with no real narrative holding it together, and Pokemon in the wild almost universally capping out at level 60 means anyone who has beaten the base game will be able to breeze through the whole thing like I did. It also doesnt help that one of the DLCs chief characters, your new rivals (Klara for Sword players, and Avery for Shield), are both incredibly annoying and written off largely as a punchline rather than anything resembling a real threat. The other two major characters, a dojo master named Mustard, and his wife Honey, are amusing, but dont get enough time in the spotlight to really shine. That said, Isle of Armor introduces a few new mechanics that do a lot to break the mold of Sword and Shield in positive ways. A welcome item called Max Soup allows you to Gigantimax your Pokmon even if they werent caught in a Max Raid Battle. A surprising new base-building mechanic lets you upgrade Mustards dojo by spending Watts, unlocking helpful new services and items. And of course, there are plenty of cool new cosmetics, like clothes and bicycle skins. There isn't a ton to do once the short campaign is over. Sadly, there isnt a ton left to do once the campaign is over, aside from catching the islands plentiful returning Pokmon  though youll now be able to do that with the Pokmon of your choice following you around the DLC areas, which is a nice cosmetic reward earned by progressing through the story. One of the main draws is Restricted Sparring, a challenging endgame mode that pits three of your Pokmon of the same type against five opposing trainers in a row (and then an endless onslaught of them after that)  its a creative new format, but is only appealing if youre looking to earn BP for the Battle Tower. Theres also a boring side quest where you run around looking for 151 Digletts buried in the ground thats nightmarishly tedious, and hardly worth the various Alolan versions of Pokmon you get as a reward. Not Sold Separately The Isle of Armor DLC is the first part of the Pokmon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass, which will eventually include two expansions  The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra (coming sometime later this year). Crucially, The Isle of Armor is not sold separately from the Expansion Pass, so this DLC is only one part of a bigger whole. Well be reviewing The Crown Tundra when it releases, but this review is only evaluating The Isle of Armor since thats currently all the Expansion Pass will get you. The Isle of Armor is a solid first attempt at DLC in a Pokmon game, even if its too short-lived to offer anything that feels like a truly substantial addition beyond the location itself. While the new Wild Area is beautifully crafted and the exciting selection of returning Pokemon are fun to catch, the shallow campaign feels like a waste of their full potential.", "date": "June 24, 2020,"}
