However, the inclusion of vehicular zombie-slaughter with a modifiable car manages to fit nicely alongside a ton of missions and an excellent mysterious story that comes together to form a well-oiled machine. Above: Watch the first 16 minutes of The Following gameplay. The Following quickly introduces you to your new best friend/car/weapon shortly after Kyle Crane, the hero of Harran, arrives in the expansive new area known as The Farmland. This scenic location boasts a greater surface area than Harran  as you'd expect for map that accommodates a much higher-speed mode of transportation  and has swapped out the densely populated slums and buildings for open fields, gorgeous coastal cliffs, and stretches of back roads. It's just begging for you to burn some rubber. The Lost Coast The Following usually makes it so easy to summon your car to your location, it rarely felt like a bad thing. The Farmlands teem with zombie ~life,~ but it feels different because here youll find it much tougher to give pursuing zombies the slip. When the nearest building is a mile away, there's nothing to break line-of-sight with pursuers, so out here getting spotted at night without a getaway car is an almost certain death sentence. However, because The Following usually makes it so easy to summon your car to your location, it rarely felt like a bad thing. The exception is when I died and respawned in a hunting tower nowhere near my car or a safe house to recall it. Above: Watch the Dying Light: The Following Exploration Trailer. Its due to this spread-out and hazardous environment that the buggy's versatility really shines. While its rarely outright required for taking on any of the main story missions or the large amount of side quests, I never wanted to be far from it. Like your trusty but breakable weapons, the buggy is made up of several craftable and lootable parts that will break down over time in day-to-day zombie-killing use. Drive over anything other than a well-paved road, for instance, and your suspension and tires will slowly get worn out. Keeping the car in good working order breathes new life into Dying Lights already expansive scavenging game, as cars littering the freeway - once only good for a quick glance in the truck - are now a potential gold mine for salvaging engines and siphoning fuel. Drive Harder As you level up your driver rank, youll gain access crafting better parts, install new reinforced cage parts to show off collectible paint jobs, and even turn your ride into a zombie-killing machine with ram bars, flamethrowers, and mine dispensers. Cooperative play capitalizes on this with the ability to climb in the back of another player's ride to pick off incoming viral zombies with ranged weapons like the new crossbow, which is ideal for quickly picking off bandits and zombies alike with satisfying headshots. Or, you can competitively race with up to three other players. Above: Watch the Bounties trailer. The real meat of this expansion comes from The Followings array of quality quests that follow Kyle Crane seeking gain the trust of the locals to get close to a creepy cult. The concept of forcing you to do side quests in order to progress with the story could have easily gone South (as it has in many other games that seek to pad out their stories), and here it had trouble hooking me at the start. But happily, the sheer amount of things you can do won me over by never feeling like a chore - even when youre literally raiding the post office to deliver forgotten letters. It sounds mundane, but it's not. Other quests, like diving through a claustrophobic underwater cave or going on a treasure hunt for antique revolvers, not only showcase Dying Lights diverse missions, but give you ample opportunities to flex your free-running parkour skills in between driving the countryside, recalling what made Dying Light such a memorable zombie game in the first place. Finally, while the main story revs up too slowly, the DLCs finale came with a jaw-dropping twist I honestly did not see coming - and more than made up for the base games lackluster ending.
