We won't be reviewing every week, but we'll check in at the end of the season to see how the show has progressed. Taking cues from the sexy and supernatural Riverdale and its Netflix cousin Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, The CWs Nancy Drew (Kennedy McMann) is not the Nancy Drew you grew up with. More mature and spooky than its source material, the show centers on a Nancy whos past the age of being the lovable, sleuthing wunderkind were familiar with. Now shes an off-track young adult, who finds herself embroiled in a murder that may or may not involve a prom queen ghost. We first meet Nancy at the bottom of a downward spiral. Originally on the fast track to Columbia University, her entire life was derailed when her mother died suddenly of pancreatic cancer. Now college is a distant dream, and Nancy works unhappily as a waitress at The Claw, the local diner in her sleepy town of Horseshoe Bay, Maine. Disconnected from her friends and father, Nancys only real relationship is with the ex-con mechanic Ned ~Nick~ Nickerson (Tunji Kasim), who longs for more intimacy than Nancy is willing to give. All things considered, Nancy just wants to be left alone, and she emphatically doesnt solve crimes anymore since it reminds her too much of a time when her mom was alive. Just like Archie and Sabrina though, trouble has a way of finding Nancy. A socialite is murdered right in front of The Claw, and Nancy is the last one to see her alive. Suddenly she and The Claws ragtag crew of workers are all suspects, forcing them into an uneasy sort of camaraderie. Were not friends, Nancy tells the cops when they come to investigate the murder, which means inevitably of course that they will all become fast friends. This all feels very Riverdale and CAoS, but that doesnt necessarily mean its badly done. Nancy Drew just hits familiar, well-worn beats, from the foggy, otherworldly town all the way down to having a group of teens who each have a distinct style and color palette associated with them. Grouchy and cold Nancy is often in blue. George (Leah Lewis), the towns resident bad girl, has a green dress that shows off her tattoos. Bess (Maddison Jaizani), the bourgeoisie character, has a frilly yellow outfit. The stoner Ace (Alex Saxon) meanwhile sports red. All of them act as suitable foils to Nancy, who surprisingly (and disappointingly) feels the most like a blank slate compared to the rest of them. Its the chemistry between Nancy, George, and Bess that holds the most allure in the pilot episode. Bess is convinced that the ghost Dead Lucy had a hand in the murder, while descended-from-seafarers George proves integral to figuring out the nautical mysteries of Horseshoe Bay and how that may all play into the case. Though Nancy Drew made a name for herself as a young solo detective, as an adult she begrudgingly admits that she needs a little help. This only works to the pilots benefit, as both George and Bess are easily the standout characters of the episode. Whats less compelling is Nancys steamy relationship with Nick, which bookends the episode but feels rather boilerplate: good girl prodigy falls for a bad boy, who of course the father disapproves of. While focusing on an illicit romance is typical of the frothy CW, the relationship lacks any genuine spark, or bite. The supernatural aspects meanwhile work surprisingly well, and there are a few genuine jump scares to be had in the episode. Though there were often supernatural elements in the novels, just like Scooby-Doo there was always a rational explanation. Here Dead Lucy seems to actually be real, and its hinted that seeing whispers of Lucy is what compelled a young Nancy to become interested in crime-solving to begin with. While the romance drags, the ragtag crime-solving trio of Nancy, Bess, and George provides a fun and alluring hook for the series. Dead Lucy adds just the right amount of CW-level scares, making Nancy Drew a strong contender for the new fall horror series to keep an eye on.", "date": "Oct. 10, 2019,"}
