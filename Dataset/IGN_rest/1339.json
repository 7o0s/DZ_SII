Unless youre playing on the hardest mode, bullet-drop indicators and omniscient AI teammates make sure you know exactly who to shoot and when, taking almost all the tension out of pulling the trigger. Ghost Warrior 2 ultimately does exactly what I feared the most when I started: it takes one of the highest forms of shooting skill and makes it repetitive and uninteresting. Almost every level in Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2s brief four-or-so-hour campaign boils down to the same thing. You arrive on one of these pretty, CryEngine 3-rendered jungle scenes either alone or with a partner, and then move from position to position, killing everyone as quietly as possible. If you screw up, enemies will rush you with reckless abandon and youll probably die, so if youre playing on Easy or Normal, youd best kill people in the explicit order youre told to. Not that thats particularly difficult, since you seem to always know exactly where enemies are at all times. Youll need to do sniper-y things, like hold your breath to slow down time (pretty sure snipers can't actually do that, but it represents concentration), or manage your stance to reduce the sway of your barrel, but all in all every stage starts to feel like a series of target shoots with little variation in terms of goals or setting. Especially so during the canned portions where you set up a rifle and cant move until youve hit the targets youre ordered to kill. Shooting in Ghost Warrior 2 becomes less an art and more of a mundane task. Playing on the hardest difficulty helps a little. Here you don't have big marks over every person's head, so you have to actually hunt for targets. You also dont have the bullet-drop indicators, meaning that you have to pay attention to the wind and distance to your target, adjusting your aim accordingly. The stripping of these features make some shots a bit more tense, since it really does take time to learn the feel of the weapon, and you might have missed a potential target during your initial scouting. You cant just do a bit of math (well, mere mortals can't) and figure out exactly where to aim for shots in this mode, you just have to understand how wind speeds and distance will affect your bullet drop. There's a lot of shooting, missing, and then readjusting your aim  trial and error. Thats often not a problem, because in situations where missing a shot might cause a game-over state, Ghost Warrior 2 generally dumbs down the AI enough to give you plenty of time to fire again and score a kill. The enemies might react, but theyll do so so slowly (not to mention no others seem to hear the percussive bang of your giant, unsilenced rifle) that you have ample time to pick them off. It's a blessing because it helps you get through the story faster, but a curse in that it breaks the illusion that these are human beings with, you know, a desire to live. Very occasional moments in the campaign try to mix things up, but they feel so trite that they did little more than induce heavy sighs. For instance, at one point in Ghost Warrior 2s story you lose your rifle and have to retrieve it, sneaking around enemies or killing them quietly with a knife or your pistol. The problem is that after you kill the first enemy you cant just pick up his weapon. Instead, you're forced to play exactly how the designers intended, obvious course of action be damned. Like a good little soldier, youre playing by someone elses rules. It's made all the more clear how bad an idea that is when contrasted with the best parts of the campaign: when youre given an area to clear out or get past, and the freedom to do it however you want. You could alert the enemy troops and deal with them head-on, shoot an enemy grenade to blow them up, or just snipe them quietly. Heck, sometimes you can even just sneak past them altogether. Those parts make me feel more like a thinking, elite soldier, but they alone arent enough to add more than a bit of flavoring to largely one-note level design. And remember: even if the entire game had this freeform design, it'd still only be four hours long. Ghost Warrior 2s multiplayer doesnt exactly add a lot of diversity to the experience, either. True, lying completely still watching the area in front of you for movement or the glare off another snipers scope, or waiting for the sound of a rifle, does create a few moments of high tension. More often, though, it means I'm sitting around for minutes at a time, never seeing anyone or anything, except maybe one of the flickering shadows or other annoying minor glitches that cropped up as I played (on two different PCs). Whole rounds often pass where Ive fired maybe two shots, and I died many times without ever having a chance to retaliate. The campers among you may find it entertaining, but outside of the very rare intense sniper battle, it quickly became tiresome  especially considering there are only two maps at the time of this review. THE VERDICT Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 isnt bereft of good ideas or mechanics, its just that theyre all trapped in a short series of levels that rarely give you anything all that interesting to do with them. Combine that with some graphical glitches and the slow and ultimately forgettable multiplayer, and you have a mediocre game that all but the hardest of the hardcore sniper-wannabes should pass on.", "date": "March 21, 2013"}
