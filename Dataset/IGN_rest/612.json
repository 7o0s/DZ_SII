To prattle on further about how it cleverly messes with your own video game expectations or how it dissects the choices games often give us would only belabor long-since made points (not to mention risk my own words showing up in the inevitable 2031 re-rerelease). But then again, there I go doing exactly that, because despite those points having already been well made both about and by The Stanley Parable, they still ring as true as ever  and Ultra Deluxes new content proves it has plenty more worth saying, at a scale that goes far beyond a simple remaster.Before we get too deep, a quick spoiler warning: The Stanley Parable is a hard game to talk about because so much of its charm and delight comes from discovering its surprises for yourself. I am going to do my best not to ruin that experience while I tell you why its one worth having, but I will be talking about some of what already made the base game stand out, as well as the general scope and structure of how Ultra Deluxe builds upon it. So while Ill avoid ruining the specifics of any jokes or endings, my real recommendation is that you should stop reading here, play it totally fresh, and then come back and see how your own thoughts compare to mine. But if you need a little more to go on before making that leap, read on.What We Said About The Stanley Parable~Sometimes The Stanley Parable feels like an exploration of the peculiar madness of boredom. Other times its something else entirely: a joke at the players expense, a commentary on choice and consequence, a parody, a bureaucratic nightmare. All its different plotlines and personalities overlap and combine to create something thats intriguingly opaque, but always entertaining, and genuinely funny. Whatever it is, its worth playing.~ - Keza MacDonald, October 18, 2013Score: 8.8Read the full The Stanley Parable review.The Stanley Parable is a surreal adventure game at its heart. You play Stanley, wandering the halls of his office as a narrator (brilliantly voiced by Kevan Brighting) instructs you on where to go. Of course, the now thoroughly interrogated gag here is that you dont have to listen to him at all. The office is a labyrinth of paths to choose from or stumble upon, each choice sending you further down its branching tree of hilarious stories and toward one of its countless endings. Every journey is full of jokes that had me genuinely laughing out loud (even years after the first time I saw them) framed within a constantly winking satire of the way games are traditionally supposed to behave  be that mundane things like getting to ignore the correct path, or more elaborate examples like a reset not always setting the metaphorical sliders back to zero. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe may bill itself as a long-awaited console port with some nicely improved lighting and a bit of new content, but that last part is, shall we say, severely understated. When you first start it up, Ultra Deluxe asks if youve played the original before, and developer Crows Crows Crows stressed to me that its important to answer this question honestly. Ultra Deluxe contains the entirety of The Stanley Parable, and if you havent played that then its one of the easiest recommendations Ill ever make  but if you have, this rerelease offers far more than a literal trip into The Memory Zone. Ultra Deluxe's new content feels comparable to the original in size and scope.Given how many secret paths and hidden endings The Stanley Parable contains, its hard to tell exactly how big the new content in Ultra Deluxe really is, but I feel confident saying its comparable to the original with four to six hours of stuff to see at the very least. There is essentially an entirely new game to play through here, and the idea that its being presented as anything less is probably one of its best gags. Some of Ultra Deluxes content takes place in brand-new areas that pretty much feel like a straight up sequel, while other additions play out as remixed or altered versions of Stanleys usual paths through the office. (I dont know for sure, but I assume the question about whether youve played before determines how early this new content will pop up, as things start off entirely unassuming.)While The Stanley Parable pokes fun at games as a whole, it seems only right that Ultra Deluxe shifts its gaze toward the concept of sequels, expansions, and DLC  as well as some pointed self reflection about both the original game and its wider reception. I dont want to get into the specifics, but the new writing is no less clever, insightful, or funny than the old, and the way it all meshes together is a pretty brilliant take on an extremely difficult task. Framing everything this way, as new content for an existing game rather than the standalone thing it likely could have been if Crows Crows Crows really wanted to, allows Ultra Deluxe to make many points about the relationship between modern games and their updates more effectively, which was a real treat.At the same time, Ultra Deluxes new stuff didnt always land quite as well for me. Its all extremely entertaining, but one of the drawbacks of housing this pseudo-sequel within the original is the feeling that weve seen many of these magic tricks before. Its not that they dont hold up or arent still impressive, and its not that there arent plenty of new ones which delighted me all their own  but even if the well hasnt run dry, its hard to shake the feeling that we are ultimately revisiting it (something Ultra Deluxe even enjoyably teases itself for). Because of that, some of the new and remixed paths alike initially felt like slightly more passive experiences than the base games  but upon reflection Im not sure if thats actually true or if their impact was just blunted slightly by the fact that I better knew what to expect nine years later. The Stanley Parables base game truly holds up almost a decade later, both in its hilarious narrated writing and the clever satire that houses it. Ultra Deluxe may seem like little more than a decent lighting improvement and a simple console port on the surface, but the new content thats been added alongside those things is on the scale of a whole new game. Those new encounters are consistently impressive and always entertaining, even if the feeling that weve seen some of these tricks before means they never quite reached the heights of my first surprising playthrough back in 2013. But if youve never played The Stanley Parable at all, Ultra Deluxe is a definitive version that provides another extremely convincing reason to do so.", "date": "April 27, 2022"}
