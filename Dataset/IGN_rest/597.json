Although a fetch quest in well-trodden territory is a low point, The Temple of the Witch stands out from the main campaign by virtue of this unexpected psychedelia. Laras hunt for a witch whod allegedly terrorized locals for years is a welcome change from Rise of the Tomb Raiders more grounded threats. In one sequence, Lara must follow her father through a haunted forest, pursued by demonic dogs and leery skeletons. While genuinely spooky, it also serves to illustrate Laras complex relationship with her dad, one of the most interesting themes in Rise of the Tomb Raiders main campaign. This sense of escalating insanity culminates in a great boss battle that takes place entirely on this otherworldly plane. Multi-tiered and increasingly frantic, this battle is a fitting end to The Temple of the Witch, and offers a satisfying resolution to its mysteries. Outside of its dark wrapper, though, its business as usual here. Lara solves puzzles, fetches things, and shoots bad guys. Overall, this isnt a bad thing - in fact, one of its puzzles is the most enjoyably tricky Ive yet encountered in this resurrected series - but all that time spent gathering resources in Rise of the Tomb Raiders overly familiar Soviet Installation felt like a wasted opportunity. After all, The Temple of the Witch's Wicked Vale is an entirely new region, so its difficult to comprehend the justification behind returning to such well-worn territory when I couldve been there instead. Once your main mission is over  which took me around 2 hours  there are a handful of distractions in The Temple of the Witch to make your return to Rise of the Tomb Raider more worthwhile. A new Dreamstinger bow enables you to equip poison arrows that cause hallucinations, and document and survival cache challenges are there for completionists. I was left yearning, however, for new challenge tombs - the absence of one made the post-boss-battle Wicked Vale feel curiously empty. Pros Supernatural elementsGreat boss battle Cons Dull fetch questNo challenge tomb Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch is a brief, but mostly entertaining chapter in Rise of the Tomb Raiders lore. While I would have happily swapped the return to the Soviet Installation for a new challenge tomb, its supernatural elements added a noticeably different feel and a welcome sense of tension to Laras new adventure.", "date": "Jan. 28, 2016,"}
