In the lead-up to the launch of Pokmon Scarlet and Violet, I thought this claim would end up being a marketing gimmick, a little joke, something wed all be mad about later. But from the moment I left the hallowed halls of Uva Academy, that promise has been wonderfully fulfilled, with open-world, open-ended gameplay serving as a shining beacon for the future of this beloved franchise. And yet, a finger on the cursed Mankeys paw has curled anyway  Scarlet and Violets wonderfully innovative design is dramatically undermined by the numerous ways in which they feel deeply unfinished, with issues ranging from an incomplete world to massive and ubiquitous technical problems. So even though I want to celebrate how this generation reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pokmon, I cant without putting a great big warning label on it.The actual act of playing Pokmon Scarlet and Violet is some of the most fun Pokmon has ever been, thanks to Game Freaks commitment to a truly open world. From the second you leave the school after the tutorial, you can run all the way to late-game areas full of powerful trainers and Gym Leaders, catch high-level Pokmon, and make the adventure very difficult and rewarding for yourself accordingly. For anyone worried about accidentally leaping into a too-difficult area, fear not: Paldea is largely arranged to be friendly to those looking for a more gradual challenge, and even moreso is designed just right for getting pleasantly lost, backtracking, and wandering off the beaten route. Given that theres no level scaling at play (as is Pokmon tradition), exploring Paldea at a steady but unguided pace will somewhat inevitably have you encountering foes that are either extra challenging or too easy at different points. Running up against a trainer whos just a few levels higher than you can be a blast, especially when an unexpected Pokmon on your team comes in clutch to get the win and earn a giant pile of EXP. I had multiple tense moments against Team Star especially, like when their giant car Pokmon nearly decimated my slightly underleveled team as I pushed down a more challenging road.Their giant car Pokmon nearly decimated my team.But even when I briefly ran roughshod over several areas in a row because Id outleveled them, I didnt find it dull. With roughly 400 different Pokmon species available, I was still enjoying poking around the lower-level areas and finding monsters I hadnt seen yet, and those discoveries were rewarding even when the battles werent. Its a process made especially delightful by how silly and clever many of the new Pokmon designs are this generation, like the apparently edible Lechonk, or the absurd not-actually-Diglett eel Wiglett. The monster behavior is much improved too, as I loved stumbling upon flocks of Starly, Magikarp flopping on the shoreline, Hoppip floating nervously out of the rain, or herds of Deerling protected by a kingly Sawsbuck. With so many monsters to see, it was wonderfully easy to get lost and distracted in the enormous areas  Scarlet and Violets replacement for routes.What We Said About Pokmon Legends: ArceusI am left feeling torn about Pokmon Legends: Arceus. On the one hand, its revamped systems are utterly revolutionary to the franchise. It sheds both stale battle mechanics and an outdated progression system that sorely needed a shake-up, and the new replacements are incredibly fun even after hours of repetition. But while Legends: Arceus is the closest Pokmon has ever been to reflecting the monster catching and battling as I always imagined them in my head as a child, its otherwise exciting attempt at a genre-shift is set in a disappointingly empty, ugly, and at times tedious world. While I'm thrilled by this new gameplay direction, I wish the same care and attention was put into every aspect of the adventure. Pokmon Legends: Arceus is the best its ever felt to catch and collect Pokmon, but that level of ambition and brilliance deserved a better house to live in.  Rebekah Valentine, January 27, 2022Score: 7Read the full Pokmon Legends: Arceus reviewMoving across the grassy plains and rocky deserts of the land of Paldea is made easier thanks to a legendary Pokmon you obtain right at the start thats determined by whether you are playing Scarlet or Violet. Either way, this Pokmon can be used as a bike and is upgraded with new movement options through one of the three main storylines. The dash, climb, and swimming upgrades are all helpful for crossing big Paldean expanses quickly, but one of those upgrades is a glide ability that cant hold a candle to the one we got earlier this year in Legends: Arceus. Its better than nothing, but Im disappointed by the way you almost immediately lose altitude when gliding, dashing my dream of jumping from atop the highest mountain and soaring across the whole map.Biking across all that land, especially as I closed in on the endgame, also made Paldea feel strikingly empty. Scarlet and Violet are at least an improvement over Legends: Arceus in this regard, mostly thanks to their robust Pokmon variety, tons of hidden items, and the general design and placement of rare Pokmon and secrets. But there still isnt the same level of detail weve seen in other open-world Switch games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and no sign of anything resembling the dungeons, puzzles, or other more contained challenges that were staples of older Pokmon games, either. There still isn't the same level of detail we've seen in other open-world Switch games.The realization that almost the entirety of Scarlet and Violet are their interconnected outdoor zone is even more pronounced when you look closely at the detail that is there. Towns are all unique, colorful, and full of personality. Each one has distinct buildings and landmarks, like Artazons windmill or Porto Marinadas fishing docks, and theres clearly been a lot of thought put into modeling them after diverse and specific locations in and around real-world Spain. But for the most part, thats where the thoughtfulness ends. Most buildings are facades you cant enter, with nothing to do around them. Most stores are just menus you open when you interact with the door, and the biggest cities have the same storefronts repeated over and over. To give an example, in one city I was excited to run into what was clearly a warehouse for in-game store chain Delibird Presents  it looked like a warehouse, had the logo, and everything. I expected Id be able to go inside, and that there might be workers, a sidequest, vendors, or something unique in there. But it was just an unopenable box. Someone put enough thought into the world to imagine this company would have a headquarters in the town I was in, but the idea went no further.Hopes and Pokmon DreamsScarlet and Violets story and adventurous heart is well-supported by a fantastic score that clearly bears much of the influence of Undertales Toby Fox, who entered Game Freaks composer roster with one tune in Sword and Shield and joined the team in full for Scarlet and Violet alongside longtime composer Junichi Masuda and several others. While its not clear from simply playing it which pieces he actually worked on, fans of Foxs prior work will probably recognize his touch across the soundtrack, especially in the very Hopes and Dreams vibes of the Tera battle theme.Most notably, though, Fox loves his motifs. And that love is prevalent in the ways Scarlet and Violets jubilant and memorable field theme, which he wrote, is woven into the various overworld tracks of Paldea, as well as multiple excellent battle themes. Its the first time in years a new Pokmon melody has gotten stuck in my head. I keep humming it! Its great!That blankness unfortunately extends to many of the NPCs scattered around the world, too. Older Pokmon games are dotted with characters who would engage in short conversations with you about gameplay tips, Pokmon, world lore, or just goofy one-liners that gave them personality. I wouldnt say that element is absent from Scarlet and Violet, but its certainly lessened, almost like someone ran out of time to write interesting dialogue for all these people walking laps around their towns. A lot of the trainer and bystander NPC dialogue is roughly on the level of I like Pokmon!, while the more in-depth explanations of the world are relegated to classes you can take at the school. Dont get me wrong: I love the classes and the ways in which they manage build Scarlet and Violets lore while also tutorializing things about Pokmon even I didnt know after decades engrossed in the series. But its strange that the NPC department has suffered so much when the writing in the central storylines is otherwise stellar, especially given that the main cast of characters are some of the most interesting Pokmons had in a while.While previous games have essentially followed one plotline with a few momentary distractions, Scarlet and Violets three main stories  one about the usual Pokmon Gym challenge, one about a bunch of student delinquents, and one about five powerful Titan Pokmon  are an idea Game Freak has successfully made the most of. By giving each story its own separate threads and main characters rather than blending them all together, some truly excellent personalities are able to shine. I dont think Ive ever loved a Gym Leader as much as Ive loved the everyman Normal-type leader Larry, and the Path of the Titans plot had me a little choked up when I learned about my classmate Arvens true goals. Sure, its still a kids game  dont expect Nier: Automata levels of depth here  but theres a lot of humor, cleverness, and heart contained in Scarlet and Violets writing, and it all culminates in a bombastic ending that goes surprisingly hard for a Pokmon game. All told, it took me about 35 hours to reach the credits, and Ive played through the hearty endgame PvE content for an additional 15 since then, without having quite finished every sidequest and found every secret. The main outfit you're going to wear for the next 50 hours is aggressively purple.Alongside their open world, Scarlet and Violet come with a number of new and returning features to supplement their exploration. Character customization is back, and while the initial character facial design is much more detailed than in the past (except for skin tone, were still limited to only four options for some reason), the clothing customization is just sad. Both Sword/Shield and Arceus have tons of cute outfits to select from, but in Scarlet and Violet youre stuck with four ugly school uniforms, and thats all you get forever. You can customize hats, backpacks, shoes, socks, gloves, and glasses, but when the main outfit youre going to wear for the next 50 hours is aggressively purple, those little accessories dont feel much like real options. What am I going to do with a green hat, for instance? Id look like a grape!Another supporting feature thats returning with significant modifications is the ability for Pokmon to follow you out in the world. This time, you can also send them out in Lets Go! mode to automatically battle wild Pokmon they encounter, earning you EXP and items accordingly. Its a touch clunky in terms of whether or not your Pokmon will actually target the thing youre asking them to, especially when youre supposed to use it during specific story segments to battle a horde of trainers all at once. But its a pleasant and fast way to gather items to craft TMs that teach Pokmon new moves, and works well enough for the kind of item economy Game Freak has built with Scarlet and Violet. Im not sure its game changing, though, especially since my Pokmon never run as fast as I do, and if I want them to follow me I inevitably have to keep sending them out over and over as I repeatedly outpace them.While the battle system remains largely unchanged from past Pokmon games (and certainly doesnt embrace any of the more interesting shifts I loved in Legends: Arceus), the one major new addition is the expected generational battle gimmick of choice: Terastallizing. Thats a fancy term for a mechanic that temporarily gives one Pokmon in your party a superpowered monotype and a cool new bejeweled hat, but whats most interesting about it is that any Pokmon can have any Tera typing, including types they wouldnt normally have. This results in fun and unusual combinations, like a dragon-type Cloyster or an electric-type Gyarados. While some of these unusual Tera types can be found through exploring Paldea, the best and most interesting combinations are gained through Tera raid battles, which are Scarlet and Violets endgame answer to Sword and Shields excellent Dynamax raids.As with Dynamax raids, up to four players can participate in these time-limited battles to take down and capture superpowered Tera Pokmon with strange Tera types. Tera raid battles also feature a major improvement over Sword and Shields raid battles, in that you no longer have to sit through all of your opponents attacks each turn  everyone just moves simultaneously. Its a huge time saver. Ive had a great time hunting down interesting Tera Pokmon, and am extremely optimistic about its potential to keep the Scarlet and Violet community alive and well for the next year or more  if the technical problems dont kill it first.These games run like garbage.Lets talk about the Donphan in the room here: these games run like garbage. The framerate is an inconsistent mess, lighting effects toggle on and off seemingly at random, models pop in and out at short distances and sometimes very rapidly like weirdo ghosts, characters who arent even that far away walk like a bad stop-motion animated cartoon, everything slows to a crawl when theres more than one environmental effect (like rain or ocean waves) on screen at a time, and battles themselves can take an agonizingly long time as new Pokmon are swapped in. There are also tons of bizarre clipping issues where Pokmon can get caught in walls or underground, or the camera gets stuck at an odd angle and show an empty void on half the screen. Wild Pokmon will sometimes appear directly underneath you unexpectedly, trigger battles when youre not touching them, or vanish inexplicably  a problem thats especially annoying if the Pokmon in question is rare or, worse, shiny. For a more in-depth rundown of the technical mess, weve done a Performance Review on the specific issues that sheds some light on whats going on here:This is all bad enough, but its all exacerbated by the fact that Scarlet and Violet would be far from pretty games even if they ran well. While the aesthetic and architectural aspects of many of the towns in Paldea are interesting, theyre surrounded by incredibly low-resolution textures, long stretches of ugly, unremarkable terrain, and a weird, vague, shimmery effect around most objects. This is made especially odd by the fact that some of the character models and most of the Pokmon do actually look very good, but then you stand next to one of the pixelated Team Star flags and wonder what happened to cause such a dramatic disparity between that and your characters uniform.The issues do not end there  Pokmon Scarlet and Violet are also stuffed with bizarre bugs. They mostly manifest as small, funny, or harmless problems, such as being able to move at twice the speed with a second controller plugged in for some reason, but also there are more severe problems. For example, for some reason two of our guides writers suffered hard crashes when they walked near a ladder. At one point, two items were sitting on the ground that I was unable to pick up or interact with at all until I progressed the story further  and then they mysteriously began working again.Pokmon Scarlet and Violet are also stuffed with bizarre bugs.If you checked IGN ahead of launch you may have seen my review in progress, in which I held off on a score largely because I hadnt been able to try Scarlet and Violets online features  and its a good thing I did, because online adds an entirely new layer of weirdness. In addition to all the aforementioned technical issues, while online I experienced brand-new problems  at one point my friends turned invisible while riding their bikes, and at another the bikes turned invisible so my friends were floating in odd squats midair. I saw everyones faces get stuck in different emotes after using the camera app, resulting in permanent shocked or depressed expressions. One of my friends appeared in the doorway of every building I entered in a weird YMCA pose despite being nowhere near the area I was in. There were multiple communication errors that forced us to disband and reform groups just to keep playing, which is itself a time-consuming process. Oh, and there was an utterly bizarre moment where my friend briefly turned into a giant noodle man. Local co-op seems to have slightly fewer weird bugs than online (my colleague kept weirdly teleporting across the map on my screen for no reason), but broadly still runs as abysmally as the rest.for reference, @thekamdyman wasn't in this town, much less building. #PokemonScarletViolet #NintendoSwitch pic.twitter.com/JqXJyOURI9 Rebekah Valentine (@duckvalentine) November 19, 2022 This is a massive shame because, like the rest of Scarlet and Violet, the actual gameplay ideas in its co-op system are promising, if unrefined. Between debilitating bugs, my friends and I were able to do almost everything you can do alone in Scarlet and Violet side-by-side, if not explicitly cooperatively. They were able to complete early game story events that I had already finished while I hopped to the next town over to do some endgame content they didnt have access to yet. I could take photos with them, set up picnics and build absurd sandwiches together, and watch them battle wild Pokmon. They can battle trainer NPCs in the field, too, but this is an odder situation because you cant actually see the Pokmon fighting, so the two character models just sort of stand there and glare at one another while the friends of the battling player can run through the middle of the battlefield and make weird faces mid-fight. The bones of an excellent co-op system are mostly there  they just feel like they are held together with bits of wire and string.They just feel like they are held together with bits of wire and string.By far the best part of cooperative play, both technically and design-wise, is the aforementioned Tera raid battles. Though still plagued with some lag and occasional online connection weirdness, the four-person battles against powerful, jewel-like Pokmon mostly ran smoothly while in co-op, and they provide a fun treasure hunt of their own to embark on while playing with friends. Jumping into battles randomly online without turning on co-op mode could have been a great way to hunt Scarlet and Violets strongest monsters, but that has its own drawbacks. Even with an ethernet connection, matchmaking was a painful process with repeated connection errors and awkward queues that left me sitting around for an hour trying to find a raid I could join  not to mention intermittent lag and more of the same visual bugs that cause Pokmon to appear and disappear mid-battle. Having talked with several others about their own experiences with the technical mayhem in Scarlet and Violet, it does seem like your mileage may vary. Some people are reporting nothing more than some minor framerate blips. Other people I know have had multiple hard crashes, and have lost save data as a result due to turning off autosave (though alongside all the other weird bugs in this game, theres apparently a workaround to retrieve that data). My personal experience has fallen somewhere in the middle of those, but the middle is still extremely rough, and fundamentally none of this should be the case for anyone. Its shocking that a behemoth like Pokmon would be released in such a messy state, with no communication yet on whether or not we can expect a fix any time soon. (Nintendo has historically not been very aggressive about patching its games, which leaves us to worry that fixes might never come.) While I truly believe that patches could bring Scarlet and Violet into a more playable place, the fact remains that this is a product Game Freak, Creatures, The Pokmon Company, and Nintendo deemed acceptable to release. Pokmon and its fans deserve far better than this. Ive been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pokmon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined  a belief I also held about Pokmon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts  visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness  are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pokmon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pokmon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pokmon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if youre devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care weve all come to expect has not been shown here.", "date": "Nov. 24, 2022,"}
