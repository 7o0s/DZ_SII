Containing HD updates to 2005s Kingdom Hearts 2 and 2010s Birth by Sleep, its a mouthful of action-RPGs that proves that the series has aged gracefully over the past decade...for the most part. For something originally released during the waning hours of the PlayStation 2s life, Kingdom Hearts 2 holds up surprisingly well on PlayStation 3. Sure, the opening few hours, in which you play as Roxas, are still a boring string of banal tutorial missions that goes on for way too long. But the second youre finally back in control of Sora, it becomes a creative, meaty, and fulfilling action-RPG. His upgraded character design, great voice over, and awesome feel in combat make stepping into his oversized shoes a joy. As someone who grew up with these movies, characters, and worlds, Kingdom Hearts games are one of my favorite ways to actually interact with them. Hopping back and forth between the worlds of films like Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King, and Mulan keeps the 60-hour adventure feeling fresh, and the self-contained stories of each of these locations really nails the tone of their source material. Its colorful and creative representations of these worlds needed only the minor array of upgrades in this HD version to hold up a decade later. The stark neon colors of Trons Space Paranoids world look cleaner and better than ever in HD. However, the same cant be said for the menus themselves, which still look as spartan and bland as they did back in 2005. While the combat in Kingdom Hearts 2 initially comes across as a button-mashy, the past decade has proven theres a lot of depth to uncover throughout your journey. Soras arsenal of attacks, dodges, and juggles grow as you level up, both in power and with great animations that reflect it, and a deep roster of party members (which includes beloved Disney characters that range from Simba to Tron) all encouraged me to continue replaying this old favorite long into the night. To test the skill of even an old hand like myself, HD 2.5 Remix also contains a handful of new bosses pulled from some of the later games, including a bunch of raincoat-clad members of Organization XIII. Most of these provide a crazy level of challenge that forces you to really master the combat system: youll need to have the best weapons, become adept at managing your magic points, and memorize some of most brutal attack patterns this side of Mike Tyson in Punch-Out!!. Great voice work and a remixed soundtrack add to the atmosphere, and shortened load times make the entire thing more enjoyable to revist. The biggest pain point of getting back into Kingdom Hearts 2 was the control scheme. Over the past decade, its become more or less standard to bind jump to X and attack to square, but HD 2.5 Remix stubbornly sticks to its O to jump, X to attack ways, without offering a more modern and conventional configuration. It certainly didnt stop me, but being uncertain of my own fingers did slow me down. The second major game in the 2.5 Remix package is Birth by Sleep, and HD upgrade of a 2010 PSP game (which I, sadly, missed the first time around). As a prequel to the original Kingdom Hearts, its filled with mostly new and interesting characters and story elements, which helps make the overall plot much easier to understand. Your trio of playable characters  Terra, Aqua, and Ventus  have unique and intertwining stories that deal with some really interesting themes, including how we deal with failure when were surrounded by people whore succeeding. Each has their own set of abilities, too, which sets breaks the gameplay up into three distinct and varied scenarios. And while youre visiting the same classic Disney locales, these different emotional arcs still hit me in a really personal way. Birth by Sleeps combat is a modified version of Kingdom Hearts 2s, but instead of relying on magic points to use a lot of your special attacks, each one has a cooldown period reminiscent of modern MMORPGs or MOBAs. After being immersed turn-based combat for a few dozen hours, I greatly enjoyed this real-time combat systems pacing. Managing constantly recharging skills is a very different task from scouring through items list and finding something that can refill your magic or health, but equally challenging and interesting. It encouraged a level of strategy and on-the-fly planning that previous Kingdom Hearts never really took into consideration. The biggest thing that holds Birth by Sleep back is that its camera system is more cumbersome than Kingdom Hearts 2s, and is definitely lacking by modern standards. Locking on to enemies feels inconsistent, and rotating your view has a strange weight to it that makes certain close-quarters battles a bit of a chore. But beyond this, the interesting characters, fun battle system, and actually digestible story made Birth by Sleep one of my favorite games in the Kingdom Hearts series. Im glad I got this chance to revisit it. The weak link on this disc is definitely the Re:coded movie, which cobbles together cutscenes from the 2011 game into something thats palatable only only for the most die-hard of Kingdom Hearts lore completionists. As someone who loves the series gameplay and sense of exploration, and who finds the overarching story to be a bit of an undecipherable quagmire, Re:coded was a bit like watching a foreign film without subtitles. Pros Tons of contentFantastic soundtrackGreat combatBirth by Sleep Cons Control issues Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix is a great way to whet your appetite during the long wait for Kingdom Hearts 3, or to learn why so many of your fellow gamers are anticipating it so impatiently. It contains the best versions of two of the best games in the series, with upgraded visuals, music, and some really entertaining high-level challenges. Despite Re:codeds failure to make the series overarching story comprehensible, this package is a great celebration of what can happen when two completely unrelated, but equally beloved things merge together.", "date": "Dec. 9, 2014,"}
