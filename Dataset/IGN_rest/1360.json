And also a little bit nostalgic. Dragonborn  the second major expansion pack for the sublime Skyrim  takes many cues from Morrowind, the beloved third game in the Elder Scrolls role-playing series. Thats largely because its set on the island of Solstheim, a land last seen in the Bloodmoon expansion for Elder Scrolls III. While its still very Skyrim-y overall, some of its dungeons and locales set it apart from the mainland youve probably already spent dozens of hours living in. To the south, for instance, is Tel Mithryn, a gorgeous overgrown Smurf village dominated by gigantic mushroom homes and stacked with interesting quests, like chasing down a fledgling spellcasters runaway magic summon-gone-wrong. Its discovery will be a complete and utter surprise for the uninitiated  odds are youll stumble on it simply by making your way towards the massive erupting volcano to the south (sadly, you cannot actually get to it). Solstheims dungeons are an equally fresh experience. The aforementioned Black Book realms  festooned with tentacles, acidic seas, and eyeballs in the sky  make for creepy hunting, and even the usual Dwemer or snowy dungeons throw new puzzle wrinkles into their otherwise familiar formula. Youll be fighting a handful of new enemies in them too, which helps. Disgusting Seekers float around and confuse you by cloning decoys of themselves, while the goblin-like Rieklings sometimes ride wild boars and always throw spears at you. Pro tip: be sure to visit the Trisk Mead Hall and talk to  do not attack  the pack of Rieklings out front. It will lead you on a hilarious sidequest. All that exploration, combat, and book collecting is in an effort to power yourself up and ultimately take down Miraak, the ancient, original Dragonborn  essentially the Bizarro World version of you  whos not pleased about you joining his exclusive Fus-Ro-Dah Club. Though simple and archetypal, its actually an engaging tale that feels rushed despite taking between six and eight hours to complete (sidequests add a lot more playtime, however). The scale of the story, during which youll search for Black Books and destroy Miraaks elemental shrines scattered about the world, feels like it needed more time and more quests in order to properly convey its scope. Dragonborns biggest new feature is arguably the ability to ride dragons. You dont gain the skill to do so until you learn all three words of a new Dragon Shout, which happens at the end of the main quest. When you finally do, youre probably going to be a bit disappointed. Its not a completely passive experience, a la Grand Theft Auto IVs taxi rides, but its only a step above that. You can command your winged, scaly beast to land, lock onto targets, and attack, but thats it. No airborne quests or other shenanigans. Any dreams you have of flying freely around Solstheim and Skyrim, snatching town NPCs in your dragons clutches, then dropping them to their doom from a mile-high altitude are going to have to stay dreams for now. We welcome the very Morrowind-y vibe. THE VERDICT The requisite new armor pieces and weapons look very cool  and can even benefit higher-level players  but by and large Skyrim isnt going to wow you, visually speaking. This is still Skyrim, albeit one year later, and Dragonborn is an expansion pack in every sense of the term. But theres enough new stuff here, highlighted by the spectacular island of Solstheim itself, to make Dragonborn the best piece of add-on content for Skyrim yet. Although it may not be immune to the test of time, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim still holds up as one of the most immersive virtual worlds ever created in a video game. All of its vastness, beauty, characters, stories, and goofy bugs fit nicely onto the Switch, where it runs at a good, steady framerate and resolution. The addition of motion controls are handy unless you plan to be a melee fighter, and amiibo support is a nice touch, but neither is really a game changer. This is a great way to get your Skyrim fix if youve never played before or have been looking for a reason to jump back in.", "date": "Dec. 17, 2012,"}
