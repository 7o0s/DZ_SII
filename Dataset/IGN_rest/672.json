This time, however, its a far more personal essay, and I was left thinking - for many, many hours afterward - not just about the process of game-making but about Wreden himself. In this regard, The Beginners Guide is an unforgettable experience. The Beginners Guide opens in a charmingly illogical Counter-Strike map created by a developer named Coda. We are told this by Wreden himself, the emotive narrator of The Beginners Guide. Coda was a friend of his, he explains, who created many interesting games - not intended for public consumption - but has since stopped creating for reasons Wreden doesnt understand. Wreden tells us he created The Beginners Guide in part as a message of encouragement for Coda to start creating again. Wredens secondary intention is what got me hooked - to take us through Codas body of work chronologically and thus reach a previously elusive conclusion about the man and his methods. What are the common elements in each of Codas games? Why did he make them during the time he made them? What was he trying to say? Can a video game offer insight into the mind of its creator? Its Wreden who makes moving through Codas body of work during The Beginners Guides 90 minutes the engaging experience that it is. Codas games are exploratory and deeply personal, demanding very little practical engagement from us, and more often than not are thematically obtuse. But Wredens lively commentary sheds light on their meaning, or at least, his interpretation of their meaning. He dances easily between topics - repeated motifs, for example, or possible themes - while littering the Beginners Guide with anecdotes of his relationship with Coda, like a self-deprecating story about his over-eagerness at getting to know the developer at a game jam. Its a charming performance. His presence encourages a great sense of fun while moving about Codas worlds, too. Like The Stanley Parable, much of my enjoyment in The Beginners Guide came from the narrators awareness of my actions and thoughts in my role as the player. Wredens commentary was always one step ahead of my own internal monologue: Why is this wall here? Id think. It just ends like that, says Wreden with a laugh. Why is there a maze in a space station? Wreden doesnt know either. The smashing of the fourth wall reaches its peak when Wreden actually dips into Codas games to add his own little flourishes in particularly janky or unplayable parts, or just to open them up and see how they tick. In one game, for example, he grants you the ability to make the oppressive walls of the levels interior disappear, so youre able to gaze at the world in its complex entirety. In another, he builds a bridge over an inhospitable area. As a player, its liberating to be allowed behind the scenes in this way, but it also poses questions about whether or not Wredon should be doing this - by his admission, without Codas knowledge - in the first place. The gut-punching conclusion to The Beginners Guide asks more questions than it answers, and left me struggling with my own thoughts on Codas work, on Wredens intentions when he created The Beginners Guide, and that original hypothesis: can games offer windows into the minds of their creators? That Ive not stopped thinking about it makes the question of fiction vs non-fiction in The Beginners Guide ultimately irrelevant. Pros Unique conceptLively narrationInspires thought The Beginners Guide poses a number of academic questions around the nature of choice, interactivity, and creativity. While it offers no firm answers, its one of the most thought-provoking and ultimately disarming interactive experiences Ive had all year, and one I wont easily shake off.", "date": "Oct. 8, 2015,"}
