This isn't unique, as virtually every videogame makes heavy use of symbols  a red cross symbolizes health; a block of buildings with a star represents a capital city. What makes Continue? unique is that it embraces and understands the symbolism of games and abstract narrative, and constructs its story entirely around that understanding. The actual game side of Continue? occasionally interferes with the overall experience, but it is fascinating. Symbolic storytelling works because our brains fill in the blanks automatically when given incomplete information in every story. But when it's especially abstract, as Continue? is, the ambiguity is riskier. Its character design shows how this works: the piles of tiny blocks and stilted limbs approximate a human just well enough to represent most any videogame hero, without actually looking like any in particular. With every one of its components  visual style, dialogue, plot, music, and even styles of gameplay  Continue? creates an ambiguity using symbols, that works very well for it. The most immediate symbol is Continue?9876543210's title, a reference to the countdown encouraging you to put in more quarters in arcade games. (Back when those were a thing.) It's not common or necessary anymore, but it immediately points to death. That's the first thing you see starting it up: the main character keels over in a forest, and the Continue? countdown begins. This is followed by a touching and clever introduction showing a mixture of religious death imagery  going into the light, crossing the River Styx  with programming, like a set of .jsp files connected to the hero's limbs suddenly turning to null. That mixture of the practical elements of the program with the metaphysical symbols of death and afterlife remains one of Continue?'s strongest aspects throughout. Your hero is unwilling to be erased, and is swept up by a program that cleans garbage from his game's memory. So he or she moves through limbo, talking with people, figuring out a way to avoid the garbage collector program. It all sounds very artsy, but there's a challenge behind it too: you have to play through six random levels, collecting shelter against a gathering storm, while also fighting off enemies trying to devour your RAM in arcade-style minigames based on Zelda or Space Invaders. The controls for these are too awkward for them to be the reason to play Continue? on their own, but they work in this context as an abstract meditation on videogame death  they're awkward and abstract in the same way that the characters are visually. Unlike similarly themed games (To The Moon, for example, which uses the structure of a game to tell an easily accessed story,) Continue? is challenging to complete, especially on the first run. Its overall structure of racing for shelter against deletion creates an interesting balance of time, resources, and future planning. But explaining all of that takes away from Continue?'s primary charm, which is its symbolic mystery. Much like 2012's Dear Esther or Journey, a huge amount of the game is attempting to figure out what its all about. For example, it uses the refrain of My Lightning, My Prayer both as a core gameplay decision and a poetic contemplation on finding meaning in death. Death, when jsp files turn to null. The writing continues in this vein. One of the first characters encountered explains that the software deletions have taken out chunks of language, making all the characters speak a broken English that veers between baby talk and poetry. Once again, this imbues Continue? with abstract meaning  whatever your brain thinks gives the symbolic dialogue the most meaning will work. On the other hand, the combination of the broken English with some of the level settings, like Slums or Prison, occasionally led me to the feeling that its accidentally making fun of poor folk and minorities. (Likewise, one level that partially frames Juggalos as modern Native Americans due to tribal facepaint, shared songs, and ritual drinks doesn't work well.) If this sounds like Continue?9876543210 is a difficult game to grasp, that's because it is. Two components really define its core tension. First, its music glues Continue? together. Its sad, minor-key piano music for the directly death-related scenes may be a bit of a clich, but it works well enough. It also nails the pounding danger of the battle sequences, as well as the desperate drone of the shelter levels. The artistic aspect of a game like this relies so much on mood, and the music consistently sets that mood in a way that supports the blocky graphics, broken/poetic English, and clumsy controls. My brother is also named Bort. On the other hand, the fact that there is a difficult game within Continue? serves to break that mood more than anything else. It can successfully instill a feeling of pensiveness about death in a cutscene between levels, but when you're more focused in making sure you have shelter and health, that cutscene or that poetic line of dialogue becomes an annoyance. The feeling of frustration that it sometimes instills trumps the feeling of sadness that it wants to consistently creates. In doing so, Continue?9876543210 inadvertently reveals why many games that take on difficult or emotional subjects tend to be easy to finish: because that's the most effective way to convey the intended experience. Pros Gorgeous musicPoetic storyClever premise Cons Clumsy controlsOccasionally frustrating Continue?9876543210 is arty game that actually attempts to challenge us, yet their short, repetitive, ritualistic nature can interrupt the themes that make this a unique and interesting game. Perhaps the most paradoxical aspect of Continue? is that for a game so committed to abstraction and ambiguity, it itself is what it appears to be. I went into it expecting a simple, evocative game-based meditation on death, and while I was somewhat surprised by the level of challenge and cleverness, it still was exactly a simple, evocative, game-based meditation on death. That's rare enough and smart enough to make it easy to recommend Continue?9876543210 to the curious.", "date": "Jan. 15, 2014,"}
