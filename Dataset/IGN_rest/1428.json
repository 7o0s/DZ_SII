See, I thought Funcom's modern fantasy opus had shown me its true colors early on. Midway through a main story mission, it handed me a tattered sheet of paper littered with sloppy scrawlings vaguely related to my next objective. Then it booted me out into the cold without so much as a waypoint to my name and told me fend for myself. Now, in the grand scheme of TSW's investigation missions, this one wasn't even that difficult. But after years of playing MMOs more or less on autopilot, I was suddenly in uncharted territory. You want me to think? I said to no one in particular. Like, with brains and things? Does it... does it hurt? Initially, I was tempted to use a walkthrough. I mean, any time this mission spent chewing up and spitting out my gum wad of a brain stood between me and sweet, sweet XP. And yet, here was TSW, throwing a monkey wrench in the level treadmill. But I decided to go with it, so I wandered around Kingsmouth for 30 minutes or so. And when, on a hunch, I finally arrived at my destination, the Hooray, you completed a quest and are not entirely stupid! chime was music to my ears. I overcame an interesting challenge. The XP hardly even mattered. The point was, well, the actual experience. That philosophy pervades TSW's core elements  questing, story, dungeons, locations, skills  resulting in an MMO that brings something legitimately different to the table. Well, initially, anyway. I found myself exploring every inch of locations ranging from small-town New England to Egypt, simply for the joy of uncovering tiny details that really make the world come alive  readable menus, working phones, lovingly crafted interiors, etc. This is a game world like no other, and TSW's worth at least a look on that merit alone. Questing  with its plethora of utterly unhinged, darkly humorous characters  had the same effect. I sought them out to hear their absurd (and spectacularly voice-acted) monologues, even if a good many of them spoke as though they'd been bitten by a radioactive Shakespeare play. Larger quests (read: main and story), can only be tackled one at a time, but break down into multi-objective tiers. This places further emphasis on cohesive storylines, as opposed to repetitive quest chains that do roughly the same job as a bored tour guide whose monotone voice sends your face on a one-way vacation into a puddle of drool. On top of that, tiers aren't simply moldy MMO standbys Voltron'd together into some lumbering beast of boredom. Some had me solve puzzles, while others incorporated elements of (admittedly clunky) stealth and strategic planning. One of my favorites, meanwhile, saw me brave a legitimately frightening haunted house. Investigations, however, stole the show, brilliantly melding the lateral thinking of games like Funcom's own The Longest Journey and an authentic modern day setting. One mission, for instance, had me find an in-game character's computer password by Googling an email address from a business card, which led to an honest-to-goodness real-life website for his not-so-honest-or-good giant corporation. I've also researched nursery rhymes, dug up obscure Bible verses, deciphered Morse code, and on and on and on. These things are rarely easy (though a handy, fully functional in-game web browser at least means they're not inconvenient), but boy are they ever rewarding. And that's hardly even touching on the fantastic, incredibly atmospheric group instances (which I spotlighted in my first impressions write-up) or tiny conveniences like the ability to call in quest completions and search skills and items by name. Point is, TSW's got some seriously forward-thinking ideas, and they make the first handful of hours seem downright magical. But then things slow down a bit, and cold reality starts pouring down on the parade. Later zones' quest content becomes markedly less interesting, relying more on run-of-the-mill brawn than brilliantly inspired brains. And when TSW trots out traditional MMO kill/collect tropes, it goes all the way. Tier One: kill five zombies/sea monsters/ghosts/demons/evil clowns in a location. Tier Two: kill five zombies/sea monsters/ghosts/demons/evil clowns in another location. Tier Three: kill five zombies/sea monsters/ghosts/demons/evil clowns in yet another location. And so on. Worse, I encountered my fair share of glitches, including a few quests that were out-and-out broken. After copious corpse runs and uttering curses more vile than anything my supernatural foes were flinging, the last thing I wanted to find out was that all my hard work was for nothing. All the while, rote, hotkey-mashing combat failed to put any semblance of swing back into the step of this tired song-and-dance. That becomes all the more heartbreaking when you factor in TSW's colossal, completely open skill system which... honestly isn't as open as advertised. Don't get me wrong: there's still tremendous room for variation and experimentation, but generally, it ended up being in my best interest to conform to a traditional MMO role  for example, tank, DPS, or healer. Ultimately, I still had fun dreaming up new builds (my masterpiece: a stun-and-knockdown-centric PvP troll build engineered in the most devilish depths of my mind for the sole purpose of pissing offeveryone), but this system won't set the world  secret or not  on fire. Speaking of PvP, it's here and accounted for, but in a distressingly subdued manner. TSW's story, after all, centers around the puppet-string-pulling tug-of-war between Illuminati, Templar, and Dragon. And yet, it barely manifests at all in-game. So instead of subterfuge and intrigue (or even open-world PvP), we're left with three fairly traditional battlegrounds. Admittedly, they're not by any means bad; Eldorado, for instance, has teams both capturing neutral relics (read: flags) and choosing where to defend them, while Stonehenge is some of the most chaotic king of the hill I've ever played. But the Fusang Project, TSW's one persistent warzone, tends to devolve into a numbers game. Do you have more people than the other faction? Congratulations: the point is yours. Again, all brawn, none of TSW's trademark brains. TSW is, in that respect, a bit odd. There's an opportunity for some truly interesting emergent factional warfare here, but Funcom doesn't really seem interested in facilitating it. So instead, we get a pre-written, single-player-style story telling us about this vibrant, living world and a shadowy war between secret societies, but it's all kind of a facade. I mean, why make your game an MMO if you're not going to take advantage of, well, all of the people? The endgame, meanwhile, is largely composed of escalating dungeon difficulties and  if you're feeling so inclined  repeating quests until you've turned your skill wheel into a technicolor dream rainbow of certain death. Those things can scarf down hours if you let them, but there's a distinct aftertaste of deja vu. To its credit, Funcom has promised monthly story content, new zones, more investigations, new weapon types, additional skills, a PvP dungeon, and all sorts of other regular content updates  but only time will tell whether or not that's enough to keep TSW's community alive and thriving. For now, then, The Secret World's a wonderfully promising foundation that's positively riddled with cracks. On one hand, it's obvious that Funcom really, really cares about crafting an incredibly detailed online world that can stand alone. But, on the other, that places a microscope atop TSW's seams  the spots where it hasn't quite broken outside its genre's very stale mold  making the lack of evolution all the more disappointing. All that said, I do plan on renewing my subscription for at least a few months. To be sure, there are countless issues here, but TSW's the first major MMO release in ages to contain ideas I can honestly say I'm in love with. It's a mixed bag, but I'm already neck-deep in this gleefully insane rabbit hole. Guess I'll just have to see where it leads. CLOSING COMMENTS The Secret World flirts with brilliance and  at least, during earlier zones  looks primed to seal the deal. But, as time goes on, its its seemingly bottomless bag of tricks starts to look a bit shallow. The story, world, skill system, and investigation missions definitely do their damndest to rewrite the MMO rulebook, but uninspired combat, ho-hum PVP, uninteresting late-game quests, and general clunkiness keep TSW's smartest innovations from truly shining. More content's on the way, but for now, the reality of TSW can't quite match its lofty ambitions. IGN RATINGS FOR THE SECRET WORLD (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 Presentation Each zone is a lovingly crafted ode to everything from Lovecraftian horror to all sorts of urban legends, and the story's got just the right amount of quirk and camp to accompany its long-winded monologues. 7.0 Graphics Locations and creature designs generally have a very nice gothy look to them, but character models range from mediocre to downright ugly. Animations aren't much to write home about either. 7.0 Sound The music's fairly forgettable ambient fare, but background sounds and enemies' horrifying howls really steal the show. This is the first MMO that's made me feel more than a little unsettled while simply wandering around a zone. 7.0 Gameplay While investigations are completely unlike anything else in the genre and dungeons contain some seriously creative encounters, everything else comes up a bit flat. Nothing's bad by any means, but combat and combat-centric quests, especially, end up drenched in deja vu. 6.0 Lasting Appeal TSW starts off extremely strong and then slowly but surely loses steam. Later characters and quests simply aren't as interesting, and the endgame's currently composed of no-frills PVP and re-runs of old dungeons. Promised monthly content updates might be worth sticking around for. 7.0 OVERALL Good (out of 10) The Secret World flirts with brilliance and  at least, during earlier zones  looks primed to seal the deal.
