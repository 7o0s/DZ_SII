I know, I know, it actually works really well and, on a technical level, is far superior to the Wii motion controller that came before it. But the fact of the matter is the PlayStation 3s audience is largely of the hardcore variety, and no matter how much Sony tries to spin things, that hardcore audience doesnt want anything to do with motion controls. The sales of PlayStation Move over the last two years all but prove that. With that said, there are, in my estimation, three games exclusive to PlayStation Move worthy of everyone's time  the original Sports Champions, Sorcery and Medieval Moves: Deadmunds Quest  and Im happy to report that Sports Champions 2 joins their ranks. Its by no means a tour de force, but for those that already own PlayStation Move and are desperate for a reason to charge it up and get to playing, Sports Champions 2 warrants a look. Sports Champions 2 comes by way of Zindagi Games, the studio responsible for two of the three aforementioned worthy titles. So the developers pedigree with Sonys motion controller is established. And wisely, Zindagis stuck with whats made its games critically successful, taking some of what worked in Sports Champions  namely archery  while shuffling in some new athletic events that replace older offerings with a varied amount of success. Lets start with archery, Sports Champions hallmark, and Sports Champions 2s as well. As the lone carryover from the original, archery makes a welcome return with a variety of options and settings. It is, indeed, Sports Champions 2s most robust and enjoyable mode. Theres something undeniably fun about grabbing an arrow from your digital quiver and letting it fly at any variety of targets. Not surprisingly, Zindagi Games has this down pat. After all, the best PlayStation Move game of them all  Zindagis Medieval Moves: Deadmunds Quest  is largely built around that very mechanic. Bowling is also a great deal of simple fun. The sport in real life proves easy to understand and difficult to master, and that carries over nicely in Sports Champions 2. Putting some English on your ball as it curves precariously close to the gutter only to swing in and slam directly into the heart of the pins is almost as satisfying as it is when playing the real thing. Out of all of the activities in Sports Champions 2, bowling perhaps provides the most fun, most casual game to play with a friend. Im terrible at golf in real life, but not so bad at it in Sports Champions 2. Then again, following through with your stroke, whether teeing-off or putting on the green, can be a little inexact. I always found myself using too much power no matter how subtly I tried to swing. Still, like bowling, this is another great game to play with a friend, and just as fun by yourself. Mechanically, it falls somewhere in the middle of Sports Champions 2s six activities in terms of fluidity and functionality. Even though Zindagi Games chose to remove its gladiator mode from the sequel, it has added another mano-a-mano competitive activity in the form of boxing. Now, in premise, boxing is actually really good. Theres a lot of depth to it, from throwing different kinds of punches to blocking different points of your body. You can even use super attacks when the time is right to bloody your opponent with a fury of digital swings. But you can easily work around its fine mechanics by doing the motion controller equivalent of button-mashing, swinging wildly and hoping for the best. This takes a sound experience and somewhat sullies it. Sports Champions 2s weakest offerings come by way of the final two activities: tennis and skiing. Tennis is functional most of the time, but it has a sort of controller-based Achilles heel  the PlayStation Eye losing sight of the Move when aggressively going for the forehand or backhand. Obviously, this makes the experience frustrating. Its truly a shame, as tennis had the potential to be fresh, fun and engaging, and perhaps the best of Sports Champions 2s six activities. Skiing, on the other hand, is bizarre and totally out of place in Sports Champions 2. It controls strangely and feels broken at times, and is  by far  the biggest miss in the entire package. Boxing is functional, but could be better. All six activities come wrapped up in three different modes for you to explore on your own or with friends. As someone who loves playing games on his own, I derived the most amount of fun out of Cup Play, a single player-only mode available in any unlocked sport. For each activity, Cup Play is split in three  Bronze, Silver and Gold  with a series of tasks to complete to earn each cup. Players earn stars all the while that get them closer to earning each cup and act as a sort of separate scoring method. Going back to get all of the stars in each cup for every sport provides a true hook in Sports Champions 2. Of course, Sports Champions 2 also has another hook, a substantial hook, in fact, if you have multiple PlayStation Moves and some friends who want to join in on some faux athletics. In Free Play mode, you can play any sport with up to four friends (as well as by yourself). If you really want to mix things up, you can jump into Sports Champions 2s Party Play functionality, which also accommodates up to four players and mixes and matches sports randomly to give you a hodgepodge of tasks to keep you busy. Playing with friends in Sports Champions 2 is fun if you have the room to fit everyone in front of your PlayStation Eye, which might be a stretch for many gamers. Still, even though I think Sports Champions 2 is most enjoyable when played solo, youll have the option to get some friends on board if you have the hardware and space to accommodate them. Its just too bad you cant play Sports Champions 2 with folks online. THE VERDICT I like Sports Champions 2, and Zindagi Games should be applauded for clearly mastering the device about as well as any developer has. But Sports Champions 2 doesnt rise much above its predecessor, either, and its not a game that Id recommend going out and buying if you also have to invest in a PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye. These devices simply havent justified themselves in their two years on the market, and Sports Champions 2  a good game in its own right  doesnt change that fact. But by all means, if you own a PlayStation Move and want to dust that bad boy off, Sports Champions 2 may just be for you.", "date": "Nov. 3, 2012,"}
