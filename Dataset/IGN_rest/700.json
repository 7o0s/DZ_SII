Super Mario Maker is a unique celebration of Nintendos iconic mascot. Its also an incredibly accessible level construction kit, one where you can easily spend hours creating stages or playing levels made by a passionate community of series fans. Youll see a genuine reverence for Marios history in the 10 Mario Challenge, a mode where youre given 10 lives to complete sample courses. Theres 68 stages in all and each one is wildly different from the other. Some remix levels from past Mario games, others showcase interesting twists and challenges that transform Marios standard platforming mechanics into a puzzle to be solved. Overall, its a fun experience, even if it can be finished in one or two sittings, depending on your skill level. 10 Mario Challenge is brief, but each sample course you unlock can then be closely examined and even disassembled in the Course Maker, an intuitive design suite where you can easily build Super Mario stages in one of four styles from the franchises unique history: From the original Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. No matter which style you choose, creating levels is an intimidating task but the well designed interface makes learning easy and intuitive. Each piece of this do-it-yourself toolkit is well thought out, with smart button-based shortcuts, a grid-based user interface, and simple drag and drop controls. The 60 individual building blocks you use to make levels -- from ground tiles to enemies -- unlock over a 9-day period. But this careful roll-out really works because you have plenty of time to tinker with new stuff and not feel overwhelmed by too many choices. Each day I returned to the Course Maker, I would lose track of time building stages, an experience punctuated by funny sounds and my wacky imagination of what a Mario stage could be. Despite the overall goal of keeping things simple, Super Mario Maker is a powerful toolkit that helps you build fun contraptions, distractions, and courses. However, the fact that you cant place a checkpoint baffling. Youre forced to finish a level on one life. Sadly, not even the original Super Mario Bros., which the company released in 1985, was that cruel. But Super Mario Maker isnt limited to just making levels for a Super Mario platformer. The tools are flexible enough that you can make all sorts of things, from special birthday messages to rube goldberg devices. The ability to personalize your stage with special character costumes or custom sounds adds another layer of personality to your creations. The simple stylus-driven interface makes it possible to build almost anything you want, and the self-discoveries made during the process transform the act of creation into something that feels like a game itself. But the most novel part of Super Mario Maker comes from how quickly and seamlessly it jumps between stage creator and play. Once a level is complete, you can quickly upload it to Nintendos servers and keep track of stats and feedback via notifications. Through curated lists you can find and play the popular levels or discover up and coming designers to follow in the community. However, dont immediately count on playing stages made by your buddies - theres no filter for searching levels made by people on your pre-existing Nintendo friends list. The 100 Mario Challenge is a fast way to play though up to 16 user created stages in a mini-campaign from the maker community. If a level is too difficult, a quick can swipe on the GamePad will move you over to another randomly selected stage quickly. Pros Intuitive interfaceGreat creator tools10 Mario Challenge Cons No checkpointsNo filter for friend list Super Mario Maker is a great way to mark Marios 30th birthday, but its not concerned with being an overwrought history lesson. Instead, its a celebration that folds three decades of Mario into one accessible, powerful creation suite. The perpetual joke at the end of every 10 Mario Challenge run informing you that the Princess is in yet another castle hints at Super Mario Makers bigger promise: There will always be more levels to play thanks to the online creation community, and a virtually endless pool of challenges to overcome.", "date": "Sept. 2, 2015,"}
