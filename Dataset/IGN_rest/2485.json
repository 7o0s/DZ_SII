Thats what Chasm tries to deliver: a full Metroidvania where every new game has its own unique, randomized map. Its RPG-elements and awesome variety of beautifully animated enemies make it fun the first time through, but its that push for replayability that ends doing more harm than good. The layout of Chasms map is randomized, pieced together with pre-built rooms to build a custom map that no one but you will experience. You still progressively unlock new movement abilities in a specific order -- like a wall climb or a double jump -- that open new paths as you go, but you wont be able to look up the locations you unlock them in a wiki. Unlike many other platformers with randomized maps, like Rogue Legacy or Dead Cells, Chasm isnt a roguelike. You arent constantly dying and restarting, and death doesnt mean a new map. My first playthrough of Chasm took me around eight hours to beat (with some secrets still left to find) and I was on the same map that was generated at the start the whole time. The randomization only really comes into play in future runs. After the credits rolled, I started a new game and was amused that I didnt immediately know where everything was. Its an awesome idea, and the way Chasm assembles its worlds works surprisingly well, to the point where it feels so seamless that I imagine many people may not even notice on their first run. Bland-omly Generated And thats exactly the problem: it doesnt matter. To me, a person who just wants to play this Metroidvania like a regular game, the fact that its a randomized map means nothing apart from room placement being unpredictable. This is the map Chasm is handing me, and how it was generated is irrelevant to my experience while playing until Id already beaten it. The world is put together in a way thats impressive for being generated by a formula, it doesnt apply itself in an interesting way in the slightest. The randomized construction is successful enough that the result doesnt feel wonky, but its also devoid of personality or thoughtful care. Each area is just a series of rooms that lead to other rooms, oftentimes even repeating layouts and enemy patterns in a way that no designer would. There are six different biomes in Chasm, all of them attractive and visually diverse, but none of them connect with any logic beyond go into this door and appear somewhere else. They have their own minimaps, which I imagine allows their randomized layouts to jigsaw together easier, but prevents Chasms world from having any real sense of place or character. One moment youre in a mine, then a jungle, then a crypt -- who knows why. Because it all has to randomly piece together, Chasm's world doesn't have any real sense of place or character. Compare Chasms Lego-like structure with the carefully crafted subterranean world of Hollow Knight, the sprawling island of Yokus Island Express, or even the castles of its Castlevania inspiration and it pales in comparison. Its not that its a badly put together map, its just a bland one. The benefit of its procedural generation is only reaped with multiple playthroughs, but the cost of making the map function this way doesnt really make me want to play it multiple times through. Im sure speedrunners will get an absolute thrill out of Chasms semi-unpredictable layout, but Im not a speedrunner, and it doesnt do much to inspire me to dive back in. Even when I did, it was still full of uninspiring hallways, and the fact that they were in a different order this time didnt help that much. That all said, the bland level layouts dont make Chasm a bad game. Its a fun one despite that, with lots of retro-inspiration informed by more modern ideas. Chasm clearly pulls from Castlevania in a lot of ways (I doubt its a coincidence that my favorite weapon was the whip) but adds RPG-like stat and equipment systems that make it feel like something new. The equipment let me customize my playstyle a bit -- its not always about putting on the gear with the highest defense number. I could pick items that increased my health, physical damage, or magic damage as I saw fit -- the last of which buffs magic ranged weapons like throwing knives and axes. My favorite item, the Bird Hat, was even weirder. It summoned a little bird to follow me around and attack enemies. I could even level the bird up to make it stronger by letting it get the last hit on enemies, which added a new layer to each fight. Buffing up my bird sacrificed any experience for my own character. You get a boost to your stats with each level up you earn, though the increased max health was always the most noticeable benefit. I was a bit disappointed that my characters level had no other effect that I noticed; it didnt even get a mention in the final victory screen next to other stats, like how many total enemies I had killed. A Light Against Darkness Chasms straightforward but charming story puts you in control of a knight in training who has to rescue the citizens of a kidnapped town by venturing deep into a mines below. As you do, more shuttered shops will open back up and those same townsfolk will then ask you to find specific items in the mines for further rewards. Along the way, you stumble upon an evil cult and have to thwart the ancient god theyve summoned to destroy the world -- you know, standard stuff. Its not an overly original tale, but when told in combination with rebuilding the town, I grew invested in what was happening. It felt great to stumble on another trapped person in the caves and be rewarded for it with new items to buy later on. The combat itself is enjoyable, but can be frustratingly precise. Finding the right time to swing and dodge required mastery; it sometimes felt like I was fighting the game instead of the monsters. Every weapon has a slight recovery after youve attacked before you can do anything else, locking you in place and making wreckless swings deadly mistakes. Theres also a delay before and after using the dodge button, which made it unusably hard for me to time. Chasm's wide variety of enemies and awesome boss designs are beautifully animated. My combat strategy ended up evolving into a lot of jumping, as attacking in mid-air let me move while swinging. If I attacked early enough in the jump, landing would cancel the end of the attack animation. That meant I could quickly dodge out of the way or immediately attack again, essentially doubling my damage. I liked learning those nuances, though I felt a little guilty because I wasnt sure if it was an exploit or by design. Instead, what really makes Chasms combat so consistently fun is the huge enemy variety. There are nearly 100 different types of enemies, and very few of them felt like reskins of each other. Learning attack patterns to dodge and how many hits it took to take them down was challenging and engaging, even if the actual swinging could sometimes be frustrating. The need for precision in combat extended into Chasms platforming segments, too. Most of the corridors of Chasms mines are just simple rooms with enemies, but some had biome-specific jumping puzzles as well -- things like platforms that would open and close or sawblades youd have to dodge. These sometimes required frustratingly precise timing, but also provided interesting obstacles to juggle in the middle of fights. One of the reasons everything demands such delicate timing is because of the way Chasm is rendered: its actually running at an extremely small 384x216 resolution and is then blown up to fit your screen. That means that the pixels you see are the pixels you get, so there are fewer pixels available for you to properly time jumps and attacks. But the visual results are worth it. The art and animation in Chasm look incredible and crisp -- a perfect blend of retro and modern techniques. The backgrounds are lush and the enemies are much higher fidelity than what was made at the time of the SNES, but theyre still clearly linked to those classic inspirations -- theres even an optional CRT visual mode for the true old school look. Chasms bosses were especially well designed, with exciting visuals and some crazy attacks. A sand worm that also shot balls of lightning was definitely a highlight, even if it wasnt too difficult to beat. I was a little disappointed that every boss only rewarded me with +3 max HP when your total health already starts at a whopping 60 (compare that to going from three Hearts to four from the first boss of any Zelda game and Chasms reward feels miniscule) but fighting them was a treat regardless. Chasm is a lovely and fun Metroidvania with a lot of cool new ideas, its just not an overly exciting one. The maps it pieces together are amusing enough to explore, filled with tons of wonderfully animated enemies to fight, but the repetitive rooms and the worlds lack of personality as a whole undermines Chasms own goal of replayability. As a result, Chasm is a platformer I thoroughly enjoyed playing through once, but Im not rushing back for more.", "date": "Aug. 1, 2018,"}
