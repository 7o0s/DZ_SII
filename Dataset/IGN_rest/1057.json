Now, the most important thing to know about Mighty Gunvolt is that it's woefully, incredibly short; roughly 20 minutes with just a little skill. However, that 20 minutes is a tantalizing throwback to an era that preceded and inspired 16-bit side-scrollers like Mega Man X. Unlike Azure Gunvolt, Mighty doesn't bring anything new to the table, but I'm pretty sure that was the idea. It's part of its charm. If Azure Striker Gunvolt -- which we loved -- is Japanese developer Inti Create's 16-bit revival project, then Mighty Gunvolt is Azure's 8-bit icing. The original Mega Man is clearly the point of origin for Mighty Gunvolt. Everything about it -- its fluid gameplay, its simple-yet-colorful backgrounds, its soundtrack, and even its point system -- is a throwback to the Blue Bomber's original adventure. Heck, getting through its five stages takes a comparable amount of time it takes an expert to get through Mega Man's six initial stages. There are a lot of parallels old-schoolers will appreciate, which breeds welcome familiarity. Much more like Mega Man 10 than Mega Man, there are multiple characters to choose from: Gunvolt himself, Beck from the upcoming Mighty No. 9, and Ekoro from Inti Creates Japanese-only rail shooter, GalGun. Each character has his or her own strengths, weakness, and special abilities, though they all have access to the same five stages and boss battles. I liked playing as Gunvolt the best. He's perfectly balanced, though Ekoro and Beck have their uses too. Ekoro is the weakest offensively, but she can float like the Princess in Super Mario Bros. 2, which is useful at various times during the brief campaign. Beck sports a handy dash ability that allows you to uncover otherwise inaccessible areas, though there's a different reason you might want to play him: it's the very first time Mighty No. 9's main character has been playable anywhere. And for those of us stoked about Inafune's promising upcoming project, that's pretty damn cool. Each of the five stages, along with the enemies that occupy them, are pulled from Azure's campaign; they've just been reimagined in an older 8-bit style. Seeing Inti Creates realize their 16-bit creations in a simplified way provides some awesome design insight, especially if you played and beat Azure Striker Gunvolt before playing Mighty Gunvolt (which is, by the way, the order you should take the two games on). In fact, it's likely you won't enjoy Mighty Gunvolt as much if you play it before Azure Striker. A lot will be lost on you if you do. But perhaps the greatest juxtaposition between Azure and Mighty rests in their respective stories, and how they're delivered. Azure Striker Gunvolt has a nicely translated, expertly localized story that reads naturally. Mighty Gunvolt, on the other hand, is rife with 8-bit era misspellings and terrible grammar. It's entirely intentional, and it's a really nice touch. Reading the text gave me a good chuckle, and harkened me back to a time in my life when I was much younger, blowing on NES cartridges and watching Ninja Gaiden cutscenes with horror (they were scary!). Pros It's free!Solid, old-school gameplayAwesome enemy designsMultiple playable characters Cons Incredibly brief It's hard to complain about something available for free, especially when it puts a smile on your face like Mighty Gunvolt does, even if it lasts for under a half an hour, and even if you never go back to it again after that. Mighty Gunvolt is short, but sweet. It's not incredibly difficult, but it's not necessarily meant to be, either. It's an experience more than a full-fledged game, a taste of what Inti Creates is capable of when they strip everything away and go back to the 8-bit style and aesthetic they proved to know so much about when creating Mega Man 9 and 10. Plus, you get to play as Beck from Mighty No. 9 long before that game actually comes out (though not in his native state). Talk about a huge bonus.", "date": "Aug. 31, 2014,"}
