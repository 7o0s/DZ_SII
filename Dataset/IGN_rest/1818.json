In reality, its poorly-scaled world, the PSVRs limitation to forward-facing play, and the slippery nature of its still relatively fast-paced combat mean Doom 3: VR Edition is more often a demon-grade headache than a joyride through hell. Both its original campaign and its two DLCs are unaltered, and as a result unsuited for VR, especially when you compare them to modern PSVR shooters like Blood & Truth or The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners that show what games truly built for the medium can do. 17 years later and Doom 3 still stacks up as one of id Softwares greatest hits. Thats thanks to its fantastic arsenal of guns, terrifying enemies, and engaging level design. Packing all of its action into the relatively limited PSVR headset and making it play as well as it does with the delightful but similarly limited gun-shaped Aim Controller could not possibly have been a simple task. It runs great on a technical level, text is remarkably clear to read, and the guns are just as weighty and fun to shoot as in the original  especially when the optional Aim Controller thumps with every blast of your pump shotgun. I felt a sense of tense exhilaration whenever I shined my flashlight into the dark corners of a room, often followed by a startling jolt as a demon popped out of the shadows or through a doorway at me. These constant jumpscares work as well in VR in 2021 as they did on-screen in 2004. Furthermore, theres an indescribable level of satisfaction that comes with blasting a Cacodemon with a plasma rifle or sawing apart a zombie with a chainsaw when your entire Aim Controller is rumbling from top to bottom. Its added weight brings an extra something special to the quality of two-handed weapons in VR, and Doom 3 is the perfect game to showcase that in. However, this port immediately reveals some of the key flaws of just taking a campaign that plays great in 2D and dropping it into virtual reality. Right off the bat, the scale of the world around you is noticeably weird. Even when you adjust the height settings to your real-life height, the terrain itself never feels appropriately sized to accommodate you. At one point, I towered over everything. Then, after holding the Options button down and resetting the view, Id apparently been sized down to a small child. Doom 3's strafe-heavy movement is natural in 2D, but nauseating in VR. Meanwhile, NPCs and even the enemies you fight are irregularly scaled. Its hard to see from outside, but in VR the disproportion between NPCs and your field of view is almost comical  like youve stepped into an episode of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, except the kids are face-eating demons. This is especially apparent when comparing an NPCs size to that of your weapons, which look huge in your hands and often block your field of view unless youre holding your controller in your lap. Ironically, doing so worked much better with the standard DualShock 4 controller than with the Aim Controller, which isnt nearly as comfortable held at waist-height. Another major issue is the way Doom 3 wants you to move during combat. In later zones, swarms of bite-sized Trites, Cherubs, and Maggots  giant spiders, flying babies, and two-headed monstrosities  try to surround you in close physical proximity, which makes it paramount that you strafe around and keep your distance. That sort of FPS movement feels natural with a keyboard or a gamepad, but is just plain nauseating in the PSVR headset. Theres no option to move via teleportation, either, and doing any kind of strafing or backing up with Doom 3s super slippery movement controls is an instant recipe for motion sickness. While theres an option to activate snap-turns and screen-blocking vignettes that cover your peripheral vision whenever you turn a corner, playing with those features turned on is an inconvenience when youre tasked with fighting literal waves of demons spawning in every direction. As a result, its easy to find yourself aiming your controller directly downward and frantically holding your trigger to clear your path of enemies while skittishly darting left and right. This happens too often, and its neither comfortable nor fun. All of these frustrations would be easier to move past if Doom 3 had more moments of VR interactivity, but its 10-hour campaign is mostly packed with fast-paced combat because thats simply how the original was designed. Your hands are bolted to your gun at all times, and your only actions are move, attack, and occasionally push buttons on a computer screen. Once again, this style of play works great outside of VR, but the lack of variety in its interactions beyond this is tiring  even when your real-life hands are plastered to the Aim Controller. Other Aim-friendly games like Farpoint, Firewall: Zero Hour, and even Borderlands 2 VR feel more tailored to the limitations of PSVR, whereas Doom 3: VR Edition often forgets to accommodate those limitations at all. Cutscenes are also a major issue in Doom 3: VR Edition. These are completely flat, two-dimensional scenes that play out in front of you, and they pull you out of the action entirely. These scenes do set up a few key pieces of the story of Doom 3, especially the bits about the appropriately menacing villain, Dr. Betruger. However, itd be nice if there were an option to skip them  or better yet, experience the same exposition face-to-face with those characters in VR instead of having to sit through a bunch of flat scenes. A PSVR adaptation of a classic as highly esteemed as Doom 3 sounds great in concept, but this port is hurt by its stubborn adherence to the original. It refuses to rebalance its keyboard and gamepad-friendly demon slaying for motion controls, while also adding very little outside of fights that demand you to experience its world in virtual reality. While a few of its slower, tenser moments do highlight some of VRs charm, they feel almost coincidental when youre then forced to strafe around in intense 360-degree firefights that dont feel very good while locked into the forward-facing PSVR headset. What results is a port that pales in comparison to other, better shooters truly meant for VR  or even the experience of playing Doom 3 on a flat screen.", "date": "April 8, 2021,"}
