Dance Central and Just Dance aren't pulling in Call of Duty records by any stretch, but the growing genre is on a massive, millions-selling upswing. I mistook Rhythm Party for a crummy casual cash-in trying to take advantage of the explosive success. The Kinect Arcade dance game is more than that. Rhythm Party goes out of its way to do something different with its genre, which is more than many shooters can say for themselves. WHAT IS GOING ON? Even if it misses the point in a few ways, Rhythm Party's creative spark inspires me to do a little jig. This isn't another motion game about mimicry -- it's about liberty. As the music progresses, colored circles drift into rings. Hitting the rings at the right time earns points, builds a multiplier, and generally keeps you in tune with the tune. Elite Beat Agent veterans will recognize the familiar setup: Rings appear across from each other, at the same time, and at various speeds. The cool thing about Rhythm Party is that you're free to hit the markers in any way you want. This is about freestyle dance. At first I was just punching the orbs as they appeared, but I eventually started experimenting. I kicked high, punched low, jumped to hit them with my head, swayed my arms through sequential spots, and otherwise improvised my way to high score success. I was surprised to see not only that doing whatever I wanted worked, but that Rhythm Party recognized my experimenting and rewarded it with trick and style bonuses. I felt fantastic about my moves, but after watching the video recording play back I don't know that I'd call that dancing. Build a big combo, get sweet robot parts. Naturally. At any rate, my flailing was hysterical, so it's a pity there's no way to share your shame -- Rhythm Party lets you save replays, but you can't do anything other than re-watch them. Movement gets particularly taxing on higher difficulties, though there's also a stronger sense of rhythm to the songs there. Early challenges only let you hit so many circles at a time, so you're left using one or two appendages at a time. Using your entire body can get out-of-control fun if you succumb to the goofiness of it all. Rhythm Party's primary weakness is its set list, which is as inconsistent as it is limited. There are only 10 songs total, some of which are Dance Dance Revolution re-hashes, and there's no real theme. It's a confusing mess of Vanilla Ice, Lady Gaga, and the Village People next to soulful R&B and fist-pumpin' J-pop. This leads to the next major concern: What's that downloadable content option doing on the main menu? Oh, like we don't already know. CLOSING COMMENTS What's not to like about a rhythm game that gives you robot body armor as you build a great multiplier? Well, OK, let's not generalize: Rhythm Party has a weird, short-sighted set list that doesn't give you much to enjoy. There's a lot here to like, certainly, especially because dancing however you please is a freeing feeling. Even if it can't keep a beat the entire time, Rhythm Party bothers to shake up a genre still in its infancy. That's commendable and inspirational.
