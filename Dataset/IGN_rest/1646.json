The opening cinematic, where the Sith appear out of nowhere and reclaim Korriban, introduces you to the conflict between the Empire and the Republic. Then you choose which faction you're going to play for, and another cinematic sets the tone of your alignment. For Empire players, the focus is on power, control, and anger. The Republic cinematic portrays a need to take back what's lost through planning and tenacity. The cinematics are spectacularly compelling and make me wish Blur, the creators, were contracted to do a feature-length film. Then you're kicked back to a menu screen to create your character. The creator is quite flexible, with a wide range of customization options unique to each race, but you're limited only to strictly humanoid races and a few rather similar body sizes (males at least get a ~fat~ option  female characters don't even get that). For a universe with a vast number of established intelligent races of all shapes and sizes, this feels limited. You can't, for example, play as a Jawa or a droid. In the grand scheme of things, it's a minor annoyance though. Star Wars: The Old Republic Video Review The classic scrolling yellow text of the films begins immediately after you've created your character, accompanied by the Star Wars theme. There is, in my mind, no better way BioWare could have kicked off your adventure. The text briefly explains who you are and in what context you're entering the galaxy. It's unique to each class and, along with the cinematic that follows, sets you on your way to making a name for yourself. This is where inexperienced players will hit a figurative force-field. The Old Republic Wiki GuideStarter GuideDatacron LocationsClasses & Skill BuilderEaster EggsQuests Guide The Old Republic has no structured tutorial. Rather, there's a tip system that offers help about an aspect of gameplay whenever the context calls for it. In any other MMO, that would probably suffice, but the moment you set foot in The Old Republic you are faced with quest-givers, future quest-givers with grey quest icons, class-specific story areas that you can't enter, vendors, dialogue trees, half a dozen abilities and hostile NPCs who will attack on sight. That's a whole lot to take in within the span of about five minutes, and while many of the systems that The Old Republic uses are familiar to MMO players, I can't help but think how overwhelmed I was by my first MMO, and just how much more The Old Republic throws at the you from the get-go. But BioWare gives you an incentive to get over that initial hump by giving you a sense of purpose and the opportunity to breathe personality into your character. In the amount of time it takes to get through the first dialogue bit, you may be tempted to proudly announce to anyone nearby that you're ~the most evil Sith ever,~ or ~a Bounty Hunter with a heart of gold and an eye for credits.~ From there, BioWare gives you hundreds more opportunities to reinforce your identity (or flip-flop entirely). This makes learning the complex game systems feel like more of a side-effect of role-playing your character than a requirement to move forward. The complex game systems won't seem so complex if you've played an MMO in the last decade. Combat is based around selecting a target and using an ability to attack it. The Old Republic sets itself apart from many MMOs by removing the auto-attack that initiates when your character is set to beat up a target. Instead, each class has a basic attack that has to be activated manually whenever you want to use it. It requires no class resource, and in the case of the Jedi Knight and the Sith Warrior it actually helps build the resource, somewhat similar to Rage for the warrior class in World of Warcraft. This quest on Voss is one of the best on offer. I'm not a huge fan of the system. While it does away with the passive gameplay of the auto-attack, it introduces the problem of forcing you to fill every gap between cooldowns with a basic attack, and to constantly pepper it into every attack rotation. The attack doesn't do anything unique  even the Knight and Warrior get other abilities that add just as much resource  and the damage scales with gear at the same rate as other abilities, except abilities get significant bonus damage and usually a secondary function. For some classes the basic attack might trigger another ability, but invariably there are other abilities that act as triggers as well. So the sole purpose of the basic attack is to add a slight amount of damage to gaps in an attack rotation, or to give you something to do while you wait for your class resource to regenerate. It doesn't make for more fun gameplay in the long run and just means you'll be pushing a single key a whole lot. While it can get a little annoying having to babysit a single button that doesn't add any true depth, the rest of the skill set makes up for it. The nature of the Advanced Class system means that two very different style of character will share many of the same skills, but by virtue of the skills they don't share, they function in wildly different ways. The best example of this is the Sith Sorcerer, a ranged damage dealer/healer versus the Sith Assassin, a melee damage dealer/tank capable of going into stealth. They both split from the Inquisitor, so they both have Overload, which knocks nearby enemies back. As a Sorcerer the skill is a powerful means of getting some distance on an attacker, while an Assassin can use it from stealth to completely disorient an enemy player or get them way out of position. While these abilities certainly do their job against an AI-controlled enemy, against a player in one of The Old Republic's Warzones is where they really shine. This is true especially of Huttball, a deranged version of American football mixed with rugby, with acid pools and plumes of fire scattered across a multi-level arena, is the most original and compelling PvP map I've seen. It's the only map that currently allows two teams of the same faction to fight against each other, so for servers with population imbalances it's also the most frequently played of the three Warzones and according to in-game chat and forums, people are getting sick of it. I'm not one of those people. Huttball's emphasis on teamwork, communication, planning and clever use of the environment set it apart from Voidstar and Alderaan's emphasis on straightforward combat. A look at the space missions. Regardless of the Warzone, The Old Republic has a brilliant method of making every class role viable. In traditional PvP, tanky characters  usually a central part of PvE group combat encounters  become little more than a free, albeit slow, kill for damage-dealing classes, or a flag-carrier in capture-the-flag modes. It's the only role in PvP that has traditionally struggled to find its niche. In The Old Republic, besides being excellent Huttball-carriers, tanks are able to redirect an ally's damage to them and reduce the damage an enemy deals to everyone but the tank himself. This can make a massive difference to the lifespan of squishier characters and makes tanks an important part of a solid team's makeup. The Old Republic takes note of the reduced and redirected damage in the background, along with the amount of damage each player deals and heals, the number of kills they are involved in, and how often they are involved in attacking and defending objectives, and allocates Badges to players whenever they reach a certain threshold throughout the match. Badges are turned into one of the game's many currencies at the end of the match, rewarding those who contributed to a battle. In my experience, the system rewards performance well, and I've only seen one person standing idle in dozens and dozens of matches, which to me reflects that the Badge system is effective at encouraging players to participate instead of trying to rack up the meager default rewards. Early speeders look like giant noses and lawn-mowers. The later ones look much nicer. Class roles in PvE group encounters are much more simplistic, and the encounters themselves  at least prior to the level cap  fairly standard. The more interesting ones take place primarily in Flashpoints, which are instanced and heavily scripted. The first Flashpoint for each faction is a particularly excellent showcase of BioWare's signature branching storylines. Later Flashpoints don't emphasize story as strongly and play more akin to instances in other games, which makes repeated runs less exciting. That's not a big deal, though, because you'll get plenty of storytelling through questing. The quality of the story is very good  you get opportunities to threaten, extort, maim and murder, or be totally nice and live and let live. Light and dark side options spring up regularly, and occasionally foregoing the obvious light or dark side choice early on in a conversation will reveal an extra opportunity. Force-alignment is mostly cosmetic (you can get equal or better gear through different avenues) but can influence what your companions, AI-controlled allies who aid you in battle, think of you. 12", "date": "Jan. 6, 2012,"}
