This is the first time Apple has put the Pro designation on its phones but what has it added to make this $999 phone worthy of such a title? Well, quite a lot actually: its new triple-lens camera that includes an ultra-wide view, one of the brightest OLED displays available, and an included 18W fast charger, just to name a few. After years of lagging, the iPhone 11 Pro has not only caught up, but also leaped above and beyond, its Android phone rivals in a few areas. iPhone 11 Pro  Design and Features Outwardly, the iPhone 11 Pro isnt a radical redesign over the previous iPhone XS. In fact, Apples latest handset is built on the same overall all-screen (with the conspicuous camera notch at the top), glass-backed design as the iPhone X, which was introduced in 2017. But this iteration introduces one hard-to-miss change with the first triple-camera array on the back. This triangular arrangement makes the camera bump on the back of the new iPhone a significantly larger square, as opposed to the narrow vertical arrangement found on the X and XS models. The good news is the new bump isnt nearly as tall as it might look in photos. The whole assembly, the three lenses and the surrounding hump, barely stand above the rest of the phone, and I would say the new bump is actually shorter than or equal in height to the one found on the iPhone X or iPhone XS. iPhone 11 Pro  Camera When it came to the iPhone 11 Pros cameras, I expected the improvements would be focused around the new ultrawide camera. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much the image quality from all of the cameras has improved year over year. The main wide-angle 26mm f1.8 camera now has a slightly improved sensor while the telephoto sensor sits behind a slightly faster 52mm f2.0 lens. The front-facing cameras, meanwhile, have been upgraded with dual 12MP sensors. And of course, theres also the brand-new ultrawide camera with a 13mm f2.4 lens. Beyond those hardware specs, Apple has improved its image-processing software to produce wider dynamic range, richer colors, and a deeper level of contrast. Its a drastic improvement over previous models as the images dont look quite as flat as they used to. Compared to the images you can get from a Google Pixel 3 or Samsung Note 10 Plusarguably the best Android phones for photographythe photos I look with the iPhone 11 Pro look just as good now. Another big improvement to the iPhone 11 Pros camera is Night Mode, which produces better low-light photography. Night Mode turns on automatically when you try to shoot in the dark and it basically extends your exposure to somewhere between a full second and three seconds, depending on conditions. As the camera is taking in more light, the resulting photos look brighter overall and they also reveal details that would have otherwise been shrouded in darkness. Just like a regular long-exposure image, if anything moves through the frame it will appear as a blur natural blur. Thankfully, the image processing doesnt add any strange artifacting or compilation errors in your final image. Compared to Nightscape on the OnePlus 7 Pro, Night Sight on the Google Pixel 3, and Night on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, the iPhone 11 Pro does an effective job of producing more natural-looking photos. It doesnt quite look like a flat long-exposure photo or surreal like an HDR-processed image, but a pleasant composition somewhere in between. One disappointing thing about Night Mode is its only available while shooting with either the main wide-angle camera or the telephoto lens, and not the ultrawide or front-facing cameras. It would make sense for Apple to add this feature to the ultrawide camera for late-night landscape photos. The 4K 60fps videos you can shoot on the iPhone 11 Pro also look more stunning now Apple has enabled extended dynamic range for video recording. Like the images this phone outputs, movies shot on this camera just pop more thanks to a wider level of contrast and color depth. The iPhone 11 Pro has one other camera trick called Deep Fusion, which promises to produce the high-resolution images by creating a composite photo from a series of frames taken both before and after you press the shutter button. This feature isnt out yet, but well update this review when the new camera mode is available. iPhone 11 Pro  Battery Life The iPhone 11 Pro offers some pretty impressive battery life. With regular usage, I easily found myself finishing the day with over 50% of my charge still intact. Heavier use, with a mix of gaming and watching videos on my commute, lowered my end-of-day battery status to 30% to 40%. Both figures are pretty impressive for a smartphone with only a 5.8-inch screen. You could easily get through two days of conservative use with the iPhone 11 Pro and not worry about running dry when you need you it most. If you do need to charge in a hurry, though, you can: the included 18W fast charger can have a near-dead phone get back to about half charge after plugging in for just 30 mins. Meanwhile, a full-hour charge will get you somewhere above a 75% charge. Fast charging has been available on Apples handsets since the introduction of the iPhone X and iPhone 8, but its about time the company started including a beefier brick than the old 5W charger. Naturally, the iPhone 11 line is compatible with Qi wireless chargers as well, but its at a slower rate than plugging in. Purchasing Guide The iPhone 11 Pro is available starting for $999 while the larger iPhone 11 Pro Max retails for $1,099. Just to note again, both of these base models come with only 64GB of storage and 4GB of memory, which certainly looks disappointing next to the Android phones you can get for less. The currently discounted $799 Samsung Galaxy S10 nets you with a similar triple camera array while offering you double the memory and storage. Meanwhile, the recently announced OnePlus 7T only costs $599 to offer everything its rivals have plus an 1,000-nit display. The $699 iPhone 11 may look tempting with the same processor, but know that it has an inferior LCD display, one fewer camera lens, and no included fast charger (which really should have been included). These new specs, along with drastically improved image/video quality and extended battery life, better justifies the price gulf between the Pro and the regular iPhone 11 compared to last year's models. There are plenty of phones you should consider before the iPhone 11 Pro if youre looking for the best specs for your money. But as a whole package Apples latests handset stands out as just a really well put together phone with a strikingly bright screen, much improved image and video quality, and access to the best mobile gaming library available right now. If you prefer iOS or are just locked into Apples Messages platform this is the best iPhone to get. And if youre jumping ship from Android, I think youll be really pleased with this new device and all the improvements iOS 13 has made to privacy and new features like Dark Mode. Normally when Apple puts out a similar-looking iPhone for the third year in a row its a sign of a minor upgrade, but the iPhone 11 Pro is different and deserving of the new name. In everything from performance to its dazzling display quality to its vastly upgraded camera system, its a seriously phenomenal device and a big step up for the iPhone line. The images and video you can get out of this flagship Apple device have never looked better. Lastly, battery life has become even less of a worry, with up to three days of regular usage or almost two days of heavy use. The $999 starting price for an iPhone 11 Pro is undeniably high, but it feels better justified than ever before.", "date": "Sept. 29, 2019"}
