MOGA's recent Rebel is quite good, and Mad Catz's new C.T.R.L.i controller seems a strong contender at first glance, with better overall build quality and a lower entry price. However, a familiar problem from the earlier MFi pads rears its head once more, diminishing my expected recommendation. Like the Rebel, the C.T.R.L.i takes obvious inspiration from Xbox controllers, and it fits similarly in your hands. While this Bluetooth-connected iPhone and iPad controller isn't quite on par with the ultra-refined Xbox One gamepad, it feels weightier and more premium than MOGA's offering. The dual analog sticks have a nice grip to them, the face and shoulder buttons all prove responsive, and it doesn't feel like a cheap toy. That's sadly still a rare quality in this space. With the iPad, the C.T.R.L.i simply connects wirelessly, and you'll play compatible games with it much like you would a console. For iPhone and iPod touch, however, the controller comes with a detachable plastic travel clip, which is easily secured to the top via a removable knob. This lets you mount your smaller-screened device directly to the controller, and while the actual pairing is still handled via Bluetooth, the sensation is that of having a makeshift portable gaming console. It's not as elegant an option as the Rebel's foldout arm, which has no detachable parts and doesn't add much bulk in the process, but it worksunless you have an iPhone 6. Sadly, the design of the cushioned grip means it puts pressure on the iPhone 6's bottom volume button when placed in the middle, so you'll have to mount the phone off-center to actually use it. That's not a huge deal, and the iPhone 6 isn't officially listed as compatible likely due to this very reason, but Mad Catz should still revise the design and offer free clip swaps for buyers. Ignoring Apple's current flagship due to a small design conflict would be silly and shortsighted. Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad: Essential Stats Manufacturer Mad Catz Price $60 In the Box Gamepad, Adjustable Mount Clip, 2xAAA Batteries Minimum OS Required iOS 7 or later Connectivity Bluetooth Unlike previous MFi controllers with built-in rechargeable batteries, the C.T.R.L.i goes the antiquated route of relying on two AAA batteries. But with a promised 40 hours of power, the expense may be slow to accrueI played several hours myself, and the handy companion app said the batteries still had nearly 90% juice left. And there's a definite trade-off in controller price. At $60, the Mad Catz pad undercuts the Rebel by $20 and launches cheaper than all previous options. By and large, I had a strong experience using the C.T.R.L.i, whether it was with console ports like BioShock and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, or top mobile picks like Oceanhorn, Respawnables, and Impossible Road. When playing games that primarily focused on analog stick-driven action, it was smooth sailing. Switch to the d-pad, however, and a big issue emerges: there's a small, but noticeable dead zone when you lightly tap in certain directions. A subtle press right or down often doesn't register at all in the game, which can decimate precision-focused genres. In games like King of Fighters '98, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Traps n' Gemstones, I clearly noticed the lack of input fidelity, which is something that early pads like the Logitech PowerShell and MOGA Ace Power also struggled with. Pros Sturdy, weighty buildConvertible design Cons Unresponsive d-padHolds iPhone 6 off-centerNeeds AAA batteries The Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i makes a strong case for itself in most regards, but sadly blows its potential on an unresponsive directional pad. If you're planning to play mostly 3D, analog-centric affairs, you might not mind the occasional forceful d-pad press. But anyone eager to dig back through retro classicsand/or play fighting and platform gameswill be better off dealing with a virtual d-pad over this real one.", "date": "Nov. 5, 2014,"}
