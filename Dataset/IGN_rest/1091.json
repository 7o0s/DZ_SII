Fortunately, youre a precocious little tyke, able to escape from your nursery and set off on a quest to find her. Among The Sleep is a distinctive experience, and while it doesnt fully explore how playing as a child really changes the way you interact with the world, it more than succeeds in creating a wonderfully eerie atmosphere full of childlike anxiety, and along the way tackles a serious subject in a darkly poignant manner. The journey ahead winds through an increasingly surreal and sinister environments, which is actually a big part of what Among The Sleep is trying to achieve. Wardrobes become never-ending labyrinths in which to hide; playgrounds stretch into vast wildernesses with a gnarled playground. At first I thought it was just a night terror, but its really a psychological landscape. It manipulates perspective in clever ways and transforms everyday locations into hellish mindscapes that, in some way, reflect the terrible events that once took place there. Its part psychological horror, but more interestingly its also part therapy  a walking cure, of sorts. Youre only two years old and havent yet mastered language (in fact, one of Among the Sleeps nice touches is that all in-game text is written in an alien script). Youre ill-equipped to cope with whats going on around you. I read the entire game as a way of working through past trauma, mastering the world and working back to the source of this pain. Its a great idea, with more introspection than your typical first-person horror adventure, though the environments lack sufficient detail to make them deeply impactful. Despite being set amid chaotic architecture and disorientating landscapes, the underlying structure is fairly simple and straightforward. In order to be reunited with your mother, you must retrieve four precious memories of her; they have been scattered across weird environments, including a dark cabin beside a murky lake and a violently distorted version of your own home. The puzzle solving also remains simple throughout  retrieving objects, finding keys, pressing switches  yet I still found it sufficiently engaging due to its unique perspective. As a toddler, the world towers above you and slowly transforms: doors become obstacles, people shift into giants, and a chest of drawers turns into a makeshift staircases simply by pulling out the drawers. It never really progresses beyond this, but its short playtime  around three hours  stops just short of it becoming tedious. So many recent horror games have instilled fear by making you feel helpless  Amnesia, Outlast, Daylight  either stripping away your powers or denying you the ability to fight back entirely. Among The Sleep takes a similar approach, but the mechanics it establishes early on are never fully explored. You can hide in small spaces, sneak under tables and beds, and crawl much faster than you can walk or run (though this, of course, takes away the ability to use your hands). Theres definitely potential there, but Among The Sleep lacks the variety or imagination to really use them effectively. In the end, their main contribution is to provide a novel perspective on a familiar type of experience. Nowhere is this more keenly felt than your teddy bear, which accompanies you throughout. He can walk and talk, but hes also a form of safety. When scared, you can clutch him tight and he will emit a familiar warm glow. It has the potential to be not only a great mechanic but also a powerful metaphor, but its rarely used as little more than a cute, fuzzy torch. The gameplay falters most when the central threat finally makes an appearance. The nightmarish figure which presumably took your mother remains fairly anonymous until the latter half of Among The Sleep's three-hour playtime. Its a slow build, but one I found to be really effective and, without treading into spoiler territory, appropriate for the type of story it's trying to unfold. But these encounters, while initially tense, are probably the weakest moments when they should be some of the most dramatic and effective. Its when the most is expected from you, but unfortunately its gameplay systems dont feel quite deep enough to carry these sections. Sometimes you must quickly avoid the creature, but its hard to really get a sense of its patrol patterns and the very act of hiding can even become frustrating  the mechanic of dragging doors closed isnt always reliable or effective. Its a shame, as I think some of the mechanics Among The Sleep has at its disposal  many of which stem from its protagonist being a small child  have the potential to support a much richer, more diverse experience. Instead, theyre always secondary to the plot, which is undoubtedly the real focus  consequently, my success felt more due to perseverance than skill. Pros Unique perspectiveAtmosphericPsychological intrigue Cons Mechanics under-usedFrustrating stealth sections Among The Sleep is a horror experience thats more interested in exploring the nature of childhood trauma than in providing big scares (though there are still a couple to be had), and thats no bad thing. Its story is sparse and the impact of its conclusion isnt fully worked through, yet its worth playing for the way in which it manipulates perspective and transforms everyday locations into nightmarish reflections. The mechanics are underused and are even frustrating at times, but its psychological approach and poignant conclusion distinguish it from a lot of the games that simply resort to shock tactics.", "date": "June 5, 2014,"}
