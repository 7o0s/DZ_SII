Around me shimmered a constellation of gorgeous environmental art, strong mission variety, and impressive tactical depth. But the more I saw, the more I felt weighed down by the gravity of uninspired story presentation, and gameplay elements that sound better on paper than they are in practice. The 20-hour campaign launched me into orbit around an Event Horizon-esque expedition exploring a mysterious area of space called The Black Zone, on the trail of a supercarrier that went missing while investigating a possible alien threat. Across 15 missions, I was treated to a moderately engaging story with some cool twists, but no especially outstanding or memorable characters. Starship Troopers alum Dina Meyer gave a respectable, grounded performance as the expeditions de facto leader, but most of the rest of the cast (including Fireflys Ron Glass and Battlestars Aaron Douglas) sounded like they just came out of hypersleep and werent entirely aware of what was going on. Plot details were mostly delivered Captains Log-style, with disconnected monologues between missions, stymying chances for character interaction and making the story feel less alive and personal. The fleet I was to command through this narrative was anchored by persistent hero-unit capital ships, complete with voice-acted captains (including those mentioned above) and a host of potent special abilities. Joining them along the way were just over a dozen gradually-unlocked constructible ships, ranging from small, scrappy fighter squadrons to impressive, photon cannon-equipped bruisers that stood as near equals with my heroes. Each ship type has three upgrade slots for damage, armor, and speed, and my primary carrier was eventually able to earn several tiers of progressively powerful perks, adding up to a satisfying supply of fleet customization. Unfortunately, these choices didnt have much of an impact in the inconsistently paced real-time battles ahead of me. Combat uses a rigid rock-paper-scissors formula based on the type of a ships hullSmall, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Buildings. Most ships weapons can only damage two or three of these, and plink almost entirely harmlessly off of all others. There are no generalists, and upgrades only play to bolstering the strengths of a given ship typenever shoring up its weaknesses. I could have 12 ships with no damage bonus against Medium targets, and they would take far longer to kill a single Medium enemy than one friendly ship that did have such a bonus. While this encouraged fleet diversity, it also had the unpleasant side-effect of forcing me to micromanage every single one of my units almost constantly. I spent most of the larger battles with the action paused, calling out individual targets for each ship, since the unit AI isnt smart enough to prioritize foes its guns can actually make a dent in. Even on the lowest difficulty, manual target selection seemed mandatory. The really cool clickable abilities (like cloaking and EMP missiles) that differentiate each ship type qualitatively take a back seat to this constant target management. Control groups can alleviate this problem somewhat, but those with an allergy to intense micromanagement shouldnt even enter the kitchen where Ancient Space has been cooking. The strategic side is relatively shallow in comparison. There are resource-generating nodes on each map that can be tapped with space stations and upgraded with static defenses, but in most missions, they were simply unnecessary. My resource counters ticked up at such a generous rate that I rarely needed to build a structure to keep my fleet at the population cap. I could certainly plop down buildings as I went along, but doing so only ever seemed to drag out the mission length for very little economic reward. This removed all considerations related to map control that may have made certain missions more interesting, and my only real concern outside of combat was determining which units to bring to a fight. This isnt to say that the missions arent enjoyable. No two in the campaign had me facing the exact same objectives, and some of them were genuinely tense and rewarding experiences. In particular, missions that charged me with defending a static point or running an enemy blockade required quick thinking, good unit synergy, and smart use of capital ship abilities in order to come out victorious. One such scenario involved covering a transport evacuation, Battlestar Galactica-style, while under heavy fire from all directions. Things came right down to the wire, with all of my units battered or destroyed, plugging a bottleneck in a desperate final stand as the last civilian ship made its getaway. If only it played as good is it looks. On the other hand, missions that required me to assault a fortified position quickly became frustrating, drawn-out slugfests until I unlocked the late-campaign tech needed to take down buildings and capital ships quickly. The fragility of many of my fleets core units, and the sluggish pace at which I could replace them, meant I was spending most offensive missions prodding the enemy installation, losing all of my fighters in the first 30 seconds (in spite of healing abilities), and being forced to gun my impulse engines in full reverse and repopulate. These situations werent difficult because I made bad decisions; they were difficult because I didnt have the patience to continually redirect and otherwise babysit all of my cannon fodder for the duration of a long fight. The missing polish in both the story and mechanics felt like a shame, considering the imaginative and consistently beautiful level art and ship designs seemed to hint at what could have been a much more epic and satisfying tale. Every map is constructed with soaring, titan-scaled asteroids and alien ruins. Friendly and enemy hulls look bolted together with the loving care of an art team who had a deeper understanding for and appreciation of this universe than I was ever given the opportunity to develop. The scenario-based challenge mode certainly didnt give me that, either. Considering that this is a single-player only game, its disappointing more care wasnt given to making me feel like a part of this universe. Pros Fun defensive missionsStrong unit varietyBeautiful environment art Cons Tedious micromanagementDull story presentation You could do a lot worse for a sci-fi RTS than Ancient Space, but you could also do a lot better. The excessive micromanagement and often vexing pace of combat tarnish the tactical depth created by cool officer abilities and unit variety. The campaign oscillates between enjoyable, and just plain annoying. Multiplayer or a custom skirmish mode might have picked up some of the slack, but both are absent. Entering this particular warpgate is far from inadvisable, but also far from essential.", "date": "Oct. 6, 2014,"}
