And for the most part, the Horipad Wireless feels like a best-of compilation of what else is out there right now: it's solid and sturdy, has great-feeling analog sticks, and thankfully features a rechargeable battery. It even comes with a foldout stand for your iPhone. Despite sharing a name with Hori controllers on other platforms, the Horipad Wireless for iOS has its own unique design. Well, ~unique~ isn't really the word: it looks like a bulkier version of an older DualShock pad, just as many third-party dual-analog tend to. But while this Bluetooth-connected option may not have the most original design, the Horipad has full, pleasantly contoured grips that make it feel comfortable in your palms. For fans of the classic DualShock design, the Horipad Wireless has parallel analog sticks, similar to the SteelSeries Stratus XL, while some other recent iOS pads (like the Mad Catz C.T.R.L.i and MOGA Rebel) have offset, Xbox-inspired sticks. And thankfully, the sticks are super precise, making this an ideal controller for nearly anything you can throw at it, including twitch games that require quick, tiny inputs. The d-pad is also very solid (albeit raised and rounded like the rest, per Apple's specifications), making the Horipad a good pick for the handful of iOS fighting games with gamepad support, as well as the larger selection of platformers and retro ports. It wouldn't be my first choice for shooters, however, as R2 and L2 here are shoulder buttons rather than triggers. That doesn't mean it's ineffective at all, but if you're looking for a satisfying squeeze when firing off a round, the quick click experienced instead might disappoint. Still, the overall functionality of the Horipad Wireless is quite strong, and the battery life is promised at 20 hoursI played numerous games across several hours and didn't tap out the charge. Without an attachment for the iPhone or iPod touch, the Horipad is best utilized for iPad games, but I have to commend Hori for including a tiny, useful stand for pocket devices. It folds flat with something of a tweezers-inspired design, but can be pulled out into a ~V~ shape to hold an iPhone. Playing at a distance from a few-inch display isn't ideal, but it could be a really handy perk when traveling. While Hori's controller is nicely weighted and feels sturdy, my biggest complaint actually comes with the glossy plastic used for the entire design. Simply put, right out of the box, it was the most slippery controller I'd ever tried holding onto. That doesn't end up being a huge issue, surprisingly: with a bit of play, your natural hand oils will coat the controller, reducing the slippery feeling. But then you've got a wealth of very visible smudges all around the device. Strangely, this is the rare device that performs better the grosser it looks. Pros Great analog sticksSturdy buildBuilt-in battery Cons Slippery sheenFingerprint magnet The Horipad Wireless definitely falls on the premium end of the current crop of iOS gamepads, coming in at $80but that price gets you a full-sized and mostly well-built pad with a rechargeable battery. Other pads may offer a better value (the Micro C.T.R.L.i) or more premium finish (the Stratus XL), but the Horipad Wireless comes darn close to being the complete package for those willing to shell out a little more for it.", "date": "Feb. 12, 2015,"}
