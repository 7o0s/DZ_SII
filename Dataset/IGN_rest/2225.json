The MSI GS65 Stealth not only boasts Intel's latest silicon, but it has a Max-Q tuned version of the RTX 2080 as well, and it's also the first gaming machine I've tested with a 240Hz display. It feels like last month I was giddy over 144Hz displays, and now here I am, staring at a 240Hz display and I'm not sure how to feel about it. All that impressive tech comes at a price though, with the version of the GS65 Stealth I've been testing costing just under $3,400. That's not cheap, especially when you look at recent gaming laptops I've reviewed, such as Acer's Predator Triton 500 that's priced at $2,499. Or the Lenovo Legion Y740, that's just under $2,000. Here are the specifications of the MSI GS65 Stealth I am specifically evaluating here: Model: MSI GS65 Stealth (9SG-666US) Display: 15.6-inch IPS 240Hz Full HD (1920x1080) Processor: Intel Core i9-9880H at 2.3GHz (16M Cache, up to 4.80 GHz) Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 with Max-Q (8GB GDDR6) Memory: 32GB DDR4 OS: Windows 10 Pro Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD Webcam: 720p Ports: 3 x USB 3.2 Gen 2, 1 x HDMI 2.0, 1 x miniDisplayPort, 1 x Ethernet, 1 x Thunderbolt 3.1 port, 1 x audio out, 1 x audio in Connectivity: 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.0 Dimensions: 15.08 x 10.24 x 0.69-inches (WxDxH) Weight: 4.19 pounds Price: (as tested) $3,399 MSI GS65  Design and Features I've always appreciated just how thin and small MSI is able to make its gaming laptops, and the GS65 is no different. Even with its 15.6-inch FHD display, the GS65's housing measures 15.08 x 10.24 x 0.69-inches and weighs 4.19 pounds. Any laptop that's only 0.69-inches thick is impressive, let alone one that packs as much power as the GS65. As is typically the case for MSI, the entire housing is black with gold highlights around the edges of the lid (chamfered edges are still a thing, apparently), the exhaust grille on either side of the housing, the power button, and the dragon shield logo on the lid. The first thing I noticed when I opened the GS65 was the extra large touchpad. The sticker on the housing claims the touchpad is 35% larger, and in use, it feels even bigger. It's smooth for gesture use, but most appealing to me is that I never run out of space when swiping across the touchpad. I would love to see this size of touchpad on more laptops, gaming or not. The GS65 lacks a number pad, instead there's a single column of shortcut keys  including a dedicated key to rotate through the SteelSeries Engine 3 keyboard lighting schemes. One gripe I have about the keyboard's layout is that the Function key is to the right of the space bar, and there aren't any dedicated volume or brightness buttons. That means when I'm gaming and need to make an adjustment on the fly, I have to search for the function key, because I can never remember that it's been moved. Sure, over time I would likely adjust, but its current location just feels like its on the wrong side of the space bar. The GS65 isn't short on ports. There's an Ethernet port, followed by two USB 3.2 ports, and audio in/out ports on the left side of the housing. On the opposite side you'll find a mixture of different ports, with another USB 3.2 port, a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3.1 port, a miniDisplayPort, and an HDMI port. The charging port is also on that same side. The naming scheme for USB ports and their respective speeds is confusing, especially when you consider that USB 3.2 Gen 2 is actually the new name for USB 3.1 Gen 2 (previously USB 3.1), and its transfer speed is still limited to a maximum of 10Gbps. Just to drive home how confusing this all has become  USB 3.0, which became USB 3.1 Gen 1, and is now USB 3.2 Gen 1, offers 5Gbps speeds. In short, the GS65 has three USB ports capable of transfer speeds up to 10Gbps. One puzzling feature the GS65 offers is that the hinge for the display can rotate the screen so it lays flat, or nearly 180-degrees. On a standard laptop with a touchscreen, I can see how this would potentially be useful. However, on the GS65, it's more of a neat trick than a feature I would use. MSI GS65  Software The first time you launch Dragon Center, a small dragon character asks a series of questions aimed at tuning the system to get the performance you want. It's a fun initial interaction, and in a somewhat entertaining way, educates users on what kind of performance improvements can be made to the system. If you don't like interacting with animated dragons that can talk, you can skip the opening questions and go straight to Dragon Center's main screen. Dragon Center provides system stats, specs, power plans, and even fan speeds. There are several sections to the app that allow you to fine-tune how the laptop behaves, from things like battery optimization when you're portable, to a gaming mode that will optimize the system when you launch a game. The program auto-identifies which games you have installed, but in my experience, wasn't reliable. The only game it found installed on the test unit was Apex Legends, despite Far Cry 5 and Fortnite being installed in their proper locations. Adding to the confusion, I couldn't figure out how to manually add an installed game to Dragon Center. Heck, I even launched both games while Dragon Center was open with Gaming Mode enabled, and it still claimed neither game was installed. Outside of MSI's program, you'll find Norton Security, SteelSeries Engine 3, and Killer Control Center pre-installed on the GS65. I'm ok with the latter two programs, but Norton Security should be nowhere near a $3,400 machine. MSI GS65  Performance and Gaming If you were building a laptop from scratch, and wanted the best and latest components, you'd probably end up with something along the lines of the GS65's spec sheet. Inside the impressively thin housing is Intel's 9th generation Core i9-9880H CPU, Nvidia's RTX 2080 with Max-Q, 32GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD. Who wouldn't want all of that tucked into a portable housing? I know I do. But here's the kicker  I didn't see as big of a jump in performance as I would have hoped. When looking at the benchmarks, the GS65 didn't blow away the Triton 500, despite Acer using an Intel Core i7-8750H. It doesn't come close to keeping up with the Alienware Area-51m, either, but that's fully expected and should come as no surprise. Even still, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus S and the GS75, both of which use the last generation Intel Core i7 processors and an RTX 2080 with Max-Q. My experience gaming matched the benchmarks. In Apex Legends with all graphics settings set as high as they could go, I saw around 100 frames-per-second. With Fortnite set to Epic, I was pushing 150 FPS. When testing Battlefield V, which supports real-time ray tracing, I set DXR to ultra I never pushed above 70 FPS. That's a far cry from the 95 FPS I experienced on even the GS75 Stealth, or more recently the Triton 500. One aspect of the Max-Q tuned RTX 2080s you have to take into consideration is that they can be optimized by the laptop maker for each specific design. The GS65 Stealth is tuned to the exact specs as the GS75 Stealth, with a base speed of 735MHz and a boost speed of 1,095MHz. Yet, the performance was drastically slower. Perhaps there's some room for developers to optimize for the eight-core processor, and only after that will we see any meaningful performance improvements. I was able to get Fortnite to push the 240Hz display at medium settings. Now, before I move on, I do want to say I was able to get Fortnite to push the 240Hz display at medium settings. I don't know that I felt like it was impressively smooth because of the tradeoff in graphics quality, but knowing that despite the performance hiccups I was still able to hit over 240 FPS on a 240Hz display was exciting. Even when I wasn't hitting unreal frames-per-second, I liked the overall look and feel of the screen. It's not overly saturated and it's just bright enough for my taste. The fans of the GS65 are loud, but not too loud. I was able to game without headphones and never felt like I was missing out on the more nuanced environment noises, nor did I have to max out the volume setting to feel that way. Even with the low-profile keyboard, I don't recall any missed presses or accidental presses or nearby keys. They're evenly spaced and work both in gaming and typing situations. When opening the bottom, it doesn't look like you'll be able to easily swap out RAM or upgrade the SSD on your own. Thankfully, the 1TB SSD in the review sample is more than enough for all of my testing programs and AAA games, with plenty of room to spare. MSI GS65  Battery Life One highlight to the GS65's performance is its battery life. In my testing, where I loop a video with the display set to 50% brightness and keyboard lighting turned off, the GS65's battery powered through 193 minutes of use. That's over three hours of playback  plenty of time to watch just about any movie you want on a plane. It's also the best battery life I've seen from an RTX 2080 equipped laptop yet. The closest was the MSI GS75 Stealth at 167 minutes, then the Acer Predator Triton 500 at 141 minutes. The GS65 Stealth looks amazing, inside and out, but at $3,400 its performance leaves a bit to be desired since there are gaming laptops that perform just as well for a lot less.", "date": "Aug. 1, 2019,"}
