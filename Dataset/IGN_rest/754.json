Heres what we said: So are you going to enjoy Devil May Cry 4? Hardcore actions junkies aren't going to care as much about the wrap-around level progression and repetitive encounters as they'll likely be busy replaying stages for the highest ratings. They're going to love the punishing Legendary Dark Knight mode on Turbo and power through the wonky platforming and puzzle sections. If you're one of those who are just looking for a one-shot action experience, though, you'll probably be more affected by these kinds of flaws. Regardless of how much weight you put on each category, the action gameplay is accessible and possesses quite a bit of depth if you're willing to put in the time. The higher-resolution graphics on the PC shine and flow smoothly, and the fact that a gamepad is the best way to go shouldn't turn you off. This type of game couldn't really work any other way. So while it's not without flaws, it's still one of the better pure action experiences on the platform. The same holds true of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. This updated version brings the 1080p graphics and 60-frames-per-second gameplay to consoles for the first time, alongside a trio of new playable characters. The sharper look and snappier feel is a satisfying upgrade for this old-school Dante adventure. Sadly, this Special Edition isnt special enough to fix the gaping backtracking and puzzle flaws of the original 2008 release, but its a fun treat for anyone who prefers the classic combat of Devil May Cry before Capcom rebooted the series in 2013. The new characters and their combat styles are the single best reason to own DMC4: Special Edition. Each one presents a fun set of options that dont feel like reskins of existing characters. Trish is fast, fluid fighter that straight up demolishes her opponents with a mix of close and mid-range attacks options. Her quick, graceful style is a great counterbalance to Lady, a much slower character whose rocket launcher, shotgun, pistol, and melee attack combinations pack quite a wallop. But of the three, Vergil is perhaps the most interesting, in that hes a deadly mix of devastating speed and deliberate action. His focus meter rewards careful play and, in a way, pushed me to play a more conservative role than any other action game Ive played. Sure, I could swing my samurai sword willy-nilly and find some success. But, by carefully measuring my opponents, dodging, and counterattacking, I could tap into his true potential and really wreck the enemy with beefed-up attacks. A fighting style that emphasizes economy of motion isnt common to Devil May Cry, a series where hacking something to death is often encouraged as paramount to success, but this is a fun direction I hope Capcom explores in future sequels. The fact that you can respec a characters moveset at any time is great, too  if Capcom was going to pull any forward-thinking feature from the rebooted DMC, Im glad it was this one. Where the new characters arent so well integrated is the haphazard way theyre oddly stitched into the story, with a noticeable lack of interstitial cutscenes. As you tour through the strange world of DMC4 with the new characters, youll encounter a boss or special enemy with next to zero fanfare. These cutscenes used to be the best reward in the original game, but without them, DMC4: Special Edition is like playing a remix of your favorite album only to discover some of the best song lyrics somehow went missing. And then theres all the backtracking through levels and terrible board game puzzle section near the end. I wish Capcom had found a way to snip out or replace these low points to learn from the mistakes of the past and give fans a way to experience the good without the bad, and introduce new players to only the best of DMC4, but no, theyre still here. My best advice is just to stick it out and play on through, because it gets much better. Pros Fun combatNew charactersCustomization Cons BacktrackingAnnoying puzzles Beyond the nice upgraded graphics and framerate, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition puts all of its energy into adding three great new characters and fighting styles to Capcoms over-the-top action game. Trish, Lady, and Vergil are the best reasons to pick up this special edition, and theyre playable in every mode. Its a bit disappointing that Capcom didnt take this opportunity to delete the bad points while adding in new good stuff, which means that the backtracking and annoying puzzles that pushed some people away in 2008 will do so again in this edition.", "date": "June 24, 2015,"}
