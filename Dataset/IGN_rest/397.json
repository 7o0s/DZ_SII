Batman: Return to Arkham brings both games - and all their DLC - to the current generation of consoles, but an unremarkable graphical upgrade doesnt do them justice. Thats not to say its not noticeable. Textures in Return to Arkham are much sharper: Batmans suit, for example, looks much more detailed. His cape in particular stands out beautifully, pebbled, catching the light. Virtous, the studio thats upgraded Rocksteadys original games, has ported both games to Unreal Engine 4 from Unreal Engine 3, making for a much brighter aesthetic overall. But in many instances, brighter does not mean better. The original Arkham games were dark for two reasons: one, because deep blacks add to the atmosphere and two, to disguise the graphical shortcomings of 2009-era consoles. Here, every PS3 plant, rock and puddle of water is thrown into stark relief, and as a result Gotham often feels quite blocky and theme park-esque, which breaks the romantic illusion. More, some of the detail in faces has been smoothed out in this much lighter version, and some of the intricacies of expression are lost as a result. This isnt a deal-breaker - characters can still emote - but to remove such nuances is another example of illumination where its simply not needed. The bigger issue is performance. For a remastered version of older games, its disappointing that neither Asylum nor City runs at 60 frames per second - theyre both targeting 30. In fact, Asylum suffers from some odd stutters when Batman runs through a corridor or turns a corner. The issues arent bad enough to interrupt combat flow, but occasional chugging is a noticeable distraction. Outside of the two campaigns, all the DLC challenge maps and additional skins are here, so you can play as 1970s Batman - or even better, animated Batman - from the get-go. But theres nothing to differentiate the extra content from what was included in the Game of the Year editions, and the lack of making-ofs or behind-the-scenes details is a missed opportunity. If youve never played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and own a current-gen console, Return to Arkham is a fine place to start. But for those who already own both on PC or last gen, theres no real reason to pick this up beyond a rather uninspiring and technically disappointing graphical upgrade.", "date": "Oct. 18, 2016,"}
