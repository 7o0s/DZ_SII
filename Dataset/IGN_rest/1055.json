All of the strategies and spell combinations I'd spent the last couple of hours perfecting on weaker enemies now proved no more powerful than feathers against a freight train, and I'd steeled myself for the possibility that I'd never see the second stage. But then I took a step back, studied the tooltips, and made new spells accordingly. I adjusted my strategies and, at last, I was victorious. Lichdom: Battlemage thrives on these moments, and they soothe the burns inflicted by the poorer aspects of its design. My early troubles were appropriate for a first-person roleplaying game that follows the exploits of a mage that only learns his or her craft after a grizzled wizard slaps some magic cuffs their wrists seconds after the opening cutscene. Developer Xaviant here gives us a flimsy tale of revenge against some ruffians known as the Cult of Malthus, but the hows and whys of the simple fiction are never so meaningful as the playful relationship between the two playable characters. Choose the female, for instance, and the male alternative becomes a sidekick that flits in and out of reality and informs you of what lies ahead. Choose the male, and the roles are reversed. Further exposition reveals itself in the purple ~echoes~ enacting scenes from the past, but it tends to get lost among the banter and superior performances of voice actors Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker. It's harder to get lost in the gigantic levels themselves, which unfold with enough monotonous linearity down corridors and mountain paths that Final Fantasy XIII would blush in its presence. It makes for progression that's in far better company with the likes of Call of Duty than Skyrim, and while the loss of true exploration feels painful, the design makes a bizarre sort of sense considering its almost shooter-style gameplay. Your opposite-gendered companion can point out the proper path by spitting forth a purple falcon, but it's rarely necessary unless you're hopelessly turned around while hunting down hidden snippets of lore or extra spell components down the few short side paths. On the bright side, the striking, ivy-laden ruins and snowscapes that follow pull up much of the slack, even if the CryEngine 3 engine that powers them was prone to crashing my mid-range PC (especially on the first level).  But provided your system can handle it, these concerns never entirely undermine Lichdom: Battlemage's primary goal of taking the archetypical mage class and realize its full potential by unshackling it from the mana bars and cooldowns that normally confine it. Melee combat is not an option here, and it never feels needed. (I never quite mastered the counter-attack spell that helps survive close-range encounters, but it didnt feel important enough to bother with.) You instead expand your powers with eight sigils that run the gamut from simple fire and ice to telekinesis and corruption, and then focus those energies into a targeted ranged attack, an area-of-effect spell, and a magical barrier. You can equip three sigils at a time, which is just enough to add meaningful spell combinations without getting overwhelming. Superficially, a Battlemage in action looks like a cross between the double-handed magic of Skyrim and the plasmids of BioShock. Here, however, the focus on crafting allows for a considerably rich gameplay experience. The road to revenge here is littered with spell components of varying quality that drop as frequently as guns in Borderlands, and finding the best playstyle for each situation requires constant and careful experimentation. In one of my favorite combinations, for instance, I might first root an enemy in place with a kinetic lobbed spell and then follow it up with a targeted ice blast. Thanks to crafting components, both spell effects deal a stackable Mastery bonus, which augments destructive spell effects. I then toss a fire-lob spell on the enemy, who then usually explodes in a massive critical hit. All the while, I use a Dishonored-like ~Blink~ spell to teleport a few feet out of harm's way. It feels powerful. This tends to get me through most situations, but it wasn't always thus. So many spell components drop that it's easy to get intimidated before the end of the first chapter, particularly when you're confronted with the lengthy cascade of effects and modifiers when you attempt to craft a new spell out of at least two component pieces. Don't like what you have? You can upgrade and reforge components as well. It's the kind of thing that begs for spreadsheet interaction to make the most sense of the numbers aside from just looking for bigger figures, but I contented myself with fumbling through various combinations via experimentation. It made some rough sort of sense after enough practice, but I never warmed to the thought that I was spending almost as much time studying the crafting menu as I was blasting my foes with lightning and fire. Yet such study is necessary. Lichdom: Battlemage is brutally difficult in spots, and it doesn't help that the resurrection points feel like theyre miles apart and that enemies respawn after each death. Constant hordes of enemies lack the tension of, say, Dark Souls, and thus the inevitable failures transform would-be thrills into grinds. There's no difficulty slider, meaning that you'll truly have to learn how to survive in situations where archers are lobbing arrows, shielded warriors are rushing you, or banshees are freezing you in place. Sometimes all at once, too. The good thing about all this is that achieving victory amid this chaos feels uncommonly rewarding, and it imparts some association with the main character as he or she learns to harness a newfound power. Lichdom: Battlemage can make you feel like a badass, yes, but it makes you work for it. The trouble is that this badassery too often takes the same form. This is a game that all but begs for puzzles and related activities to break up the routine of fighting, but for the roughly 24 hours I played, it rarely deviated from the same dance of mowing down enemies who mindlessly rush you or fling death from afar. Challenge aside, it's a hack 'n' slash without the swords, and at times I felt I relied too heavily on pelting enemies with fire as I teleported backward to say out of reach. The settings may shift from glaciers riven by rivers of lavas to deserts, but the enemies themselves rarely deviate from the same cast of undead and misguided knights. (The NPCs themselves seem critical of the repeating character models  at one point, one asks, ~Why hasn't His Preceptorship assigned any women over here?~) But in most respects, Lichdom: Battlemage gets magic combat right. The downside? By the time you've reached the New Game mode, the magic of experimenting with spells against the onslaught of samey foes has largely fizzled out.
