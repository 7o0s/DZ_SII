There have been times over the last several days when Ive become deeply immersed in the process of learning a new trick and executing it perfectly on a cool line Id found some place within the maps. However, playing on Xbox has exposed the fondly-regarded PC versions secret: its heavily reliant on user-made mods to flesh it out. This has left the console version feeling extremely light on content at launch and, combined with some regularly occurring jankiness, the result is something that generally feels more like a tech demo than a complete game. Skater XLs controls may initially seem familiar to Skates gesture-based brand of analogue stick flicking  and its true that there are some rough similarities  but mastering Skater XLs controls is actually like learning a whole new language. In Skater XL, each thumbstick represents the skaters corresponding foot. That may sound simple but sometimes its a bit like rubbing your belly with one hand while braiding your own hair with the other. Even a straightforward kickflip requires you to pop the board with your back foot and then execute a properly-timed kick with your front foot. If you chuck a rotation in there, thatll require one of the triggers. If you want to throw a grab on top of it all, that brings in the bumpers  and all of a sudden youre squeezing your controller from all angles like it owes you money. This complexity may ultimately be a turn off for some, but I've quite enjoyed just zoning out and trying to perfect some complex skate tricksThis complexity may ultimately be a turn off for some, but Ive quite enjoyed just zoning out and trying to perfect some complex skate tricks. Things like this are often a simple button-push away in other skate games but would require a huge amount of practise in reality, and so they do in Skater XL. Overall I get the feeling the goal here has been to build a control system that attempts to mirror the finesse of foot movement that real-life skateboarding requires and, to a certain extent, that has worked. The granular control over grinds is particularly nifty if you move the sticks slowly enough not to trigger an ollie or shuvit. That said, its loaded with annoyances, too: the zone on the stick for performing manuals feels a bit too small, you cant seem to turn more than 90 degrees on the spot without pushing off in the complete opposite direction, and sometimes my skater will bust an unwanted ollie before Ive let go of the stick. Tre Cool During my second morning playing I attempted a tre flip, which in Skater XL requires two similar yet slightly out-of-sync movements with each stick. I couldnt get it. I just couldnt remotely nail the timing, and the angles were beyond me. Skater XL was asking my monkey fingers for Moonlight Sonata and all they had to give was Mary Had a Little Lamb. At one stage I even noticed theres an achievement for performing 10 tre flips in a row. I scoffed. It was never going to happen. But I made a few more attempts, and those few attempts turned into a few more attempts, and a few more attempts after that. Eventually I landed one. Then three in a row. Then 10 in a row. Skater XLs controls are a bit of a wall to crash through compared to, say, an arcade skate experience like any Tony Hawk game out there, but because they ask you to practise and practise, theres a quaint loop here that imitates the spirit of the real thing  or, at least, learning a real, physical skill  in a satisfying way. Try. Fail. Try again. Fail again. Try again, succeed, celebrate. American Wasteland That loop, however, is all Skater XL has. Theres no campaign for its four pro skater characters or even a path through its five core maps or the three user-made maps from PC modders that have been curated and added to the console versions. Theres no ultimate goal beyond go skate. Each of the maps has a list of challenges you can complete but they feel a bit like a long series of tutorials. This may be enough for skaters who just want to noodle around, bust tricks, and experiment with the video editor, but for those accustomed to more substantial skating games I expect Skater XL may feel a bit like the part of a game you play while you wait for the rest to install. The high school level feels very authentic, theres a faithful rendition of the West L.A. Courthouse spot, and the downtown L.A. map also features riffs on several iconic spots skaters will likely recognise, but theyre all completely lifeless. No NPC skaters, no moving vehicles, no multiplayer; just you. The visuals and bright and sharp and the menus are clean and unobtrusive, but the visual quality is a little uneven overall. Theres some great detail on some of the surfaces, in particular  like the benches and pillars of the West L.A. Courthouse spot bearing the scrapes and scars of a few thousand 50-50s  but certain things dont quite stand up to the same level of scrutiny (like shirts clipping through pants or the fuzziness on props like cars). The Big Ramp level is fun in bursts, but theres no denying that it undermines Skater XLs focus on making you strive hard to perfect the fundamentals of straight street skating when I can bust out a successful backside 1800 into a port-a-loo, by accident. Theres big rift between the gritty, harder-than-it-looks urban skating Skater XL wants to celebrate and the fact you can successfully land a double-900 from low orbit on flat ground without your ankles exploding, and then skate off through the desert. It just doesnt feel finished. Theres a halfpipe on the Big Ramp for transition skating, too, but it's unreliable and I find whenever I get into a groove I end up exiting the pipe or landing on the coping unintended and bailing. The bails arent particularly great, either; if skaters arent freezing their limbs in odd positions theyre regularly clipping through the environment. They can be hard to predict, too; sometimes youll pop off the same low rail half-a-dozen times and collapse in an unexplained heap all but once, and other times you can accidentally fall from a freeway bridge and skate away with no hassles. The audio is very good, however, and theres a nice suite of honest skating sound effects. With the short soundtrack turned off theres an almost meditative quality to the hiss of rolling wheels and scraping ply. Skater XL is being positioned as a platform but on console it still feels a bit too much like a prototype. Regular glimpses of promise appear when I operate within its limits and focus on managing its complex controls and limit myself to earnest, realistic skateboarding, but ultimately it seems more like a skateboarding video tool than a fleshed-out game. Its faithfully dedicated to skatings Californian roots and  like real skating  it can look pretty slick when you edit out the misses, but with all its rough edges and without the PCs huge mod environment, Id anticipate only serious skateboarders will stay on board here.", "date": "July 31, 2020,"}
