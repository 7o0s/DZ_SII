Most lists would default to the ones from Bose, or Sony, or even JBL, but if you have charted Amazon for a pair, you have must seen Mixcder headsets constantly being one of the best sellers on the platform. And there is a reason for that  because for some inexplicable reason, Mixcder achieves a perfect mix of affordability and high-end features, and somehow manages deliver on it. It might be easy to brush this aside as one of those cheap Chinese brands but it is far from the cash-grab knockoffs that you find on the hypermarket store shelves. For approx. AED 280 (USD 73.99), the Mixcder E9 packs in Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Bluetooth 5.0 capability, fast-charging, and 35 hours of playtime - with all of it working as it should. The only sacrifices youll make are on the aesthetics and a bit on the sound quality, but are these reasons enough to pay the big bucks for other brands? Design The Mixcder E9 wears its budget mindedness on its sleeves but it also manages to not look or feel cheap. The headset is largely made up of hard plastic with faux leather padding on the headband and earcups. It tries to add a bit of oomph to the design with a shiny radial plate on the outsides of the earcup, but it isnt too loud and gaudy as cheap headset tend to be, so the overall muted design of the E9 keeps things basic, simple and efficient. My only gripe with the design is the plastic coating around where the controls reside. Its the only bit of material on the headset that truly feels cheap, and tends to quite easily pickup on smudges and scratches. Adding to that is the bulbous control buttons that, while thankfully are as minimal as possible, do drag the overall look down. On the right earcup you have the plus and minus volume buttons, the power button, and a micro-USB charging port. While on the left earcup you have the ANC switch, and a 3.5mm audio port for wired connectivity. All the control buttons are well placed, as I never found myself second-guessing which button I was pressing. The earcups are generously padded and do provide reasonably good comfort for a few hours. The clamp force is a tad bit much for my liking, as it tends to press on my spectacles, but it becomes a non-issue after a minute or two of settling down. The faux leather does heat up because of it, however, and I found myself removing the headset every hour or so to let my ears breathe a bit. The Mixcder E9 comes with a nylon-covered carrying case with an elastic band to keep the headphones in place. Its pretty basic otherwise as it doesnt have any compartments to keep accessories and such, so if youre carrying extra cables or adapters, youll just have to throw them in along with the headset. If you chose to skip the case, the headsets can lay flat or fold-up into a clamshell for easier carry, as well. Performance The sound quality on the Mixcder E9 might be the biggest factor why one may choose to skip it over other brands. Its 40mm drivers pumps out big bass and loud volume but its aural prowess is nothing to write home about. The E9 does manage to produce sufficiently clear vocals and resonating highs, but most of the time, the sound is clouded by its booming bass that muddies the overall production of the track you are listening to. I am someone who prefers a more controlled bass structure that supports the sound rather than be the lead that drives the music, and so, E9s sound signature is not something for me. However, if you are big into bass driven tracks, the headset could be the right fit for you. This is not to say the headset is entirely bad. With ANC turned on, which tunes out much of the cacophony of the outside world, the audio performance is entirely passable for daily listening as you travel back and forth from work or complete your chores. Just dont expect it to win you over with rich detail or a large soundstage. The headset also has a built-in mic for taking calls or chatting on VOIP apps. It is clear and loud for those purposes, or at least none of my callers mentioned anything wrong with my voice, so thats always a good sign. When it comes to compatibility, the E9 pairs with anything that has Bluetooth on it. Pairing is easy too  just hold the power button for a few seconds after turning it on and it will immediately go into pairing mode where the tiny LED will start to flash in red and blue color. Each step on the headset  be it turning it on or pairing  is denoted by a voice which is a neat touch. Purchase Guide Mixcder E9 generally goes for around USD 69.99 on Amazon US, which is the probably the best place to purchase the headset from. However, due to the Covid-19 situation around the world, don't expect timely shipment or the ability to purchase it just yet. If you are interested in the previous Mixcder E7 model, you can use the discount code, MIXCDERE7, to avail a 10% discount, while the code, MIXCDERE10, can be redeemed for the same level of discount for the company's latest E10 model. It wouldnt be wrong to describe the Mixcder E9 as a perfectly average pair of wireless headset. There is nothing overtly impressive about it, and neither does it do a poor job with what it promises on the tin. Its bass heavy sound performance  which you could presumably correct with an equalizer  is the only drawback on an otherwise reasonably well spec'd and well-priced headset.", "date": "April 21, 2020"}
