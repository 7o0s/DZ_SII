Which is appropriate because its largely about a neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono, but Katana Zero refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways. Katana Zero puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, youre told No That wont work, as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that doesnt end in your death. Every level even ends with a security camera recording of what actually happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back, but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on. Working up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zeros action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, its one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that isnt a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets, or reflect bullets back with his sword. Theres a great flow and feel to your characters movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action (both of which can be adjusted or disabled in the options). My favorite thing about the action of Katana Zero though is the slow-mo effect  specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; its on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, youll rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick. As I got better, I found myself trying to wean myself off using slow-mo as much as I could, because storming into a room full of enemies, deflecting bullets, dodging shotgun blasts, and cutting up baddies all at full speed feels incredible. I also liked keeping slow-mo in my pocket as long as possible as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Katana Zeros story doesnt quite hit the high note that its action does, but its at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, or a psychotic Russian named V. Theres also an innovative dialogue system that gives you unique options depending on when in the conversation you decide to interject and skip through NPCs lines. For example, if you just want to get a move on past the receptionist at the front desk of a hotel full of dudes that need a killin, you can rudely shut down her every attempt to talk to you, resulting in her getting super pissed. Or, if you wait til she finishes every sentence you will be rewarded with new dialogue options, such as one that allows you to tell her the fun lie of saying youre cosplaying as a character from an anime. Either way, the resulting dialogue is entertaining and well worth multiple playthroughs to see how the scenarios play out. That being said, any deviations in the story due to my choices felt largely superficial, so there were times when later dialogue options felt wildly inconsistent with my previous decisions. The biggest issue, though, is the fact that very little is resolved by the time the credits roll. It feels like its planned to be the first part in a series of games, and Im interested to see where a potential sequel or DLC might go from here, but its hard not to feel like the story of this first chapter was all buildup and no payoff. Katana Zero wont take more than four to six hours to complete, but its a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like its running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from a minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence to one particularly standout level thats a bit too spoilery to talk about here. It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give Katana Zero a unique visual style and personality. Theres also a fitting and fantastic retro-electro soundtrack to go along with the action. Katana Zeros time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but its unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like its saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, Katana Zeros shorter length makes it a quick fix, and Ill no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.", "date": "April 21, 2019"}
