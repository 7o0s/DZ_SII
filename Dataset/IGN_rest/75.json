Though the CHG90 stands alone by virtue of its daunting dimensions, is it worth its whopping $1,300 price tag? I spent some time with Samsungs ultra-wide behemoth to find out. Design and Features Ive reviewed other large, ultra-wide gaming monitors like the Asus ROG Swift PG348Q and Alienware AW3418DW, but lets just get this straight from the beginning: neither of those monitors prepared me for the gargantuan size of the Samsung CHG90. With a 49-inch screen and a deep 1800R curvature, this display absolutely filled my field of vision completely, and seemingly wrapped all the way around me. Its so wide that it's impossiblewithout taking a few steps backwardto actually look at the entire screen at once. The CHG90 is closer to an HDTV with gaming-centric features thanks to its size. While theres certainly a sense of awe and enough screen real estate to make any multi-tasker cry tears of joy, its important to note the huge panel may just be too much for some users. My office desk isn't the biggest desk as the pieces are only 21~ from the wall, but the CHG90 basically took up the entire thing. Using a gaming keyboard on the same surfacedue in no small part to the CHG90s big metal standrequired me to move it awkwardly to the side a bit (see above). But honestly, the screen real estate and ultra-wide gaming would make purchasing a larger desk worth the effort. For the most part, the QLED Vertical Alignment (VA) panel in the CHG90 is fantastic. Color reproduction is excellent, and with High Dynamic Range (HDR) compatible games, its beautiful. Coupled with wide open vistas in a first-person shooter, its hard not to get swept up and immersed in all those pixels. That said, the CHG90 isnt the sharpest monitor on market. The 3840 x 1080 resolution means this is still a 1080p monitor vertically, so if youve grown accustomed to 1440 or 4K monitors, you'll notice some loss of visual fidelity. The upside is you don't need a GTX 1080 Ti to run the monitor at its native resolution. As far as the panel goes, if you glance too quickly at the spec sheet, you would be forgiven for thinking this is an OLED monitor. Instead the CHG90 sports a QLED, or ~quantum dot display.~ At this point, QLED screens are fairly rare in the PC monitor world (as opposed to more common QLED HDTVs). The result when compared to a more traditional vertical alignment (VA) LCD panel is a wider color gamut and increased brightness, especially when combined with the rich tones provided by HDR content. In short, at nearly every turn the CHG90 offers features very few gaming monitors on the market have attempted. The CHG90 is also one of the first monitors to offer AMD's new FreeSync 2 technology. While the original FreeSync has existed for some time and offers tear-free gaming with a compatible AMD graphics card, FreeSync 2 also tackles the latency inherent to HDR content. Any FreeSync-compatible GPU will utilize the FreeSync 2 functionality of the CHG90, so you'll just need to be playing an HDR game, and the list of those is still quite small. The external design of the CHG90 is pleasantly understated, eschewing the gamer look found on monitors like the Asus PG348Q, for example. Most of the CHG90 body is constructed of a simple, grey plastic with its one defining bit of pizazz being a swirled plastic piece around the stand mount which glows blue when the monitor is powered. Bezels on three sides of the display are super thin, while a slightly larger bottom edge features a small, embossed Samsung logo. This monitor also offers cable management, wherein the back of the stand is actually removable and cables are hidden underneath the cover. The I/O ports on the CHG90 are mercifully easy to access from the back of the monitor, which is especially important when youre trying to move around a monitor of this size. Unfortunately, theres only two USB ports, which is a woefully small number and given the huge space afforded here its a bit odd Samsung couldnt squeeze in two more. Theres also two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DisplayPort, and one Mini DisplayPort. Youll need to use the DisplayPorts to get the max 144Hz refresh rate on the CHG90. And if youre using 3.5mm connections for audio, youll also find a headphone and mic in/out jacks on the back of the monitor. Samsung has placed a joystick and three menu buttons under the bottom edge of the CHG90 for accessing the monitors on-screen display. The menus themselves are easy to access, with each of four directions on the joystick providing a shortcut to the most used features. Within the menus, the CHG90 offers a pleasing range of adjustments, including gaming presets such as FPS, RTS, and a sRGB mode. Personally, I found the FPS setting to offer the best mixture of brightness and color temperature. Theres also individual settings for brightness, contrast, and color settings. As Ill discuss later on, the 3000:1 contrast works very well, and beyond messing around with presets, the CHG90 looks great out of the box without much fiddling with settings. Testing I used the Lagom LCD testing pages to take a closer look at how the Samsung CHG90 performs. These pages allow me to evaluate the CHG90 in regards to things like contrast, gamma settings, color banding, and refresh rate. As mentioned previously, the CHG90 boasts a 3000:1 contrast ratio, and combined with a nice QLED VA panel and HDR functionality, this monitor delivers excellent, deep black levels. Dark and light tones were perfect across the spectrum, and white tones were easily seen across even the brightest backgrounds. Gamma settings on the CHG90 were near perfect, sitting right at the Windows-standard 2.2 range. There was no visible color bandingan issue on come monitors where visible lines appear in color gradients. Overall, color reproduction on the CHG90 is some of the best Ive seen on a monitor, regardless of whether the presets were in sRGB mode or even the game-centric FPS mode. Samsung claims the CHG90 has a 1ms response time, and in regards to the easiest transitions (grey to grey tones), this seems to hold up under my testing. In fact, the CHG90 is extremely fast in all but the darkest transitions where the response time dipped a bit to perhaps around the 5-10ms mark. Lastly, I took a look at how the CHG90 performed in regards to potential ghosting issues, where artifacts trail behind fast moving objects on-screen. Using Blur Busters UFO tests, there was a minimal amount of ghosting with the monitor running at its full 144Hz refresh rate. Gaming The Samsung CHG90 is a multitasking dream. At one point, I had Grand Theft Auto V, a Word document, Discord, and Chrome all running on the same screen. In effect, this monitor is like having two 16:9 1920 x 1080 monitors in a multi-monitor setup, but theres no break in the image where you'd normally have a bezel ruining the fun. Samsung also offers a decent piece of software called EasySettingBox that allows you to set up multitasking on the CHG90 monitor with ease. For example, you can pre-set the monitor into the previously mentioned dual 16:9 configuration and have two 1080p games running side-by-side. Or, if youre a streamer, set up the game on one side of the monitor and run streaming software and social media windows on the other. The possibilities are fairly endless with this much screen real estate at your disposal. At full screen, productivity apps like setting up spreadsheets is really something. Of course, the 32:9 aspect ratio can be strange in regards to gaming. If you thought finding PC games with native 21:9 ultra-wide support was hit or miss, the unique dimensions of the CHG90 are a whole other bag. Generally, running games at 21:9 resolution works fine, albeit youll have considerable black bars on the sides of the screen. Some games, like PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds, for example, actually zoom in to the picture which can look a little odd if youre used to playing in third person. But at the same time, the experience of playing on this huge ultra-wide monitor iswhen it worksbreathtaking. Destiny 2 works natively with the 32:9 aspect ratio of the CHG90 and quite honestly, its difficult to go back to playing it on any other display. Running through levels, physically turning your head to check the environment, is about as close as youll get to virtual reality without having to wear a headset. And with HDR functionality and great colors pumped out by the curved QLED display, playing games on this monitor is a real treat. Real-time strategy games also look great on the CHG90, too. And since most modern strategy games seem to love ultra-wide displays, theres lots of native support. Playing Civilization VI or even new indie darling Northgard on this huge display worked flawlessly. And when youre surveying a huge map from above, the genre really looks its best on this monitor. If youre in the market for a monitor that will cause everyone around you to gasp at its insane size, the Samsung CHG90 is the monitor for you. The price is a bit high for its pixel density, but its still one of the most enjoyable and unique gaming experiences Ive ever had.", "date": "Jan. 28, 2018,"}
