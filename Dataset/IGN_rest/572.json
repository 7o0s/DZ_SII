Heres what we said then: Heavy Rain is a hell of an experience. Its controversial control scheme actually works really well in allowing the fantastic story to dictate how events play out, and many of the game's scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts slow and the presentation isn't perfect, but the character development, dialog and story twists will hook you like few games can. Heavy Rain is not to be missed. Six years later, Quantic Dreams interactive drama has landed on the PlayStation 4, sporting a very attractive visual upgrade. The PS4 port has ironed out the originals screen-tearing, while 1080p visuals now run at a consistent 30fps, making it the best version of Heavy Rain available. However, Heavy Rains control scheme has not aged well, and while its story remains an entertaining B-grade oddity, poor characterisation and terrible voice-acting are less forgivable in 2016. Of everything, its performances have dated most obviously. In the wake of games with subtle, nimble performances like The Last of Us and Firewatch, Heavy Rains strained, not-quite-American voice acting clangs harshly on fresh ears. It isnt helped by frequently stiffly written dialogue and half-sketched characters: while private detective Scott Shelby is charming in a cliched heart-of-gold kind of way, Ethan and Madison, our heroes, are paper thin and robotic. Considering their lack of chemistry or even the most rudimentary rapport, their quick-time controlled sex scene is unintentionally hilarious. Heavy Rain still gallops along at a great pace, though. While its whodunnit story is wildly nonsensical (that heel-turn remains bizarre), its mix of thrilling action, hard-boiled detective schlock and James Wan-esque horror is heady and fun. More, I was as invested in its outcome as I was the first time I played it, knowing that the choices I made in-game affected Heavy Rains conclusion so brutally. Its rudimentary controls are less charming. Holding down R2 to move felt odd - especially considering the left thumb-stick is mostly ignored - and constantly shifting camera angles often sent my character in a different direction to the one I intended. I found myself walking around in circles and moving into furniture a lot; not great during the moments in Heavy Rain when time was working against me. On the other hand, Heavy Rains quick-time events hold up. Im still impressed by its action sequences, where button prompts grew increasingly frantic to evoke a real sense of tension, and the finger-twisting involved in some of its more gristly moments work wonderfully within their context. And it really does look gorgeous on the PlayStation 4. Textures - particularly on faces - have gained new depth, shadows are richer, reflections more visible, and the eponymous rain itself looks, well, heavier. Its a stunning presentation that should hold its head high among current-generation games. Pros Fun, B-grade storyContextual QTEs work well Cons Clunky fundamental controlsPoor voice acting Although its clunky controls and inconsistent voice acting dates Heavy Rain, it still remains enjoyable (if mad) B-grade sholock. A stunning visual upgrade on the PlayStation 4 makes this the version to grab if youre new to developer Quantic Dreams games, and existing fans should find enjoyment in a richer aesthetic this time around.
