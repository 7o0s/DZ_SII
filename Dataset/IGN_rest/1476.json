Its true, there is no real way to beat it, even though the XBLA version doesnt have the end content developer Mojang added to the PC version. But that isnt what Minecraft is about anyways. Sure, you can play through the Xbox version and churn out achievements, but the point of playing Minecraft  the very reason it sinks its claws into you and wont let go  is because its just so rewarding to set your imagination free. The secret of Minecrafts success isnt any one component of its design, but rather the way every piece of it coalesces to create an experience thats more liberating and creatively fulfilling than most video games. The 360 version of Minecraft doesnt coddle you, but it is different from the PC title. Just like the PC version you create a randomly generated world, dropping in and setting to work with nothing at the start. How you proceed is up to you; you set your own goals, working towards building the basics like shelter, fashioning tools and fighting for survival against the monsters that come out at night. You could never settle anywhere permanently, choosing to be a nomad who simply sets sail on the rivers and seas you encounter, or you can tunnel deep into the earth to harvest whatever treasures you find. The 360 version lacks the free-form Creative Mode of the PC, but its Survival Mode is much more user-friendly. On top of a substantial tutorial level, which covers all the basics of Minecraft and then even lets you just keep playing in that world, tooltips regularly pop up. These work great as a primer for new players, giving them the gist of each materials use. At any time you can also open up your inventory and see a basic description of each item, ensuring you never have to open a wiki to enjoy Minecraft. Alongside these great tips and tutorials, the team behind Minecraft on Xbox has smartly recreated the crafting system. The materials you need for each recipe are faithful to the PC version, and building them is accomplished with a few button presses. The crafting menu separates everything you can make into various categories, allowing you to rapidly tab between them, select the item you wish to make and then do it in a snap. If you dont have the necessary materials, it clearly shows you, which again makes it so you never have to leave the game to hunt down additional information. And before you say it, no, tracking down information is something longtime fans have grown accustomed to doing, but it isnt a good feature. The point of Minecraft is to create and have adventures, not to open up web browsers and read forums. Just because the 360 version explains gameplay features, doesnt mean that you dont earn everything in Minecraft. Every block of your house, every window you fashion and every door you put up comes from raw materials that you harvest. Finishing a powered rail system or laying the final block of a 12-story tower instills a sense of accomplishment few games can match. Hours spent trudging through caves and battling monsters all seem worth it for the moment you break through a block, place a hand-crafted torch and see the bright colored stones that indicate there are diamonds to mine. You get the thrill of finding treasure, the suspense of venturing into the unknown and the reward of seeing your dreams come to life. The thing some longtime fans might complain about (and rightfully so) is the features the 360 Minecraft is missing. Great tutorials and a streamlined crafting system make it much more user-friendly, but, since this version of the game is adapted from an early PC beta version, many recipes and seemingly minor gameplay mechanics are missing. For instance you cant sprint and you cant stack food items. There are no jungle biomes, either, and mods are pretty much never going to happen on the Xbox. The other features and additions dont detract that much from the experience, but mods have been so great at extending the value and life of the PC version that theyre deeply missed on Xbox. In the end I dont think most newcomers will care about any of these missing features, especially since the core mechanics and crafting recipes are present and more than enough to inspire countless hours of play. The PC version of Minecraft never integrated multiplayer very well, and the barrier to entry was enough that many people probably didnt bother. The Xbox version alleviates this with great integration of Xbox Live, letting you pop into your friends worlds from the main menu, as well as quickly invite them to yours. You can also play with up to four players in local split-screen co-op, jumping into another players game or simply running around as team within your own. Its a lot of fun creating vast castles, taming the wilds and exploring caves full of monsters, but its even better when you can share those times with your friends. Minecraft on Xbox just makes that a lot easier. CLOSING COMMENTS Minecraft on Xbox is almost as good as the PC version. Its still a great way to express yourself, but the lack of some of the PC features like mods and Creative Mode is disappointing. The vastly improved crafting interface and smooth online play make it easier to get into than ever before, which should open up Minecraft to a whole new audience. If you long to be creative and express yourself in a videogame, and dont mind being dropped into a sandbox that lacks stereotypical game goals, Minecraft is one of the greatest options available.
