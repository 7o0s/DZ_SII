Actually, nevermind  go ahead and enjoy that charm. Its a gorgeous game with a colorful, almost Links Awakening-esque art style, beautifully serene music, and an adorable sword-wielding fox for a protagonist. Enjoy it, because even though Tunic may look like a simplistic isometric action-adventure that draws clear inspiration from the early Legend of Zelda games, it is in reality a decidedly hardcore experience that will fiercely test both your mind and your combat abilities. Its not kiddier Zelda, as its bushy-tailed hero suggests (though Tunic himself should be made into a real-life plush immediately). Instead, Tunic caught me off guard with its challenging combat and complex puzzles, and once I regained my footing I found that it executes on that premise wonderfully.One of my favorite things about Tunic is that, like the old-school classics it clearly takes inspiration from, it tells you nothing. Less than nothing, in fact: nearly all of its dialogue and in-game language is in an indecipherable script, Tunic never speaks, and there are no objective markers, hints, or breadcrumb trails to speak of. Everything must be intuited, which is done partly through exploration but primarily through the individual pages of the in-game instruction manual that youll find scattered about the world. The booklet is modeled after what youd find in the box in a NES-era game, complete with handwritten scribbles and annotations on some of the pages. This manual, too, is written in Tunics own language, but youll be able to suss out clues and directions from the images contained within  it doesnt look like an IKEA instruction manual, but its a similar idea. Paying close attention to it is absolutely vital, as my cautionary tale proves; I ended up going into an early boss fight severely underpowered, but the frustration I felt as a result of that was my own fault for not reading the manual studiously enough to have figured out the key bit I was missing. Its an exceptionally clever way to guide us through, even if it might have you seeking out the IGN wiki from time to time (no shame in that!).It's an exceptionally clever way to guide us through.When youre not nose-down in your pieced-together instruction manual, youre out in either the overworld or one of the many dungeons where youll be slashing, blocking, dashing, and dodge-rolling your way to victory against Tunics wide variety of enemies. Importantly, you dont really learn any new moves after you acquire the sword in the first hour; instead, its your tactics that will have to evolve. This includes making good use of not just that basic set of moves in new ways but also your items, the applications of which are also not explained at all. From sticks of dynamite to magic items later on  all of which youll find hidden in chests around the world and able to be bought from a terrifying but harmless shopkeeper  figuring out what each one does and employing them with smart strategies will lead to success far more often than quick button-mashing will. But sometimes youll need both.My favorite among those items is easily the aforementioned sticks of dynamite youll have access to right from the jump. Theyre useful all game long, particularly during boss fights. Sure, theyre nice for clearing out clusters of bad guys, but against a bosss intimidatingly large health bar the TNT is one of the most reliable ways to take sizable chunks off of it. They benefit from a certain unpredictability in how they work due to their physics. Dont try to throw them at an opponent on a ledge, for instance; sure, Tunics got a pretty good arm, but the dynamite doesnt explode on contact. Rather, it will hit your target, then bounce off and roll around on the ground  depending how it lands  before finally combusting. Enemies in or around water are effectively impervious to dynamite as well, as the lit sticks instantly fizzle out if they touch water... as youd expect if you think about it.Like the old-school classics it clearly takes inspiration from, Tunic tells you nothing. No matter their size, your opponents are no pushovers  even the simplest of foes, like a Husher or a Autobolt, can drain your health rapidly. Their AI doesnt stand out as overly smart or stupid, but each one hits with a wallop. Larger hero versions of the vanilla baddies of various types move slower but hit harder, and that healthy helping of boss battles are not to be taken lightly. Good luck. And if youre wondering, you can only save your game at flame-lit shrines scattered about the world, and while doing so will restore your health and magic bars, the trade-off is that all of the enemies reset, too. Thats an obvious nod to Dark Souls.Lets talk a little more about those boss battles. They are many, they are memorable, and they are the good kind of nasty. There are no difficulty settings to choose from in Tunic; there is only Figure It Out. A simple multi-hit sword-attack combo is both hinted at in your manual pages and something you might discover on your own anyway, and it will be crucial to your chances of survival. Even more vital to your ability to stand toe-to-toe with Tunics bosses, however, is the dodge roll that gives you a very brief window of invincibility. Mastering it is a must, as is being able to quickly cycle through the items you might need that arent already hotkeyed to X, Y, and B. The moment you finally take down each boss genuinely feels like a victory well-earned.There are no difficulty settings to choose from in Tunic; there is only ~Figure It Out.~As in a classic, top-down Zelda, Tunic has many Metroidvania-style layers to eventually peel back, and this, too, is part of what I love about it. When you see some place you cant reach, or some door you cant access, or something you cant figure out how to activate, know that you will eventually get that tool  and when you return to see whats been quietly making you crazy for many hours youll finally have satisfaction. Tunics world, in general, is a lovely place as well. The overworld is bright and colorful, while each dungeon has its own look and feel, from the traditional-fantasy spider cave at one end of the spectrum to the almost-sci-fi Monastery at the other. But Tunics mysteries dont all show themselves early on and torture you until the late-game. Rather, new head-scratching conundrums are constantly revealing themselves, meaning youve always got a new lead to chase if you get frustrated or hit a dead end on the trail youve been following. This includes the run up to and past the endgame, where the knowledge youve accrued acts as momentum that can lead you to a number of puzzle-solves and revelations in short order as you go back and figure out things that youve previously walked by or stared at dozens of times, but theres still plenty of brain-bending to be done after the credits roll as well.On that note, Tunics story is an interesting one as you piece it together, but admittedly not one I felt particularly moved by or satisfied with by the end. My 15-20-hour journey mattered a lot more than the destination for me, but perhaps youll feel differently. I completed the original Legend of Zelda when I was nine years old, but nine-year-old me wouldnt have lasted long in Tunic. Though it may look adorably approachable thanks to its deceptively cute furry orange protagonist, Tunic quickly makes it clear that youd best be ready for a fight. It is a fantastic Zelda-style game for the Elden Ring generation, and solving its ceaselessly clever campaign and challenging combat through careful studying of your indecipherable but intuitive in-game instruction booklet and agile controller work gave me a well-earned payoff and feeling of satisfaction that I wont soon forget.", "date": "March 17, 2022"}
