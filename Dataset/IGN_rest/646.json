Heres what we said then: Despite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders 2 is simply a fun game. The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. Its a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for. Still, if you love action adventure games, its certainly worth checking out - but dont expect it to rival the masterpieces it will inevitably call to mind. Three years after its initial release, developer Vigils dark, massive, Zelda-like is back on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition. This current-gen remaster takes all of the puzzles, exploration, and loot-crazy action of the original game, packs in a wealth of DLC, and improves the whole package while running at 1080p and 60fps, making it the best version of the game. That said, its not necessarily worth revisiting for those whove already completed Deaths journey. Darksiders 2s kitchen-sink approach to gameplay and mechanics mostly holds up well. The combat is still very much inspired by God of Wars light, heavy, and airborne attacks, and slashing my way through masses of creatures feels nice and responsive, especially with the upgrade to 60fps. The inclusion of all of the DLC is a nice bonus, even if most of it is just a handful of new weapons and armor to add to your pile of hundreds that youll gather throughout the loot-heavy adventure. Traversing across the colorful world on horseback and grabbing dozens of quests from a slew of fantasy tropes creates an effective, if not entirely inspired flow that makes the adventure feel like a single-player MMORPG. While the visual improvements dont change the fact that the story is pretty dumb and relies a bit too heavily on the teenage angst of Death and his brothers, the varied environments make exploration an enjoyable experience, especially when you get into any of the many fantastic dungeons. Yes, the dungeons are clearly inspired by The Legend of Zeldas, but they unfold in interesting, satisfying ways. You solve smart puzzles that require paying attention to your surroundings, find keys through exploration, acquire a new weapon or tool that rewards you with a great sense of progression, then use that to ultimately slay a final boss. That being said, theres little here to make me want to take a second dip in the 30-hour adventure, so the Deathinitive Edition caters more to people who missed out on the game back in 2012. Pros Interesting dungeonsSolid loot progressionDiverse world Cons Dumb storyFew original ideas Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition brings the originals diverse world, interesting dungeons, and great loot system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sure, the story is dull, and there arent a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.", "date": "Nov. 3, 2015,"}
