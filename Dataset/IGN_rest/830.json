Not this one. Despite the challenging puzzles of Mario vs Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars later levels, we never really see anything new or different, and its big idea to encourage and reward community-designed levels is a bust, thwarted by cynical players. Tipping Stars plays out much like its likeable Mario vs Donkey Kong predecessors: guide Lemming-like toy versions of Mario characters through small hazardous areas. You have no direct control over their movements, but you can control their environments with your stylus to force them onto a safe path using girders, conveyor belts, pipes, springs and more. Its helpful that you can effectively pause the action while stretching out girders and conveyor paths to get their placement right, though I find it makes things a bit too easy to plan ahead in some levels. However, even with that advantage, getting gold-medal scores by collecting coins along the way requires expert timing. Some of the later levels had me frantically placing and picking up girders, blocks, and conveyor belts just moments before my mini-Mario wouldve careened over the edge of a spike-filled pit  and I loved every moment of it. What I didnt love was getting through the over 40 introductory levels that felt more like a series of simple mechanical tasks to be completed than puzzles I needed to think about to get past. Even when the challenge ramped up, though, I was never given the same sense of awe that tells me a puzzle game is something novel and special. As someone whos played previous Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, the lack of new ideas is disappointing. The highlight of Tipping Stars meager innovations is a cursed mini-Mario that wanders the map as a moving hazard until you whack him with a hammer, but even he never significantly changed the way a level played. Likewise, neither the 3DS nor Wii U versions take advantage of their touchscreens beyond simple stylus tapping and dragging. At least theres a lot of content, and more on the way. Each of the six main worlds teaches you a new mechanic or block to work with, and by the eighth and final stage of that world youll have to prove youve been paying attention. Add that to the two additional worlds unlocked later, and the three bonus worlds unlocked by earning gold trophies, and youll have a lot to learn and master. If that wasnt enough already, the level editor workshop makes its return, along with the new and improved community hub where you can upload and share levels across both the 3DS and Wii U. This is where Tipping Stars gets its name: you can both collect stars from completing a community-made stage, and give them to a stages creator as a tip for a job well done. These stars can be used to unlock more tools and cosmetic changes in the workshop. Using that to encourage people to build and post interesting levels to keep the puzzle love happening long into the future is a brilliant model... in theory. In practice, theres one tiny hiccup: as of writing, a quick glance at the top 50 popular stages (its hard to view anything other than that) shows that most are quick and easy levels designed to get you stars fast. And of course, who wouldnt give a Yeah rating to a stage that essentially gives you something for nothing, and helps unlock those bonuses right away? Theyre basically cheats, and its a shame when you think about the many smart amateur level designers out there who spend their time crafting challenging and creative levels for us to play, only for nobody to actually see it because its buried under countless crappy free-star levels. Thankfully, there is still one more place to look for challenge: The Nintendo Official Levels. Starting with the release of Tipping Stars, Nintendo has promised that two new levels will be uploaded by developers every week, for 50(!) weeks straight. One other notable thing about Tipping Stars is that its the first Nintendo game to offer of cross-buy, meaning a purchase for either the 3DS or Wii U will net you a code for the other platform. This is great in theory, until you find that it was meant to be played on small touchscreen with a stylus, so the Wii U version offers virtually no benefit over the portability of the 3DS  the screens a bit larger, but you cant take it with you. Thats not to say the Wii U version is entirely inferior, as families or friends can still gather around the TV to give tips, but Tipping Stars short but challenging level structure feels much more at home when you're on the go, waiting in line, or looking to kill some time. Pros Eventually challengingPost-launch contentLots of levels Cons Few new ideasStars easily exploited Whether youre a Mario vs. Donkey Kong series veteran or are diving into the toy-puzzle scene for the first time, Tipping Stars will (eventually) challenge you with tough stages to master, even if it doesnt exactly bring anything new of value to the table. Theres even more challenge and fun to be had via the community - but you need to dig through a mountain of nonsense to find it.", "date": "March 15, 2015"}
