Well, you know what they say about assuming: You and I get stuck playing mindless junk like this. It's not like developer Demiurge aimed low. There's plenty of potential in a lighthearted shooter inspired by old-school action games, especially when it's as flashy and full of content as this. The great ideas involved in Shoot Many Robots are easy to see, just not quite as clear as the anchors holding them back. It's too bad Shoot Many Robots blows its potential. There would have been a lot here to love if it didn't collapse under the weight of one mindless idea.. For a similar experience, watch this video for six hours. The most identifiable problem is the controls. Aiming and moving are both tied to the left stick, rather than split between the left and right. This makes running and gunning easy if you're looking forward, but aiming in a particular direction means you need to stop. Even stranger, you need to hold another button to aim. It's like playing old-school Resident Evil in 2D. Walk, stop, aim, fire. In an action game about shooting many robots, why should we have to fight the controls? They're the core means of surviving wave after wave of predictable bad guys. Not that twin-stick controls would alleviate the deeper issues at work here. Shoot Many Robots is as repetitive as games come. The endless waves of mostly unchanging enemies and recycled stages are a heavier burden than a good first impression can bear. Running right, stopping to shoot, and repeating for eight hours is hardly what I'd call a good time, never mind doing it all again on a harder difficulty. Co-op can't salvage Shoot Many Robots, either. Yes, it's more enjoyable to share the innate fun of causing carnage with your pals, but it's a chaotic mess. Enemies take so many hits to kill early on that my interest in punching and shotgunning robots faded with each encounter -- toward the end they take even longer. Robo-crabs come in such vast quantities that they're bound to overcome you, so everyone becomes a babysitter. Players not only need to look out for the swarms coming from all directions, but their fallen comrades. Without 'em, your team is probably screwed and forced to suffer replaying some lengthy battles. Boss battles have predictable patterns and take forever. It opens strong, though. The colorful art, goofy sense of humor, and riffs on cowboy/redneck themes give Shoot Many Robots a delightful aesthetic. The economy is likable as well. Slaughtering hundreds of robots means you score hundreds of dollars to buy sweet new wares. Goofy hats -- ranging from a sombrero to an astronaut helmet to a beer hat -- and ridiculous guns each comes with sharp, funny descriptions. Trouble is, the items usually aren't effective enough to keep up with Shoot Many Robots' pace. Bigger enemies came in larger numbers with each level. Worse, massive spawning structures that take five to 10 minutes to destroy are often replaced by another, leaving your group in a near-endless loop of massacring non-sentients. And for what? A funny backpack and flamethrower upgrade to use in a senseless side-scroller? CLOSING COMMENTS Shoot Many Robots lives (and mostly dies) by the old idea that the first 30 seconds is what grabs the player. In that time, Demiurge establishes a fun theme in a likable world, and shows the immediate reward for making a mess. What it ultimately comes down to is that Shoot Many Robots grabs hold hard and won't let go while it shoves an overwhelming amount of forgettable, often irritating action down your throat.
