At its heart its still about ship design and combat, and this time the execution is good enough that playing Space Admiral and ship designer ends up being enjoyable. But it's in service of a strategy game that overwhelmingly focuses on the ~exterminate~ portion of the 4X formula to the exclusion of all else, which ultimately makes StarDrive 2 feel a bit two dimensional. StarDrive 2 lifts a page from Total War's book by having tactical space and ground battles that occur separately from the turn-based 4X layer, on which you do the usual mix of exploration, colonization, planetary development, and diplomatic negotiation. But these pieces don't all fit together equally well, and tend to get in one anothers way. At its very best, StarDrive is a space admiralty simulator. There are a lot of different things to take into account when designing your fleet: the power draw of your weapons and engines, the weight of your armor and equipment, the output of your engines, and the overall maneuverability of your ships. It's an enjoyable exercise in trade-offs and forecasting; when I'm sitting there in the ship designer, I'm thinking about how the carrier I'm building is going to support the battleship I just designed, and how their protection from long-range missiles will rely on an electronic warfare cruiser I'm planning to design next. It's not just a case of slapping the latest and greatest technology onto the old templates (though you can easily exchange outmoded equipment if you need to). That's because StarDrive 2 cleverly offers you mutually exclusive research opportunities in groups of three. Once you've researched one technology from a trio, the other two are closed off to you, except through trade or conquest. That means that your rivals can have very different threat profiles that you need to take into account as you build your ships. Are you going to be fighting the Draylok, who have a lot of long-range missile technologies but seem to be lagging when it comes to close-range weaponry? Or are you more like to end up at war with the Kulrathi, who have big ships with lots of armor, but whose focus on energy weapons requires massive reactors and power capacitors? You'd want a different fleet for each fight, and guessing at the right balance is the most interesting challenge StarDrive 2 offers. The real-time combat in which all these plans come to fruition, however, is slightly less rewarding. The AI seems to beeline for your ships almost regardless of what weapons it has access to. My ship design choices still mattered, but most battles ended up turning into scrums as capital ships twisted and turned at close range, which made them far less tactically interesting than the ship designs imply. Still the best part. Where StarDrive 2 is least successful is when it comes to ground combat, which is a very simple turn-based combat game in which two armies line up on opposite sides of a grid and start marching at each other. While you can equip your troops with different weapons and items that give them special abilities, the ground combat mostly feels like a slow-motion math problem where firepower and weight of numbers take their toll. It feels like an afterthought. Outside of combat, StarDrive 2 is also a very familiar type of 4X, and this is where the results are decidedly mixed. The first game introduced a lot of the enjoyable goofy characters (like the Pollops, a race of sentient hippie plants) who are back for another round, and there are even more neat narrative touches and random events to spice things up. Menacing and mysterious aliens ships conduct raids on your territory, your generals might give you special quests, and you might encounter strange anomalies in space that will reward you if you investigate them. Minute-to-minute, StarDrive 2 can be a fun, if simple, strategy game. Take a wider view, however, and that simplicity proves very limiting  and at times a bit puzzling. There is no real concept of territory in StarDrive 2, despite some coloring on the starmap. You'll get a warning when you cross into another race's territory, but other races will colonize absolutely every rock they can lay their hands on, including planets in your home system. There are no diplomatic options to keep them from doing it, so you always end up with potentially hostile fleets cruising around your own space unless you lock everything down first. More like inevitably hostile, because all roads eventually lead to war in StarDrive 2, even without the help of randomly and at times suicidally aggressive AI faction behavior. That's a shame, because the diplomacy system has some great ideas that dont get a chance to pay off. Each trade you do with another faction consumes ~tolerance,~ so you can't just farm your best friends for technologies. Every race is a bit xenophobic, so you have to really think about what you want to ask them for in each negotiation. It really does feel like Im developing relationships with alien races who aren't too sure about me. But without victory conditions besides galactic deathmatch, eventually you're going to have to kill your friends. Pros Ship designSense of humorTechnology trade system Cons Extermination-only victoryLimited diplomacy options StarDrive 2 isn't anything but honest about what it is: it says, right at the start of the manual, that the goal is to conquer the galaxy. But the focus on extermination saps excitement and possibilities from the strategic level, and the tactical minigames dont have the AI needed to make the ship-building systems depth pay off. When betrayal and war are always inevitable, one game starts to feel much the same as another.", "date": "April 21, 2015"}
