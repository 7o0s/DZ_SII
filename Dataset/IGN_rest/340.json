Configurations for gaming mice are nearly limitless at this point, with models that offer more accurate sensors, an array of programmable buttons, lighting options, weights, and more. However, ultimately what works best for any individual gamer comes down to personal preference, so while some might prefer a mouse that looks like a Transformer, some want a simpler design. The SteelSeries Rival 300 ($49.99 on Amazon) is for those gamers who want a straight-forward, entry-level mouse tuned for accuracy without the sometimes overwhelming amount of features and buttons found in more specialized, and more expensive models. Ergonomics and Design The SteelSeries Rival 300 fit into my hand better than most of the other mice I've sampled over the years. The back of the mouse body fits into the palm of my hand exceptionally well, something a lot of other mice fail to do. As such, it feels more like resting my hand on it than it feels like I'm gripping something, and that's a good thing. Both sides offer a textured rubber surface that isn't quite as supple as I'd like, and it lacks the tackiness of something like the Razer Deathadder Chroma ($49.99 on Amazon). As comfortable as the Rival 300 fits in my hand, that textured grip on either side does tend to get a little uncomfortable after extended sessions of CS:GO. It would be nice if there was just a hair more ~give~ to the surface, because as it stands, it's tiny bit too firm. Right and left mouse buttons are ever-so-slightly contoured for comfort, and the mouse wheel scrolls smoothly, and it stops just where I wanted it to. The wheel's accuracy is aided by rubberized coating and small notches that kept my finger from slipping too. The coating on the mouse wheel would be really nice on the side grips since it's soft and grippy, but it's a bit of a contrast since the sides are so stiff. One odd but awesome feature is its swappable name plate. Directly behind the mouse wheel is a small programmable button that by default toggles DPI settings. It's a little tricky to reach. The back-and-forward buttons on the left side of the Rival 300 are easily accessible yet aren't placed in a way where I found myself pressing them accidentally. The Rival 300 uses SteelSeries' switches in its buttons, which is not surprising in the slightest but is something SteelSeries makes sure to point out. It claims the mouse buttons can survive over 30 million clicks. The right-and-left mouse buttons have a satisfying feel to them, with just the right amount of travel and a solid, audible click. However, the side buttons don't have the crisp feel of the other buttons. It's weird, and it feels like the switches are made from something entirely different than those used in the rest of the mouse. One odd but awesome, feature of the Rival 300 is its swappable name plate. At the back of the mouse is a oval, roughly inch-long piece of plastic that says ~RIVAL.~ The plate is removable and can be customized if you happen to have a 3D printer. I don't know how common 3D printer ownership is among gamers, but if you have one, you can print your own plate and snap into place. Like I said, it's odd, and yet, oddly cool. Software The SteelSeries Engine software for the Rival 300 is fairly robust and allows for a surprising amount of customization options. Since it's an RGB mouse you can choose from over 16 million different colors, and there are effects too, like ~breathing,~ ~color shift,~ or just a constant color. Breathing can be set to a single color or multiple colors, and the rate and pattern can be further tweaked to your liking. Another unique yet not really that useful feature is something called GameSense, which includes presets for different lighting effects based on things that happen in certain games. You configure the mouse to change colors based on events in-game, like low-health or kill-streaks. It's a cool feature, but I didn't it particularly useful since I'm watching the screen, not my mouse. However, in a tournament or LAN setting, it seems like it could be a fun way to show off to spectators. The software is easy to use. Overall the software with the Rival 300 is easy to use and has a slick interface. The mouse's DPI setting can be adjusted by manipulating gauges resembling speedometers, and a spline curve lets you tweak the acceleration and deceleration sensitivity. Using it feels like adjusting the settings on a modern supercar, even if the Rival 300 isn't quite the Ferrari of gaming mice. One feature missing from the software is the ability to adjust lift-off distance. It's kind of an odd thing to leave out of what's an otherwise well-rounded bit of customization software. The default lift-off distance is quite small, so it was never an issue for me personally, but if you like adjusting it, you're out of luck with the current version of the SteelSeries Engine. I also experienced a weird bug in that I was unable to install an updated firmware with the mouse plugged into a USB 2.0 port. A Google search told me I needed to have it plugged into a USB 3.0 port in order to get the firmware installation update process going, which was odd and inconvenient. Once I did that it updated, the mouse worked fine using any of the USB ports on my computer, but it was mildly frustrating, and hopefully a one-time deal. Gaming The SteelSeries felt accurate right out of the box, but adjusting the mouse acceleration and deceleration in the software, as well as tweaking the DPI, helped noticeably with my accuracy. The mouse wheel scrolling action is tuned perfectly too, to a point where I never found myself accidentally overshooting when swapping weapons. The SteelSeries Engine software also has an angle-snapping adjustment option too, which helps smooth out mouse movement along lines. I didn't like it though as it felt unnatural, but it could be useful in games that don't require precise aiming. It was overall very easy to use but felt like a pretty standard, accurate mouse instead of a new or particularly eye-opening experience. Purchasing Guide The SteelSeries Rival 300 has an MSRP of $59.99, but like a lot of PC hardware it can generally be nabbed at a discount. It's currently just $46-$50 on Amazon: See the SteelSeries Rival 300 on Amazon Note that if you click on one of these links to buy the product, IGN may get a share of the sale.
