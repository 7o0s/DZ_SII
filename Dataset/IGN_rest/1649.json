Venture Towns is Japanese iOS sim-maker Kairosoft's second city sim, following Oh! Edo Towns, released just five weeks earlier. In both titles players are tasked with developing a tiny town into a bustling metropolis, using tax dollars and other incoming funds. Unlike Edo Towns, the city players construct in Venture Towns is much more modern and westernized, allowing players to construct offices, stadiums, gyms and other modern-day sights. Like allKairosoft games, the ultimate goal is to make as much money as possible within the game's set time limit, with certain bonuses carrying over from game to game to encourage replay. Did we like it? Venture Towns' more relatable Western buildings make it a more enjoyable experience for English-speaking gamers when compared with Oh! Edo Towns. I relished saving up enough Research Points and dough to unlock and construct showcase constructions like Theme Parks and TV Stations. The combos also feel very intuitive  it makes sense to construct an Anime Shop, Game Store and Electronics Shop by one another, leading to plenty of combo-hunting fun. Unfortunately, Venture Towns' slow pace and lack of fresh ideas decreases the title's overall fun factor. Kairosoft released more than a half-dozen mobile sims in 2011, all of them feeling a little too similar to one another. Venture Towns feels doubly repetitive, since it follows the extremely similar Oh! Edo Towns. It does have a revamped job system, with citizens discovering careers like Pop Singer, Pastry Chef, and Gambler, but this doesn't significantly impact the experience. The game's slow pace doesn't do it any favors either. Money accumulates very slowly, causing me to spend less time playing and more time waiting to earn enough bank to place my next building. Should you buy it? Despite its shortcomings, Venture Towns is still a cute and addictive city sim. Gamers new to Kairosoft will find the experience very addictive, and are likely to fall down the ~just one more month~ rabbit hole time and time again. But gamers that have experienced Kairosoft's other titles won't find much new here, and can safely skip the title. CLOSING COMMENTS Due to its slow pace, Venture Towns is far from Kairosofts strongest effort, but neither is it the companys worst. Its still very possible to lose several hours watching your tiny pixel empire. Still, I hope Kairosoft has some fresh ideas on deck for 2012.
