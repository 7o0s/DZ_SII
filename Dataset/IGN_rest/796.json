This dungeon-crawlers gameplay is fundamentally tied to its music. You move on the beat, and so too do your enemies, making every encounter an elaborate dance. Get the steps right and its a thing of beauty. Of course, being a roguelike, the penalties for getting them wrong can be severe, and you can very quickly find yourself starting again. The beauty of Crypt of the NecroDancers central concept, however, is that every run is essentially a series of puzzles to be solved. Sure, theres plenty of randomness, and theres no denying that picking up a bad-ass weapon, some armour, a sweet charm and some health-restoring food can make a journey into the NecroDancers lair a whole lot easier, but theres predictability within the randomness: enemy movements follow the same rules each time, so defeating them is all about knowing the steps. Youre actually doing more of a nervous jig than a dance as you hop from tile to tile, puzzle solving to the beat. As the music plays your enemies come ever closer, forcing you to find and exploit an opening before its too late. The rules of engagement are pretty simple. If you and an enemy both try and hop onto the same tile on the same beat youll take damage. Instead, you want to move so youre adjacent to an enemy, which then lets you attack. Youll only take damage if the enemy then tries to jump into your tile and doesnt die from your attack. Its pretty cool working out how to outmanoeuvre NecroDancer's varied bestiary. The dirt walls within each dungeon can be dug out, for instance, which is great from an exploration/discovery perspective, but it also enables you to dig buffer  to dig a dirt tile out and thus stay stationary for a beat. Need to let an enemy jump one tile closer while you stay in the same spot? This is the way to do that without losing your coin multiplier. The gameplay, then, is entirely geared around manipulating enemy movement patterns so that you can safely attack. This might be about knowing that an enemy jumps forward one square every four beats, which enables you to jump in and attack twice before jumping away and having it follow so you then have three more beats to finish it off. Monkeys move on every beat, while red dragons can one-shot you from across the screen. Each failed run teaches you more about how each enemy moves, which then  hopefully  makes it easier to execute your dance of death next time. Cleverly, though, Crypt of the NecroDancers randomly generated dungeons never let you get too complacent. The music changes with each floor you descend within a zone, for instance, forcing you to adjust to a new tempo. Each of the four zones also has its own set of enemies and its own gameplay tweaks, and ends in a randomly chosen boss fight, making it its own distinct challenge. Every level in Zone 3, for instance, is divided into fire and ice sections, with music that shifts in tone depending on which one youre in. There are ice creatures that leave behind frozen tiles which you slip across, adding another wrinkle to kiting enemies correctly, while the lava tiles that appear in the wake of fire monsters will deal damage if you walk on more than one in a row. Ice tiles can also be melted to create water tiles, which are their own obstacle. Zone 4, on the other hand, sees the digging mechanic change so that its multiple tiles at a time, changing how buffering works but also allowing the player to knock down the scarabs that perch atop walls. Here you also have enemies that parry attacks, drop live bombs when defeated and teleport the player. Each zone, then, requires its own approach and knowledge-base, but even when youve got something of a handle on enemy movement patterns, Crypt of the NecroDancer still offers up a good challenge. No two games will ever be the same, and when the soundtrack is bumping along and you have to quickly appraise a room and execute a sequence with multiple enemies all moving to their own beat, its all too easy to mess up. The fire and ice theme is great - particularly its impact on the soundtrack. The right loot can really help, and can also drastically change the feel of the gameplay. Broadswords can do damage to adjacent tiles for instance, whereas the crossbow can fire up to four tiles ahead, but needs to be reloaded  on the beat. You can also expand your viewing range with torches, upgrade your shovel so it can dig through tougher walls, put on armour to raise your base defence stats, eat food to restore health, pick up a wide variety of spells, expand your health or carrying capacity, wear a number of charms and crowns, find dungeon maps and so on. And of course, youre deciding what to pick up and what to buy while hopping back and forth, adding somewhat comical pressure to even the act of gearing up. Is an obsidian rapier better than a golden whip? Is it worth swapping my pick-axe for a glass shovel given it will shatter when I take damage? Is the Ring of Charisma better than the Ring of Luck? There are just so many variables here, and like most roguelikes youre always in search of that dream run, where you get helpful gear that makes pushing through the area youre in more straightforward. Its entirely possible to get by with just the dagger, but what a difference a bit of reach and some armour makes. After all, death can come very very swiftly in Crypt of the NecroDancer. All it really takes is getting a single strong enemys attack pattern wrong and youre dead. And starting all over again. Well, mostly. NecroDancer does have a meta game, where you spend diamonds earned during runs on gear that directly upgrades you  like extra starting life  or on items that will then appear within the game. It helps keep the game evolving, but unlike a game like Rogue Legacy  where you have a long road of small incremental upgrades to make over the course of the game that gradually improve your chances - youll run out of things to spend your diamonds on before too long here. Zone 4 is pure chaos. Thats a little disappointing given diamonds are a core collectable, but it does make sense given NecroDancers overall design philosophy. This game, after all, is driven by the pursuit of tactical metronomic movement, and its longevity comes from twisting the core gameplay with the many unlockable characters. Theres the Monk, for instance, who is killed instantly if he picks up gold, but can choose one free item from the merchant each time he appears. Theres the pacifist, Dove, who doesnt kill enemies  just confuses them with the flower she wields  and for whom the exits are always unlocked and there are no boss battles. Theres Eli, who takes a page out of Bombermans book, with no weapons, just infinite bombs, which he can kick at enemies. And then theres Melody, who wields a golden lute, which only does damage when shes adjacent to enemies, demanding a completely different approach to combat. With ten playable characters in all, each offers up quite a unique challenge. The one Ive spent the most time using other than Cadence  the starter character  is actually the Bard, as he effectively makes the game turn-based. Global movement remains tied to the beat, but you no longer have to move in time with the backing track. What that means is that the music plays as per normal, but if youre not moving, the gameworld is effectively frozen. Move a tile and everything moves forward a step. Hop through the map at pace and everything else moves in fast motion. Its a cool twist because it means you can puzzle out how to defeat each level without the time pressure of having to move on every actual beat. It makes you a puppet master, in other words. And yet I still die over and over. Theres more here too. Mod support is baked right in. Theres a level editor. The final game has three versions of the soundtrack to switch between  and you can set the soundtrack on a character by character basis. Not only that, but you can allocate your own music as the soundtrack, which is every bit as cool as it sounds. You can play local co-op with a friend, you can take on a daily challenge, you can practice against every enemy and every boss using every weapon. Oh, and hey, you want to literally dance your way through the game? Theres an easier mode for anyone with a dance mat. Bosses riff on the dancing theme, and aren't overly punishing. Pros Brilliant conceptOptions galoreSoundtrack(s)Varied characters Cons Diamonds lose value From a distance, Crypt of the NecroDancer seems like a very mathematical game. The logic used to dispatch enemies should ideally play out like a neat algorithm, flawlessly executed once you know their patterns and how to manipulate them. Thats not how it works, of course, as the dungeons are complicated, chaotic things, and players are forced to move at the whim of the soundtracks tempo, with little room for error. Logic meets chaos. Its a tension evident in many games, and its exemplified wonderfully here.", "date": "April 22, 2015"}
