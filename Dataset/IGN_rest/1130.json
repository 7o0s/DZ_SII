That's good news and bad news, because while Freeze's motivations are some of Batman's rogue's gallery's most sympathetic, this version sadly seems to have virtually no interest in putting a new spin on it. It's almost identical to the Batman: The Animated Series episode Heart of Ice, so if you've seen that (and you should) there are no surprises. It begins in the absurdly cavernous Wayne Manor and then briefly returns to the Penguins club, but the bulk of its two hours takes place in a pretty generic gray-and-blue cryogenic research lab. There you fight through a few predator encounters, one of which is fairly tough, and the usual brawls with a good variety of enemies. (Fortunately they barely call in the overused big brutes at all.) My favorite thing in Cold, Cold Heart, though, is the new freeze-ray thugs. Theyll encase you in ice if you hold still, but their attacks can be turned to your advantage if you dodge at the right moment and cause them to rake the beam over other henchmen. The bulky new thermal Batsuit looks pretty cool, in that Batman needs a custom suit for every situation sort of way. It unfortunately doesnt change how the Shock Gauntlets (now Thermal Gauntlets) work, though. They still pretty much defeat the purpose of this otherwise excellent combat by letting you just punch everybody in the face, regardless of what weapon or armor theyre carrying. I continued to avoid using them. Oddly, Cold, Cold Heart does away with the Glue Grenade gadget, but doesnt replace it with Arkham Citys Cryo Grenade (which was presumably changed in Origins because Mr. Freeze wasnt around yet). It just gives you one fewer weapon to work with. The boss battle with Mr. Freeze is mostly a retread of what we saw in Arkham City, but a bit tougher. Its a good fight, if nothing terribly novel except for icicles you can drop on his head by tossing a heated Batarang at them. After that, there are a handful of new collectibles in the form of frozen citizens that need thawing, but it actually doesnt allow you to revisit the northern part of the Gotham map. At least you dont have to cross that stupid bridge anymore. Pros More BatmanFreeze-ray thugsPredator fights Cons Unoriginal storyThermal Gauntlets More Batman is always good, and freeze rays change up brawls in an interesting way, but Im disappointed that Cold, Cold Heart doesnt do anything new with Mr. Freezes story or boss battle.", "date": "April 27, 2014"}
