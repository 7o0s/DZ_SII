The original Yeti is arguably one of the most well-regarded USB microphones for podcasting and streaming, but the brand new Yeti Nano (See it on Amazon) offers many of the originals great features in a much smaller package. I spent some time recording with the Yeti Nano to see if its worth an upgrade for existing Yeti users, or even those just looking for a decent mic to start podcasting and streaming. Blue Yeti Nano  Design and Features While the original Yeti is an excellent USB microphone, it certainly lived up to its name with its huge size. The Yeti Nano, as the name implies, is a smaller USB microphone with a similar design. Overall, I would say the Nano is about half the size of the original. For the most part, thats a good thing. A smaller, lighter mic offers less weight on a shock mount or boom stand, and packing it up into a bag for field recording is much easier. But on the negative side, the Nano doesnt have the height to feel as comfortable as a desktop mic. The included stand is wonderfully sturdy, but I found this little mic works better on a mic stand to be the right distance from my mouth. Luckily, Blue included an adapter that makes the Nano compatible with just about any stand or mount. The volume dial on the mics frontassuming youre using the 3.5mm headphone port on the underside of the Nano for monitoring audiois actually an improvement over the old model. This dial has a smoother rotation and muting the mic takes a simple press. When the mic is hot, the dial features a green LED ring. When its muted, the ring turns red. The finish on the mic itself is very attractive with a smooth metallic surface offered in a range of four colors, including grey, red, gold, and blue. If your mic is going to show up on-screen while streaming, youll be hard pressed to find a better looking option. Under the hood, the Nano includes a dual-capsule design for capturing audio in either cardioid (for recording narration and podcasts), or omnidirectional (for recording multiple speakers or environmental audio). Personally, I feel like these are basically the only two settings any podcaster or streamer is going to need, but this a step down from the original Yeti. That model offers both of the Nanos capsules, as well as options for bidirectional and stereo. In any case, the Nano is much improved when it comes to selecting cardioid or omni sound, thanks to a super convenient push button on the mics back and indicator lights showing which mode youre using. The original Yeti was a real pain in that department and if you spent much time switching modes, it was easy to set the mic to the wrong setting. Another missing feature on the Yeti Nano is a gain adjustment knob. Depending on your recording setup, the gain knob can make a big difference in how your audio sounds. Since the Yeti is a semi-pro mic, and is closer in audio capture to an XLR-input mic than a cheap USB model, you can easily blow our a recording due to its sensitivity. While the original Yeti has a gain knob built in, the Yeti Nano requires softwareappropriately called Sherpato make those adjustments. I almost never touch the gain knob for my setup, but it is a hassle having to open an app to make those adjustments. Blue Yeti Nano  Setup and Recording If theres one thing I want from a USB mic, its simple plug-and-play setup. And once again, Blue has delivered on that promise with the Yeti Nano. I hooked this mic up to both a MacBook Pro and Windows 10 desktop and encountered absolutely zero issues. On the Mac, the Nano was ready to go from the jump in GarageBand and setup was just as simple using Adobe Audition on my PC. Windows 10 did of course require me to set the Yeti as the default input, but thats also simple enough. Amazingly, even without Blues Sherpa software installed, everything just worked as it shouldbeyond adjusting gain, obviously. The Sherpa app was, for my use, kind of unnecessary. But on the bright side, its extremely easy to use and works flawlessly. Theres a simple menu for selecting cardioid or omni capture (albeit you can do that with the press of a button on the mic), and theres a slider for adjusting the volume (again, theres a knob on the mic). Similarly, gain is set in the Sherpa app using a slider and is straightforward. The software also makes it very easy to update firmware, should it be needed. The Yeti Nano is capable of recording audio in a 24 bit, 48Hz format, a jump up from the 16bit original Yeti. In terms of what that means in the real world though, I honestly couldnt tell much of a difference, but the Nano sounded great. Cardioid vocal tracks sounded very crisp and much like the original Yeti, the high and mid-range was excellent as well. The Nano does a decent job of recording low-end tones in a deeper voice, too, but I wouldnt refer to the captured audio as very bassy. Generally speaking, that high and mid-range clarity is what I want from a vocal mic anyway. What I did notice is the Nano seems to handle vocal popsthat puff noise when a speaker says a word beginning with the letter P, for examplemuch better than its bigger brother. In any case, a pop filter is highly recommended, but I was fairly impressed with how well the Nano handled the issue. Purchasing Guide The Blue Yeti Nano has an MSRP of $99.99, and since it just came out thats what it's listed for on Amazon: See it at Amazon Blue continues its dominance of the USB podcasting mic space with the Yeti Nano. The smaller size is generally a bonus, and while theres a few features missing due to its shrinkage, the sound quality is hard to beat in any mic in this price range. If youre streaming or podcasting, and want something easy to use, this is the mic for you.", "date": "Sept. 5, 2018,"}
