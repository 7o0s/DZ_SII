But with its big 2.0 revamp, Call of Duty: Warzone has made some admirable efforts toward inspiring us to work together, communicate, and socialize even as we fight to be the last ones standing. Some of its other new ideas dont pay off quite as well, such as the relatively bland new map and its ill-advised backpack system. But even if you put all of that aside, the introduction of an excellent new PvPvE mode is more than reason enough to round up a squad and drop back into Warzone for a few matches. After all, the real victory screen might just be the friends we made along the way. Xbox Series X . . 1,929.00 View on Amazon  The first thought-provoking new social idea is that you can actually recruit enemy players to your team in squad-based lobbies if you end up losing a teammate at any point. This is a clever way to give weakened teams or solo stragglers a fighting chance, and to keep more people invested in a match for longer. Its also just fun to make friends in a battle royale, though its an idea that might work better on paper than in practice. Most people still tend to open fire on sight, so Ive yet to successfully convince anyone to join my team, but the fact that I can at least try is a fun addition on its own. The Unhinged Trios mode even lets you invite up to six people to be on your team mid-match, living up to its name in the chaos that creates. Well, that it could create  a lot of people dont really seem to want to play with six people on a team and would often just not work together. I guess we all took it to heart when our parents told us you cant trust anyone on the internet, and you mostly see people playing Unhinged Trios as normal trios. I still liked it just fine in that context too, but the actual gameplay mechanic of it being a squad building simulator was a little disappointing when no one really wanted to participate in that aspect. New Stomping Grounds Our new battleground, Al Mazrah, is an interesting map to explore thanks to its many cities full of buildings to loot from and 18 points of interest, from a literal fortress to airports and even a mining city. That said, the vast stretches of terrain between those exciting locales arent quite as varied, and I felt like I was really just looking at a lot of sandy and beige backgrounds as I ran through the map. I understand Al Mazrah is a take on a realistic region with cities and industrial areas sprinkled throughout, but the fact that buildings and houses in those cities all look so similar and the same color palette is applied through the entire map makes it less pretty to look at than a lot of other current battle royale arenas. Apex Legends and Fortnite, by contrast, have extremely varied terrain (and even weather), particularly with Apexs Worlds Edge that contains snow, lava, and urban landscapes splayed out in one single map. However, Al Mazrah is the biggest map Warzone has seen to date, allowing it to comfortably accommodate 150 players, and it has some new cool water passageways throughout that let you travel via boat alongside land and air vehicles. I like that it opens up travel options to water because it means youre not always forced to take a car or attempt to grab a helicopter from an extremely exposed location. It also gives us more options for escape routes, especially since the waterways take different turns through the map from roads. I've enjoyed the twist of having to constantly watch the map and pivot my movement in less predictable ways. The areas between each cluster of buildings are pretty open and really demonstrate how big the map is when youre on foot and trying to run from one location to another. This couldve been a problem, but with the way Warzone 2.0 has reworked the ever-tightening circle its not too big of a deal. The original Warzone had a traditional single safe circle; in 2.0, theres a chance for that one circle to split into three that are spread across the map, forcing you to scramble to the closest one to survive. The three circles will then collapse back into one for the final minutes of a match, forcing the survivors among all three isolated groups to finally face off in one area. This is a fresh and unique approach to the battle royale format, and Ive enjoyed the twist of having to constantly watch the map and pivot my movement in less predictable ways. Even better is when my team and I find good buildings to hunker down in and try and pick off stragglers who werent paying attention to the splits. Gulag 2.0 Warzone 2.0 also brought in a novel new take on the Gulag mode (where you go when youre knocked out of the main match) in which you may be paired up with a random enemy in a temporary truce, so you have to make nice with a stranger to get a second chance at life. Its clever, but it did get a little frustrating since communicating with your random teammate isnt exactly consistent, sometimes leaving me feeling like I was really fighting a 1v2. Also, if you get sent to the Gulag and find theres only one other player there, you often times cant get into a full Gulag match  once the timer runs out you simply get kicked back onto the battlefield. So while this new system is interesting, I still prefer the old 1v1 Gulag because you could rely on yourself and match times were short. However, one fun change in the Gulag is that you dont necessarily have to beat all the enemy players to get back into the match. Instead, everyone can band together to take down an AI-controlled Juggernaut Jailer that jumps into the arena after a certain amount of time has passed; if youre successful, everybody who is still alive can redeploy. Alternatively, you can continue to try for a full enemy team wipe as chaos ensues  and predictably, most of the time people have opted for the bloodthirsty option of killing each other in the hopes of a selfish revival. I also had a match where the Jailer actually ended up taking out the last enemy player for me and I got redeployed with my teammate, so the new variation of the Gulag certainly has some really fun moments when it works properly. Hopefully over time well see people team up against the common foe more often. Hold Your Friends Close, and Keep Your Enemies on Proximity Chat One of the best new additions in Warzone 2.0 is proximity chat, which allows anybody who gets close enough to listen in on your voice coms. Thats a fun and sneaky experience that you dont get very often in battle royales. I could, for example, hear a team in the building next door discussing how they could hear me and my teammate looting, giving away their location when they might otherwise have gotten the drop on me. Warzone has always had death comms where youd hear the enemy players mic just after youd killed them, which is a fun way to revel in their defeat, but proximity chat really changes that in an interesting way. Proximity chat has made the whole experience of Warzone so much better. Proximity chat is one of those mechanics I didnt think an FPS or battle royale needed but its made the whole experience of Warzone so much better. Because Warzone is crossplay, you can sometimes hear people unknowingly playing with their mics open on their controllers once you get near them. Ive had some fun conversations with enemies too, just talking to them casually and butting into conversations, or throwing playful banter around as we try to hunt each other down. Its also allowed for some really funny moments where people will get creative with it and, say, pose as taxi drivers for otherwise hostile players in a temporary truce and exchange money for rides around the map. What We Said About Call of Duty: Warzone In spite of the serious concessions to depth made in the name of instant gratification, Call of Duty: Warzones beta remains thoroughly enjoyable. The battle royale formula is intact, albeit some of the aspects that usually make it so exciting and replayable are muted here. Id love to see a reason to try something other than my Modern Warfare multiplayer loadout in the future given how easy it is to acquire, and think that the armor plate system and gulag are in need of revision. But my time spent in Verdask was still supremely fun even if the how and the why of it didnt matter all that much. - James Duggan, March 20, 2020 Score: 7 Read the full Call of Duty: Warzone review Proximity chat has really made Warzone feel like a lively battleground with the constant reminder that the players youre fighting against for survival are other humans. Of course, this doesnt always mean those interactions will be great  Ive gotten some less-than-tasteful remarks and overheard certain conversations Id rather not have. But most of the time its a fun option to turn on if youre interested in being social or hearing when enemies are nearby to get a slight advantage. Stilted Lootin then Shootin Im less enthusiastic about Warzone 2.0s new lootable backpacks, which allow you to carry more items without sacrificing ammo and armor plate space. Its certainly a bold choice for Call of Duty because Apex Legends similar tiered backpack system has been a topic of contentious debate among that community  rather than having to find them as loot, should we just have bigger backpacks on drop or be able to craft one consistently? Having limited slots in a backpack is a bit annoying. After playing with it in Warzone 2.0, I have to side more with the latter camp. Ive found myself frustrated when Im running out of ammo or armor plates because I couldnt carry enough with the standard backpack and wasnt able to find an ammunition replenishment crate or armor supply crate to carry as backups. Previously, ammo and inventory management wasnt really an issue since you could just collect the max amount for each type and auto-fill your tactical and lethal equipment as well. Having limited slots in a backpack is a bit annoying, especially now that in order to loot specific items you have to click on what youre looting, say a box or an enemys dropped backpack, and individually click on what you want to take or swap. This slows down the looting process and can mean an aggravating death if youre looking through an enemys backpack and suddenly need to swap guns or ammo. Its just made gameplay more sluggish, and it feels like a step back from the original Warzone where you could simply run over things, loot quickly, and proceed with your game. Additionally, the armor vests have been changed so that you only get slot-two armor plates on drop, forcing you to loot a higher value three-plate vest just to be protected at max capacity. One nice thing about this change is that when you hit an enemy you get an indication as to what armor theyre wearing: blue hitmarkers reveal an enemy has the two-plate vest and purple indicates a three-plate. This gives you more information as youre making the split-second decision on how you want to approach the enemy  if they have better gear than you, a hasty retreat might be a better idea. A revised ping system has finally caught Warzone up to other battle royales. Elsewhere, a revised ping system has finally caught Warzone up to other battle royales, which was long overdue. It gives you a whole wheels worth of options for how youd like to point out enemies, allowing you to play without having to be on voice chat. Even when I am, though, I like to use it to point out specifically where I saw an enemy by Double-tapping the ping button. Highlighting an enemy with a live ping, where the ping moves with a tagged enemy for a short amount of time, is especially useful and nice to have. Also, if you wanted to avoid being overheard on proximity chat, this could double as a stealth tactic. Its only improved the gameplay of Warzone 2.0. Microtransaction Reaction The biggest disappointment of Warzone 2.0s launch event and Season One was in its roughly $10 battle pass. Theres a free track and a paid track for unlocks, but both use a new system that Im not really sold on. You have to go through specific sectors on the battle map that items are now locked in. It operates a lot like how Fortnites battle pass works, forcing you to unlock one tier or sector before moving on to the next. I dont like either, since it overcomplicates things with having to earn unlock tokens just to claim anything in individual sectors. Just give me a straight battle pass line where I can see what Im unlocking next without giving me five different menus to click through to get to what I want. Its as confusing to look at as it is to actually obtain rewards. The launch season battle pass also doesnt have a lot of rewards I expect most people would care about: The operator skins are lackluster and the weapon blueprints are merely fine. Luckily, this is a free-to-play game so you dont need to buy anything to play Warzone 2.0 or DMZ, but its still disappointing to see such dull paid content. Despite everything thats been improved, the overall user interface of Warzone 2.0 has left a lot to be desired, especially since things seem to have been made complicated for no reason. The gunsmiths unlocks work by progressing through a new gun family tree called Platforms. You have to hit specific weapon levels within a Platform to unlock new Receivers, weapons in its line. For example, if you unlock the M4, you can open the progression tab and see youve got two tracks to unlock the 556 Icarus or the FTAC Recon. Its very visually confusing, though thankfully not a huge deal overall as you still unlock guns really quickly just by playing Warzone or the new DMZ mode. In fact, DMZ is the best option for unlocking and leveling guns since you can pick up any weapon and level them just by having them in your loadout. DMZ is the best option for unlocking and leveling guns. DMZ pushes Warzone beyond the traditional battle royal crowd as Call of Dutys take on an extraction mode. No doubt inspired by the success of games like Escape from Tarkov, DMZ has strongholds stocked with big groups of NPCs located throughout the map that you can infiltrate, which keeps rounds from ever feeling like they are lacking gunfights  and of course theres a server of up to 66 players or 22 three-man human teams vying for the same targets. Its a really fun and refreshing change of pace between rounds of battle royale. Since it also takes place on Al Mazrah, Ive found that DMZ is a great way to explore and get familiar with its locations. It also has its own set of faction missions you can complete for XP bundles and additional rewards like weapon blueprints, calling cards, operator skins, and others. You can select up to three missions at a time from the factions: Legion (the easiest difficulty to complete), White Lotus (medium difficulty), and Black Mous (hard difficulty). I thoroughly enjoyed strategizing with my teammates about which missions we could work to complete together since the entire team can help  if the mission calls for you to destroy six vehicles, anyone on your team could destroy a vehicle and it would count towards your completion. Mission systems like this are really nice for adding replayability and direction to a PvPvE mode since that format can sometimes get stale without any clearly stated goals. Ive kept coming back to DMZ over Warzone due to it being so easy to just queue into and play, without all the commitment of a full 25 to 30-minute battle royale match. You control the match length since you can opt to extract at any point, or try to hold out for the final extraction time at the end. Even if I dont get an extraction and lose the items I had collected, I dont feel discouraged because the experience of DMZ with your squad is just so fun on its own. Being able to run around, explore, and rampage through AI enemies on Al Mazrah is a fresh break from the battle royale survival tactics. You can breathe, have fun, and focus on completing missions for rewards you share across your Warzone account rather than always trying to be the last person standing. That shared progression in particular really encouraged me to put more time into DMZ without feeling like I was neglecting my Warzone unlocks. Building on the already rock-solid foundation of the original Warzone, Warzone 2.0 is a positive update to Call of Dutys battle royale mode, even with few drawbacks of its own. Its new map isnt the most exciting outside of being the biggest ever brought to Warzone, but great additions like proximity chat and an updated ping system change things up and bring new life to the struggle for survival. And while adding backpacks as lootable gear may have slowed down looting in general, the new take on the Gulag creates some memorable moments if you can convince your fellow prisoners to team up against a common enemy for the greater good. And, as an added bonus, the new DMZ extraction mode revitalizes Warzone by appealing to people who might not want to sweat through full battle royale matches every time, but still want to level weapons and get a quick taste of that fight for survival.", "date": "Dec. 10, 2022,"}
