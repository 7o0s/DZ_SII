Massive Chalice, though, overdoses on that good thing. Its Game of Thrones-meets-XCOM concept is a good one, but when your soldiers can be suddenly struck down not just by a lucky shot from an enemy but also by natural causes like hereditary heart disease, and entire castles can be destroyed by unpredictable events on the strategic map, theres an overabundance of opportunities to lose one of these long 300-year campaigns through no fault of your own. At first, setting up multiple noble houses representing character classes and then cross-breeding them to create hybrid classes through arranged marriages seems like a fantastic idea for a strategic management layer of a squad-tactics game. Hitch a melee-focused Caberjack to a stealth-ranged Hunter, and their offspring is a Shadowjack who can sneak up on enemies and bash their faces in at close range. Wed that same Caberjack to an area-of-effect Alchemist, and you get a Boomstriker with a powerful shotgun-like short-range attack cone. Combine that with various armor and weapon variations that can put a spin on how a class behaves in combat, such as crossbows that penetrate through multiple targets, and theres a huge range of combat roles. The problem is that this system gets extremely complicated very quickly, and because we see so many characters and multiple generations born and die over the course of a game, few of the many details heaped onto them seem to be worth paying attention to. With randomly assigned gender, stat-modifying positive and negative genetic traits (such as brainy or sickly), and learned personality traits (eg rebel or lone wolf) applied to dozens of very mortal people who can die at virtually any time in or out of combat, characters are too disposible to be memorable. And annoyingly, the ability to custom-name bloodlines was restricted to Kickstarter backers before release, so you cant add your own family name or that of your friends or customize your characters in any cosmetic way. When you get into combat, Massive Chalices combat mechanics are novel and interesting in that unlike similar games that encourage you to take cover and dig in, it fully embraces the concept of a strong offense as the best defense. Killing or stunning as many enemies as possible is the only real means of preventing them from dealing damage, and that forced me to charge into action, which took me out of the defensive-minded comfort zone Id established in XCOM: Enemy Unknown (from which Massive Chalice apparently borrows its two-move-per-character-per-turn system). Mastering the use of knockback to stun multiple enemies by bashing them into each other like pool balls prompted me to think carefully about positioning my five-soldier squad. Enemy designs are excellent, too, in that theres no enemy who simply attacks and does damage. The most basic, the Seeds, can sap your life, and kamikazi Ruptures will stain the ground with armor-corroding goo. Bullwarks fire projectiles that can pass through multiple targets (the AI knows how to make use of this!) and have skin that hardens after the first hit in a turn, while Lapses can steal your XP with a hit. Most of all, though, I love to hate the Wrinklers  their ability to sap the youth of a hero with every swipe of their scythe-like appendages is terrifying and uniquely suited to Massive Chalices premise. And unlike most wounds, which are automatically healed after a battle (or with healing items), you can never get that time back. The downside is that the minimalist art style makes most of these enemies look lumpy and undetailed. On top of that, there are random text-based story events that pop up as you advance time, presenting you with decisions about conflicts between your heroes or random peasants who come to visit your court. As far as I can tell, no matter what dialogue option you choose, these are little more than coin flips for whether youll get a positive or negative effect. Even trying to opt out by sending the person away instead of taking the apparently good or evil option can result in crippling consequences - if a territory on the map is already teetering on the brink of being lost to the enemy, randomly adding a point of corruption can remove it from the board. I finally swallowed my pride and went down to Normal difficulty, which still suffered the excessive randomness problem but didnt advance the enemy strength quite as quickly, and blew through it on the first try. Obviously it can be beaten on higher difficulties, but the margin for error is annoyingly slim for a game that imposes so many setbacks on you. Pros Aggressive tacticsMarriage systemCreative enemies Cons Too many random elementsUnattractive art In Massive Chalice, its not just random whether your hero will hit or miss, but whether your hero will die of old age or whether theyll be born at all. As much as I enjoyed its aggressive brand of tactical combat and interesting enemy types, there are too many unpredictable variables outside your control, and too much happening to too many quickly aging, mortal characters for this tactical game to feel like decisions matter.", "date": "July 9, 2015,"}
