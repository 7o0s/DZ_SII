Some of its five bundled games are great demonstrations of what the PlayStation VR can do, but the others are throwaways that Ill quickly forget I played. The star of the show is The London Heist. Aside from a brief puzzle scene in which you open a safe to steal a diamond, its little more than a shooting gallery with the Move controllers. There's one scene about shooting your way out of a robbery gone wrong and another where you ride shotgun in the getaway car and blast away at pursuers. Shooting is simple, but the experience of firing a virtual gun with a Move controller is still a great novelty, and reloading by popping magazines into your gun with the other hand is satisfying. It's a little annoying that there's no ammo counter for your gun to warn you when you're running low, but that made me try to keep track of how many shots I'd fired and made it slightly less mindless. Simply shooting things is far more fun this way than it is with a traditional game controller, so I can forgive a lack of significant enemy or weapon variety. Surrounding the gunfights, The London Heist is dressed up with impressive cinematic monologs from a pair of highly detailed gangster characters. Theyre well acted and impressively animated as they argue and posture, and though I didn't have enough time to get attached to them as characters in the short running time I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me asking for a light for their cigar or threatening me in a subway service station. After the hour-long storys done theres a set of three shooting gallery levels with leaderboards to play on. Free of the need to make things fit into a serious story, these ranges have a lot more fun with the idea: they throw in elements like friendly targets and paint cans moving along tracks that you have to shoot at the right time to knock them into appropriately colored bins. There's some replay value in setting high scores on there, which is good, because that's about all the replay value that PlayStation VR Worlds has to offer. Scavengers Odyssey, for instance, is a short and linear first-person shooter where you use the DualShock 4 to pilot a mech suit through a story of uninteresting sci-fi mysticism. Enemy variety is weak  only three aliens, counting the final boss, and a stationary turret  and there are only two weapons including a gravity gun, so combat is bland. The best thing about it is launching yourself between platforms, which I enjoyed for the sensation of movement as you trigger a leap to a pre-designated spot, and for the ability to double-jump and change directions mid-air. But its over in less than two hours, and theres no reason Id want to play it again. Danger Ball is basically first-person Pong for the VR era, and controlling your paddle by looking where you want it to go works great. This is the kind of game that can only really work with stereoscopic 3D, because you need to be able to tell how far away the incoming ball is, and the PlayStation VR handles that well. I was able to time the impact well enough to do a last-second flick of my head to put some English on the ball and make it curve in a direction of my choosing, which often threw off the AI player and scored an easy point. The different opponents do shake things up with unique powers, such as being able to launch two balls at you at once or a shield you need to break down before you can get it by them. However, they're not too bright, and it only took a couple of tries to beat the tournament mode. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents directly instead of just through the leaderboard on the simple score-chase mode, this one will be short-lived. VR Luge is about as simple and arcadey as you can get. You're put in the perspective of a luge racer coasting down busy streets, dodging cars by looking right and left. I think the biggest disappointment, besides the fact that head-on collisions with trucks barely slow you down, is that I didn't get as much of a sense of speed as I'd expected from being inches off the ground and allegedly moving at over 100 miles per hour. Theres some scenery and spectacle, but not much gameplay variety - youre just dodging left and right using your head. Ocean Descent isnt a game, but an interesting passive experience in which youre lowered hundreds of feet into the ocean in shark-proof cage. Theres some beautifully animated sea life and a little drama created by your crew on the radio, and it made me flinch a few times, but not much more than that. When you're done you can take the same trip again without the excitement or just sit underwater and watch the fish swim, but that would've been much more relaxing and meditative if there were an option to remove the ugly shark cage. Its a shame these four games and one sightseeing trip arent sold separately, because as a mismatched hodgepodge its a lot harder to recommend as a whole than the good parts would have been on their own. The entertaining shooting gallery and drama of The London Heist carries the other three short and less interesting games and the passive Ocean Descent, and is likely the only one I'll remember.", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
