Heres what I wrote: Tearaway is a joy. Whether it was riding a pig towards the sunset or playing basketball with a super-powered accordion, it never failed to make me smile. It sincerely believes that imagination really is the most important faculty... It does this by using every aspect of the Vita, crafting an experience that I cant imagine being realised elsewhere. It might be short but its very special. Tearaway Unfolded is a different experience, though. While the skeleton of the original can still be detected, Unfolded is best thought of as part-remake, part-adaptation. And it does a great job of realising the potential of its new hardware: familiar environments are generously expanded, made more bustling and beautiful; instead of the Vitas assorted cameras and touch screens, the peculiarities of the DualShock 4 are celebrated in novel and enjoyable ways. The adaptations are smart, and go someway to realising the core experience on another, very different platform. Yet not all of the changes work as well. So much new content is added, the overall experience is altered, and the intimate charm of the original is lost in translation. One thing that definitely benefits is Tearaways striking and unique art style, which looks better than ever. On a bigger screen, running at a higher resolution, its easy to appreciate just how well-executed this world made entirely of paper really is. Tabs of glued down paper flutter in the wind, or bounce up and down as you run by. Step in a pool of water, and a ripple of jagged, torn paper will appear. It feels hand-made, a world shaped by scissors and glue. But its not just decorative; paper is folded in surprising and smart ways to create environments and obstacles. It's not just a superficial choice, but one which informs every aspect of the world. With this arts and crafts ethos, it's unsurprising that Tearaways biggest message remains the celebration of creativity, and as such youre often asked to design small parts of this landscape. These range from relatively ordinary requests, like outlining the silhouette of a snowflake, to far more surreal commissions, like designing a majestic crown for a theatrical squirrel. This is all done by sketching on the DualShocks touchpad. Its surprisingly accurate, but given its limited size its tricky to realise more detailed designs. I often found my sketch prematurely coming to life because my finger had accidentally slipped off the touchpad. The PlayStation App on phones and tablets can be paired with Tearaway Unfolded, giving you a far bigger canvas. Either way, seeing your design for a snowflake suddenly appear in the world  multiplied a thousand times, fluttering down as a you scale Gibbet Hill  is still a magical experience, and one few games offer. Similarly, you can use the PlayStation camera (or a device running the PlayStation App) to import a texture into the world. I transformed an albino stag using the carpet design from Stanley Kubricks Overlook Hotel. Again, that's something you dont get to do all that often. Similarly, I've yet to play a game that makes better use of the DualShock 4 and its more unusual features. Light bar, gyroscope, touch pad: each one is used as the basis for a new mechanic. The light bar, for instance, is used to illuminate the darkness and interact with plant life, creating new platforms, while the gyroscope grants precise control over a certain type of platform. Swiping a finger across the touchpad creates forceful gusts of wind, capable of erecting new platforms, blowing down others, and whisking away enemies. Each mechanic is given its moment in the spotlight, but occasionally, these new control schemes combine with more familiar ones to create original and surprisingly demanding sections of gameplay. 'Unfolded' is an interesting word when talking about adaptation. Of course, it immediately brings to mind some sort of expansion, and there's plenty of areas in Tearaway that really benefit from this approach. It's the same experience, but it just feels like it's taking place on a bigger scale with a bigger budget. Familiar areas, like Maypole Fields, have more depth and detail, and more jolly NPCs to carry Tearaway's festive spirit. But 'unfolded' also implies that something is being revealed, and Tearaway Unfolded doesn't disappoint with several new areas to explore, from moors and laboratories to spooky swamps. In fact, I recognised very little from the final third of the campaign. This would be great, but its not seamless expansion  the fold lines are still visible, and old and new design fail to really connect. The Vita version focussed on a messenger delivering a special message to you, the player. Tearaway Unfolded retains this overarching design, but in the interest of offering new content  and presumably a bigger and better experience  it takes several detours into new content. Theres a whole subplot regarding your enemies, known as Scraps, building their own DualShock controller. Its great, and gives rise to some delightful breaking of the fourth-wall, but ultimately its a detour. In fact, a lot of these new sections, including my favourite which takes place entirely within your controller, feel bolted on or squeezed into the frame of the original  a way of extending the length of the campaign but one that doesnt really serve the underlying story. In fact, these new sections while fun introduce pacing problems which undermine the overarching story. And this certainly isn't helped by levels being broken up by frequent scrap battles which can't be avoided. Instead of enemies just inhabiting the world, they ambush you in areas which suddenly become fenced in. Before continuing, you must defeat wave after wave of scraps. The execution and frequency of these encounters make them feel more like a chore than a platform to play with abilities. Pros Papercraft worldArt challengesUse of DualShock 4 Cons Pacing problemsRepetitive fights Tearaway Unfolded successfully translates so many aspects of the original. It remains a distinctive experience which celebrates creativity and fun with undimmed enthusiasm and invention, and along the way asks you to do things very few games do  whether thats designing a snowflake or christening a baby wendigo. It takes a familiar controller and makes you play with it in a different way. Its new areas unsurprisingly offer fun and fresh ideas, but they definitely feel crammed into the narrative of the original which suffers as a consequence. Tearaway Unfolded is a big and bold adaptation, but lacks some of the original's intimate charm.", "date": "Sept. 2, 2015,"}
