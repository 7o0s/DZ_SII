Problem number three is that its PlayStation VR mode actually makes it worse. Throw in bad graphics, limited gameplay options, and an attempt at cheesy humor that forgets the humor part and youve got one of PSVRs more forgettable games. To its credit, 100ft Robot Golf takes its clever premise  an anime-style far future where the once-popular sport of giant robot golf is making a televised comeback  and attempts to build a full-blown 2 to 3-hour campaign around it, complete with a fleshed-out storyline and a large cast of characters. Its all told through badly dubbed anime-style cutscenes, but the cheese is intentional and delivered by a voice cast of amateur actors that includes game developers and podcasters. It just isnt that funny. Sure, some of the anime references might elicit a chuckle, and I give it props for getting a grin out of me when it unveiled a Voltron-like 100ft robot piloted by five Corgis, but most of it is borderline unwatchable. That the on-course commentary is highly repetitive doesnt help either. The news doesnt get much better when your 100ft robot actually steps up to the tee box. Im fine with not having many shot options in an arcadey golf game  for instance, you cant club up or down  but I often had shots land in what were essentially no-win situations, leaving me frustrated at having my ball go nowhere and thus having to swing again from the same spot. What depth and variety there is comes from each 100ft robot having its own simplistic swing meter and special ability, such as an extra-bouncy ball or a hoverboard that lets you more quickly traverse the course in order to get your ball in the hole faster. All of bots can melee-attack buildings to literally clear a path for shots to fly through, which adds a fun wrinkle. 100ft Robot Golf is at its best when speed-golf rounds pop up, in which whoever puts their ball in the hole first wins the most points. When its a standard turn-by-turn match its just a dull golf game, but here youre able to physically interfere with your opponents shots by simply getting your giant self in the path of your foes ball. The challenges you unlock when you finish the campaign, such as the one where you control four golfers simultaneously in a four-way split-screen and have to get their balls in the hole (its much harder than it sounds) are the best designed elements here. If only more (or really any) of that had been worked into the campaign proper... Meanwhile, graphics are never king, but when a game gives you the option of putting on a VR headset that drops you inside its world, itd better look halfway decent. 100ft Robot Golfs PS2-era graphics wont impress you on a regular TV, and immersing yourself in them with PSVR only amplifies their crudeness. Youre set inside the bots head by default in VR, but the perspective neither helped my golf game nor made me feel like an awesome giant robot. Its more of a distraction than anything else. Also, for some inexplicable reason multiplayer is incompatible with PSVR mode. 100ft Robot Golf is a game whose title paints a much prettier mental image than whats actually delivered. The very basic golf gameplay is full of frustrating moments without high points to balance them out, the graphics are rudimentary without stylistic charm, and the jokes in the goofy story and commentary dont land often enough to save it. And if youre going to play it Id suggest staying away from the VR mode  it only makes things tougher and uglier.", "date": "Oct. 23, 2016,"}
