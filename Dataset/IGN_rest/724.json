Intrigued by its strange, almost serene overtures, I found myself caught in the quiet, eagerly anticipating my next discovery as I wandered the macabre avenues of a sunken civilization. Some of what I found revealed disillusioning limits to this worlds scope and polish, but overall the journey through a fascinating, haunted archipelago of mossy buildings lurching up through the rolling surf of a drowned planet was a rewarding pleasure. Refreshingly nonviolent, Submerged presents no enemies, no obvious time limits, no failure penalties, and no way to die. Though my quest for medicines was a matter of life and death for a sick young boy, I was pleased to discover that the worst consequence I could expect for miscalculating was having to double back a bit along my route. Relieved of the need to proceed with wary caution, I was able to invest myself fully and without fear in Submergeds aquatic playground. Despite the absence of combat, I quickly learned that I wasnt alone in the apocalyptic oceanic ruins. Sea mammals, huge rays, sea birds, and strange carapaced humanoids shadowed my every move as I steered my little boat through the sunken streets; none are menacing, but all are peripherally present and adding a welcome sense of life and motion to the haunted, eerie landscape. Taken in as a whole, the city is lovely -- a series of jutting, ivy-gnawed spires stabbing out of phosphorescent waves. The water looks good, especially at night, presenting a glowing, murky miasma occasionally broken by whales or rays breaking the surface. I wished I could have taken a swim and explored the world beneath the waves, but for reasons later explained through the story, Submerged keeps your head above water. Closer inspection reveals an uneven, unpolished art direction that leaves different impressions at different times of day. Supersaturated colors flood over the seascape during a sunset, creating a vibrant, haunting, and otherworldly quality. Thunderstorms crop up suddenly, reducing visibility and silhouetting the rotting buildings in gorgeous electric flashes. Night reveals bioluminescent algae set against the blackness of a tumultuous sea. Viewed in the full light of a clear day, on the other hand, those same sights are sometimes less impressive. A blandness and aesthetic sameness in the building textures can be visually fatiguing, especially when you leave the boat for long climbing sequences when the camera faces away from the majestic cityscape. These climbs are simple affairs, with helpful paths to the main objectives clearly marked and few surprises along the way. I enjoyed the peaceful ascents, especially when I took my time, stopping at intervals and exploring the shadowy horizon with my spyglass. Without the threat of death, a timer, or any real chance of becoming lost, I was free to simply observe, listen, and find new story elements. The rewarding sense of discovery diminished somewhat as I became more familiar with the metropolis, but fortunately Submerged reached its conclusion after only three or four hours, long before things became too routine. The map is large enough for engaging exploration, but sadly a bit less vast than first impressions infer. I was disappointed to be turned away by the invisible boundaries at edges of the seemingly endless ocean -- I wanted to sail farther and discover new lands in the great oceanic beyond. Submerged avoids tedious exposition, telling its story in a gratifying silence. What few cutscenes I encountered were welcomely succinct, and instead, most of the storytelling takes place through a novel cave-painting picture book. Panels unlock as you discover vital hidden items, and each image unravels another piece of the enticing mystery behind your character and the fall of the great sunken city. Optional collectibles encountered during climbs reveal more glyphs, but the skyscraper environments themselves tell very little about the story. I wish there was more to find during ascents than just glyphs and eerie far-off vistas -- theres nothing to suggest what used to happen in these locations, what kind of a places they were, and what the people who once lived her were like. Pros Sometimes beautifulInteresting worldOriginal storytelling Cons Limited scopeUneven art Submerged attempts to replace tension with curiosity as a motivating force, and largely succeeds even though its environmental storytelling isnt as dense as it couldve been. Its an unchallenging, occasionally beautiful experience that caters to our instinct to see whats on the other side of the mountain. In the moments where Submerged rewarded inquisitiveness, I loved it. When it occasionally stumbled in that responsibility, I found myself wishing for a more polished and complete world to explore.", "date": "Aug. 9, 2015,"}
