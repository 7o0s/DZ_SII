People playing on mobile can spend hours on seemingly repetitive levels because theyre just so darn addictive. Planet Nam Nam is one of those games that can keep you going for hours at a time, offering plenty of choices, upgrades, and enemies to keep things fresh. With its constant additions and with so many things to level up, it smoothly avoids the realm of boredom. Story-wise its quite simple. Youre playing as Pow whos been commissioned by Earths military to retrieve stolen artifacts from evil space birds. Your mission is to kill all the birds and bring those rare artifacts home. While theres not much skill involved in aiming or shooting (you just tap on the bird to kill it) it becomes surprisingly difficult as the number of birds on screen increases and your gun just cant keep up, pushing the limits of your reflexes. Perhaps one of the best things about Planet Nam Nam is the number of weapons, powerups, and upgrades you can go through. Its definitely not one of those games where you can make do with just using one kind of gun throughout. Much like any other shooting game, guns vary in shooting style, number of bullets per magazine, and speed. Most of your strategy is centered on which gun to choose, at which time, and making sure youre upgrading your armory often to get more bang for your buck. Powerups are offered as bonuses while youre playing and give you a wildcard that can save you in a time of need, but they need to recharge before you can use them again. New kinds of enemies get added often that behave differently, some faster, some slower, some stronger, etc. With an on-screen inventory of 4 weapons and 2 powerups, you can change your shooting strategy as the level progresses. You can purchase all these awesome weapons, weapon upgrades, and powerups with in-game currency (coins and gems) that you collect by killing more birds, getting longer combo streaks, and making it through the level with minimal health loss. While earning more coins and gems should be your main motivation to kick butt and get better weapons, you can always take the easy way out by purchasing them with real money and microtransactions. Personally, I feel its always disappointing when games offer a pay-to-win alternative because it takes away the satisfaction of a job-well-done. All this being said, the setting can get redundant. Planet Nam Nam has 3 worlds to explore with 16 levels per world, at 6 waves per level. This means that the backdrop remains more and less the same for a good third of your playing time. While the art style is definitely attractive and engaging, it would be nice to change things up more often so it doesnt feel like were playing the same level across the entire world. One of the strangest choices the developers made, however, is the robotic voice-over. It sounds like one of those programs that you type sentences into and it reads them out loud (and it very well might be). With this voice narrating the story, tutorial, and other one-liners, it deters from the games atmosphere and the humor is all but lost. It might have been better to simply remove the voice over altogether and rely solely on text prompts. Otherwise, change the voice to something that can inject a little more emotion into the story. Pros Highly addictiveChallenging levelsLarge variety of enemies, weapons, upgrades, and powerups Cons Bad robotic voice-overPay-to-win microtransactionsRedundant backdrops Planet Nam Nam is one of those games you play when youre waiting idly and it makes the time fly by quickly. It has the addictive quality of Temple Run or Candy Crush but with a larger variety of level-ups to give you enough motivation to come back for more. It would be helpful to learn from Rayman Fiestas varying art styles for the levels and get a more appealing voice-over to make it more engaging. But if you can overlook that, youre in for hours of fun.", "date": "Dec. 5, 2014,"}
