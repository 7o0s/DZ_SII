Its done away with some, but not all, of the slowness, you get to play a ton of great minigames with the cool, but not perfect Switch controllers, and that infuriating randomness of awarded stars at the end of a game is  still a problem. But even those painful upsets feel like less of a party killer this time, because Super Mario Party, especially in the team-based Partner Party mode, is competitive, strategic, and, above all, a lot of fun. Party Mode Super Mario Party is a collection of hit-or-miss virtual board games, broken up by competitive minigames  a few of which are worth your time. Theres a lot of filler there, too  I would have preferred more focus on the core modes  but theres enough here to support up to four partiers having a lot of good fun. (Theres an option to play with computer-controlled opponents, but I dont recommend playing by yourself.) The main Mario Party mode has one to four players rolling dice and moving around four board game-like levels with branching paths. As you make your way towards spots to purchase stars, the currency of winners in Mario Party, you thankfully end each turn with a minigame. This is not how Mario Party 10 worked: It significantly limited minigames to spaces you had to land on. The more minigames, the merrier, I say. Above: A game board in Mario Party mode. The boards are also less linear than before, with branching paths and an ever-changing end goal as the star space moves around. The boards are fun, but still simpler than those of the best Mario Parties ( 5 and 6, for my money). There are also only four to choose from, which means if you dont like one or two (I found the unlockable board, which I wont spoil here, to be pretty dull) Parties will get stale fast. Because I also run the strategy guide team here at IGN, Im going to give you a great tip: recruitable Allies are incredibly important in Super Mario Party. This has three big advantages that really change the way you play: First, for each Ally you get bonuses for your dice roll. Second, the Allies appear in some minigames, too. Yes, they get in the way with their crappy AI, but that can potentially help you overwhelm an opponent. In some games they row alongside you on a boat, or linger just long enough after you get knocked out of a violent clash to clinch a victory. Its great when you win, but nothing hurts worse than losing to your human opponents mindless drones. The third big advantage Allies give you is a unique dice block to roll. Each character (including yours) has a different-numbered block: Marios gives you more chances at 3s (The faces read: 1 3 3 3 5 6), while Warios can give you a 6 two-thirds of the time -- but the other third of the time you might not move at all (The faces read: -2 Coins +2 Coins 6 6 6 6). You can freely switch between a regular dice block, your characters special block, and your Allies. This makes for an extra layer of strategy I really enjoyed. Rolling big or little can make all the difference, and now theres something (in addition to items) to help you even the odds. Unfortunately, you cant see characters unique dice blocks on the character select screen, which is an oversight. Above: Koopa Troopa's dice roll can give you a 10, but it's a big risk. The mode I ended up liking the best is Partner Party, which recycles the four maps from Mario Party but adds a co-op partner and converts the gameplay area to a grid in which you can choose your own path. You and your partner can tackle different things around the board, scooping up Allies, gathering stars, and stomping on opponents. Each turn requires a discussion, and my partners would plan several turns in advance. Playing with a friend ramped up the competitive vibe of the Party, which I loved, and added complexity, which Super Mario Party needs to keep from feeling like a simple roll of the dice. In both Mario Party and Partner Party modes, minigames really matter because you need to beat your opponents consistently to win coins. Pair this with some light strategy and you should come out ahead... but winning is not guaranteed because theres a random element that keeps the most skilled player in your group from dominating every game. You can still get a really bad dice roll, Kamek will award the losing player(s) with extra items near the end, and bonus stars are awarded at the end that can change the tides. This time, these bonus stars can be well-deserved, like getting rewarded for having the most coins or the most minigame wins. But this is random, too, so you never know what youre supposed to be going for: Sometimes the bonus stars are given out for the most times youve stomped on another character, or landed on an event space (spaces that change the level layout). In the latter scenarios, its just dumb luck that will decide who gets the precious star. Even worse, you cant turn this off, or adjust the settings in any way. Above: River Survival gameplay. There are two other Super Mario Party modes I didnt feel like returning to. One is River Survival, a co-op game with its own set of minigames. The Everyone Wins! vibe here will probably go over well with young children, but the Mario Partiers I roll with are out for blood and found them boring. Another set of unique minigames is framed around a rhythm game mode called Sound Stage. The rhythm games are fine, but there are just a few, and most use the Switchs motion controls, which arent known for their precision, and thus felt inconsistent. I would have preferred button controls, but I dont think this mode wouldve really grabbed me anyway, as it is just a handful of mode-specific minigames strung together that get old, fast. Crowd Control All modes of Super Mario Party require every player to use a single Joy-Con; no Pro Controllers or grip allowed. This allowed the developers to go wild creatively without having to worry about fairness across controllers. There are many games that use unique 3D rumble effects, and, yes, there are lots of games that need motion controls. Super Mario Partys developers have apparently learned some restraint after a decade of motion controls and so I didnt encounter anything as bad as the worst Wii-era games, but if you dont like like waving wildly to shave ice or tilting carefully to control a plane, you arent going to be happy with Super Mario Party. If you are interested in knowing more about the Switch and it's controllers, we just re-reviewed the Nintendo Switch console. Check it out, above. While the Joy-Cons unique properties make for some fun minigames, the hardware presents some pretty serious problems as well. For example, for a four-person game youll need four Joy-Con, the little wrist strap attachments, and a lot of charging time. If you have just one Switch that means youll have to carefully plan out your charging, since you can only charge two Joy-Con on the sides of the Switch, and you can only do it while youre not playing. The shortest of the Party mode games mentioned above is an estimated 60 minutes for 10 turns -- if any of your Joy-Con loses its charge during that period youll need some additional charging accessories or additional Joy-Con at the ready, or the Party will have to be suspended. This is the first Mario Party that couldnt be continued with AA batteries, and thats a big deal considering Joy-Con cost about $40 a pop. If You Have Two Switches There are several standalone minigames that make use of the Switchs ability to sense and interact with another console nearby, though the concept is not put to great use in all of them. Note that you don't have to have two Switches to play all of these games (with the exception of Banana, Split), but if you do choose to double up you'll also need two copies of Super Mario Party. Mini League Baseball - A stripped-down baseball game that shows the pitchers view on one screen and the batters view on the other. But the two-screen setup doesnt add anything to a dull game. Puzzle Hustle - With the two screens lying flat, players push pieces together to assemble an 8-bit puzzle. There is no reason to play this on two Switches  it could easily work as a split-screen game. Banana, Split - This is a pretty astounding tech demo: The naked Switch screens can be pushed together on a desk to solve puzzles across both screens. It works really well, and, but theres no competitive mode, and the challenge doesnt evolve in an arcade-y way or anything, so the fun evaporates quickly. Warning: Your Switch is going to get knocked around and potentially scratched as you slide it frantically into position. Shell Shock Deluxe - This is a top-down versus mode with up to four tanks on a battlefield. The twist is that you and your opponents can manipulate the battlefield by moving the Switch consoles around on a table, potentially giving your side an advantage. Adding competition makes this more fun than Banana, Split, but its still just a mixup of the simplistic gameplay thats been around since Ataris 1978 hit, Combat. Above: We play Banana, Split, and Shell Shock Deluxe on camera so you can see how they work. With the two game/system setup you can also just play all of the other Super Mario Party modes on two screens with two players assigned to each. But even with two Switch screens, the split-screen minigames are pretty cramped, not to mention the text, which is so small its difficult to read. Putting the Switch in portable mode requires you to get pretty intimate with other partiers, and I wouldnt recommend it over using the Switch in docked mode on the television. Miniature Games Above: We have compiled a video with every. Single. Minigame. Super Mario Partys biggest win, and the best surprise, is its top-notch batch of 80 minigames. Its easily the best in years, and I cant think of any that were so stupid or boring that they were worth warning you about. Here are some of my favorites: Dash and Dine - In this shameless but fun Overcooked clone, you and a partner jostle for ingredients in a busy kitchen where toads and your opponents get in your way. Sizzling Stakes - Using Joy-Con motion controls, you slide a cube of meat around a wok to try to fry all six sides. Slaparazzi - Four players jostle and punch their way to the center of a photograph as its being taken. The photos are always great. Nut Cases - Using the spookily tuned HD rumble of the Joy-Con, you shake boxes of nuts and try to identify which have the most in them. (This idea is rehashed from one of 1-2-Switchs better games.) Candy Shakedown - You must shake oblong pieces of candy out of a jar with a tight end. You have to get pretty creative with the use of the Joy-Cons motion sensors to get every piece out. One cool thing to look for is the level of detail. Textures, reflections, and subtle touches are not something the Mario Party series is known for, but theres an additional layer of quality in Super Mario Party. The kitchen in Sizzling Stakes is really detailed, for example, with a shiny, pitted pan filled with bubbling grease and steam. The realism is sometimes jarring alongside the cartoony graphics of the game boards. Above: Meat cubes in HD. Quality and Quantity Super Mario Party has a sheen of quality that previous Mario Parties noticeably lacked. It doesnt approach the level of graphical and gameplay fidelity as Super Mario Odyssey, but Party fans will notice the bump in shiny polygons. Speaking of Super Mario Odyssey, which stood out in part because of the wacky real-world/Mushroom Kingdom mashups, talking hats, and overall weirdness, I wish Super Mario Party had that edgy novelty going for it. Returning to the Mushroom Kingdoms overly familiar, garish, Toad-filled fields and castles, not to mention its blaring carnival soundtrack, is more obnoxious than nostalgic in Super Mario Party. With all it does have going for it, I think Super Mario Partys four game boards for the main modes of Mario Party and Partner Party will get old before the 80 minigames do. The other, lesser mixes of minigames, River Survival and Sound Stage, dont make up for the lack of maps. Super Mario Party's sole online mode called Online Mariothon (Compete in a marathon of minigames with players from all over the world) also promises to extend Super Mario Partys life, but the servers werent live at the time of this review, so I wasnt able to try it out. Super Mario Party delivers the couch multiplayer experience the series is famous for with an awesome new layer of strategy, 80 mostly-great minigames, and the quirky tech of the Switch controllers to keep things feeling fresh. The downside is that with the Switchs controllers come some annoyances that make getting people settled onto your couch a bit more of a hassle than previous parties, and the best games are prone to annoying random upsets. But its far better paced than recent games and Super Mario Party reset my expectations of the series with its graphics and gameplay creativity.", "date": "Oct. 4, 2018,"}
