{"name": "Splatoon", "name_review": "Splatoon Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/splatoon/106796/review/splatoon-review", "text": "Splatoon turns the act of making a mess into fast-paced action and portions it out in energetic three-minute matches. With just one online mode, an offline 1v1 mode, and a brief single-player campaign, its a short but colorfully chaotic burst of fun. Theres a mechanically deep, yet family-friendly third-person shooter hiding in the pools of ink. Territory control is a concept that you usually only hear high-level shooter players talk about, but Splatoon successfully takes this tried-and-true idea and makes it central and accessible to everyone by having us splash colorful ink everywhere to mark our territory. Turf Wars, the 4v4 competitive online mode, is about drenching the map in your color much more than it is about killing enemies. This makes it easy for anyone to pick up a weapon contribute, even if headshots arent your thing. Painting a level is crucial, because as long as youre standing in your own color, you can hit a button to instantly switch to a fast-moving but unarmed squid form to quickly reach trouble spots, then switch back to open fire and defend your territory. Its a fun tradeoff that encourages you to swap between the two forms constantly, and both moving and shooting feel good at a steady 60 frames per second. At the end a cat judge tallies up the claimed territory and declares a winner. Its nonsensical goofy fun, and a suspenseful ending for close matches that had me on the edge of my seat. Each ink-spreading tool is built around the dual purposes of painting the ground and splatting your enemies. The whimsical Splatroller lays down a wide lane of color, but flick it and youve got the equivalent of a shotgun. The Splattershot is a trusty rifle, but the different variations you unlock change how fast you paint and how far you can shoot. Coupled with sub weapons, like the Splash Wall or the Sprinkler, theres a lot to choose from. A handy test facility lets you experiment with your arsenal and find the weapons set thats just right for you. Since claiming territory is such a visual activity, its easy to tell if enemies are nearby whenever you spot rival ink. A quick glance at the GamePad immediately tells you whos winning a match and what areas need to be recaptured. Sadly, this doesnt make up for the fact that Splatoon has no voice chat support. I found myself dialing up my friends on Skype so we could coordinate, but that feels like an unfair advantage. When I played Splatoon online matches pre-release, matchmaking was spotty. Matches would rarely show signs of lag once I connected, but sometimes Id get stuck waiting for a match to connect. Its impossible to know right now whether thats a problem with server population or not - well let you know this Friday. The long wait times highlight a separate issue: You cant alter your loadout while waiting to start up a match. Those waits are significant enough that Nintendo put a minigame on the gamepad to help pass the time, but Id much rather be choosing my gear and dressing up my Squidling with trendy outfits. You shop for those goodies between matches, and I got a kick out of visiting the offbeat vendors of Splatoons charming squid-themed Inkopolis. Each one sells useful items that make you more effective in multiplayer battles, and the wide range of weapons and gear sets up a great upgrade loop of fighting to earn shopping money, and then taking your new toys for a spin in a fight. I could do without the Squid Sisters, though. This pair of hosts announces which of the five multiplayer maps are available through an unskippable cutscene, and the fact that you have to suffer through their lame banter each time you boot up borders on criminal. The offline portion of Splatoon is a fun six-hour single-player campaign with the type of variety, pacing, and amusing boss fights youd expect from a Mario game. Splatoon levels take a theme, say sliding platforms or sponge-like surfaces, and build a stage around it thats challenging and well thought out. Each playfully teaches you a skill and then ramps up to a climax, before walking away gracefully and introducing something new. The Octarian enemies you fight are both expressive and lovingly detailed, in a way that lives up to Nintendos high standards. Just look at the adorable Octostamps wind-up before an attack. Its just so charming. That said, its lacking in reasons to play it again, so Splatoons not something youll probably want to get just for its single-player content. In Battle Dojo, the offline 1v1 mode, the simple objective is to shoot down more balloons than your rival. To keep things unpredictable, power ups you pick up will fire off a random special ability that can help or hurt your chances, so each ones a gamble. That randomness makes it goofy fun in the short term, but soon it becomes pointless because the winner of a match is basically randomly determined. Splatoon amiibo unlock fun additional challenges that make clever use of alternate weapons, like the Splatroller or Splatcharger, and these changes have an impact on how you play and progress through the single-player campaign. The content is fun, and it unlocks gear and mini-games you can play on GamePad, but its important to note that all of it is locked behind a $13-per-figure paywall (or $30 for the three pack).

Pros Creative mechanicsFast-paced matchesCustomization Cons Limited contentNo voice chat Nintendos take on the third-person shooter is refreshingly original, with lots of impressive tools and skillful mobility. Matches are consistently fun and tense, and the mechanics feel simple enough that almost anyone can contribute positively. Splatoon really needs the extra modes and content Nintendo says is coming once a portion of the community levels up a bit, and not having voice chat is a bummer, but what is here feels polished and kept me claiming turf for hours.", "date": "May 28, 2015,"}
