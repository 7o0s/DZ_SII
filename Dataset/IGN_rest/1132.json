I wish my compliment would had more value to it because cricket games have been embarrassingly abysmal for quite some time now. Developer Big Ant Studios however, sets up a fine example with Don Bradman Cricket 14, a game that not only discards the dated and uninspiring designs of the previous games but also boldly sets a precedent with its detailed and intricate new mechanics. The first rule of playing Don Bradman Cricket 14 is to forget all that you know about cricket games past and start afresh, as the games manual says. And its true - gone are the slog-tastic batting and exploitative bowling systems that would guarantee a win with little to no effort. DBC 14 ditches them and introduces players to a new set of tools that offers a more intuitive and in-depth experience that almost closely resembles a real life play. Unfortunately, as satisfying and rewarding as these new tools are, DBC 14 fails to provide proper orientation to them, leaving players confused and overwhelmed with its sheer amount of depth. I have to admit - I spent nearly two to three hours in practise just to get a hold of the controls as neither of the available tutorials truly makes an effort to get you acquainted to them. It was like learning cricket all over again, only this time there is no parent or friend to guide you through. But once you understand them - and trust me, it will take you a good couple of matches before you are confident enough to move on from the amatuer difficulty - DBC 14 is surprisingly fun and addictive. Take batting for example - the idea here is to study the line and length of the delivery than simply camping at the bowling reticule that pops up before a delivery. Once you have an idea of the kind of stroke you want to play, you can then choose to play the delivery either on the front foot or the back foot with the left stick, and the area you want to place the ball with the right stick. Higher difficulty levels have decreasingly short timing meters, making batting a more reactionary experience. So if you see a delivery, you have mere milliseconds to decide if you want to put it through the covers or angle it away for singles. Thankfully, the game does include a way to read the line and length. A delivery with a fully colored circle means it is aiming for the middle stump, while a gap to the left or right means it is either going for the leg or off stump. If you fancy unleashing your inner Shahid Afridi by going over the top, or Pietersen your way through with an unabashed reverse sweep, clamping down your shoulder buttons allows you that luxury. You can also clamber down the pitch for the big slog, but again timing is of utter importance - even a slight miss will be punished with an awkward run out. Much like the batting, bowling too offers the same level of satisfaction and reward for mastering it. In fact, Big Ant has shown an unhealthy obsession over providing a bowling system that gives absolute control over the type of delivery, the line and length, the swing or spin, and the speed at which a ball can be bowled. You can choose the type of delivery (in-swing, out-swing, cross seam, etc.) with the left stick, and you must time the jump of the bowler and the release of the ball with the right stick. You select the length of the delivery before the run up (full, good, or short), after which the timing of the jump and the release of the ball will determine how close or farther the ball will land on the selected length. This opens the bowling up for experimentation - you can go all McGrath with proper line and length, or mix things up with some swinging yorkers to unsettle the batsman. You can choose to add or subtract pace from a delivery for added variety. The game also allows you to rub the ball, which I am not sure if it does indeed help remove the shine from the ball. The fact that I am questioning if the game allows you to remove the shine from the ball shows the level of detail Big Ant has put into the game. The fielding too receives similar love, and it is by far the best system to be featured in a cricket game. You can set the field to be fully assisted, semi-assisted, or completely manual. I found going with the semi-assisted system offered the best balance between control and complexity, and maintaining the thrill of stealing a run out or getting a hard earned catch of a difficult batsman. The right trigger can be used to sprint to the ball while the shoulder button can be utilized to slide or dive for a catch. Once you have the ball, you can then decide to throw or pass it to the wicketkeeper or throw it at the non-strikers end. The system is not without its flaws though, the fielders at times feel laborious to move as the default animation kicks in, usually resulting in a missed run out chance. Also, while your fielders may struggle to get the ball to the wickets end, fielders of the opposition team are blessed with precision and accuracy that would make Jonty Rhodes go pale with embarrassment. This coupled with the fact that the game has no fielding radar makes taking risky singles or judging whether it will be a comfortable double run difficult. You are instead forced to switch to a first person view between deliveries to have a sense of the field placements yourself. These odd design choices are further compounded by the games numerous glitches that frequently nose their way in. One of which will be familiar to anyone who has played a cricket game before. Yes, the legendary, omnipresent glitch where the wicketkeeper or bowler breaks the stumps after receiving the ball for no apparent reason is present in this game too. Its incredible how long-living this glitch is, and its probably one game away to being a called a feature instead. There are also other bugs, most annoying of which is when the umpire would rule an out on a no-ball or a free hit. But it is in these trying times that you can use the Big Ant Review System, which can be employed within ten seconds after a ruling has been given if you suspect an umpire has not been entirely accurate with his decision. The mere presence of such a system adds a whole new angle to the game and can often overturn a match - in or against your favor. The games rough visual presentation and odd glitches are but only a minor annoyance in a title thats packed with content. Big Ant has gone to great lengths to produce a complete game, with every aspect given enough care and attention. In terms of game modes, the game has it all - premiere leagues, domestic leagues, World Cup tournaments, classic tours, and more. You can even design your own tournaments if you so choose to. Of note is the Career Mode. While it may not be as fleshed out as the equivalents in say FIFA, it is a welcome departure from playing the other modes. In Career Mode, you must guide a 16 year old batsman or bowler through a 20 year campaign, developing him into a great player and hopefully one day captain the Test and One Day teams. The mode allows you to live each and every match, as if you are were actually present in the game. This means that if you are a wicketkeeper or a fielder, you can choose to just field for the entire innings, or if you are a batsman, you can simply watch the match till your turn comes up. Following your career like this requires time and patience, and thankfully, the game doesnt force you to live every moment of it. If you want to focus purely on your main specialization, you can simply spectate through the unnecessary parts of the match. When it comes to licensing, Don Bradman is the only licensed player in the game. However, Big Ant manages to skirt the issue with Cricket Academy, an extensive set of tools that allows users to create or change existing players, umpires and teams. The developer may have anticipated the issue with non-licensed teams and had released the Cricket Academy Beta to everyone a year ago. The beta invited users to keep an updated list of players and teams, complete with proper names and attributes, and found a way to incorporate that into the final release. If you are not happy with the non-licensed teams and players, you can simply source it from the community. Its a very clever way of battling the heavy licensing fees, but the system is not without its faults. Since its community-based, mistakes in player attributes and statistics are bound to happen and it does not seem as if Big Ant will establish any sort of quality control over it. Pros Intricate and in-depth gameplay systemsPacked with content and featuresCareer Mode! Cons Lack of proper tutorialsUnhelpful fielding cameraRough presentation with lots of glitches Don Bradman Cricket 14 is a work of passion. Big Ant shows the necessary attention and care required to truly craft a good cricket game experience, and attempts to reinvent the genre with its superb gameplay fidelity. It may not have entirely succeed - its got a steep learning curve and a few odd design choices and bugs that hinders the overall experience - but it comes impressively close. We can only hope that this is a start to a very special innings.", "date": "April 16, 2014"}
