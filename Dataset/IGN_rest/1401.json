While chaotic gunfights are undoubtedly part of Battlefields charm, massive lobbies with that many players eventually turned the series signature modes frustrating instead of fun. Thankfully, its tense new Hazard Zone mode provides an interesting strategic alternative, and its crazy-customizable Portal tools are an exciting glimpse at how its future could thrive with a little help from the creativity of the community. After playing Battlefield 2042 on live servers with the other players who have the Gold Edition, Ultimate Edition, or a subscription to EA Play Pro, Im not entirely impressed. As the name implies, this latest Battlefield shifts the series into a near future setting full of high-tech gadgets and freedom to play Battlefield the way you want. The goal was to bring back the feeling of Battlefield being a playground again. It also does away with even the meager campaign stories Battlefield V had, featuring no single-player options whatsoever. What it does have is the infantry and vehicle-based shootouts across those huge, beautiful maps Battlefield is generally known for, as well as a few fresh ideas of its own  but not all of the innovations it introduces are for the better.For instance, at first glance it appears that Battlefield 2042s roster of 10 playable Specialists are based off of the original four Battlefield classes: Assault, Support, Recon, and Engineer. However, unlike the previous Battlefield games where classes had very specific jobs and skills to define them, 2042s Specialists skills dont really change a teams dynamic much. For example, I first decided to go with Support Specialist Maria Falck to act as the team medic. Her Specialty skill arms her with a Syrette Pistol that fires syringes which heal allies and herself, but damage enemies. I initially thought Falck would basically be the only option for someone who likes to play as a medic, but it turns out that anyone can go in as a healer if they equip the medical crate gadget, which lets them throw out the typical Battlefield area-of-effect healing box. And while Falcks Specialist trait allows her to revive downed teammates to full health, anyone can revive their teammates or provide healing. 2042's Specialists' skills don't really change a team's dynamic much.Similarly, anyone can now hold a repair tool, so thats no longer specific to Engineers, and any Specialist can even equip any gun. There are Specialists who have more unique abilities, like Casper getting an OV-P Recon Drone to scout with or Sundance getting a wingsuit instead of a parachute to cover more distance while dropping into the map  but overall the Specialists loadouts dont feel as distinct as the roles we played in previous Battlefield games. I eventually found myself primarily picking Webster Mackay, whose Specialty is a grappling hook, and equipping the medical crate to get maximum mobility while still being able to play support. Not having the usual class items exclusive to specific Specialists makes selecting a class feel less restrictive, but it struck me as odd that there also isnt really any reason for a team to diversify their classes anymore when anyone can repair, heal, use anti-aircraft and anti-artillery equipment, and deploy ammo crates. Specialists are basically just an extra skill that you can pick to augment your playstyle further  thats a fun addition, but its also a big shift that diminishes the importance of individual classes as a result. Everyone is a Jack of all trades, which disappointingly lessens the need for coordinated squad building and teamwork.Everyone is a Jack of all trades.There are three game types in 2042, and your leveling is shared across the board. The main event, All-Out Warfare, has within it the Breakthrough and Conquest modes, which both live up to that label with a whopping 64 players on each team. With that many people gunning for each other on one battlefield everything feels chaotic, even spread out across the impressively huge and detailed maps that have been made to better accommodate that player count. Conquest is the traditional Battlefield mode where you compete to capture and hold multiple points at once spread around a massive map, only this time the map size and player count is turned up to 11. As much as Ive enjoyed Conquest in past Battlefields and wanted to do the same here, this actually my least favorite mode in 2042  it felt like every point I went to take had the entire enemy team defending it because there are just so many players, and only a few points that are easily reachable. Its the kind of problem that takes a huge amount of teamwork to solve, and with the teams as big as they are thats very difficult to pull off. What We Said About Battlefield VLike a fresh recruit, Battlefield V was clearly deployed into action without adequate preparation. And a variety of bugs, underdeveloped features, and placeholder menu screens remind you of that at nearly every turn. However, theres a great deal of raw potential here that could, with time and luck, be forged into one of the series best. Bold changes to Battlefields traditional gunplay, essential resources, and team dynamics create a strong foundation. On the single-player front, Battlefield V presents three short but distinct vignettes that weirdly focus on small-scale stealth instead of bombastic vehicular warfare. Their successful story moments arent really enough to go out of your way for but theyre worth playing once youre here. Overall, Battlefield V can be lots of fun to play today, even if theres still a lot of building left to do. - James Duggan, November 20, 2018Score: 7.5Read the full Battlefield 5 ReviewAt the same time, the maps are big enough that you dont always run into anybody else in the vast spaces between points, and that leads to a problem where youre stuck running for excessive periods if you dont have a vehicle drop-in available or if your team spawns are far from another point. Its a bigger inconvenience than it was in Battlefield 5, where I didnt feel as if I was running forever just to get to another point and the matches felt pretty evenly paced without so much dead air. In some matches, if youre not fast enough to select a vehicle at spawn (which can easily happen if your load times are a bit too slow), you just have to leg it to the fight. Its a bit amusing to see an entire army of around 20 people pitter-pattering to the nearest point that feels an eternity away, but probably not in the way its intended. That space issue also impacts the visually stunning weather system somewhat, which was supposed to be even bigger and better this time around but didnt seem to come into play very often in practice. More than anything I just encountered rainstorms that didnt have any real impact on how I played. Id occasionally see a tornado in the distance, but driving near one made it awkwardly clear how small they actually are up close. Also, they dont really seem to do much to the map other than blow through it, which was a little disappointing compared to the amazing trailers that made this updated weather seem like it would be far more significant in a typical match. It can be a lot of fun to run through the utter chaos of explosions and rampaging vehicles all around you. The returning Breakthrough mode focuses the action a little bit better by putting each team on either attack or defense, but with the catch that each zone the attacking team captures cant be recaptured. That means the defending team is pushed back to the next point, becoming increasingly desperate to hold onto the last one until the attackers respawn tickets run out. Again, its hard to execute any kind of real strategy this time around since your team is so big and theres no clear leader  but when all of the action is focused on a single target, it can still be a lot of fun to run through the middle of this war with the utter chaos of explosions and rampaging vehicles all around you. However, in my matches so far Ive definitely noticed a problem with the balance favoring attackers. Because defenders can only spawn in the zone currently being attacked and can be easily surrounded by the attackers, Ive already seen way too many hectic spawns where my teammates and I get obliterated by a tank immediately after coming back onto the map. Hazard Zone is a brand-new game type that currently ranks as my second favorite of Battlefield 2042s options. Its basically Dices version of Escape from Tarkov: 32 players (unless youre on last-gen consoles, in which case its 24) group up in teams of four to scour the map for data points, taking out both small swarms of AI soldiers and each other as they go, before extracting from the map. Its not quite a battle royale, but its similar in that if you do get killed you wont be able to respawn unless a teammate is able to secure a respawn uplink to get you back. And while the first opportunity to extract is toward the beginning of the match, the second has every team fighting over a single escape vehicle toward the end. Hazard Zone isn't quite a battle royale.Throughout each match youll gather data that will increase the amount of credits youll receive afterwards, but you can also loot Uplinks that allow you to call in Rangers (the robot dogs that are totally not inspired by Boston Dynamics), a LATV4 Recon Vehicle, and Team Redeploys that allow you to bring back any dead teammates all at once. (I greatly prefer that to games where I have to revive them one at a time!) If you didnt bring these in your loadout, finding Uplinks can instead be lifesavers that create heroic moments  if youre the last one standing on your team, a nearby Team Redeploy will be pinged on the map for you to run to and loot for a dramatic save. What makes Hazard Zone great is its progression: when loading into a match for the first time you can pick any Specialist, but your loadout of weapons, gadgets, and tactical equipment is limited since you wont have enough credits to get anything other than the freebees. Play a few more matches, though, and maybe even successfully extract once or twice, and youll earn enough credits to buy some sweet items for your next drop, such as any weapon of your choice that you can customize with attachments and increased data storage in your tactical slot, allowing you to carry and extract with more data points. My favorite weapon in Hazard Zone is the M5A3 assault rifle with two scope attachment options for a 1x close-range option and 2x at slightly greater range. Microtransaction ReactionIt's hard to react to what's not currrently available, and Battlefield 2042's store is a no-show at review time. However, the fact that a store tab exists at all suggests their existence. Battlefield V introduced purely cosmetic options five months after it launched, so it wouldn't be surprising to see those pop up here as well.The clever part about this is that the stakes keep rising higher as you go thanks to Extraction Streaks, where if you manage to extract two or more times in a row youll unlock an extra Tactical Equipment slot for the next match. If you lose that streak, however, you revert back to only one slot, and having something to lose ratchets up the tension a couple of notches when youre wondering if you can take on that group of soldiers up ahead. Each streak is attached to the Specialist you used for the previous match as well, so if you switch from one Specialist to another youll lose that extra Tactical Equipment slot and essentially start over. This didnt seem like a huge problem since the need to switch Specialists doesnt really come up too often in Hazard Zone, but establishing the Specialist you want to use throughout the mode early is probably best. I found that Casper and his OV-P Recon drone was pretty handy to have on your team, especially since he could scope out areas with Data points and see how many hostiles are around.Teamwork is crucial in order to survive long enough to go from one data point to another.Teamwork is crucial in order to survive long enough to go from one data point to another, and since there are only 32 players in a match it felt slightly better paced and deliberate than All-Out Warfares chaos. I found myself eager to queue in for another match of Hazard Zone even if I had been absolutely demolished at the beginning of a previous game because I wanted to rack up points to get my best loadout in the next round. The feeling of accomplishment when you steal the extraction helicopter or plane from enemy teams in the last extraction point is exhilarating, and it naturally pushed me to queue in for more matches to ride that high. One thing that bugged me in both All-Out Warfare and Hazard Zone was that the time-to-kill feels incredibly inconsistent. I dont know if its a bug or what, but no matter what weapon types and attachments I use, it often feels like I have to hit an enemy with a few bullets more than I should need to down them. That gets frustrating quickly, especially when some enemies seem to be able to down me just about instantly. By comparison, the custom Portal mode allows you to play with the settings of past Battlefield games, and the TTK felt just fine next to the likes of Battlefield 3 or Bad Company 2. In All-Out Warfare, the long TTK didnt bother me too much since you respawn pretty quickly and can get back in the action, but in Hazard Zone it felt especially punishing since its a squad-based game and you stay down until you can be revived. I want the TTK to feel justified and even in an FPS, but in 2042 I found myself switching from my assault rifle to a marksman rifle or even a sniper rifle just to get those faster kills since other weapons can be so unintuitively weak. Unlike Apex Legends or Call of Duty: Warzone where you can take on three enemies at once and potentially pull off an exciting outplay, it feels nearly impossible in Battlefield 2042  being surrounded by even two enemies always felt like a death sentence. Things went awry a bit more often than I'd expected, even from a newly launched game.Another problem was an ongoing bug where Id occasionally run over to revive a downed teammate only to find that theyd already chosen to die and spawn back in, yet their bodies remained on the ground like bait in a medic trap. Being downed seems to be buggy in general, because other times Id be waiting for a revive but my teammate wouldnt be able to get a revive icon on me, so Id just have to accept death and respawn. Also, finding out that the Hovercraft can scale entire buildings was a not so pleasant surprise since that vehicle can inch its way up places it shouldnt and cause a lot of trouble. There were a handful of other bugs too: sometimes being unable to bring up the Uplink screen, getting stuck loading until you restart, and some server issues. Id occasionally get hit with lag and desync away from where I was, and Id also get some ping issues where my latency would drop and I wouldnt be able to move very well due to connection stutters. In general, things went awry a bit more often than Id expected, even from a newly launched game. The real treasure of Battlefield 2042 is its Portal mode. More of a massive playground than a set mode, it lets anybody create their own experiences, game modes, or even just new game rules in general. It lets you tailor what kind of Battlefield you want to play, packing loads of the series long history into one great big developer toolset. On top of Battlefield 2042s maps and toys, Portal currently includes three full Battlefield games that you can customize: the original Battlefield 1942, Battlefield Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. There are maps, weapons, classes, and equipment available from all these. There are a few preset, dev team-curated modes that you can jump into, including Battlefield 1942 Classic Conquest, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Classic Rush, and Battlefield 3 Classic Conquest. Playing Battlefield Bad Company 2s Classic Rush mode in a match with 64 players using that games actual ruleset and maps felt so, so good, and it was a stark difference from how I felt about playing All-Out Warfare in Battlefield 2042s main game mode list. Ive only dabbled in 1942s Classic Conquest mode so far, but sniping there is fantastic. Playing these games in Portal reminded me of how much fun Battlefield can be, especially with the classic modes where classes actually matter to team balance. The real fun comes from tweaking things yourself.But the real fun comes from tweaking things yourself. In Portal, you can change anything from if Friendly Fire is on for a team, to how much headshot damage multipliers are valued at, to if you take fall damage, and more. Basically anything you can think to change in a game, you can. Not only does it let you create entirely unique Battlefield experiences and game modes, but it also provides a more hands-on understanding of what goes into game balancing. Portal can also be used to make incredibly silly stuff, like one dev-created mode I played where you have a single rocket in a launcher as your primary and a knife as your secondary; in order to reload you have to jump five times. Why? Because its goofy madness and there are no rules in Portal, thats why. The tools that Portal gives you can be overwhelming to look at because it goes all the way down into the skeleton of game development  thats an incredible level of freedom, but it also means it isnt necessarily the most accessible custom mode maker an FPS has ever seen. The good news is that you dont need to learn any of it to enjoy the smartest and craziest stuff out there, because finding community-created modes has been made easy  there is a selection of fun featured custom modes from the community on the front page of Portal that will rotate over time. One of my favorite featured modes so far is CourageJDs VIP Fiesta mode, where two teams face off against each other to eliminate each others VIP players. The VIP title swaps around between players on each team, and the twist is that every time you respawn youre given a completely different loadout and class character from Battlefield 1942 vs Battlefield 3. Portal allows for so much fun and creativity that it might just be the saving grace of Battlefield 2042. Battlefield 2042 tries to do a lot, but only some of its experiments are worth celebrating. The 128 player matches of its All-Out Warfare modes definitely feel like too much for their own good a lot of the time, but its more strategic new Hazard Zone mode is incredibly fun. But the fact that the most fun I had with 2042 was playing recreations of its previous games in Portal is a pretty good indication of how ideas like its new Specialist system have missed the mark. For a game claiming to be the future of Battlefield, 2042s impressive Portal options make it clear that it doesnt stack up to the past. Instead, its those same customization tools that could come to define it in time.", "date": "Nov. 18, 2021,"}
