Heres what we said about it then: Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big. Parts of its presentation are lacking, and the state of its single-player is criminal, but overall, it's a deep, addictive co-op shooter that tickled my inner burglar. Read the original Payday 2 review. The Switch version has all of that, plus most  but not all  of the content updates the PC and console versions have gotten since launch, and the addition of an exclusive new character and HD rumble give it a slight edge. But as with many ports, performance isnt its strong suit, and the lack of built-in voice chat is a big problem for a game that requires such tight cooperation for success. Payday 2 runs at a mostly steady 30 FPS, with a few minor dips when the action really picks up. Whether I was playing docked or undocked, Payday 2 runs at a mostly steady 30 frames per second, with only a few minor dips when the action really picks up. Its not as good as the 60 frames per second you see on PC, but its smooth enough. On the big screen, the resolution appears to fluctuate somewhere between 1080p and 720p, which can make textures look pretty fuzzy. A bigger problem is the lack of communication. Theres just no way around it: Payday 2 needs voice chat, and the Switch doesnt have it. Even the phone app that clumsily solves the problem for Splatoon 2 isnt supported here. That makes playing with randoms impossible, and playing with friends tough unless youre in the same room or using something like Discord. Switch heisters are one update behind other consoles, which are already slightly behind the PC version. The Switch version comes with roughly 50 of the DLC packs thatve come out on PC and consoles over the past few years. Those range from weapon and character packs that allow you to play as John Wick himself, to Biker Heists where you fight through waves of diesel-fueled gangsters aboard a moving train. However, the two latest pieces of DLC packs, Scarface and h3h3, are conspicuously missing. That leaves Switch heisters one update behind other consoles, which are themselves slightly behind the PC version. One thing the Switch has that no one else does is Joy, the latest playable to join the crew. This timed exclusive character has skills and perks that revolve around hacking and electronic countermeasures, which is great for playing in a support role. Not to mention, she comes equipped with arguably one of the coolest looking cosmetic items in Payday 2: a fully lit red-and-blue neon mask which appears to be a direct reference to the look of the Switch itself. While playing as Joy, I was able to put together a technician build that gave me the ability to supercharge my drills for faster safe cracking and leech health off enemies by blowing them up with grenades. Her speedy hacking skills can also really come in handy, especially while attempting to stealth through missions. The ability to hack into any security system and grab a direct camera feed of your entire surroundings while on a mission is incredibly helpful. Touchscreen controls have also been added, but their sole purpose is for navigation through the menus. HD rumble is cool, though: it adds tactile feedback to the already excellent sound design, making each weapon feel distinctive. The subtle clicks and locks of reloading your gun can be surprisingly satisfying. Pros Deep strategyTerrific soundIntense gunfights Cons Inconsistent graphicsBroken single-player Its nice that Switch owners can cash in on Payday 2s co-op action, which remains great, and the new playable character has a skill set that introduces a new support style. But this version is handicapped by its lack of voice communication tools. Even if its updated to parity with the PC version, thats a tough pill to swallow in such a cooperative game.", "date": "Feb. 23, 2018,"}
