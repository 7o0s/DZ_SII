Thankfully, the promised PC port has finally appeared, and its set to reignite that discussion. When it first arrived on Xbox One and PS4, I wrote: World takes a dramatic leap into a look, feel, and size that feels truly new, simultaneously staying true to the series ideals by maintaining the addictive loop of combat, intimidating monsters and meaningful upgrades that fans love. The sheer depth and commitment required is still intense, but it clearly isnt Capcoms aim to court a casual crowd. This is as all-consuming and incredible a ride as ever. Read our original Monster Hunter: World review. Brilliantly, Monster Hunters first western foray onto PC is a near-perfect recreation of that console experience I fell in love with last winter. Those hoping this release would be Capcoms excuse to add the much-loved G-rank challenges will be disappointed, but this remains the stupendously generous game it always was, with hundreds of hours of play in store for those that become entranced by its web of quests and upgrades. In fact, those returning having dropped off from playing earlier console versions will find a more welcoming experience. Months of updates saw Capcom fixing some of our few complaints about the launch version, from being able to sort the endless lists of Investigation quests to changing text size and adding more options to farm certain useful items. Its not drastically different, but its definitely more efficient. While all the console versions quality of life improvements have made their way across, PC players will have to wait a little while to get the content updates that came post-launch. New monsters like Deviljho and Lunastra will be added at a later date - but in a game that takes at least 100 hours to finish the basic storylines, that isnt a huge problem. The true benefit of playing on PC is, predictably, in the performance. Playing the game at the Highest level of quality doesnt outstrip what weve seen on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X but, as youd expect, you arent forced to choose between higher resolution, graphical quality and frame rate here. The result is a game that looks as good as on the most powerful console, but runs without a hitch (and, with an uncapped frame rate option for those with beefier machines, even better than the original). While itd take a more powerful PC than mine to run with every setting maxed, in hours of play at 1080p, 60 FPS at max quality with a GTX 1070, Ive not seen a hint of the frame rate dips that hit every console version. Capcoms hinted that it may release a PC-exclusive graphical improvement patch post-release but, even without, this is no slouch. Speaking of patches, you may have heard about a pre-release version of the port crashing regularly. Thankfully, a pre-release fix seems to have eliminated that issue. Despite suffering multiple crashes pre-patch, Ive had none in the hours Ive played of the release version. PCs other major addition is keyboard and mouse play. While this works far better than Id assumed it would, and feels like something of a novelty, Id still recommend a controller. Monster Hunters combat requires pinpoint timing at the best of times, and using its more complex weapons can feel like more of a dance across a keyboard than it perhaps should. That said, with some input remapping, I can see the games ranged weapons becoming more usable on keyboard and mouse, offering real precision, but the default control scheme just isnt there. Fitting for the series first ever western PC version, this isnt a case of bringing flashy new exclusive content but a supremely stable, confidently-put-together package of what got all the console players so excited about in January. If its the first time youve gotten a chance to see what Monster Hunter is all about, this is as good a starting point as youre likely to get.", "date": "Aug. 7, 2018,"}
