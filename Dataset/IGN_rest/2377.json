Its a living watercolour illustration that explores the complex themes of loss and grief through a visually arresting world and affecting orchestral score. At first glance, Gris looks to be a fitting bookend to a year that started with Celeste - a game that married an exploration of mental illness with incredible platforming gameplay, but ultimately its basic level design and many minor frustrations make its exceptional qualities feel only skin deep. Griss story can be obtuse at times as it opts to tell it through symbolism rather than dialogue. The main character, a heartbroken young woman, has lost her voice and wanders the empty, motley world with no real sense of purpose. As she explores and the landscape changes from windswept deserts littered with debris and collapsed buildings to forests and underwater labyrinths that hide curious creatures both friend and foe, she learns new skills to overcome obstacles and eventually find her way out. Like a painting in an art gallery or an art house film, Gris leaves itself open to interpretation. Like a painting in an art gallery or an art house film, Gris leaves itself open to interpretation. The animation, world design, and visual effects in Gris are immediately impressive and absorbing. Theres a focus on symmetry and simple, clean design. The protagonist is hand-animated and her transformations into different forms display a mastery of 2D animation. Her cloak, for instance, twists around her body as it spreads into the shape of a manta-ray, flowing and pulsing as you swim deeper into the dark, foreboding depths of underwater areas. As you move through the different stages, blotches of watercolour spread across the screen, painting the gray world. The orchestral score complements these changes in mood, and the first time I guided the unnamed protagonist off a cliff framed against a perfectly symmetrical sun, it took my breath away. Gris has some of the most amazing visual design in video games. There are several moments that play with this idea of symmetry. Some are interactive but most arent, instead happening when the young woman falls from a cliff or swims upward to escape a dark pursuer. I was often enthralled by the design of the different stages and would stop just to look at what was on screen. The menus, too, are simply gorgeous, and built around the circular design of Griss main collectibles. Form vs Function Finding these collectibles starts out simple and never really evolves. Each world is a linear path that eventually splinters off into multiple branches. While initially appearing complicated, each level follows the same basic layout. Within each branch is one of a preset amount of collectibles you need to find in order to unlock an ability or way forward. These are usually easy to get through via light platforming or environmental puzzle solving and didn't offer any real impedance to my progress. Each world comes with a new ability  one allows you to turn into a heavy block to walk through strong winds and destroy broken floor tiles  and each subsequent world factors in the preceding ability in some interesting ways. One of the final worlds introduces a new element that builds on the idea of symmetry, and it makes for one of the most gorgeously presented 2D levels in recent memory. Sadly, the level is confusing to move through and the way forward isnt always clear. Gris's focus on symmetry can sometimes make its levels difficult to navigate. Completing a level returns you to a central hub world where the previous world's collectibles leave to form part of a constellation. Its rewarding to return to a familiar area after each stage and see your progress reflected in the environment. Areas of the palace will spring to life as your newfound abilities reinvigorate plants and animals. Gris is best played in one four to five-hour sitting, but during that time I found it to be a chore in certain stretches. While the light line work and subtle colouring of backgrounds and characters is a visual feast, it negatively impacts the central platforming gameplay. Several times I found myself stuck on a puzzle as I couldnt distinguish the white lines that denote a platform from the background. In other sections it simply wasnt clear what was part of the foreground, middleground, or background, and I found myself jumping over rocks that turned out to be in the foreground or falling in front of a platform that was in the background. These issues are individually minor but start to add up, as exploration is the main means of interacting with the stages. One and Done Theres also not much of a reason to replay Gris. I would've loved the ability to return to earlier stages with new abilities simply to move through them with more options, but after each level is finished its blocked off and accessible only from the chapter menu screen. When you return to a location, youre stripped of any new abilities, making replaying levels just that  everything is reset except for collectible mementos. Each stage has a set number of these collectibles that, when complete, unlock a reward. But the only way to track them is by warping to the start of each level and finding which particular part of a chapter hid the uncollected few I needed wasnt clear. Its another minor inconvenience that started compounding the more time I spent playing. Platforming in Gris is simple but can feel tedious. The larger issue that emerged over time is that Griss platforming and puzzles are overly simple. Its levels are linear to a fault, even when they give you the option to explore in any direction, and the only times I got stuck were due to visual design inconsistencies. Simplicity isn't itself a bad thing, especially when done elegantly, but in Griss case it makes exploring the vast landscapes tedious and repetitive. Gris is, at times, a meditative, affecting exploration of complex emotions that uses its levels as a canvas for some of the most beautiful visual design in any platformer, backed by a fantastic score. At others, its a maddeningly simple and confusing game that lets its artistic ambitions run roughshod over its gameplay.", "date": "Dec. 14, 2018,"}
