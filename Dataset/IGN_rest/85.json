If 2016s Godzilla Resurgence was a jump forward, then Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters is a leap. Not only because its the first animated Godzilla film, but also because it just oozes video game sensibilities. Look at the background of the production team. Directors Kobun Shizuno and Hiroyuki Seshita are known for their work on Knights of Sidonia, Ajin: Demi-Human and BLAME!, and between them they have pushed the boundaries of CG animation in Japan, but at the beginning of their careers, they were also involved in the production of a Final Fantasy-related anime series. The film is animated by Polygon Pictures, a cel-shading animation house that previously worked on games like Onimusha 2, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, Resident Evil 5 and Street Fighter 5. The screenplay is handled by Gen Urobuchi, best known for anime such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Psycho-Pass, but with Nitroplus he worked on the scenario for visual novel games like Kikokugai and Saya no Uta. Looking at all this, it is obvious that Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters is a film produced by people who know their games. Even if you ignore the staffs work history, the movie itself feels like a video game. The premise is based around coming up with a plan to defeat Godzilla, and then carrying out said plan, similar to how gamers wrack their brains trying to analyze and defeat a difficult boss. Since the film is set in the distant future, the filmmakers have the liberty of ignoring whatever remains of human society and governments, and it is set in a wide-open field much like those of RTS/action games. Has there ever been a Godzilla film like this? While Godzilla Resurgence paid respect to earlier films in the series by utilizing Godzillas symbolism and social commentary as a response to political issues at the time, Planet of the Monsters seems to completely throw those elements away. In exchange, the series has obtained new liberties. Godzilla has gone from a menace threatening cities into a target that needs to be destroyed. Instead of Japan or Tokyo, the film is set on an uninhabited version of Earth 20,000 years in the future, allowing the filmmakers to create an unusual topography, making it look like theres some sort of hidden treasure (an item related to beating Godzilla). Being set in a field thats just begging for exploration might be yet another first for a Godzilla film. Giant monsters have chased humanity to the verge of extinction, and the remaining population have escaped Earth on a space ship. Resources are dwindling and feelings of hopelessness are growing, prompting a return to the planet they had fled years earlier. This is arguably one of the most desperate situations ever for a Godzilla film. However, the impressions I got from the film were positive and bright. This comes from the fact that there is an enemy to beat, a plan to do so, and a planet to reclaim. Rather than being attacked by Godzilla out of nowhere, humanity is invading Godzillas territory and taking back the planet they lost. This differs greatly from the usual formula in the series of having humanity on the defense, and maybe this different approach is why the film gives off a more positive vibe. While we cant experience the sense of danger and despair that Godzilla normally brings by destroying cities, some may prefer this approach. (Personally, I like Godzilla to be a bit more frightening.) How does this Godzilla differ in terms of symbolism? Up until now, the series has symbolized nuclear weaponry, air raids, pollution and the Japanese military, among other things. What has happened to those themes this time around? The Godzilla here has a different build from past variations. The beast is heavy set and stout. What is the meaning behind this change in form? This Godzilla more closely resembles forests and mountains; nature and the Earth itself. Seeing Godzilla conjoined with the planets forest and mountains evoked a similar awe to seeing such natural sights for real. Its a fantastic departure from what were used to. While Godzilla is a monster deeply connected with Japan, this film introduces Godzilla as an object of awe, much like those found in religions that worship mountains and nature. As a monster so closely embedded in Japanese culture, this is an unusual side of Godzilla to stress. Godzilla has burst from mountains and caused landslides before, but it is a first for Godzilla to be depicted in such an awe-inspiring way. Realizing a world of awe-inspiring nature with the use of artificial tools such as CG animation might be one of the most memorable achievements of this film. Planet of the Monsters is the first film in a trilogy. My review score is a 7.0 because it cuts off right where the story is starting to pick up. With a runtime of only 88 minutes, it feels unsatisfying. Compared with Blade Runner 2049s 164 minute runtime, it feels like something is missing; they couldve just compressed the next few parts into one whole film. While Im not sure how the story will unfold going forward, if they continue with the formula of Godzilla representing nature and the planet, there is a good chance that the series will unfold with themes of humanity fighting nature itself, utilizing science and such to extend humanitys livable territory. Judging from the encounters in the film, its likely that other creatures and obstructions exist that will make the return home not a simple task. Most likely, the fact that Godzilla itself has been drawn using artificial animation techniques will have something to do with future developments. Itll be interesting to see how the CG-animated series builds upon the theme of science and nature clashing that has been a staple of the Godzilla series. Whether or not this anime-game-hybrid version of Godzilla will be well received depends on that. Naoya Fujita is a freelance writer for IGN Japan. This article was translated by Alexander Neang. Planet of the Monsters biggest selling point is its fresh take on the creature Godzilla. While the film employs cel shading and game-like elements, the standard formula of Godzilla gets flipped on its head with humanity on the offense. The question of whether it was worth giving up the joy and terror of watching the destruction of well-known cities along with losing social commentary to gain these new liberties will have to be answered by future movies in the trilogy.", "date": "Jan. 19, 2018,"}
