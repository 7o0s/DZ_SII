What's most notable about its lineup is it has just one high-end mouse for FPS players  the M65 Pro RGB ($39.99 on Amazon), and it's built for a specific type of gamer: a right-handed, FPS player that uses a palm grip. Though it doesnt make an obvious bid for gamers attention with its staid exterior, it is an impressive piece of machinery and a great deal at just $40 online. Ergonomics and Design The M65 features an aluminum unibody frame that Corsair proudly calls aircraft-grade. I'm not sure there are planes in the sky that feature the same type of aluminum, but I can tell you the mouses build quality is first rate. It offers a pleasing rigidity and heft, weighing a stout 135.5 grams when employing the three optional weights you secure to its bottom panel. You can remove the weights using a coin or screwdriver. With all three weights and screws removed, the mouse drops to 115 grams. I appreciate the wide degree of weight customization and how hefty the mouse feels when fully loaded. By comparison, the G.Skill RipJaws MX780 ($39.99 on Amazon) weighs 120 grams at its heaviest. The Corsair M65 Pro RGB features a soft plastic coating on the single top piece that comprises the right- and left-click buttons and palm rest. The sides feature a textured, grippy surface for your thumb, ring, and pinky fingers, but the right side of the mouse has no ledge or even the beginnings of a ledge upon which your pinky might rest. Since my pinky was dangling off to the side a bit it was gently pinched underneath the mouse a few times, which was annoying. On the bottom panel, the Corsair M65 Pro RGB features five large glide pads. Mouse movement felt smooth, but I found the G.Skill RipJaws MX780 and its smaller glide pads offered a slightly smoother gliding sensation. As I wrote earlier, this is a right-handed only mouse, which is common in the gaming mouse world, but it's also what I'd call a palm grip only mouse due to its long and low design and the fact that you can't adjust the height of its palm rest. If you could adjust its height it would also make it suitable for so-called ~claw grip~ users, but out of the box they might have a tough time feeling comfortable with this mouse. The Corsair M65 Pro RGB features eight programmable buttons. In addition to right- and left-click buttons, it offers a clickable scroll wheel, DPI up and down buttons, and three buttons for your thumb. Below the standard forward and back thumb buttons is a ~sniper~ button, which lowers the DPI setting when it's held down. It also offers extreme sensitivity, even in a crowd of highly sensitive mice, and features a 12,000dpi optical sensor and surface tuning capability for extreme precision. Software Corsair's software is named the Corsair Utility Engine (CUE), and it works across all the company's products that support software control so it's full-featured and offers a lot of options. Probably the most important setting to tweak is the DPI range that you can cycle through while gaming. You can enable up to five DPI settings that range from 800dpi to 9,000dpi, which is pretty typical, but Corsair also allows you to go even further, dropping down as low as 100dpi or a max of 12,000dpi which is a huge range. When you adjust the DPI setting, the light between the up and down buttons changes colors to let you know which setting you have selected, which is handy. In the CUE there is also a separate slider to set the DPI for the sniper button so that you can, for example, lower the DPI to 100 when zoomed in with a sniper rifle, then have it return to 8,000 when you release it. You can also calibrate the M65 for your mousing surface regardless of whether its a proper gaming surface, wood desk, or even glass. The software has you click and drag an icon for roughly five seconds to complete the calibration, so it's a quick affair. You can also adjust the mouses polling rate, which is a semi-common feature of gaming mice that's designed to make mouse movement feel smoother. Out of the box, the mouse is set to a rate of 1,000Hz (1ms response time) but you can lower it to 500Hz (2ms), 250Hz (4ms), or 125Hz (8ms) if you prefer a less twitchy experience. The mouse also features onboard memory for storing profiles so you can take them with you, saving you lengthy setup procedures when gaming at a friends house. Finally, you can also change the mouse's RGB color options using the CUE software. In addition to the color-coded light between the DPI buttons, the Corsair M65 Pro RGB features two other customizable lighting zones: Corsairs logo on the heel of the mouse and the area below the scroll wheel. You can set a color and lighting effect for each zone, and . Gaming In testing, the Corsair M65 Pro RGB felt smooth, accurate and responsive. The placement of the buttons felt comfortable, and FPS fans will appreciate the dedicated sniper button that features its own DPI setting. The buttons, too, offer excellent travel and springy feedback, and they are blissfully quiet when clicked. The rubberized, textured scroll wheel was also a pleasure to use. The Corsair M65 Pro RGB was stellar across the gaming spectrum, from an RTS game such as Civ V to manic FPS games like Quake and Counter-Strike. The soft-touch plastic never seemed to lose its grip even when our hand got a bit sweaty, and the grippy, curved sides made me feel like I was in complete control of the mouse at all times. The thumb buttons are positioned in just right spots and overall where we could reach them without straining or repositioning our grip. Purchasing Guide The Corsair M65 Pro RGB has an MSRP of $59.99, but like a lot of PC hardware it can generally be nabbed at a discount and is currently just $39.99 on Amazon for the white version: See the Corsair M65 Pro RGB on Amazon Note that if you click on one of these links to buy the product, IGN may get a share of the sale.
