The latest Omen X 17-ap001ne from HP that we are reviewing today is one such choice, featuring the GTX 1080 GPU, a grogeous 4K IPS screen, a fast storage solution and plenty of ports for your devices. Design While HP is already known for making some great clamshell laptops and ultrabooks, their gaming laptops are a step further in both design, build quality and performance. We are talking about a laptop that weighs 4.85kg and features dimensions of 42.5 x 32.72 x 3.64cm. The 17.3-inch IPS display features anti-glare coating with good viewing angles. The maximum screen resolution available is 3840 x 2160, for the best image sharpness. The whites of the screen appear to be warm by default, but thats a personal preference whether you like the color temperature to be warm or cool. On the top of the screen is HPs Wide Vision Full HD camera with dual-array microphones on either side of the lens. The screen is connected via two curvy hinges, and in between them resides the LED-backlit OMEN logo. There is enough room for a full-sized keyboard and the lighting effects of the backlit keys can be set up with different animations or static themes via the Omen Command Center application. There is also a dedicated key for the Omen Command Center above the numeric pad. There are 6 programmable macros keys on the left side, which can be set manually. You can also lock the Windows key to avoid accidentally pressing it while typing or playing any game. It didnt take much time to get used to the keyboard though and the key travel is good. The touchpad could have been a little bit wider since there is enough estate on the palm rest area. HP has equipped a decent number of ports on the laptop, although, it seems some of them is located on very odd sides. The laptop features a total of three USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (one on the left, one the right and one behind the laptop). While I understand that the HDMI port, the mini Display Port, the two Thunderbolt 3 ports and the RJ-45 jack is best suited to be behind the laptop to avoid any wire tangles, the USB 3.1 port and one of the Thunderbolt ports thats (located on the rear), should have been on the side of the laptop for easy access. However, while all the USB 3.1 ports should theoretically offer almost the same performance, we got different transfer speeds on each. We compared the transfer speeds of each USB 3.1 port by copying some of our massive Steam game files from a Samsung T1 1TB external SSD to the internal SSD of the laptop. It so happens that the USB ports on the side of the laptop were performing low transfer speeds below 100MB/s for large files and sometimes even lower than 50MB/s. But that wasnt the case with the USB 3.1 port on the rear side as that port easily transferred gigabytes of data above 300MB/s. We even checked to make sure if there were any driver issues but the transfer speeds remained the same. It could be that this issue is contained to our review unit, so the USB ports might perform properly on retail units. There is a multi-format SD card reader on the right side and two audio jacks on the left with support for DTS Headphone X for a true surround sound experience. The power connector of the laptop is located on the right side. The laptop also features two Bang & Olufsen powered speakers on either side. Speaking of which, the Omen X 17 features dual vents on the rear for efficient cooling of the CPU and GPU. However, I didnt find any means to control the fan speed, much like how some of the MSI high-end gaming laptops have a dedicated key for maximum fan speed. The rear side of the screen features the X light bars with the OMEN branding insignia. There is also another lightbar above the rear-facing ports. Specifications and Benchmarks Powering this beast is the 7th generation Intel i7-7820HK quad-core processor. The 14nm Kaby Lake chip operates at a base speed of 2.9 GHz and can fire up to 3.9 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost technology. There are two user accessible memory slots that are filled with 16GB DDR4-2666 RAM modules and thats a total of 32GB DDR4 RAM on this laptop. Im not going to sit and talk about how fast the laptop for normal uses is as its a high-end gaming laptop with ample amount of RAM and a Samsung 256GB MZVLW256HEHP PM961 M.2 NVMe SSD to speed things up. That drive is none other than the OEM version of the Samsung 960 EVO NVMe SSD. There is also a 1TB hard drive for all your mass storage needs. We ran a series of benchmarks for the processor and storage, so check out the results below. Now comes the part where most of us gamers are interested. Yes, this machine packs the NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU with 8GB GDDR5X RAM onboard. Its perfect for 1080p gaming with all graphical settings cranked up. But, while playing at 2160p, its better to tone down those effects. Regardless, we have benchmarked the laptop with several FutureMark tests and ran several games on both resolutions at maximum settings, so you would get a clear idea of how the laptop performs. As for the operating temperatures, the processor easily went over 90 degrees and the GTX 1080 GPU went up to 78 degrees while playing graphic-intensive games. During our gameplay tests, we could feel that the heat was building up in the upper area of the keyboard estate. We also ran some copy tests on the Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD and it went up to 63 degrees. Battery Life and Temperatures For a laptop thats this big, this model packs a 6-cell, 99 Wh Li-ion battery. The machine can easily last between 2 to 3 hours, depending on what application youre using. HP claims that the laptops 330W AC power adapter can charge the batteries to approximately 50% in 30 minutes. However, the fast charge is only possible when you completely shut down the laptop. For a moment, we hoped to see a smartphone-like fast charge capability on a gaming laptop. We must also point out that our review unit didnt have the standard Windows power profiles such as Low Power and High Performance, and instead, was replaced by an HP Recommended balanced profile. But that didnt stop us from custom creating our own high-performance or power-saver battery profiles. HP knows how to make great gaming laptops under the OMEN branding and the Omen X 17-ap001ne proves that point. Although not entirely perfect, the machine is well-made with sufficient cooling for the hardware inside. The laptop simply holds the best graphics chip that NVIDIA has to offer and is paired with a powerful Intel CPU and a large amount of upgradable RAM. While the inclusion of the 4K display is a great bonus, it may be a bit too much for the GTX 1080 to handle (if maximum graphical settings are your top priority). Remember, even the mighty desktop-class GTX 1080 Ti GPU struggles to handle 4K at max settings for many game titles. While the NVMe used here is one of Samsungs best, HP could have done something to handle the heat produced while copying large files at high speed. We wish there were options to manually control the cooling fans on this system as other brands do offer such capability. Other than that, its quite a heavy laptop for its size, so portability might be an issue, however it does offer decent battery life so it should last you for a good amount of time if you do decide to carry it around.", "date": "March 29, 2018"}
