It's the most difficult team sport to talk up to non-fans. But for the faithful, the ones who love America's past time even when it's a pitcher's duel, MLB 12: The Show provides the best baseball experience on consoles, and now the PlayStation Vita. For the Vita version, the Sony San Diego Studio crammed as much of The Show as possible into the smaller game. The presentational effects took a hit, so you won't hear as much commentary, or see as many replays, but that was also partly done to make the games faster, and better suited for a handheld experience. However with even less dialogue than the console, the commentary is pretty weak, and usually worth turning off. Touch Screen Pitching Ball rotation physics isn't the sexiest bullet point on The Show's features, but it's one that become instantly noticeable when you play. Line drives can chop up, balls can lift or sink in the air, and the bases can send your baseball bouncing in a different direction. However, as is the case with most new additions to a sports game, it seems like the physics are turned up a bit too much (do balls really hit off third base that often?). Pitching fans get the brand new control scheme included in the console version: pulse pitching. Instead of the familiar pitch meter, a pulsating circle grows and shrinks in the strike box. Time your pitches when the circle is at its smallest for more accuracy and power. It's a simpler, faster way to do pitching, that still keeps the timing element of the other methods. And it does something every baseball game desperately need: makes every at-bat quicker. They're not colliding, which is kind of a big deal. Franchise and Road to the Show make an appearance on Vita, with the improvements from the console. Smarter trade logic and more accurate lineups are things you probably won't notice (they tend to stand out when they're bad). Your RttS player finally gets the treatment he deserves, beginning as a Double-A starter and letting you get plenty of game time in right off the bat (baseball joke!). What the Vita version doesn't get is the brand new Diamond Dynasty mode, so if trading baseball cards to make teams is a feature you really want, keep that in mind. However you do get touch screen controls, which comes in handy for choosing where your pitch goes, without having to hold the analog stick steady. CC Sabathia... SMASH! The big feature Sony is touting for MLB 12 is the ability to transfer saves. You can upload a single save file, like a Franchise career or Road to the Show character, to ~the cloud~ and then download him to the console or Vita. It allows you to continue to play your saved game on the go, which is awesome if you own both copies of the game. It's not a feature that's cool enough to warrant two purchases, but if you have to have baseball on your couch and on the go, score! Closing Comments MLB 12: The Show is a major step up from the PSP versions. Its nearly the same game as the console. The touchscreen controls are a nice addition. Its a smaller, slightly less polished version of the game, but still an awesome baseball experience, and one of the best portable sports games ever.
