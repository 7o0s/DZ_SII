Shadows $139.99 Ghost (See it on Shadow's website) box, in particular, aims to replace your gaming PC by allowing you to play any game on a tiny, low-powered boxwith GTX 1080-level graphics. Shadow Ghost Game Streaming Box  Design and Features The Ghost is shaped rather uniquely, with a curved, wave-like form factor sporting some 3D polygonal flourishes on the bottom. It consists of a single, triangle-shaped power button on the front, and a rear IO that includes a gigabit Ethernet port, two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, an HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a jack for the included power adapter. Inside, it also features dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1, if you want to use Bluetooth-enabled gamepads. When powered on, it has a rather bright red light that shines out from the bottom for a very ~gamer~ ambiance, though Id argue its a little too bright, especially if youre playing in the evenings. Nothing a little electrical tape or some LightDims cant fix, though. Blade, the company that developed the Ghost, says they designed the box to be small and portable (its about 7x5x2 inches in size), light (weighing in at 7 ounces), silent (due to its ARM processor and fanless cooling), and power efficient (consuming about 5W of power while gaming, instead of the 150W or more you see on many gaming PCs). Their marketing boasts the energy conservation is a money-saving prospect, but at the end of the day, were probably talking tens of dollars over the long haul, not hundreds of dollars, depending on where you live and the cost of electricity. But the Ghost isnt really about hardware. Its about the Shadow software that runs your games on a server, sending them to your Ghost in the form of streaming video. You pay $35 per month, and just hook a mouse, keyboard, and/or gamepad up to the Ghost, and itll send your inputs back to the host PC, which is running an 8 thread Intel Xeon CPU, An NVIDIA GTX 1080 (or equivalent Quadro), 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an insane internet connection. Since the host PC is connected to Shadows gigabit internet, your games download to the host in mere minutes, so you can get playing right away (with your Steam Cloud saves, no less). If you install and reinstall a lot of games, thats pretty awesome. At the time of this writing, Shadow is available in all US states except Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Alaska, and Hawaiithough Shadow says theyre going nationwide soon. Shadow is also available for most major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux (in alpha), Android, and iOSso when youre done playing on your Ghost, you can pick up where you left off on just about any device. I tested the service on the Ghost as well as multiple Windows PCs and my iPad, and the service was pretty consistent across all of them (at least, on my home networkmore on that later. Shadow Ghost  Software The Shadow software, which is similar across desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and the Ghost), presents you with a dark window sporting a few options for customizing your connection. You can set your bandwidth, so it knows how much to compress the video stream, as well as adjust the video codec and the color rendering. (Desktop platforms have more experimental options, while the Ghost is a bit more bare.) If youre hooking the Ghost up to your TV, youll want to follow the same best practices you would for any other PClike setting your TV to Game Mode, naming the input PC so it doesnt overscan, and making sure the color rendering matches your TV (RGB Full or RGB Limited) so things look right. It took a bit of tweaking to get things just right for my TV, but once I did, everything looked as it should. Unfortunately, the Ghost doesnt really work great as a living room TV device, at least as far as the login process is concerned. Theres no way to control anything with a gamepad, so its clear Shadow is expecting you to use a keyboard and mouseor at least have one sitting in front of your TV every time you turn on the box. I also had problems with the Remember Me checkbox on the login pagethe Ghost would constantly log me out of my account by the time I came back the next day, and Id have to enter my password and log in all over again. Switching to the beta client, an option available to all users, solved the issue, but its clear the folks at Blade are still working out a few kinks. (Ive also had a few random errors that required a hard reboot to fix, and one of those errors was in French.) Once you log in and click the big Start button, youll boot into your virtual machine and start using Windows just like any other PC. You can browse the web, install apps, and login to Steam or similar services and play games you own, or buy new ones. This is in stark contrast to some other game streaming services, like GeForce Now, which only really stream the game itself, and only for games it specifically supports (there are workarounds, but your mileage may vary). With Shadow, you actually have an entire Windows PC at your disposal, which is much more flexible. Shadow Ghost  Gaming When Shadow works, its pretty darn great. Hardwiring the Ghost to my 100 megabit internet connection over Ethernet produced a perfectly smooth experience at 1080p, with ultra graphics settings at 60 frames per second. (The Ghost also supports 144Hz at 1080p, though I don't have a compatible monitor to test that particular configuration.) The graphics arent quite as sharp as they would be on an actual PC equipped with a GTX 1080the video compression is somewhat noticeable (or very noticeable, if you have a slower connection)but its better than, say, playing the game natively on a crappy laptop. 100 megabit internet connection over Ethernet produced a perfectly smooth experience at 1080p, with ultra graphics settings at 60 frames per second. Input lag will vary depending on your ping time to Shadows servers, and Ive seen it described by other users as everything from unnoticeable to unplayable. I didnt notice any discernible lag on my connection, but then again, I also prefer to play with V-Sync enabledso if that statement alone makes you balk, cloud gaming may not be for you just yet. Switching from 1080p to 4K was a mixed bag. Even if I turned the game settings down enough to get 60 frames per second on the in-game stats, motion was noticeably more choppy than it was at 1080p. Since my internet connection was well above Shadows required 15 megabits per second, and I can stream 4K video on my other devices just fine, I had to chalk it up to the Shadow service (especially since it happened on my PC as well, taking blame off the low-powered Ghost hardware). The folks at Shadow recommended I update to the Beta version of their softwarewhich is available to all users from the main menuand this helped a fair amount. It still wasnt quite as smooth as 1080p, but at least Shadow gives you the option, so you can decide which is more important to you if you run into the same issue. Playing over Wi-Fi, things get even murkier. While the Ghost has a solid Wi-Fi chip inside its tiny body, that doesnt guarantee you a playable experience. Connecting to my own home Wi-Fi actually worked reasonably well, while streaming games at my father-in-laws housewhich boasted the same 100 megabit internet connectionwas straight up unplayable, even standing right next to the router. Remember, even if a speed test tells you youre getting fast internet, Wi-Fi is full of latency and other hiccups that can hamper your streaming experience, and some networks will be more reliable than others. So the whole pick up and play anywhere idea kind of falls flat on its face unless you can wire up directly via Ethernet. (This is more Wi-Fis fault than it is Shadows, but its just a bit of a reality check on their play anywhere tagline.) Finally, lets talk about Shadows subscription cost. At $35 per month, Shadow claims it will take you about 4.7 years to approach the same cost of building an equivalent PC yourselfwhich, at their measurement of $2,000, is probably pretty accurate. (That doesnt include the cost of the box, but lets generously say that itll get cancelled out by energy savings within that time.) However, not everyone choosing between a Ghost and a PC would necessarily build a $2,000 beast, especially when a $1,200 PCstuffed in a compact Mini-ITX casecan perform more than admirably at 1080p, with fewer quirks and less dependence on network reliability. That makes only 2.8 years until building a PC is a better option, and most PCs will last longer than thatthough Shadow does include hardware upgrades in your subscription over time. In comparison, Shadows competitors use different pricing structuresmany have you pay for the number of hours you play, which could be cheaper or more expensive depending on your usage. GeForce Now is free while in beta, and you can get instant beta access by buying a $190 Shield TVa much better deal than the alternativesthough I dont know when itll come out of beta and what the price will be. I'm not saying Shadow isn't worth the price, just that you really need to do the math to see if it's worth it for you. Im not saying Shadow isnt worth the price, just that you really need to do the math to see if its worth it for you. If your only PC is a little laptop with integrated graphics, the Shadow service is a decent replacement for a desktop gaming rig. Or, if you have a gaming PC but travel for long periods of time during the year, you could spin up the Shadow service when you need it and cancel it when you donttheres no contract and you can cancel at any time. Its just a matter of whether you visit enough reliable networks for the play anywhere notion to actually be worthwhile. The Shadow service works well on robust networks, but isnt as reliable as a gaming PC. The Ghost serves as a great companion to Shadows software, though, so if game streaming is right for you, the Ghost is a good buybut at $35 a month, its really only worth it if youre replacing a gaming PC rather than complementing one.", "date": "Feb. 27, 2019,"}
