Kinect Rush looks to capitalize on a similar experience. However, instead of delving into Disney's theme parks again, Kinect Rush presents a world connecting the films of Pixar, the acclaimed animation studio behind Toy Story, Up!, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and others. Kinect Rush bears more than a passing semblance to Disneyland Kinect Adventures, as both games stick you in a central hub and allow you to explore a variety of fully-fledged worlds. However, Kinect Rush offers more of an action-adventure take, where most levels unfold in third-person action style gameplay focused on collecting coins, performing specific goals, and getting a high score at the end. Kinect Rush Gameplay At the start, Kinect can scan your face and create an avatar based on your appearance. Conceptually, you only need to stand in the right position and Kinect Rush will do the rest. In my case I had trouble getting the game to register my position and create an accurate likeness of me. But considering I'm taller than the game's target demographic, I figured I'd let it slide. Kinect Rush takes five familiar Pixar films (Up!, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Cars, and Toy Story) and divvies them up into a set of missions. You'll team up with characters from established films, like Remy, Buzz Lightyear, Lightning McQueen, and others. You even gain control over a few of them and unlock them as playable characters so you can live out your Pixar fantasies. The game's central hub area, Pixar Park, is where you'll spend time interacting with other children and making your way to areas throughout the park. As you meet Pixar Park's other denizens, you'll embark on imaginative adventures with them, completing missions and gaining unlocks through the game's themed environments. Pixar Park lacks the exploration element of Disneyland Kinect Adventures, so there not much to do between missions. Pixar Park is your central hub, tying all of the worlds together. The simple act of getting around is where Kinect Rush hits a major stumbling block. To move your character forward, you have to swing your arms as though you're running in place. Changing your direction is done by turning your shoulders in the direction that you'd like your character to go. Trying to control your character isn't very intuitive, and considering it occasionally registers sidesteps instead of turns, it leads to some frustrating control moments. Couple that with unregistered and laggy motions like jumping or climbing, and the on-foot sequences feel broken. It wouldn't be a huge deal were it not for the fact that many levels rely on platforming sequences. The way the scoring system is divided, you'll be ranked on how many coins you collect as well as how fast you complete each stage. However, when simply getting your character around in the levels is such an obstacle, reaching for that gold medal is frustrating at times. Play as beloved characters like Buzz Lightyear through the game's missions. In the stages that don't require you to walk your avatar around, the game does a fine job of blending diverse gameplay and fun controls. The Cars driving levels handle well, with responsive and intuitive hands-free controls. Holding out your arms and pretending you're holding a steering wheel feels as natural as it could, and steering was responsive and fun. Unfortunately, these driving sequences were greatly outnumbered by the lackluster on-foot missions. Kinect Rush's look fares quite a bit better. The characters boast a nice detailed look that does a fine job of mirroring their movie counterparts. Also, the environments are nicely detailed and capture the spirit of the films. The sound effects are also well done, although there is quite a bit of repetition in the dialogue, particularly when your co-op buddies dole out the same hints seconds apart like broken records. CLOSING COMMENTS Kinect Rush does a good job of capturing the Pixar atmosphere, and is sure to give kids plenty of exercise as they complete the game's mission set. However, the control issues make for an frustrating experience at best and a broken one at worst. IGN RATINGS FOR KINECT RUSH: A DISNEY PIXAR ADVENTURE (X360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.5 Presentation The game doesn't really feature much of a cohesive story tying it together, and there's really not much to explore in either the stages or the central hub, Pixar Park. 7.5 Graphics While it won't bowl you over with technical prowess, the game does a fine job of capturing the look and feel of the Pixar worlds from which it draws inspiration. 6.0 Sound The sound effects and music are decent, but the voice work is way too repetitive. 6.0 Gameplay The driving sequences are fun and intuitive, but trying to steer your character through the on-foot sections is very cumbersome. 5.0 Lasting Appeal The whole experience is short-lived and fairly abrupt, and the lack of a reason to explore the world means you won't be returning often. 6.0 OVERALL Okay (out of 10)", "date": "March 27, 2012"}
