If you paid attention to The Last of Us, you have some semblance of how Left Behind will end. The moment I started the game, I felt a tinge of sadness as I began to anticipate that moment. That heart-wrenching inevitability of this elegant and beautiful story, about two friends and the sustainability of their friendship in a world that has met its ruin. Disclosing anything about Left Behind would be trudging dangerously into spoiler territory - the game has been so delicately built with everything being so relevant and important, that its hard to share anything without robbing you of its unique experience. Left Behind feels necessary. Despite coming as a DLC, Left Behind is a story Naughty Dog would had been remiss not to tell. Its a risky endeavor and features some pretty solid story-changing moments, but Neil Druckman & co. once again show restraint and skill in tackling a subject that will be as debatable as the originals. It walks the tight line between adding to the original story and swiftly ruining what they had so lovingly built Left Behind is tonally and mechanically different from The Last of Us. Its more explorative than action heavy, more focused than Ellies and Joels story, and it benefits heavily from its limited time as it swiftly moves from one story piece to another, leaving no time for fillers that handicapped the original. The game loosely picks up towards the end of the four-part American Dream novel, and if you havent read it already, I highly recommended to do so to get a better sense of understanding between the two main leads - Ellie, and her military school friend Riley. They are the quintessential mischiefs; as brash and daringly bold as their naivety allows. Together they are the source of many a pain for the concerned parties involved. Yet it never diminishes their need to explore the world that lays outside of their military prison, even if it exposes them to the horrors that plague it. Left Behind is set in an abandoned shopping mall. This bastion of commerce and glittering luxury now lies in ruin, reeking of death and misery and only slightly resembling what it once stood for. But for Riley and Ellie, its a place that holds unbridled wonders, filled with amazing things to see and do, and acts as a large playground ripe for any odd game they can come up with. Once bustling with kids, Raja's Arcade is a sad reminder of the days gone by. The mall is almost an alien place to Ellie and Riley. They have never seen what a mall is truly all about, they only have an idea that its for family outings, catching a movie with friends, or spending coins in Rajas Arcade playing video games. Their unfamiliarity with worldly things shows through as they dumbly quip about things we usually take for granted. At a photobooth, Ellie ponders, What is Face...book? Maybe they print our faces on a book!. Their half-bemused and half-delighted perspective gives a fresh twist to the drab setting, creating many such moments that are genuinely funny and heartwarming. In one instance, Riley gifts Ellie a book of puns and for the next five minutes you can sit through all the jokes as they laugh and comment on them like two close friends would. In another scene, Ellie picks up a fortune-telling skull and asks if she will ever get to play a video game, or if they will manage to get out from there alive. There are many such sweet moments throughout Left Behind, as well as tragic ones. And it is these moments that forms the heart of the story, and of Ellies and Rileys relationship which is as convincing - and as equally powerful - as that between Ellie and Joel. Its a new dynamic and a different kind of bond, one that is forged not just through words but simple mechanics, which Naughty Dog freely experiments with to connect with the player. As the two girls explore the mall in their slow and steady pace, the underlying tension between them emerges. There is a purpose to their extravagant outing - Riley has become a Firefly and wants to say her final goodbye. Was she looking for an outing and a way to ease the pain of separation, or was she trying to convince herself that it was the right thing to do? It is the impact of that answer that changes everything and very curiously ties into the original storyline. Ellie must take on human survivors and infected both. While largely an explorative piece, Left Behind does lean on action for a bit. Ellie is only a shadow of herself from The Last of Us, and while she can craft the same items as Joel, she is given a small range of arsenals to deal with the dangerous predicaments that lay ahead. There is a new dynamic to the action though where Ellie will repeatedly find herself surrounded by both the infected and human survivors, and dealing with them separately does bring about a new strategic element thats not found in the original game. In one instance, it was possible to manipulate an encounter between a horde of infected and a group of survivors by throwing bricks and bottles in their direction. I watched in fascination as they reacted to each other, wiping themselves out even before I could even a lay foot in their direction. I wished this aspect of the combat was fleshed out even more rather than just pitting us against another random deathmatch encounter that we had already had enough of in the original. However, as much as I love delving back into The Last of Us' strong combat sequences, Left Behind could have simply done without them. I would gladly exchange it for more exploration, or more of the banter between the two girls. Switching between such different tones almost feels jarring - maybe that was the intent - but the action always came as an unwelcomed break when I could be going in and out of more stores and checking out stuff. Pros Unbelievable performances from Ashley Johnson and Yanni KingA moving and heart-wrecking storyFilled with long-lasting momentsAdds heavily to The Last of Us experience Cons Combat could have been done without. Left Behind is exceptional, there is no doubt about it. Naughty Dogs focus on this adolescent relationship opens an exciting chapter for The Last of Us. Its riddled with moments that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. More importantly, it feels like a story that needed to be told - it fills the voids of the original in a unique way, and gives a new insight into who Ellie was, and an unpleasant foreshadowing of the sacrifices she will have to make in her journey with Joel. <br><br> Left Behind is good, its as good as The Last of Us in fact, and thats the highest compliment I can pay.<br><br> <hr /> <p> <em>Mufaddal Fakhruddin is the Editor at IGN ME.
