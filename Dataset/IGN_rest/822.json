Some of them inherit the wrong things from their big sibling, but Claptastic Voyage is the other way around. It trims out nearly all of the excessive backtracking and pacing problems that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel struggles with, and introduces a wonderfully whimsical setting that brings out the best in the Borderlands playstyle, and in its most recognizable character. Much like Tiny Tinas Assault on Dragon Keep does for Borderlands 2, Claptastic Voyage moves the Vault Hunters exploits into an imaginary realm that enables it to tell a very personal story. At the same time, its a delightful departure from Pandoras traditional trappings (to whatever degree you find masked, homicidal little people and robots who transform into pirate ships traditional). Here, its a digital recreation of Claptraps notoriously scattered mind instead of Tinas D&D fantasy world, but the setup is equally ripe with potential, and Claptastic Voyage dutifully makes the most of it, both in terms of gameplay and story content. Being set in a digital, Matrix-like world has upsides; Claptastic Voyages environments are basically interesting abstractions of the inner workings of software, or of Claptraps memories, both of which are strange and entertaining in their own ways. Zipping from place to place on neon-colored data streams is a Tron-era fantasy few modern games have realized, for instance, and seeing code glitches and memory degradation made manifest as obstacles or objectives makes Claptastic Voyage feel refreshingly unlike any other piece of Borderlands weve seen so far. It feels chaotic and alien, but definitely cool and even thoughtful - especially when it treads into deeper waters. It doesnt tug on the heartstrings quite as artfully as Dragon Keep, but Claptastic Voyage does shine some light on Claptraps inner workings, making him something more than the silly, wisecracking robot hes been to us for the last six years - though, not much more. Its actually for the best, though. Trying too hard to make us care too deeply for such a light-hearted character could have backfired, but the writers knew where to pump the brakes. They somehow managed to make watching Claptraps struggle with self-hatred both entertaining and sweet. The result is a character I can still laugh with, but also, for the first time in the series, connect to. Story and characters aside, Claptastic Voyage iterates on the low-gravity shenanigans of The Pre-Sequel very well while adding more new twists. For instance, Volatile Bits, essentially floating clusters of polygons, that either heal you or deal big damage to surrounding enemies, depending on what color they are when you shoot them them. Theyre one-and-done, so you need to consider when to burn them carefully  and the fact that they might be a different color the moment you eventually do makes it an interesting decision. The new glitched weapon mods change things up too. Every time you reload a glitched weapon, theres a random chance of it being modified in one of a few crazy ways, like huge single-target damage at the expense of massive kickback. Some effects arent as dramatic as others, and itd be nice if those subtle effects were made more clear and useful, but much like Claptraps randomized VaultHunter.exe action skill, they introduce a fun shot of chaos into the already-hectic firefights. Theyre fun to mess with, but not practical enough that I wanted to use them in my main playthrough. I ended up going back to old bread-and-butters when the going got tough. Said firefights are even more dynamic here than in The Pre-Sequel, thanks to a slew of new enemies with new attacks and behaviors. The couple of boss fights are the ultimate expressions of this: neither leans on existing enemy types or waves of minions, opting instead to project digital clones of themselves or bring a varied arsenal of massive weapons to bear. Even the reskinned, rezzed-out bandits have some new tricks up their sleeves. Some will unpredictably teleport around you, suicide bombers will reconstruct themselves after blowing up, and Trojans can lock you down when you attempt to take to the air. Speaking of, its a little silly that theres low gravity in a digital recreation of memories that take place on Pandora, but the level designs make such good use of The Pre-Sequels traversal tricks, I had a hard time caring about the logistical leaps involved. Where The Pre-Sequel sometimes feels like exploring a standard Borderlands environment but with longer, slower jumps, Claptastic Voyage is filled with neat little platforming challenges that make getting from point A to B far more enjoyable. Soaring effortlessly through the air feels more like a superpower than a gimmick here. Thats also due to the superior pacing and general lack of backtracking. In Claptastic Voyage I was almost always moving forward figuratively, not just literally, in that Im not wasting tons of time running in circles with little to do while hunting switches. It still does the this switch/door/bridge is broken so go find stuff to unlock/fix it thing a couple of times too many, but on the whole, it isnt an issue. Ive often said that Borderlands would be better served as a more linear experience, and Claptastic Voyage stands as a great example of why. It achieves scale and freedom of movement without all the pointless wandering. Though it doesnt sport a raid boss, theres plenty of content here too. Using my borderline-broken Claptrap build, I tore through in three or four hours without touching a sidequest. Doing those was at least another couple of hours, making Claptastic Voyage one of the most substantial add-ons the series has seen. On top of that, going through again on True Vault Hunter difficulty will net you a different set of voiceovers for a new twist on the story (just like Pre-Sequel does). Pros New gameplay twistsClaptraps storyWell pacedSmart level design Cons Underwhelming glitch weapons Claptastic Voyage doesnt quite match the towering success of Tiny Tinas Assault on Dragon Keep for Borderlands 2, but it still handily sets a high watermark for The Pre-Sequel. Its lean and focused in way the main game it belongs to sometimes wasnt, and yet it still feels substantial and complete. Glitched weapons are slightly underwhelming due to their inherent unreliability, but all the other twists work well, reminding me yet again that Borderlands can get as out there as it wants while still eliciting smiles and itchy trigger fingers.", "date": "March 22, 2015"}
