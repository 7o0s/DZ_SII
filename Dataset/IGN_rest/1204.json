Air Conflicts: Vietnam should light my fire. Instead, it just crashes and burns. Air Conflicts: Vietnam is a pick-up-and-play dogfighting game set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. The best moments are spent weaving through the skies trying to establish an elusive missile lock, taking down an enemy MiG with Sidewinders or short-range cannon. Flight controls are responsive and forgiving, jet fighters feel appropriately zippy, and helicopter steering is easy to master. Most vehicles are durable enough on standard difficulty to survive a few mistakes, and the enemy AI isn't bad at all. Buckle your seatbelts - this isn't a smooth ride. The thrill of conducting your F4 Phantom through a series of death-defying acrobatics at supersonic speed is largely mitigated by the fear of slamming into an arbitrary invisible wall in the air. Map boundaries force fighters to veer off after only a few seconds of straight flight, a limitation which can be exploited against the AI. When I needed to take down an enemy fighter, I learned I could hedge him against the edge of the play area, forcing him to turn and guaranteeing he would fly straight into my waiting guns. Single-player missions allow you to switch between the cockpits of different squadron aircraft on the fly. It's a shame the limited and repetitive mission design didn't take better advantage of this feature. Most outings are some variant of moving from waypoint to waypoint and performing a simple bombing or landing task. Outside of dogfights, the long campaign got boring quickly, and the standalone single-player scenarios were no better. Transport helicopter missions are particularly tedious. Most landing scenarios switched me to an on-rails shooting segment from the door-gunner's perspective and played out like a terribly executed arcade light-gun game. A few hours in, I found myself dreading the sight of a Huey Iroquois or Chinook on my carrier deck. Spotting and prioritizing dangerous targets relies on replay and memorization more than skill and reaction time. At least the selection of aircraft is impressive, and decently rendered when viewed up close. Most of the iconic fighters, bombers, and choppers of the era make appearances, and the planes have well-enough defined speed and flight characteristics to feel distinct from one another. Only American aircraft are available in single-player, though several Soviet planes are unlocked for multiplayer as you make your way through the campaign. Of course, most enemies appear as distant outlined squares in your targeting HUD. War is hell, but it shouldn't be this ugly. Just dont look down, because the terrain is ghastly  particularly on the console versions. Foliage and hills manifest with a jarring pop-in, and textures look like something out of the original PlayStation era. The whole atmosphere feels abstract and sterile, hardly befitting the grime of the Vietnam war (and theres a tedious and limited soundtrack behind it all). The framerate stutters every now and then, but the hiccups rarely interfere with combat. I encountered a more severe technical glitch in one mission which arbitrarily disabled a near-essential HUD feature, a mishap which turned what should have been five minutes of routine flight into a half hour of frustration. Graphics are better defined on the PC, but remained unimpressive, and any benefits there are completely canceled out by a crashing bug which disabled my input devices and forced me to manually power down my computer. Multiplayer is actually quite smooth should you be fortunate enough to locate other human beings playing online, a situation I arranged only with some difficulty. The mode choices are fairly limited and the arena ridiculously claustrophobic, which took away from what would otherwise have been an enjoyable enough pick-up-and-play experience. I did appreciate the inclusion of an airborne variant of Capture the Flag, a creative idea in theory if somewhat wanting in its execution. Move controls are nominally supported on PS3, but my experience with them was dissatisfying. Move is manipulated upright like a flight stick, but button mapping did not match the functions outlined in the manual and some tasks were simply impossible. The whole system felt tacked on. Where's the eject button? Theres no hope for having something to say about the war, either. It's obvious that English wasn't the first language of the writers, and localization is sketchy. Some sentences are just a little off, feeling like they've been run through a Google translate filter. A particularly angry monologue tinged with righteous indignation made a hilariously awkward comparison between the merits of a war on trees and the a war on communism.
