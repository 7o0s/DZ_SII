On consoles theres nothing quite like it, and the fidelity of its incredibly convincing handling really needs to be felt to be believed. Is it the best driving simulator on consoles? Yes; Assetto Corsa is absolutely in a class of its own when it comes to its unflinchingly lifelike physics. But is it the best racing simulator for consoles, ever? No. Not by some margin. Assetto Corsa features a decent mix of cars (ranging from classic open-wheelers to bleeding-edge hypercars) and a modest selection of European tracks but, respectfully, Assetto Corsa wasnt the best racing simulator released in the week it hit shelves. That distinction actually belongs to Codemasters F1 2016. While Assetto Corsa succeeds as a fascinating, highly technical, and massively demanding simulation of real-life driving it largely falls over as a robust racing experience due to a wide mix of baffling and sometimes game-breaking problems. Assetto Corsa first hit Steam Early Access on PC back in late 2013 and was released officially just over a year later, in late December, 2014. Since then it has accumulated a faithful fanbase and has been regularly supported by developer Kunos Simulazioni and a thriving community of modders. It's surprising, then, that after all this progress its console debut feels unfinished. The most egregious problems occur on track, and the fundamentally flawed penalty system is an especially annoying one. If you get pinged for taking too much curb youll earn a slow down penalty, but its not nuanced enough to let you just drop to and maintain a minimum speed, or simply allow an opponent to redress. You just have to stay off the throttle entirely. Touch the loud pedal, even if youve now slowed to a crawl, and the timer will reset. Its terrible. There are no consequences for the AI for shunting you off The chief offender, however, is the opponent AI, which regularly pays no mind to your presence on each circuit and is particularly deft at muscling you onto the grass and turning your car around by poking its nose into gaps it really should have thought better of. This is where the top-notch driving dynamics Kunos has massaged into all the available vehicles becomes a double-edged sword, because it takes very little to unsettle your car at speed. Even a mild tap on the rear fender can and will spear you right off the asphalt, and there are no consequences for the AI for shunting you off. Frustratingly, opponent cars seem curiously immune to any loss of control when the shoe is on the other foot. Make a little contact via an overzealous overtake and youll generally come off second-best, while the AI peels away unaffected. Its telling, perhaps, that in Assetto Corsa all I want to do is stay away from other racers entirely, though in its Pan-European peer Project CARS I relish the aggressive, doorhandle-to-doorhandle pack racing. But its not just their racing etiquette that is wanting; its also their common sense. Ive raced several events over the past few days where the entire field has entered the pits on the penultimate lap of a four- or six-lap race. Im totally befuddled by how such a weird bug could survive a trip to retail and it helps make Assetto Corsas already chore-like career mode feel even more untested. Career mode is just a real disappointment. Racing sims like F1 2016 and Project CARS bake in career modes that feel authentic thanks to the fact podium finishes are only a prerequisite for those players whove chosen to join the most dominant, in-game race teams. The expectations on everyone else are generally more modest. It makes for far better and far more realistic racing when you know you can spend a whole race dicing for an important mid-pack overtake knowing your team is just after, say, a top 10 finish. Assetto Corsa, on the other hand, feels surprisingly old school; its top three or bust. Theres no incentive for me to battle it out with the trailing pack; if Im not within striking distance of the lead group after a couple of laps Ill just restart. If the AI wallops me off the track, Ill restart. If I fluff a braking point and spear off into the gravel, Ill restart. These restart rituals are the kind of thing I practised commonly back on the early Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport games but since then other racing sims have matured to feature career modes that make you feel like youre competing as a real race driver. Assetto Corsas racing career is really just a fractured series of vanilla assessments you have to complete successfully before moving up to the next one. The tracks have a nice, real-life, worn feel to them, especially the battered curbs There is a second way to approach Assetto Corsa and thats via its Special Events, although these are just one-off versions of events the career mode is already full of (quick races, time trials, and hot laps). The only meaningful difference here is that they can be tackled in any order you want (career mode progression is very linear in comparison). Assetto Corsas overall presentation is mixed. I love the highly-detailed and fully-functioning car interiors, and I didnt really notice too many startling visual hitches while racing with my preferred dash view. The frame rate definitely wavers on both PS4 and Xbox One when duking it out with the maximum 15 opponents, though, and AI cars are also driverless for some reason (the cars pilot themselves around the track empty but drivers will be displayed in them during replays). I also dislike the strobing effect of brake lights, which makes me feel like Im at a rave rather than a racetrack. I think the sound is mostly good; missing a bit of the ferocity of something like Project CARS (with its ear-bashing exhaust crackle and immersive chassis flex squeaks) but certainly leagues beyond Gran Turismo (though some cars are less convincing than others). The games also got a vibrant colour palette which feels a little more natural than some of its slightly washed-out competitors and, while they arent particularly eye-popping, the tracks have a nice, real-life, worn feel to them, especially the battered curbs. Its menu interface, however, is a real dud. I rapidly grew tired of the unintuitive shuffling required to move around this game. Backing out of an individual career event option? You wont be taken back to the previous menu, with other events to choose from; youll be taken straight back to the main career mode tiers. Its a completely unnecessary extra step backwards. The menus are also currently peppered with cars and events from the existing PC version that are purportedly DLC here on the console version, but when I click on them theyre apparently not available right now. Uh, cool. What I dislike more, though, is the games indifferent attitude to you finishing an event. Pass the chequered flag, either online or offline, and after a few seconds youll be teleported to your pit box  watching as AI or human opponents pop into existence behind you. Its jarring and daft. You just sit there until the results screen pops up, and then you quit the race. Its anticlimactic and unintuitive, and it makes the game feel unpolished. The force feedback is spot-on and the feel of being able to jolt over harsh curbs and truly teeter on the very edge of control is just terrific Its at its worst online as, once a race is over, youll just sit in the pits until you quit, or everyone else leaves and the event restarts. Its a weird feeling, playing a game that often feels apathetic to the fact youre actually in it. Continuing the menu malarkey, when you quit an online race youre not taken back to the online race browser  youre dumped back out in the main games Drive menu, where you need to select Online again to re-join. Sadly there isnt a great deal of reasons to race online right now anyway. The racing is serviceable enough when you can get one, but I can rarely find any players racing in the pre-set hoppers and you cant create your own events. Assetto Corsa really only works as a single-player hot lapping experience for players with a wheel. I am actually pleasantly surprised at how well Kunos has adapted the games incredibly hard-core handling scheme to a controller (even at its default sensitivity settings its less twitchy and unforgiving than Id expected, and theres even an auto-throttle blip that will help keep the car composed as you downshift) but you really require a wheel to experience the best of what Assetto Corsa has to offer. Ive been playing it with a Logitech G29 and, when its just me against the physics, its genuinely brilliant. The force feedback is spot-on and the feel of being able to jolt over harsh curbs and truly teeter on the very edge of control is just terrific. Elsewhere, however, Assetto Corsa just cant make much of a case for itself, especially for less-experienced racers. Dont bother turning on the driving line; its not dynamic so the braking points are always wrong (considering the racing line will appear in your replays too its basically as if its been painted on the track). Dont bother using the chase cam, either; Im terrible at using chase cams for racing sims at the best of times but the rigid camera on this one seems especially irksome. Also, the difficulty is really uneven; the time trials are a doddle but the racing starts ruthless and just gets harder. I like challenging and unforgiving racing games  its one of the reasons Im transfixed by Dirt Rally  but theres challenging and unforgiving, and theres poorly optimised. With no night racing, no weather effects, a fairly narrow selection of circuits, fewer cars on track, no pit engineer communication or decent race-day atmosphere  all in addition to the issues Ive described above  I just cant recommend Assetto Corsa on console over more robust race sims like F1 2016 or Project CARS. Despite its amazing driving simulation, Assetto Corsa just doesnt get the racing right. Out on track alone it feels amazing; theres no denying the remarkable realism Kunos Simulazioni has captured here. Unfortunately the team just hasnt been able to wrap a comprehensive or competitive racing experience around it this time.", "date": "Sept. 1, 2016,"}
