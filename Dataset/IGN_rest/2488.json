The Banner Saga 3 offers a bloody and satisfying conclusion to the trilogy with plenty of tough choices, challenging encounters, and vivid characters. At the same time, it also fails to address the series few weaknesses: Rote combat, an avalanche of side characters with little importance to the plot, and a short adventure. Still, it spins a good yarn and delivers immediate consequences to your decisions in such a way that I was left wanting more. It is the little details that lend weight to the stakes facing this beautiful, hand-drawn world. The devastation beyond the darkness as Ivers band travels further into the belly of the proverbial beast is unnerving, almost haunting. The fates of his band of Ravens felt as immediate as the grander mission, with simple tactical decisions as we plodded along carrying immediate life-or-death outcomes. I chose poorly more than once, but each time I did so it felt fair. Whether they were a result of ignoring the advice of a seasoned companion or just misreading a situation, in hindsight it was clear that the failures I suffered were mine alone. The fates of my allies, both in The Banner Saga 3 and those who perished in the two previous installments, served as an apt metaphor of a world on the brink, and I felt the urgency behind the bands push forward into oblivion. The absolutely shabby, frayed state of Arberrang and its citizens, told both in vignettes as Rooks (or Alettes, depending on who survived in your game) caravan passed through drove home that this was a city about to break under the weight of the end of the world, and that if I couldnt hold it together and preserve it somehow there wouldnt be a world left to save. As the tension mounted and the pace of the story accelerated, I found myself realizing that I had developed a profound empathy for the decision-makers in this tale: The burden of leadership, of carrying on in the face of mistakes or pyrrhic victories, sat as heavily on my shoulders as it did in theirs. Events, tragedies, and battles keep coming.It is this tension that horsewhips the story and keeps it pressing forward at breakneck pace. Days are passing in the Sagas world, but it never feels so. Events, tragedies, and battles keep coming, with no more than a minute or two between them, and it is this brisk pace that exposes how disappointingly short the Banner Saga 3 is. I spent eight or so hours on it, start to finish, including several reloads and experiments I undertook to test the potential twists and eddies of the story. The ending was put before me before Id had an opportunity to sit with what I was experiencing and digest it. This brevity aids in replayability, certainly, and The Banner Saga and The Banner Saga 2 are of similar length. There are enough points of divergence in this trilogy that make a second or even a third playthrough worthwhile, just to see everything that might happen. Still, seeing the end credits play so quickly after Id made some devastating choices with real consequences couldnt help but numb the pain of those results for me. A fighter knows that any gut punch, no matter how devastating, is rendered more palatable by the final bell. The battle before that ending is beautiful and powerful, however. The Banner Sagas most enjoyable feature is its story, and the tale told in this finale is a tremendous achievement. By pairing the resource management and RPG advancement mechanics with story decisions and powerful vignettes, I found myself rapidly absorbed into the unfolding drama, battles, and character progression. The principal city of Arberrang is shown to us as a big and believable painting of devastation and suffering wherein we can resupply the caravan, level up and manage our heroes, and select districts of the city that have been highlight to continue the story. From there, we travel into the famous side-scrolling landscape from the first two installments. From left to right, the caravan of our heroes travels the wartorn Arberrang or apocalyptic landscapes while important decisions and vignettes are presented to them as they go. They are also far from trivial: The fates of characters can be determined by any one of them, as can the resources and population of the caravan, which become far more than mere numbers as the story unfolds. These narrative asides can seem like small moments but can transform into quick and unexpected knives to the gut. Walls fall, fires erupt, and battle cries add to the din of chaos around you. The world-building on display here is truly impressive. Fight too long, though, and you'll risk more injuries for favorite heroes.The second major component of play is the solid if unremarkable tactical battles, several of which litter most chapters. There is no significant change from previous Banner Sagas save one: the unnecessary addition of waves of enemy reinforcements. In certain battles, youre given the option to delay victory and face another wave of enemies to earn powerful items and further character growth. Fight too long, though, and youll risk more injuries for favorite heroes as they take more and more damage. Its an interesting risk-reward concept, and in certain key places, the very idea of facing a seemingly unending horde of foes added to the feeling of being under siege, outmanned and outgunned. In most cases, though, I found it underwhelming in practice. My heroes were all so powerful by this stage of the story, and I was so comfortable and secure in their optimal use, that the items I was being rewarded with werent making that huge a difference. Before long, doubling and tripling the length of battles only served to keep me from the story that had me hooked. The Banner Saga trilogy offers challenging combat  at least when the somewhat inconsistent AI actually goes for the kill  but the lack of variety can lend a rote effect to them. The environments are new and visually interesting for each fight, set in places like a ruined and warped great hall thats fallen to darkness or a sea of bodies near a breach in Arberrangs walls. But the battles themselves often unfold similarly, even taking around the same amount of time to complete. Certain heroes rapidly accumulate kills, and other heroes render unto them the same buffs, battle after battle, over and over. A few encounters add additional objectives like protecting a unit or targeting a specific enemy or additional obstacles like fire or barricades, but the large majority are simply a race to clear the map. The Banner Saga 3 would have been better served by making combat itself more nuanced and engaging than simply adding a mechanic to lengthen encounters that soon grew boring at their standard length. Not much can be said about the aesthetic trappings of the Banner Saga 3s world that has not already been said about its predecessors: The beautiful, hand-drawn animation never dips in quality, the cutscenes look as if they belong in some cartoon masterpiece from the golden era of 90s animation, and each character is penned to look unique and striking. The Banner Saga 3 offers a darker feel to accompany a darker journey, trading some of the vibrant and spectacular imagery present in the first two games for fire and ice, tableaus of bloodshed, and the warped purple oddities within the darkness. At several moments, I found myself leaning back and simply enjoying the striking artwork being presented. In many ways, this is as beautiful as this series has ever been, and the animation team cannot be commended enough for the towering achievement this trilogy represents. The Banner Saga 3 offers the darkest entry yet in this beautifully animated tactical RPG trilogy. Choices matter and come fast and furious, making this journey a thrilling roller coaster from the opening moments to the ending credits. Combat can be a bit of a chore once you find your footing, and the story ends all too quickly, but The Banner Saga 3 is a rich and powerful experience and a worthy end to a breakout trilogy.", "date": "July 29, 2018,"}
