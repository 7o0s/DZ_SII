Read here for more on IGNs review policies. Our full review will be finalized within 48 hours of Evolves launch on Tuesday, February 10, and posted shortly thereafter. Thank you for your patience! In the meantime, well provide you with our impressions as they exist right now to give you the most up-to-date information.] So far, based on playing five-player matches with and against the limited pool of folks who have advance copies, with some surprisingly competent AI bots filling in here and there, Evolve is pretty much exactly as good as it looks on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Where a lot of high-concept games start with big promises and end in scaled back disappointment, this one achieves exactly what it set out to do. Through an array of intelligent design choices, developer Turtle Rock Studios has created an asymmetric, multiplayer monster-hunting game that doesnt play quite like anything else. Its tactically deep and bursting with character, and after my first few dozen hours, my one concern is how its progression systems might stifle its momentum early on, rather than keep us enticed. Playing as a monster that grows dramatically bigger and more powerful over the course of a roughly 15-minute match is a totally different but equally challenging role, compared to playing as one of the four more conventional class-based hunters that pursue it through large, open levels. Calling it an arena shooter would be a gross oversimplification of its novel central idea, which sees the pace of action change dynamically as the monster player feeds on AI-controlled animals and turns from hunted to hunter. As the hunters, the repeatedly interesting challenge is to use sci-fi gadgets such as sound sensors, tracking darts, and unmanned drones to chase your quarry while paying close attention to your surroundings. Fresh tracks, startled birds, fallen trees - youll need to be mindful of all of it to successfully find it before it reaches its full potential. The hunt is nuanced and thrilling, and its well-punctuated by intense slug-fests when you finally catch up to the big bad. Meanwhile, though the physically intimidating monsters would appear to be all about single-mindedly overpowering the hunters, its actually far more tense, stealth-focused, and calculated than all of that. At level 1, you just arent capable of effectively fighting a team of competent hunters; you spend the opening phases sneaking about to conceal your tracks, avoiding noisy wildlife (like birds) to keep from giving away your position, and sniffing around to find animals to eat while keeping a safe distance from the hunters. Depending on when, where, and who you end up fighting, youll need to learn how to prioritize targets, or perhaps, avoid combat completely until you can fully max out your monster powers. Working so hard to outsmart them makes eventually overpowering them an incredibly gratifying payoff. Evolve is a game of possibilities. There are 12 huge maps to stomp around in, and each has a handful of unique modifiers to choose from, giving both the monster and hunters interesting curveballs to hit. You could have low-flying cargo ships periodically spotting the monster for the hunters, or it could be mating season for the maps native wildlife, giving the monster a plentiful source of easy-to-catch food to level up with. Youll eventually have three monsters and 12 hunters to choose from, along with a variety of perks to complement their wildly diverse skill sets. Each of the four match types change the way you think about and apply them, too. Hank the supports Orbital Strike might be reliant on how well your Trapper is controlling the monsters movement in a Hunt, but in Nest mode, its an easy way to destroy a monster egg in a hurry. On the monster side, different modes encourage you to allocate your starting skill points differently to suit your approach. With my favorite monster, the stealth-focused Wraith, I'd almost always open Hunt matches by using my starting points to max her Decoy skill, and take the cooldown reduction perk, allowing me to elude the hunters almost indefinitely in case they catch me at my weakest. But in a Rescue match where I know the hunters are bum-rushing the downed survivors and ignoring me, I put points into the Warp Blast, a damaging area-of-effect attack that allows me to kill packs of wildlife quickly, and the increased feeding speed perk. The combination allows me to farm quickly and efficiently so I can level up as fast as possible in order to stop the hunters from completing their objectives. Effectively weighing the possibilities is the difference between winning and losing in Evolve, which makes almost every match feel rewarding. However, the fact that you need to play for a while and meet certain conditions in order to get access to all those possibilities means Evolve has an unnecessarily long warm-up period before it realizes them, which is a bit frustrating. Unlocking new characters requires that you reach certain performance quotas with the various abilities and weapons of your currently unlocked ones. The quotas are something reasonable, like successfully reviving seven players as the medic Lazarus, but even so, depending on how your matches go and what your playstyle is, it could easily take several matches or more to fulfill all the criteria to unlock the next character. Unlocking important perks like quick weapon switching or passive health regeneration is an even longer process, as thats dependent on your player level, which goes up as you earn XP by performing well in-game. For some people, it will take a few days, but for others it could be a lot longer. Until then, you arent seeing the complete picture  and thats too bad, because it really is a thing of beauty. Now, thats not to say that I wasnt having fun until everything was unlocked. Quite the contrary; the starting monster and hunters are all a blast to play, and certainly arent replaced by their unlockable counterparts. No two members of the same class play anything like each other, because while they have one ability in common, their other three weapons/abilities are entirely unique. For instance, the starting medic, Val, provides a level of utility that the other two medics just cant match. Her anti-material sniper rifle allows her to punch through a targets armour, providing bonus damage for any allies hitting the same spot; and her tranq gun slows the monsters movement and doubles as a tracking device to boot. Switching constantly between those two guns and her healing beam mid-battle makes Val challenging and dynamic to play. So its not like youre stuck with boring characters, but for the first few hours, youre going to see the same team composition/monster matchup an awful lot. Overall, Im very impressed with Evolve. Its a smart, unique multiplayer experience, and the asymmetrical design gets me thinking about new creative tactics that dont even apply to any other game. I crave that kind of incentive and opportunity for inspiration, and I can tell that Ill be playing Evolve, and watching streams of it for quite some time. -- Pros Unique conceptBrilliant designTactical depthTons of personality Cons Progression system Its rare for a big multiplayer game like Evolve to feel so considered and intelligent. Everything  skills, mechanics, and design choices  seem to interlock in a way thats both natural and purposeful. That its so mechanically rich and still conveys the raw energy and fun of duking it out with huge monsters and action-figure-esque hunters is a real design feat. Its progression system stifles it a bit early on, but regardless, Evolve is a deeply rewarding multiplayer experience that packs both brains and brawn.", "date": "Feb. 9, 2015,"}
