You wont find any flashy new graphics, skins, or arcane layers of unlockable hidden content - just a handful of remarkable platformers treated like the video-game royalty they are. The visual execution in Legacy Collection is stellar, producing a crisp, perfectly-proportioned image on HD displays. Both boxed and vertically fullscreen 4:3 ration options are clean and precise-looking. The two filtering options were also welcome, especially the monitor filter simulating the bright, crisp sharpness of a vintage arcade display. All six Mega Man games included in Legacy Collection are well worth your time, and the best are positively stupendous examples of responsive control, textbook level design, and of course, great weapons like Metal Mans blade and the groovy Gemini Laser. Every platforms position seems chosen with pixel-perfect care, making jumps difficult but almost never unfair. Carefully-placed enemies add tension to the leaping challenges, occasionally punctuated by huge, flavorful, beautifully-rendered robot foes. Almost every stage presents unique new motifs and mechanics, with conveyor belts, disappearing blocks, insidious traps, low gravity zones, and a welcome host of other modifiers. Each Mega Man game allows you to save a single restore point, a welcome addition as it eliminates the need to deal with Mega Man's anachronistic password system. I did, however, find myself missing the easy one-touch rewind function included in Rare Replay. Legacy Collections archival database includes an immense Mega Man bestiary, with official background information and art for every enemy you encounter, and its absolutely packed with obscure facts from the Capcom archives. Included in the encyclopedic content is the option to hop in and challenge any of the Robot Masters with a full arsenal of weapons, allowing you to learn their patterns, test, strategies, and hone tactics for the time-attack encounters included in challenge mode. Alongside the database is a voluminous image gallery which presents a generous sampling of high-quality concept art including incredible 3D concept sketches of the Mega Man stages, a bit of 8-Bit arcana I'd never dreamed existed. The Remix modes are excellent, sending Mega Man through a series of timed challenges stitched together from carefully-selected chunks of the Collection. By leaping between portals, I faced previously-impossible gauntlets of jumps, boss battles, and thematic tests. I particularly appreciated these wicked nods to Capcom's fiendish design-devilry. Times are shared on leaderboards with access to archived video of the most successful runs, allowing you to watch and refine successful strategies. Pros Superb emulationMarvelous gamesHistoric contextGreat remixes Cons No rewind Mega Man Legacy Collection is an object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the materials historic context, and exercising restraint. I recommend it both to Mega Man fans and to players who haven't had the privilege of experiencing these exemplary games.", "date": "Aug. 25, 2015,"}
