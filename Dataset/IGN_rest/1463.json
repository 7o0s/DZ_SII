This game wants you to be online, immediately. If youre not playing it online it wants you to be talkingabout it online. Lurking below the intro movie youll spot a gentle prod to leap on Twitter and tell the world about the game youre about to play. It wants your YouTube account settings too and, after activating your online pass, it wants you to register for Racenet, Codies new social stat tracking service that works a lot like EAs Autolog. If you dont want to do any of this its going to keep asking you anyway. If you really arent that interested in all this stuff, Dirt Showdown probably isnt for you. This game honestly doesnt want you to stay offline for long and will spam you with menu pop-ups until you yield. The games frustrating assertiveness aside, things do start well. Its certainly impossible to confuse Dirt Showdown as anything BUT a Codemasters racing game; the presentation itself retains that familiar Codemasters aesthetic, complete with crashing option overlays and smooth transitions between menu levels. Its slicker than a buttered mongoose. In-game the news remains positive. The cars are nicely detailed and accumulate muck and dust as the races progress. The environments are raging with spectacle and bursting with fireworks, and the tracks themselves are peppered with destructible objects. Its a good looking racing game, no doubt, with the kind of visuals for which Codemasters has earned itself a reputation. The audio presentation is decent too, with a suitable soundtrack and some meaty exhaust notes, although its bizarre Codemasters wont allow us to completely mute thegalactically awful commentary. You can hush the music entirely but you can only lower the commentary to 50% volume. Dirt regular Christian Stevenson has launched into a full-frontal assault on the English language here with a salvo of nonsense thatll have you quivering in a corner whispering to your dictionary that everythings going to be okay. Perpendicular awesomeness? Awesometacular? T-Bone-a-licious? This kind of babble may be quaint scribbled beside a picture of a dinosaur wearing sunglasses on a toddlers T-shirt but here its just dumber than two sacks of hair. Were aware this is not Dirt 4; this is something lighter. The problem is its too light. Were not talking about the shallow handling, either. The vehicle physics have been simplified significantly from Dirt 3 but they remain satisfying enough for a game of Showdowns arcade ilk. No, the problem is that in what feels like no time youll have seen all the tracks and event types this game has to offer. Worse still, with many of the games already few tracks sharing large sections with one another things get achingly repetitive within a matter of hours. On top of this, while the environments themselves are bristling with personality, many of the actual track layouts are quite dull -- and brief too. The short, flat and entirely unspectacular Miami street courses are notable offenders, as is the diminutive Michigan loop circuit. The Baja tracks are probably the games best, on account of at least a few camber and elevation changes, but there isnt much that's memorable about the rest. It just feels so scaled back, and yet whats left has already been done better elsewhere. The Hoonigan events arent exactly dissimilar to the gymkhana content available in the excellent Dirt 3, only easier thanks to the more superficial handling model. Doing a donut in Showdown requires just a dab of steering and a mashed throttle. Once youre circling an object you dont need to steer, at all. Its superficial stuff that doesn't really make you feel like you've accomplished anything. The gymkhana-based Joyride mode is a retread of near-identical content in Dirt 3. You begin by performing tricks and nabbing hidden packages around the same Battersea Compound from Dirt 3, before moving to a less interesting Yokohama Docks area. Smashhunters, which has you tracking down sequences of coloured foam bollards, is brief fun but even that doesnt last. On account of the limited course selection the race events in particular quickly become bland. Like we said, the handling is pretty shallow and theres very little here to distinguish it from similar arcade racers. Its really quite unremarkable. Youd be much better off sticking with the Rallycross and such in Dirt 3 to quench your multi-car circuit racing thirst. The best mode in Showdown's suite of race events is probably Domination, which divides the track into four sections and the best times for each are ranked. Dominate enough of the sectors and you win. The destruction derbies are really Showdowns last card to play and, while these modes are far and away the most fun youll have in Showdown, they really couldve been done so much better. For instance, seven opponents out on track with you? It just isnt enough. Eight cars on track doesnt cut it. Not in 2012. Not when FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage did 12, with longer and more interesting tracks, almost five years ago. Showdown doesnt really get things right with the arena events either; theyre based on a time limit rather than last man standing affairs. This means wrecked opponents dont stay wrecked and if your cars written-off you simply respawn. Showdowns turned the destruction derby into Call of Duty. Its a deathmatch with cars. The tension is lost when youre not fighting to keep your motor running until the last opponent is toast. Its a similar story with the Knock Out mode; what couldve been an epic battle to be the last car remaining atop a raised platform  like the skyscraper mode way back in Destruction Derby Raw  is nothing of the sort. Crossover races and a survival mode round out the destruction events but theres nowhere near enough variety. Its been a long time since a good destruction derby racer but Showdown pulls up short of the mark. Looking back at the exhaustive range of fun, demolition-themed race types in something like last generations Test Drive: Eve of Destruction (or Driven to Destruction outside of the U.S.) its genuinely surprising how anaemic Showdown really is. Its not unlikeable, and the beat up old bangers Codies has crafted certainly have charm (especially the one painted up like Mad Maxs MFP Interceptor), but its going to lack lifespan. Multiplayer, something Showdowns constant reminders illustrate its obviously geared toward, gives things a shot in the arm but it doesnt last. The normal online racing functions quite well but the destruction events seemed less polished online, with opponent cars flickering and darting around the screen strangely after big collisions. Its not a patient affair either; it wants you in and out of events within a few minutes and will keep choosing them and throwing them at you until you quit. There are a few extra event types in multiplayer that aren't available in single-player, and Racenet should get friends challenging one another for a brief spell, but ultimately it suffers from the same problem as single-player; it's fun at first but, once you spend a chunk of time in it, its reliance on a handful of race types and a small smattering of courses really starts to grate. Dirt 3 fans will probably find it pretty hard to be enthusiastic about Showdown, but Showdown never really feels like its for them anyhow. If you own Dirt 3 youll probably just feel short-changed here. If you dont, you should just buy a copy of Dirt 3 and a copy of FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage; because Showdown cribs from both but exceeds neither. CLOSING COMMENTS Showdown may look heavy on options from its bombastic menus but ultimately it just feels like a narrow slice of Dirt 3 with some destruction derbies tacked on. Theres a good game in here, but there just isnt enough of it. Its perhaps eerily fitting Codies shipped this Dirt 3 follow-up with the subtitle Showdown; it may have swagger but this town really aint big enough for the two of them. IGN RATINGS FOR DIRT SHOWDOWN (PS3) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.0 Presentation High-quality, stylish presentation; typical Codemasters racing fare. 8.5 Graphics The trackside detail is impressive and the cars are crisp and colourful, although they lack cabin views. 7.5 Sound Nice engine notes and crunching collision effects but the commentary is just seven sorts of terrible and cannot be completely muted. 6.5 Gameplay The simplified handling may irk purists but it's satisfying enough for an arcade racer. The experience suffers from only having eight cars out on track, however. 3.5 Lasting Appeal The game tries hard to disguise the fact there aren't many tracks with shared layouts and time-of-day effects, but Showdown gets old far too fast. 6.0 OVERALL Okay (out of 10) Showdown may look heavy on options from its bombastic menus but ultimately it just feels like a narrow slice of Dirt 3 with some destruction derbies tacked on. Theres a good game in here, but there just isnt enough of it. Its perhaps eerily fitting Codies shipped this Dirt 3 follow-up with the subtitle Showdown; it may have swagger but this town really aint big enough for the two of them.", "date": "May 25, 2012,"}
