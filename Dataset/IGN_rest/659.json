In just under two hours, it manages to cram in powerful moments that range from hilarious banter, wonderful throwbacks to the world of Borderlands, and devastatingly powerful goodbyes. Like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, this conclusion proves that Telltale knows how to close out a season in style. After the wheel-spinning disappointment of Episode 4, The Vault of the Traveler wastes no time in a runaway approach to the finish line. The stakes reach new heights as Fiona, Rhys, and company have to come to terms with the destruction they've caused and really ask themselves, ~Has this all been worth it?~ After a series filled with so many hilarious moments, I was honestly surprised at how impactful these emotional, contemplative moments truly were. I spent much of the episode looking back on the choices Id made throughout the season, and genuinely wondering if I'd made the right decisions. Telltale has always been at its best when its stories deal with shades of gray, and Tales From the Borderlands absolutely captures that. Truth and consequence Im really impressed at how Episode 5 takes the entire breadth of your choices into account in a more impactful way than any Telltale game in recent memory. Everything from how much mercy I showed in Episode 1, to how I treated an ally in Episode 3, to how much money I spent along the journey (which, up until now, seemed to be a frustratingly useless mechanic) funneled into the final act in meaningful way that gave me a really great sense of authorship over the finale. Knowing that how I chose to have Rhys and Fiona act toward those around them had actual ramifications retroactively made me like and appreciate previous episodes even more. I also really love how my expectations for the finale were completely subverted. Over the course of a single, incredibly written and acted scene, characters I had hated became powerfully sympathetic. Likewise, players who were relegated to comic relief throughout the series suddenly and effectively gain emotional, dramatic weight. I was really happy that every character Ive grown to love, from Handsome Jack to Loader Bot, all got a moment to shine. Even the action scenes -- generally a weak point in Telltale games -- pop with energy and excitement. The third act culminates in a massive battle ripped straight from an episode of Power Rangers, but infused with Telltales patented humor. Though they still basically amounted to quick time events, it felt like my choices actually mattered. It reminded me of the great scene between Bigby and The Woodsman in The Wolf Among Us Episode 1, which made me feel like I was choreographing a gigantic Hollywood action sequence. While the style and soundtrack have remained consistent throughout this season of Tales from the Borderlands, The Vault of the Traveler delivers by far my favorite opening credits musical montage. The sense of hopelessness in Rhys and Fiona, all set to the tune of James Blakes Retrograde sets an effective tone for the rest of the finale. Past, present, and future The Vault of the Traveler is also packed with effective nods to Borderlands past, present, and future. For example, depending on your decisions, you might have a run-in with some of the series most iconic characters. Also, this episode does a fantastic job of setting the pieces for what the world of Borderlands 3 might look like. Because of the events of Episode 5, I have theories on possible playable characters, settings, and enemies, which makes me very excited to see how Telltales series intersects with the Gearbox sequel. If there's one knock against Episode 5, it's that it tries to cram so much into its brief duration that I was oftentimes left hoping for a quiet moment to catch my breath and gather my thoughts. Storylines with Valerie, Handsome Jack, the Vault, and the mysterious stranger in the framing device are all wrapped up, which is great, but it certainly feels a bit exhausting at time. This bullet train rarely slows down, and it really demanded my full attention in order to piece together exactly what was happening and why. Pros Emotional momentsStill hilariousPowerful endingChoices matter Cons No room to breathe Tales from the Borderlands Episode 5: The Vault of the Traveler finishes off Rhys and Fionas journey in impeccable fashion. From heartbreak to hilarity, it runs the gamut of emotions in some really effective ways. All of the questions and mysteries from the previous four episodes pay off in wonderful fashion, while Episode 5 simultaneously introduces a slew of new, intriguing possibilities for the future of the world. Im bummed to say goodbye to Telltales adventure on Pandora, but I'll be damned if it wasnt one hell of a ride.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2015,"}
