Even as I absentmindedly removed all the protective films, and untwisted the tie on the bundled power cable, I was oblivious. You see, dear reader, the moment I powered on the Alienware m15 and took in the crystal clear 4K OLED display, I knew I would never look at LCD displays the same way again. But there's more to any gaming setup than just the display. I can't just stare at photos or watch movies all day long. There are games to be played and system performance to be monitored. And as I quickly learned, that beautiful display comes at a cost, both in terms of money, and performance. Alienware offers several different configurations of the m15, ranging from $1,300 all the way up to $4,300. On the high end, you'll get an Intel Core i9-8950HK CPU, two 1TB SSDs, an RTX 2080 (with Max-Q), and 32GB of memory. The low end of the m15 pricing scale gets you an Intel Core i5-8300H, a GTX 1060 Ti, 8GB of memory, and 1TB of hybrid storage. In fact, I previously reviewed a $2,260 m15 configuration with a GTX 1070 Max-Q. The model I've been testing is right in the middle of that spread, priced at $2,779. Here's how its specification sheet reads: Model: Alienware m15 (P79F001) Display: 15.6-inch OLED 60Hz UHD (3840x2160) Processor: Intel Core i7-8750H at 2.2GHz (9M Cache, up to 4.10 GHz) Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q (8GB GDDR6) Memory: 16GB DDR4 OS: Windows 10 Home Storage: 512GB PCIe M.2 SSD Webcam: 720p Ports: 3 x USB 3.1, 1 x HDMI 2.0, 1 x miniDisplayPort, 1 x Ethernet, 1 x Thunderbolt 3 port, 1 x Alienware Graphics Amplifier Port, 1 x audio port Connectivity: 802.11ac 2x2, Bluetooth 5.0 Dimensions: 14.3 x 10.8 x 0.83-inches (WxDxH) Weight: 4.76 pounds Price (as configured): $2,779 Alienware m15  Design and Features The m15 is available in two different colors, epic silver or nebula red. I was sent epic silver, and outside of the laptop's lid, the color you pick isn't found anywhere else. The rest of the housing is black, with a soft matte black finish found on the sides and below the keyboard, with a glossy black finish above the keyboard and around the display. I like the overall look; it's a welcome mixture of subdued and shiny. The trackpad is centered with the keyboard that boasts individually lit RGB keys. A number pad is also backlit, to the right of the standard keyboard. A backlit Alienware logo acts as the power button just below the display, as well as on the lid of the laptop. You can control the color of the logos in the Alienware Command Center, otherwise, it will match the color theme of the keyboard. The m15 has ports on three different sides. The right side sports two USB 3.1 ports. On the opposite side, there's an ethernet port, another USB 3.1 port with Powershare, and the headphone/mic jack. The rear of the m15 is home to an HDMI 2.0 port, a miniDisplayPort, a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port, and Alienware's proprietary Graphics Amplifier port (GAP). The GAP is used to connect external GPU's to the system, should you ever outgrow the build you purchase. It's a way of future-proofing the system, but as I've complained about before, taking up space with a proprietary port when another Thunderbolt 3 port would suffice just doesn't make sense. On the flip side of that, the Graphics Amplifier is only $229, making it one of the more affordable eGPUs on the market. The 60Hz OLED display has a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160, and measures 15.6-inches. The official listing claims the display is anti-glare, but I experienced more glare on this display than any other laptop I've tested. Maybe that's a side effect of the OLED display, but there was a lot of glare from overhead lights during my tests. OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode and these displays are commonly found on most flagship smartphones. The iPhone XS and Samsung's new Galaxy S10 both use OLED displays. The benefits of an OLED display include wider color range, improved contrast, deeper blacks, and lower power consumption. The m15 is the thinnest laptop Alienware has ever produced, measuring 14.3 x 10.8 x 0.83-inches overall and weighing 4.78 pounds. On paper, it's not the thinnest gaming laptop I've tested, nor the lightest, but it felt small and portable when toting it around my house and office. Carrying it around in a backpack shouldn't be an issue. Alienware m15  Software I spent a lot of time during my test period trying to get Alienware's Command Center program to actually run. Back in January, and again with this test unit, every time I open Command Center, I'm greeted with an alert that there's an update. Command Center begins downloading and installing the update on its own, and everything seems fine. Ultimately, the update either fails and I'm prompted to try again, or a message saying the installation was successful shows up, only for the entire process start over again the next time I launch Command Center. The last time around, I was able to fix the issue by uninstalling Command Center and performing a clean install. I figured it was a one-off, random issue. But with this m15 doing the same exact thing, several months and updates later, it's clear it's a more prominent issue. Command Center is what's used to control the keyboard lighting, enable or disable various performance modes, and create system profiles that are triggered when you launch a specific game or app. When it works, that is. The m15 is free of any anti-virus software, which is worthy of praise from me. Outside of a handful of Alienware apps, like Command Center, there's a tool to install system updates, another to connect your phone to the laptop, and the other standard system utilities. Alienware m15  Performance and Gaming It's best to view the m15 as a laptop with two different performance standards, based on the assigned screen resolution. As a gaming laptop with an FHD (1920x1080) resolution, this m15 and its 8th generation Intel Core i7 CPU, Nvidia Max-Q tuned RTX 2070, and 16GB of memory is very competitive. It's when you try to take full advantage of the 3,840 x 2,160 display while gaming that you realize the true performance hit you're going to take. All benchmarks were conducted at FHD resolution, as is always the case. This is the second RTX 2070 laptop I've tested, and it outperformed the similarly configured Lenovo Legion Y740 nearly across the board. When playing Apex Legends, I consistently experienced 120-130 frames per second with every graphics setting set to high. I think the reason for the difference in performance is due to how each company has tuned the RTX 2070 with Max-Q for their respective systems. Lenovo tuned the Y740 to 855MHz for its base clock and its boost speed to 1,185MHz. The Alienware m15 is tuned to 1,080MHz and 1305MHz, respectively. That's a boost of about 20%, which is right in line with some of the benchmark scores. For the first couple days of gaming, I left the m15's resolution set to 1080 and monitored frame rates. When playing Apex Legends, I consistently experienced 120-130 frames per second with every graphics setting set to high. With Epic settings in Fortnite, the FPS took a bit of a dip, averaging 110-120 FPS. With Battlefield V, the only game I own that supports real-time ray tracing  a key feature of the RTX-series' that gives graphics a lifelike upgrade  the m15 consistently stayed between 75 and 80 FPS with DXR set to ultra. Comparatively, that's right in line with what I experienced on the Lenovo Y740. As a follow-up test, I switched the resolution settings for the m15 to take advantage of everything the UHD display had to offer. I double checked each game honored the increased resolution in the settings when I launched each game. Apex Legends dropped to 65 FPS, exactly half of what it was at 1080p. Fortnite went all the way down to 40 FPS on Epic, nearly 33% of what it was at 1090p. I did switch from Epic to High graphics settings and the frame rate went up to 110 FPS. As for Battlefield V, with DXR set to ultra, the frame rate bottomed out at 34 frames per second  a 50% reduction. Adjusting graphics settings to medium got the frame rate up to 47 FPS. Moral of the story? If you want to take advantage of the 4K OLED display while gaming, be ready to deal with lower FPS, as in half the performance. I suggest adjusting the graphics settings for each game to a level where you feel comfortable with the quality and the frame rate. Or just be OK with gaming at 1080p. All of that said, gaming on this display was unreal. All of that said, gaming on this display was unreal. Apex Legends looked amazing, with the colors of Octane's vest and headwear looking bright and vivid. I wish OLED displays were more common on gaming laptops now that I've been spoiled. One thing I noticed in testing is how hot the housing of the m15 gets. The top-left corner and roughly one-third of the honeycombed vent above the keyboard got really hot. Hot enough I didn't feel comfortable leaving my finger on it for more than a second or two. That heat was there even with the fans maxed out, too. Speaking of the fans, they're some of the louder fans I've heard on a gaming laptop. The speakers can overpower the fans, but when you're having to turn up speakers to drown out the fans, you wind up in a noisy environment. Normally I'm a big fan of small, chiclet-style keyboards. However, I could never quite get the hang of the m15's keyboard this time around. I consistently found myself hunting for the right keys, and didn't feel like there was enough feedback with each key press. The 512GB SSD is more than enough space for the various benchmarking apps, games, and other miscellaneous programs I install on review devices. There's actually room left over for some personal files. No matter the CPU and GPU configuration you settle on if you decide to go with the m15, don't skimp on storage  get at least 512GB if you can afford it. If not, you can remove the bottom and upgrade the SSD and RAM on your own down the road if needed. Alienware m15  Battery Life The m15 powered through 221 minutes of a video on loop. That's three hours and 41 minutes worth of constant video playing at 50-percent brightness, with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and any backlighting turned off. That's more than double the battery performance of the Lenovo Y740, which came in at 87 minutes. It's impressive that Alienware is able to pack that much battery power into a chassis that's as thin as the m15. The OLED-equipped Alienware m15 looks amazing, both in terms of its design and its display. And as long as you're willing to make some concessions when it comes to performance, you can even game at its full resolution. The software is a bit buggy, but the hardware is top-notch.", "date": "July 16, 2019,"}
