Bliss rarely comes in so pure a dose as the video game shotgun. With its massive wallop, wide spread, and satisfying boom, the virtual shotgun will put a smile on the face of any gamer (provided he or she is on the right end of the shotgun when that trigger is pulled.) Enemies get knocked the #%$ back. Glorious holes get blown straight through whatever's in range. And oh, that sound... ~shuk-SHAK!~ The way of the gun is the only way to go. House of the Dead III is the ~shotgun game~ in this lightgun series, and thus, it's the game that racks my rounds. Sure, HotD 4 has an Uzi and it always seems cool to just paint the world with bullet holes, but full-auto weapons and better graphics do not equal a freaking shotgun. The most recent House of the Dead: Overkill had a wide variety of guns to pick up, but every moment spent away from my beloved shotgun was time spent feeling like there was a hole in my heart. House of the Dead is nothing more than a lightgun shooter, but if you're going to get a point-and-popper, get the one that screams, ~BOOM!~ You might think I'm making too much of this whole ~shotgun~ affair, but House of the Dead 3 proves just how well a job can be done when you come at it armed with the right weapon. Every aspect of this game is built around its gun. Blubber-assed blob enemies could suck up rounds from a Desert Eagle all day long, but if you punch a hole the size of a paintcan through their guts with a shotgun, they're suddenly much less imposing. A rifle could put a round through an axe-wielding walker's skull, but a spread of buckshot can take his head clean off, and might take a decent-sized chunk out of the lamebrain behind him for good measure. With a shotgun, you can even juggle poisonous slime dripping at you from a ceiling -- try pulling that off with your pew-pew-pew shooter. Yes, it's a much easier weapon to aim than say a handgun (and the reload here is crazy-fast, even for an arcade game), but the gameplay balance of HotD 3 is tuned precisely to make the most of this gun and to challenge gamers to make each shot count before they have to pump in more shells. In your first playthrough, you'll be spraying shots like crazy and just trying to survive, but as you learn the maps and go for greater scores, you start exercising control and counting your rounds before reloading. The PlayStation 3 version of House of the Dead III (available on PlayStation Network for about $7 USD, less than five quid in the UK) is about as good as we're ever going to get in a home version of this game. After a so-so showing on the Wii (the system just barely kept up with all this arcade carnage), the game comes to PS3 with a liquidy-smooth framerate even with two players blasting away. Adding a couple PlayStation Move controllers adds to the fun (especially if you have the Sharp Shooter, as the button configs puts the reload on the sliding action bar), but you can also shoot with standard DualShock controllers. Extras are sparse; you can unlock further difficulty levels and there is a short interview included in addition to the Time Attack mode not seen in arcades, but this PSN version at least packs in Trophy support and Ranked Leaderboards. Still, once you've played through this half-hour game, you've gotten almost everything there is to get out of it. Branching paths pop up to break up the monotony, but much of the game treads familiar ground as areas are recycled to stretch out the runtime and every path still dumps you out to the same boss fight -- killer boss fights though they might be. Everything but the final boss is relatively easy to kill with such a big gun (though by simple attrition, your lives will be worn down no matter what difficulty level), and two-player gaming makes for a one-sided bloodbath. I didn't get much enjoyment out of the Ranking feature since it wasn't really easy to read through and compare myself to. Also, navigating menus overall is strangely not optimized for gun control, so you may need both a DualShock and a Move to get started. There is no online multiplayer. Visually, I still find myself wowed by the SEGA craftsmanship as the framerate and enemy design is so strong (~arcade-quality~ still meant something in 2002), but of course, the game shows its age 10 years later. The audio fares much less spectacularly, with missing effects (accurate to the arcade, but still...) and a choppy gun sound. Some might also gripe that House of the Dead III is not in widescreen -- this game was made for and balanced to 4:3, so it would unsettle the game to extend out the view -- so take note of that if black bars bother you. CLOSING COMMENTS I've never been much of a SEGA follower, but this is a game I feel I have to fight myself really hard to keep from overrating. House of the Dead III is beautifully polished, lushly drawn, and energetically driven. A decade after its release, it's still fun to point and shoot at Curien's third horror show. And with the PlayStation Move (better two for a friend or just to dual-wield) letting you bullseye targets easily and shake to reload, it's a nice approximation of a great quarter-muncher. What you don't get here is that extra something that makes House of the Dead III one to come back to. That undead beastie that crawls up from the floor of the elevator -- he and his buddy will be in the exact same place every single time. There's no randomization. No remix mode. No option even to turn off those goofy cutscenes. For a horror game, it's not at all scary, and for an action game, it's only got one type of action. This is House of the Dead -- nothing more, but absolutely nothing less. It's not gotta-have gaming by any means, but if you're a fan of a good shotgun, it'd be incredibly easy to drop the few bucks this game costs on a PSN purchase.
