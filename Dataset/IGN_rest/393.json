Its not a low calorie, 25-minute experience, or a glorified tech demo; its a content-rich racer packed with plenty of courses and cars, and hours and hours of solo and multiplayer racing. Unfortunately the trip from standard screens to PSVR has stripped Driveclub of most of what it does best  notably its cutting-edge visuals and weather effects  and the vast bulk of its content already exists in the 2014 original. I firmly believe VR is an incredible way to play racing games, but its not really the best way to play Driveclub. Driveclub VRs first big sin is its surprising separation from the original Driveclub. While it recycles from the standard version of Driveclub heavily, even cribbing its intro vignette, everyone starts from scratch in Driveclub VR. Driveclub VR seems to dole out cars quicker as you level up but theyre still mostly locked from use from the outset, regardless of how far youve progressed in the original. This means plenty of unnecessary slogging for Driveclub veterans. My patience definitely grew thin treading over such similar ground, especially with the drift events which (despite how admirably and significantly Driveclub improved following its botched release) still favour speed over style, and still suffer for it. At its best, Driveclub VR looks far, far better than I'd ever anticipated. The biggest problem, however, is visual fidelity. At its best, Driveclub VR looks far, far better than Id ever anticipated. Theres an overall softness to the image, like youre wearing someone elses glasses and everythings a fraction out of focus, but the detail achieved in the cabins here is still immense. The way different surfaces absorb and reflect light, from matte-finished dashboards to the glint of polished carbon fibre. The way the beating sun even picks up the scuffs on the windscreen from the wipers is a particularly nice touch thats survived the transition. I do really feel seated in a virtual car (a slightly blurry but very authentic virtual car). At its worst, however, its an absolute eyesore. Anything beyond 40-or-so metres ahead of you begins to turn into a low-res globule, which makes it a massive strain to concentrate on upcoming corners, or even look through apexes. I can play sessions of Project CARS in VR on PC that last hours, but I cant tolerate Driveclub VR for anywhere near the same amount of time. This hardware disparity is completely expected, I know, but it remains exhausting squinting at coloured blobs. Its all well and good being able to turn and see the meticulously-modelled monster V12 mounted behind your seat, but 98% of the time in a racing game you need have your eyes set on the road in front, as far ahead as feasible, and that happens to be where Driveclub VR is at its ugliest. Don't be fooled by these screenshots; they're not representative of PSVR. I also found myself completely rejecting the artificial, forced perspective shifts  these keep your view tilted forwards for just a moment anytime the road begins to rise (or flatten after a descent) and the cars nose pitches up (the effect is reversed when you suddenly dip downhill). Its subtle, and I didnt exactly lose my lunch over it, but theres something definitely off about it. Its a mistake of Driveclub VR to simulate any head movement. The players head position and view should always remain relative to the car; if our actual heads arent moving, our heads in-game shouldnt be either. Once the novelty factor subsides there aren't many reasons to stick with it over the standard version. All this is a real shame because, as I said, VR is an absolutely terrific way to play racing games. Combined with a wheel its arguably the best way. Once youve experienced the ability to see out of the cabin in (almost) any direction, meaningfully use your mirrors at a glance, and look all the way through a corner to the exit it can actually be quite hard to go back to a flat screen. I love the sense of scale of VR; when not restricted to the dimensions of your TV screen cars have real presence and racing environments stretch out all around you. Driveclub VRs panoramic vistas are actually especially good as making me feel very, very small. There is definitely a certain grandeur to it when youre high up on a hillside, looking out and across at the ribbon of asphalt snaking over the countryside below that forms the rest of the course. The list of sacrifices, however, is just a bit too great. Once the novelty factor subsides there arent many reasons to stick with it over the standard version, with the latters drastically better graphics, class-leading weather effects, and increased amount of opponents on track. The only real content Driveclub VR adds is a few new courses, and theyre coming to the original game in a free update anyway. Driveclub VR is Sonys VR racing welcome wagon and, in small doses, I think it does its job of demonstrating the potential of VR racing. The racing genre is perfect for seated VR, and Driveclub VR delivers a functional example of that experience. Unfortunately, thats really about all it delivers. Beyond that its just a pre-existing game with fewer features and graphics that make me feel like I have the vision of a 95-year-old man.", "date": "Oct. 23, 2016,"}
