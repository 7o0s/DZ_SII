All thats missing is one final piece from the rollercoaster. Its currently zooming happily along its tracks, but the single gap in its carriages cries out to be filled. I cruise through the air, soaring and circling, looking for something, anything, Ive missed in this flat-shaded fever dream. Hitchhikers hop onto my back as I surf the skies. So far Ive dropped them all over this world  into Ferris wheel carousels, onto see-saws and atop plinths. Ive even scooped them back up as they drift slowly down, umbrella in hand, after being spat out of the curious vacuum-like machines hovering in mid-air. This is a world with its own often-opaque internal logic, and Im momentarily stuck as I try to decipher it. The electric fences! That has to be it. I glide up near the towers, back to an area Id been avoiding after accidentally frying my precious carnival-going cargo and watching blackened corpses fall from the sky. I realise that the electric shock from flying into one of the electric fences lasts just long enough to illuminate a nearby string of lanterns. I methodically move from lantern chain to lantern chain, and when theyre all lit, the final piece of the rollercoaster makes its appearance. I carry it back down to complete the carriage, and my reward is a creature much like myself  a space-worm-thing - who proceeds to shadow me around this strange, vibrant and colourful carnival. I want to go to there. Intrigued? You should be. Hohokum is one of the years most refreshing experiences. This cross-buy, cross-save PS3, PS4 and Vita title blurs the line between game and interactive art, and there is most assuredly nothing else like it. The area described above is just one of many, and they run the gamut from entirely abstract spaces through to very distinct places: windows into fascinating  and wonderfully creative  little worlds. Over the course of Hohokum youll carry a man and his lantern through a pitch-black cave complex, shattering jewel-encrusted treasures lurking in the darkness before depositing him into a snug-looking living room. Youll clear a path for a jellyfish-like mermaid between a series of pulsing watery globes and discover the joys of swimming with schools of hyperactive fish. Youll even attend a wedding, picking out the bride or groom, then scooping drinks out of an undulating scarlet sea to serve to all the guests. Lois in the sky with diamonds. And throughout it all, youll have only a tenuous idea of whats going on and what youre supposed to be doing. In a structural sense, there are literal eyes hidden throughout each level to be opened (you can see how many there are to find on the pause menu) and each main area has a creature like yourself  unlocked with discordant fanfare  to discover. Theyre linked to activities that sometimes feel like puzzles, but are better described as play  youre really just looking for things to interact with and seeing what will happen. And what generally happens is magical. One minute youre helping the inhabitants of wind-swept mountain tops fly their kites, the next youre harvesting colour swatches to feed into a hat-making machine. Even attempting to describe this game is madness. Hohokum is very much a game to play with an open mind and a relaxed attitude. This is not a title thats about deep mechanics or clever puzzles: its a playground to be explored and experienced... and even to get lost within, as navigating between its many interconnected spaces can be quite convoluted. You will have only a hazy sense of purpose; the real goal is to simply delight in interaction. Cause and unexpected effect. To that end, Hohokum is a huge success. Yes, its deliberately obtuse  you wont always know when there are puzzles and when things should be taken at face value, and yes, the loading times could be improved  as could the frame rate, which hitches occasionally - but its also overflowing with personality and a steady stream of delightful surprises. This sequence is particularly surreal. Two words: magic beans. Hohokum is one of those games that could only have been created by a small team, so distinct are the voices within the presentation and design. Artist Richard Hogg, in particular, deserves high praise. Every environment is striking yet distinct, and layered with expressive animations and flourishes. Hohokum is less playable while zoomed in, but youll want to do so anyway, just to catch the little touches  the hitchhikers raising their umbrellas when you pass through a waterfall, or the frenzied dancing at the conclusion of the wedding, as fireworks light the night sky. Pros Incredible art directionSurprising and delightfulUtterly uniqueSuperb score Cons Confusing navigation Hohokum is the latest title in a long lineage of artistically inclined, thoroughly unique PlayStation exclusives. From Vib Ribbon through to LocoRoco, Flower, Tokyo Jungle, Sound Shapes and more, its in good company, and deserves to be uttered in the same breath as those much-loved cult classics. <figure><img alt=~~ class=~image SCREENSHOT~ data-model=~image~ data-pk=~109201~ src=~http://im.ziffdavisinternational.com/ign_me/screenshot/default/hoo610_8pra.jpg~ /> <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption> </figure>", "date": "Aug. 13, 2014,"}
