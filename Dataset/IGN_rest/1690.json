Season 1, Episode 8 - ReviewAfter eight episodes of build-up, The Watcher finally breaks his oath this week... well, again, he already did that last week. But now, The Watcher is going on offense with a team of cosmic Avengers to stop the multiverses latest threat: Ultron. Its a set-up fraught with peril for a show that has, to this point, often let good storytelling take a backseat to the action. That dynamic recurs this week, with a climactic showdown that often miscalculates when to hold back and when to let loose. In that way, What Ifs first season manages to end with both a bang and a whimper.After Ultrons (Ross Marquand) victory last week, The Watcher (Jeffrey Wright) and Strange Supreme (Benedict Cumberbatch) agree that the only way to stop the robot is to, in grand Marvel fashion, assemble a team. The ensuing sequence of The Watcher gathering his chosen warriors gives What If the chance to put a button on some of the loose ends its created. Instead, scenes like a Dairy Queen-set attack on Ego and Shuri and Pepper storming Wakandas throne room to face Killmonger are just used as backdrop, which was a missed opportunity to bring those storylines to a more satisfying close. It does, however, culminate with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) hilariously shrieking as hes pulled into the sky in the middle of an excellent battle cry. Thor, but dumber and funnier has been one of What Ifs greatest successes to date. More of Gamora?If you were thrown by the sudden appearance of Gamora, and the situation she and Tony Stark found themselves in on Nidavellir, you werent alone. Originally, What If?s first season was going to run 10 episodes, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant cutting one from the production calendar to make the release date. And just like her purple papa, What Ifs producers decided Gamora was the necessary sacrifice. Where was Gamora? Did she find that Infinity Crusher in her episode? The finale moves too quickly to answer questions like this, so having missed the episode really wont have much of an effect on your viewing experience here. If youre dying to know more, youll have to wait until next season, when the producers have confirmed Gamoras lost episode will resurface.The bulk of the episode is dedicated to, you guessed it, a giant fight against Ultron! And after last weeks mind-bending, multiverse-shattering trip through the cosmos, the finales showdown was underwhelming. With Ultron nigh-invincible thanks to a full set of Infinity Stones, its a series of attempts to slow Ultron that are obviously destined to fail, and no amount of explosions or zombies pouring out of sky portals can add momentum to that effort. The fight is basically a rehash of Infinity Wars battle on Titan, with the Guardians of the Multiverse attempting to separate the Stones from Ultrons body. But with all these heroes strangers to each other and to their foe, its hard to get emotionally invested in the action, especially after how good a job last weeks episode did at handling Clints story. There are some effective moments through the clash, though. At one point, the heroes manage to separate the Soul Stone from Ultron, and the camera focuses on the stone on the ground, restricting perspective as the battle happens around it. A close up of a rock on the ground is the most cinematic moment of this cosmically scaled showdown, a great reminder that getting the storys foundation right is far more important than focusing too much on the chaotic action running through it. But the finale relies on shoddy plotting left and right to push itself forward. At one point, Black Widow (Lake Bell) is sent careening across the city into a random building the one in which her motorcycle and last remaining magic hacking arrow are waiting in a beam of light! When youve already had the hand of a demigod involved in getting your finale to where it needs to be, deus ex machina is overkill.Speaking of, sidelining the powerful Watcher while he waited to freeze Zola (Toby Jones) and the treacherous Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) in a pocket universe doesnt make sense. Hes already broken his oath by assembling his Guardians (the title of the episode is What If The Watcher Broke His Oath?), why stop there? Hes perfectly happy dropping Widow in a universe where her Variant died; that sure feels like interference to me. It took Ultron levelling countless universes for The Watcher to become an active participant and now all it takes is a stern look from Natasha Romanoff? While Jeffrey Wrights performance has been solid throughout the season, it wouldve been nice to see more thought given to establishing The Watcher as a character to make sense of these idiosyncrasies. What Ifs first season concludes with a multiversal last stand that, despite infinite possibilities, relies too heavily on flashy action to satisfyingly conclude the story. The Watchers solution to the Ultron problem is frustratingly inconsistent and his chosen Avengers are too hastily assembled to care about them as a unit. There are moments where the episode works, but both on its own merits and as a season-capper, What Ifs finale misses the mark.", "date": "Oct. 7, 2021,"}
