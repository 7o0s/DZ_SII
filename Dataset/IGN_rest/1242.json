After seeing it introduced at Gamescom in Germany in 2011 and being one of the very first people outside of Sony and developer Fun Bits Interactive to play it, I quickly realized the incredible potential of the game. Needless to say, it turned out well. As such, would-be PlayStation 4 owners and skeptical gamers alike may have heard about Escape Plan since it launched on Vita nearly two years ago. A puzzler oozing with quirkiness, charm and style, my time with the PS4 port likewise proved to be quite fun. But Escape Plan also finds itself saddled with a handful of problems that hold it back from what it could have been -- namely some finicky controls -- even if the transition from Vitas touch screen to PS4s DualShock 4 is surprisingly well-executed. What's most noticeable about Escape Plan is its beautiful black-and-white graphics. With the exception of some red in the logo, you'll see nothing but grayscale anywhere else in the entire game. Main characters Lil and Laarg are an adorable tandem that really pop and stick out. In fact, the entire game can easily be described as gorgeous, with a special attention paid to a unique aesthetic that contributes greatly to the overall feel. Complementing the art style is an almost ironic classical music score and other sonic accompaniment, including laugh, gasp and clap tracks pulled straight out of your favorite '80s sitcom. Escape Plan revolves around the aforementioned Lil and Laarg, two characters with different body builds who are attempting to flee from the evil clutches of the devious mastermind named Bakuki. Our two heroes hatch their escape plans over and over again throughout 78 rooms. Each room is its own puzzle, and the puzzles themselves are strewn across four different environments that all admittedly look the same as one another. Expect to die often in Escape Plan; death is actually considered instructive, though, because you'll know exactly what you did wrong so you don't do it again. Then again, the game does tease you by cleverly (and maniacally) putting the number of times each character dies directly on their chest. Y'know, just so you don't forget. Most of the puzzles have one single idea behind them, though various solutions can be found in certain situations. On Vita, Escape Plan is controlled largely by touch, but thats obviously not possible on PS4. Thankfully, DualShock 4 makes for an excellent replacement, with an all-new cursor controlled by analog stick, and various functions once relegated to Vitas front and back touch pads mapped to R2, X, and more. I was skeptical about how a game so obviously made for Vita would port to PS4, but its just as solid on console as it is on handheld. Still, it shares some of the same problems as the Vita version, mainly in the form of various controls that don't always work consistently. Each puzzle is solved when Lil and/or Laarg successfully leaves the room in question without perishing. But just how do the puzzles themselves play out? Well, one puzzle might have you tap a coffee machine to have Lil drink out of it, thus giving him super speed and the ability to dodge danger with his quickness. Another puzzle might have you insert Laarg into a bubble and then control him by swiping on the front touch pad while avoiding razor blades and spikes. Laarg is taking a ride. There's great variety in the puzzles -- from simple and clean to long and complicated -- though certain conventions are reused as the campaign goes on. Still, completing puzzles, progressing further into the quest, and earning the coveted perfect three-star rating is exceptionally rewarding, though how long it'll take to beat is wholly based on your skill level. Expect to spend at least three or four hours with Escape Plan at minimum. Pros Quirky main charactersUnique, beautiful aestheticHumorous storyFree if already owned on Vita Cons Occasionally finicky controls Escape Plan absolutely reeks of nonsense and humor, which is exactly what you'd expect from a team partially comprised of the squad that brought PlayStation Network gamers Fat Princess. Appropriately priced for PS4 (and completely free-of-charge if you already own it on Vita, with a separate Trophy list to boot), Escape Plan is a worthy purchase, especially if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play game that can be digested very slowly, one morsel at a time. I just hope Fun Bits Interactive gets a crack at a sequel one day, because Escape Plan could use a few control fixes, and can easily be better than just great.", "date": "Dec. 5, 2013,"}
