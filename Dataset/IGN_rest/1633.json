Run Roo Run is a classic example of an idea so obvious, it's incredible it hasn't already been done. Gamers play as Roo, a mother kangaroo out to rescue her poached joey. The adventure is spread across 420(!!) levels of 2D platforming action. The catch? Each stage takes place on a single screen, and takes just 2-3 seconds to complete. Roo runs automatically, and players simply tap the touch screen to make her jump. Twenty obstacles and gadgets are slowly introduced, including platforming standbys like dissolving platforms, oil slicks and spring boards. Did we like it? Run Roo Run is like platforming popcorn. The action is so light and fluffy that ~just one more level~ inevitably turns into clearing an entire world (or three). The bite-sized nature of each stage is genius. Complete one and you're propelled into the next, with the knowledge that you're just a few seconds away from checking that one off, too. Complete a set of 15, and you'll face a new obstacle to contend with. Developer 5th Cell's incredible music accompanying you on your journey helps make the game hard to put down as well  it's that good. The game is lacking the stylish and charming 2D art found in Scribblenauts, however. Should you buy it? Run Roo Run could have been better with a more steady difficulty curve. The game's 300 normal stages are nearly all disappointingly easy, while the final 120 Extreme stages are brutally difficult, often requiring pixel-perfect precision. Additionally, all of the gadgets introduced have been platforming mainstays for decades. Moving platforms and double-jumps are fun, but it would have been nice to see something fresh. Regardless, Run Roo Run is a ton of fun, from start to finish. The promise of free weekly level packs just sweetens the deal. For $0.99 the game is a no-brainer.
