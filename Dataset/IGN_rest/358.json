A huge diversity of rides and attractions team up with a nearly absurd level of terrain, structure, and coaster customization options so effectively as to beg the question: where did this type of game go for so many years? Its still far from an interesting economic simulator, and its definitely wanting for certain types of buildings, but many of these weaknesses are likely to fade over time thanks to the shrewd inclusion of full mod support. The basic routine of building and running a park manages to be more straightforward and intuitive than its extreme versatility would suggest. I used simple keyboard shortcuts to place, reposition, resize, recolor, and edit gift shops, ice cream stands, coasters, carousels, and walkways. Fine control, such as setting custom angle-snapping and widths for paths, can almost seem overwhelming at first, but ultimately allowed me to tweak every square foot of my park to look precisely how I wanted it, down to the smallest details. The array of possibilities available just from remixing the stock items is gargantuan, and the pool of bits and pieces is already expanding through Steam workshop, which is easily browseable by a well-organized, responsive interface from within the client. The coaster editor may be the best example of Planet Coasters spirit of freedom and experimentation. There are 28 distinct types of coaster to start with, from wooden to chain-lifted steel to hydraulically launched, each with different behaviors and track restrictions. I had full control over the slope, turn, and bank of the track, allowing me to create just about any shape I could think of. And every coaster also comes with some pre-made loops and turns I could mix in, resize, and reposition. There was just one problem: I could build the coasters of my dreams, but that didnt mean anyone would actually want to ride them. It gives you great tools for determining where ratings are coming from. To a degree, it makes sense. Each coaster, once tested, is given ratings for Excitement, Fear, and Nausea. High Excitement is always good. High Nausea is always bad. Fear is more of a balancing act where you want to have some, but not too much. And to Planet Coasters credit, it gives you great tools for determining where these ratings are coming from - at least in theory. For example, you can view a heat map that displays, track segment by track segment, which parts of your coaster are getting your guests pumped and which ones are making them spew a deluxe caramel sundae onto unfortunate passers-by down below. The problem I kept running into, however, was that building an ambitious supercoaster almost never resulted in anything anyone wanted to subject themselves to. While my first couple designs had some admitted flaws, like a maximum lateral force of 48 times Earths gravity, even my later, more refined designs ran into issues where I couldnt seem to make the Excitement level go up to save my life. Even if the Excitement heatmap said that more than half of my track had an Excitement rating above 10, even if I switched out the slow cable lift with a linear synchronous motor launch - at great cost - to minimize the time spent getting up the first hill, Id often end up with Excitement ratings below 1. Comparing my designs to the pre-made coasters that were getting riders, the only significant difference seemed to be size. And its kind of a bummer when a fantasy roller coaster games algorithm punishes you just for going big. Of the three modes, I mostly played in Challenge, which is the closest to classic tycoon games in that you start with nothing and build a park brick-by-brick, but are beholden to loans and a budget and must spend cash to research things like new stores and coaster designs. Career is a series of scenarios that I didnt find terribly interesting, in which you take a pre-built park and spruce it up to complete a set of objectives. The main value I found in them was seeing some detailed parks created by the developers, which opened my eyes to the kinds of crazy stuff I could make with the tools available to me. Sandbox is just Challenge mode with money turned off and everything unlocked, allowing you to build whatever you please however you please and pay all of your janitors $1,000,000 a year. The economic side of Career and Challenge has some depth, but isnt particularly difficult and eventually becomes irrelevant once you have a profitable park chugging along. My first blank piece of property required a lot of time and loans to get rolling, but I eventually hit a critical mass where my annual profits were nearly enough to tear everything down and build it all over again. There are prices to set for entry, specific rides, and different stalls - you can even charge for the bathroom and jack up ATM fees if youre feeling especially avaricious. There are staff wages to pay, and theyll expect more as they become more experienced. And each ride has a running cost, as well as a wear and tear rating that must be reset by paying for occasional refurbishments. This last bit interjects a bit of strategy in that some rides are more reliable than others, at the cost of being less exciting. But in a world where money eventually ceases to matter, such considerations are easily discarded. Speaking of staff, one of my biggest gripes is that the exact same character model is used for every staff member you hire of a specific type. Janitors all look like the same, Saturday morning cartoon caricature of a middle school custodian, and every mechanic is a cheerful Hispanic man with a pencil mustache - even if the roster says his/her name is Patricia Faust. Since guests at my park could appear in all manner of randomized appearances, it would have been nice from an immersive standpoint to see the same tech applied to employees. Managing these underlings is also more complicated than it needs to be. While salaries, training levels, and work groups are all listed on the ledger, they cant be directly edited from there. I had to click on each individual staffer on the list and bring up a separate menu specific to them every time I wanted to give them a raise or assign them to a different area of the park. On a similar note, the pre-made decorations available without modding are a bit restrictive. Unless you want to build Fairy Tale Land, Pirate Land, Robot Land, or Spooky Land, youre going to have to painstakingly hand-make all of your buildings and scenery - which is a task not everyone is going to be up to considering the time involved. That being said, the tools are flexible enough to allow the truly devoted to sculpt almost anything you could imagine. If you want a giant statue of the Enterprise D looming over your new inverted coaster, go for it. If you want a pizza parlour that looks like Trogdor the Burninator arm-wrestling Macho Man Randy Savage, time and effort are your only barriers. While it may not be an amazing capitalism simulator, Planet Coaster is a fantastic theme park-building sandbox that rarely ever took an idea I had and told me, No, you cant do that. Its knobs and levers are various and potent enough to allow creativity on par with a Minecraft or a Second Life, and a big part of my excitement is seeing what other people are going to do with it - especially when you factor in the seamless Steam Workshop integration. If I were another prominent theme park game coming out this year, suffice to say Id be pretty worried right now.", "date": "Nov. 24, 2016,"}
