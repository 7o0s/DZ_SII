I was enjoying the simplicity of attacking iconic characters from the Witcher world with flashy spells, and didnt notice that the clock had stopped ticking and the respawn count had locked in place. Battle Arena has broken, and the match will not count. I reboot the iPad app, load up another match, and run into new, equally irritating bugs and disruptive connectivity issues. This is common, unfortunately, and unacceptable for a free-to-play 3v3 MOBA that already has substantial problems. The rich world of The Witcher is primed and ready for competitive multiplayer game, and Battle Arena gives each of its nine launch characters a fun and distinct set of skills. Letho is a brutish tank who can deal and receive damage in bulk at the expense of mobility; Iorveths archery expertise leaves him vulnerable if anyone closes the gap, but utterly devastating from afar if you can land his skill-shots; and Geralt of Rivia himself modifies his stylish attacks with the Sign magic that makes him such a talented monster hunter in the mainline Witcher games. These characters and more rotate in and out of free-to-play accessibility, so if you play long enough you can enjoy everyone without spending a dime. Characters abilities feel appropriate, and their skills are satisfying to execute in sequence, but, unlike other attempts at adapting MOBA gameplay to mobile platforms, the lack of player-to-player communication completely neuters Battle Arena. It positions itself as an objective-based tactical game, but matches typically boil down to mundane deathmatches with minimal strategic options. Both arenas available at launch feature layouts too similar to one another to stand out as remarkable, and with no meaningful way to coordinate with your teammates, its tough to claim and defend their three objective points. Pressing the red exclamation-mark icon pings your teammates with unhelpful information, indicating allies with a green shield, enemies with red swords, and control points with blue flags. If you can see the label, you can see the objective; the ping contributes nothing, and theres no reason to ever use it. To make multiplayer matters worse, theres no way to play with friends -- no friends list, no useful Game Center connectivity, no way to invite specific players, and no local-play features at all. It also fails to punish players who quit mid-match, so theres little reason to stay in a game thats going poorly. In a multiplayer strategy game where its important to stun, slow, and deal damage in the right order, its embarrassing that The Witcher Battle Arena does nothing to facilitate team-based multiplayer or discourage quitting. And if youre not queuing into a 3v3 game with randoms, youre stuck practicing against bots alone or with an unknown couple of online allies. Battle Arenas disappointing technical issues exacerbate this. I had three bugged matches that wouldnt end, meaning I wouldnt earn currency to purchase new characters or skins, and I wouldnt unlock stat-boosting items for my heroes. I disconnected from matches at least once every time I loaded it up, too. In a game where the economy relies entirely on plentiful play time to improve your hero with RPG upgrades, this is unforgivable. Worse, The Witcher Battle Arena erased my progress entirely after six hours of play  my leveled-up characters lost their loot, and any character or skin I unlocked vanished. It hurt to lose this because the unlock system is rewarding like a great RPG  items feel valuable, particularly when receiving rarer loot drops for boots, belts, and other improvements. If something isnt useful to you, you can sell it for Crowns, the in-game currency used to purchase cosmetics. Pros Cool abilitiesRewarding unlocks Cons Unacceptable bugsNo friends featuresShallow strategy The Witcher Battle Arenas numerous technical issues contribute to a large list of in-game problems. Its combat is simple but satisfying, and the rewarding unlock system hooked me instantly, but theyre outweighed and overshadowed by a game that is broken at worst and shallow at best. The Witcher Battle Arena succeeds at a base level, but at its absolute height, it just barely becomes competent.", "date": "Jan. 29, 2015,"}
