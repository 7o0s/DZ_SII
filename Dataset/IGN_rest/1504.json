Your dreams of wielding a lightsaber and the all-powerful living Force have to be put on hold, because control issues and want for polish make the core game a chore to play. The additional modes don't help much, either. With the exception of podracing, these forgettable modes makeinteresting use of the license, but feel largely targeted at a younger audience. The rich Star Wars universe has expanded far beyond the films, and Kinect: Star Wars makes good use of the galaxy's vastness. Your character is tasked with assisting fan-favorites C-3PO and R2-D2 as they comb through the recently recovered Jedi Archives. The moment you hop into the game you're immersed in the world, with scenery changes regularly accompanying menu selections. Having your droid companions also helps set the tone for Kinect Star Wars, as their lighthearted quips and arguments with one another feel true to the setting. From the start you can jump into a number of modes, but the campaign story makes up the core of the experience. Here you relive the lives of a Jedi Master and her padawans during the Clone Wars. You and a friend start out with basic jedi training, learning the ways of the Force from a terribly voiced Yoda. From then on the campaign plays out like a Star Wars ~Greatest Hits,~ tossing in approximations of notable movie scenes such as the speeder bike chase, the second Death Star attack, as well as a number of lightsaber duels. It strings them together in a decent enough Star Wars yarn (something that feels like it could be out of the Clone Wars cartoon, in fact), but it can be hard to get all that immersed when it has uneven visuals, occasionally broken animations and random polish issues like syncing issues where sound clips and voices don't match up Even more troublesome than graphical issues, though, are Kinect Star Wars' campaign control woes. Lightsabers are swung by moving your right hand, while Force controls are mapped to your left hand. A number of other moves combining these powers or allowing you to jump round out your Padawan's arsenal. The problem is that in the throes of battle, Kinect: Star Wars regularly screws up inputs. Failing due to a lack of skill is one thing, but dying repeatedly because a critical jump, block or saber swing isn't recognized is incredibly aggravating. When your jedi bumbles in the battlefield due to a failure of the game, it's hard to feel very special. In fact, it's hard to feel anything other than a very un-jedi like sense of anger. Kinect: Star Wars doesn't aid player immersion with constant gameplay interruptions, either. In the campaign you are largely on rails, either moving from arena to arena as a jedi, or just aiming guns or doing minor course adjustments when controlling vehicles. The vehicle parts work well enough, and let you play at length, but the jedi segments constantly remove player control. The resulting gameplay feels awkward, with regular moments where you play for only a few seconds before it wrestles control away from you. Even when it does hand control over to you it's to do the same thing over and over; fighting enemies (and often the controls) in an arena before it marches you to the next. Every game is repetitious in its design, but Kinect Star Wars' stifling pacing doesn't do anything to mask it. Even when it recognizes inputs perfectly, any part with a jedi in Kinect: Star Wars is frustrating because of its neutered version of the Force. While basic enemies can be grabbed and tossed about (assuming you can actually target a specific foe with the finicky controls), most enemies simply stumble or shake off even the hardest Force push. Canned spots in the campaign provide a moment where you feel like a super-powerful jedi, but most of the time the Force feels all but useless. Even if the campaign is a bit of a bust, Podracing is great. Here you can play single races or jump into a story-based mode called Destiny. The story itself is a bit silly and obviously targeted at a younger audience, but it does provide a bit of context for all the races, as well as give you a sense of progression. The controls work well in this mode, and it does a good job at encapsulating the thrilling sense of speed from the Episode I podracing scene. While it's hard to play for long because you have to hold out your arms the whole time, it's easily the best gameplay in all of Kinect: Star Wars. Podracing is easily the best mode. The other modes, outside of Podracing are largely forgettable for adult fans. The Duels of Fate mode allows you to go through a series of one-on-one fights. However, instead of the exciting lightsaber duels we all remember from the films, you have to slog through painfully slow, dragged out fights that suffer from input problems. Then there's Rancor Rampage, which allows you to take direct control of a rancor and smash through recognizable settings. The rancor's controls are a bit much for even skilled players, and make moving the monster a laborious affair. Still, it isn't hard to see younger kids playing this for hours on end, smashing through the world and terrorizing the populace. If nothing else, it's a lot of fun to watch someone else play -- whether or not they've having a good time themselves. Also important to note is that all modes outside of podracing can be played with a second player  a nice inclusion since the game is targeted to families and kids. While the other modes are worked into Kinect: Star Wars under the context that they're files in the jedi archives, Galactic Dance Off is just shoe-horned in. In what could be the most blatant abuse of the license since the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special, this mode tasks you with dancing for points and stars. Earning stars allows you to unlock additional songs, most of which are pop hits that have been reworded into ridiculous Star Wars-ified versions. It's disappointing and alienating as a fan to see the likes of Han Solo breaking it down in the very carbonite chamber he was hurt in, or to watch as Leia happily dances before the sadistic Jabba the Hutt (not to mention should children be dancing with a bikini-clad woman who fears for her life?). The mode works fine, and is an okay dance game, but just seems like an egregious use of the license with limited fan appeal. CLOSING COMMENTS If youre a longtime fan whos been waiting for a game thatll let you live out your Star Wars fantasies then the wait is far from over. Kinect Star Wars, with all its control and polish issues, has very limited appeal for an adult audience. Kids will likely find more enjoyment out of it, even the absurd dancing mode, but ultimately its more of a Star Wars-themed set of mediocre mini-games than the jedi epic fans are dying for. IGN RATINGS FOR KINECT: STAR WARS (X360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 7.5 Presentation The way the menus are given context is great. The story is also decent in the campaign and podracing modes. With the exception of dancing, a lot of disjointed modes have been brought together well. 6.0 Graphics Sometimes it looks beautiful, but often characters have broken animation, the framerate drops and textures pop in. It definitely could have used more polish. 7.0 Sound As a fan its hard not to notice the bad Yoda or C-3PO voice actor. Sound also clips out at seemingly random times. The music is the same great stuff the franchise always delivers, though. 5.0 Gameplay Aside from podracing, the modes are either forgettable, ridden with control issues or both. Occasional moments of fun can be had, but its largely a disappointment. 5.5 Lasting Appeal If you love the modes there are plenty of unlockables. As an adult fan, though, I cant picture myself picking up again. 5.5 OVERALL Mediocre (out of 10)", "date": "April 3, 2012,"}
