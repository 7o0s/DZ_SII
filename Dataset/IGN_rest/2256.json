At first glance, the two mice appear nearly indistinguishable, but the Glaive RGB Pro has a slight change in design, with added rubber on one of the interchangeable side grips, and a second DPI switch. Inside, it also has an upgraded optical sensor, switching from a Pixart PWM3367 to a Pixart PMW3391. The new Corsair Glaive RGB Pro starts at $69, while the standard Glaive RGB has had its price lowered to make room for the new model. The Glaive RGB Pro price puts it in close competition with some of the best gaming mice on the market. Corsair Glaive RGB Pro  Design and Features The Corsair Glaive RGB Pro is a right-handed gaming mouse with a premium design. Though it has a very curious blend of matte black plastic, glossy plastic, rubber, soft-touch-coated plastic, and a slick-looking aluminum front bracket, it manages to avoid looking like a jumble of materials. The palm of the mouse transitions directly into the two primary mouse buttons, with soft touch coating on that whole section. The sides of the mouse use a matte black plastic with diamond-shaped rubber grips that work for palm and claw grips alike. The left-side thumb grip is actually interchangeable with three different grips included with the mouse. While all three side grips included rubberized portions this time around, only one felt like it offered enough overhang for my thumb to get under and confidently pick up the mouse. The swappable sides are also tamer than the Razer Naga Trinitys. They only change the contours of the mouse, as the two thumb buttons are built in above the side plate. In addition to the two thumb buttons and primary mouse buttons, the Corsair Glaive RGB Pro includes two DPI switches and a rubberized, notched, clickable scroll wheel. It also uses Omron switches rated for 50 million clicks. It generally feels sturdy, with a tight squeeze on the sides not giving much flex. The mouse has modest heft at 115g, which is slightly lighter than the 122g Glaive RGB and 121g SteelSeries Rival 650 (without its additional weights). It generally feels sturdy, with a tight squeeze on the sides not giving much flex, but pulling up on the mouse buttons feels a little too easy. They bend up, and dont feel like the type Id want on a mouse if I was going to leave it loose in a cluttered backpack. That said, this is often the case on mice that have a gap underneath the mouse buttons, which is a lot of mice, so its not a serious detractor. Plus, the 6-foot braided USB cable has an attached velcro tie, so tidy portability is an option. With RGB in the name, theres naturally some fancy lighting going on as well. The Glaive RGB Pro features three lighting zones: one shining out of the scroll wheel and front grille, one shining through stripes on either side of the palm rest, and an illuminated Corsair logo. While these are the main lighting zones, the mouse also features 5 DPI setting lights, which have basic RGB customization as well. The color purity is a bit questionable, though, as I set the front zone to static white and it had a strong blue tint to it. The scroll wheel is included in the front zone, but doesnt get much light coming through. With the side zones turned off, I could also see light from the DPI indicators bleeding through the left-side light strip. Corsair Glaive RGB Pro  Software Corsairs iCUE utility is a tad difficult to use, but getting past the confusion, it offers considerable customization of the Glaive RGB Pro. The software allows angle snapping and enhanced pointer precision (both best left deactivated for gaming), and it has a surface calibration tool to ensure proper tracking on different mouse pads. It also allows remapping mouse buttons and setting up macros. In iCUE, you can choose 5 DPI settings plus a Sniper Mode setting, and select light colors for the DPI settings with an optional extra color to indicate Sniper Mode. Setting up the different lighting zones is a little tricky, as each zone needs its own filter to be controlled separately from the other zones. But, once established, the effects are simple enough to implement. There are options for a rainbow, color pulse, gradient, static colors, and some neat Lighting Link effects  I opted to have the LEDs correspond with temperatures of my CPU on the Corsair logo and GPU on the side strips. Corsair Glaive RGB Pro  Gaming A gaming mouse should shine where gaming is concerned, and the Corsair Glaive RGB Pro definitely does. Given its specs, this isn't much of a surprise. The Pixart PWM3391 optical sensor can handle acceleration up to 50G and speeds up to 400IPS, putting it in league with other top-notch mice, like the SteelSeries Rival 600 or Logitech G903. Naturally, the mouse also supports a 1000Hz polling rate. The DPI settings stretch from 100DPI to 18000DPI and fine tuning in 1DPI increments is possible. While I dont see the need to go as high as 18000DPI, the option to select an exact DPI setting is appreciated. I've tested the Cooler Master MM830, and it curiously only allows 200DPI increments, which kept me from being able to use my preferred 2500DPI setting for gaming. All that is to say the sensor holds up. I put in a dozen hours of Apex Legends using the Glaive RGB Pro, and I felt as accurate as Ive ever been. Up close and at medium range, I could comfortably keep my crosshairs on targets to sink a Spitfire mag into them. At long ranges, the tracking was smooth and precise enough to make minor adjustment and get enemies in my sights. At long ranges, the tracking was smooth and precise enough to make minor adjustment and get enemies in my sights even if they were only a few pixels on my screen and too far for me to actually try shooting. In a match of Battlefield Vs Firestorm mode I did manage to track a player on an island about 250 meters away and land a potshot with a StG 44 assault rifle and holo sight. I have no reservations about the tracking of the sensor. Even in my first hours using the Glaive RGB Pro (switching over from a Rival 650), I snagged three wins in a row in Apex Legends. The button experience is similarly excellent. The primary mouse buttons have a consistent actuation across all the areas fingers are likely to rest. The thumb buttons are well placed, easy to reach, and just as easy to press, making them reliable in the heat of battle. Compared to the smaller thumb buttons on the SteelSeries Rival 600 or 650, these are much easier to use. The two buttons for adjusting DPI settings combined with the always-on DPI indicator lights are a great touch. If something ever feels off, its easy to check and see that Im on the right DPI setting, and if Im not, I can switch directly to it without having to cycle all the way through all the other settings. The only real shortcoming in gaming performance is the scroll wheel, and it's just a minor thing. The scroll wheel click is a lot heavier than the other mouse buttons, which can make it hard to rely on for melee attacks or other abilities that youre likely to want to use urgently. The notches arent incredibly pronounced either, and are slightly inconsistent, so using the scroll wheel for accurate item switching in a game like Fortnite doesn't work very well. The Corsair Glaive RGB Pros shortcoming are few, far between, and minor at worst. Though it comes at a slight premium, its still cheaper than some of its competition while offering performance thats every bit as good as its peers, and a few quality-of-life features that round out an excellent package.", "date": "June 25, 2019,"}
