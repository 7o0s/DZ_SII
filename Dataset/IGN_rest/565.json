It endeavors to please fans of its namesakes - Pokmon and Tekken - while also appealing to fighting genre enthusiasts by incorporating bits of Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, and even Bandai Namcos Naruto and Dragonball games. Its broad range of influences creates a wholly unique experience. The most notable innovation in this genre hybrid is the shifting field of battle. Pokmon battles transition back and forth between Field Phase - a three-dimensional scramble heavy on projectiles and positioning - and the more traditional fighting game-style Duel Phase, depending on your actions. A stiff blow in Field Phase activates Duel Phase, allowing access to bursts of damage. Completing a lethal combo in Duel Phase might shift the action back to Field Phase, where Pokmon can side-step and dodge arrays of laser beams and torrents of fire. This shifting helps layer strategy onto the frantic action, giving you pause to consider your next attacks and the way they will manipulate the flow of the battle. Iconic Pokmon from both early and current generations are present and available to be pitted against each other, and as a long-time fan, I felt immediately welcome. The roster contains a nice mixture of old mainstays and new faces, and while it would be impossible to include everyones favorites, the 16-character group is made up of characters spanning Pokmons 20 years of history. These are characters that have existed for decades, and Pokkn Tournament does not disappoint in portraying them faithfully. Each of these turn-based RPG fighters is translated into a real-time combatant with mechanics that feel appropriate for their well-known designs. Machamp, for instance, stomps towards his foes, seeking to get close and dole out staggering blows or grab defensive opponents for even more damage. Gengar manufactures mix-ups with use of misdirection, forcing opponents to guess whether he will attack from above, from behind, or from below. In Too Deep The art style feels right at home in the Pokmon universe, while also lending an edge to the visuals to make the action a good fit for a brawler. The sounds and music fit just as well as the graphics, with new takes on Pokmon soundtrack classics alongside original high-energy compositions. Pokmon games have always had quality music, and developer Bandai Namco has made sure that Pokkn Tournament does not tarnish that legacy. Having sung those praises, I have to pivot and argue that Pokkn Tournaments many strengths also serve as its biggest flaw. The sheer breadth of complexity in gameplay places heavy expectations on your shoulders: absorb a lot, and to do it quickly. Loading Pokkn Tournaments Tutorial modes immediately illustrates this tsunami of ideas, as several non-interactive demos instruct you on a multitude of topics ranging from actions specific to Pokkn Tournament to advanced fighting game concepts. A narrated guide instructs new arrivals on Phase Shifts, Synergy Gauge, Support Gauge, Wall Combos, Wall Burst, Cancels, and Guard Breaks  by the end of it I felt like I'd just sat through a school lecture. Even for those of us experienced with fighting games, it can take some time to get comfortable with Pokkn Tournaments plethora of mechanics. The Trainer Becomes The Trainee To its credit, Pokkn Tournaments single-player content seems to anticipate how overwhelming it might be fore new players and heads that off at the pass by featuring modes that help ease them into the action. Leagues of CPU-controlled Pokmon trainers can be challenged, feeding into promotion matches that grant access to leagues populated by more skilled trainers. This is a smart approach, as it gradually introduces Pokkn Tournaments slew of advanced techniques via a series of opponents who become progressively more adept as you do, featuring AI that starts out feeble but quickly becomes formidable. And the final boss, who shall remain anonymous, is a great new take on an old idea. It's successful: after spending a few hours playing single-player modes, I found myself becoming comfortable with its more advanced techniques. However, even for a fighting game, Pokkn Tournament can be surprisingly complicated. Even armed with knowledge and practice from hundreds of battles in single-player Leagues and training modes, I found myself sometimes overwhelmed managing the multitude of ways to optimize my Pokmon. Once youve mastered the basics and learned more of the unique traits of your character, you can quickly jump into netplay against other trainers. Pre-release online multiplayer had little in the way of latency, and even with a low population of players at the time of this review, matches were made quickly. Netplay features two modes, Friendly and Ranked Matches, and they are similar to the Casual and Ranked modes players have become familiar with in games like Street Fighter V. Being able to jump into my next battle with minimal waiting was a refreshing change of pace from recent fighting games. Pros Phase ShiftingFaithful character designsGraphics and animationsMultiplayer & matchmaking Cons Overwhelming mechanics Pokkn Tournament takes a lot of what we know from old fighting gaming favorites and sticks them into a blender, delivering a unique take on both Pokmon and on fighting games in general. Sometimes all those ingredients spill over a container thats a little too full - there is a surprising amount to learn beyond the beginners level, and that may alienate some Pokmon fans without fighting game experience. Pokkn Tournament does do a good job, though, at alleviating this bloat of mechanics with single-player modes to help ease into the action.", "date": "March 15, 2016"}
