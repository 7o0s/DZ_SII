This review was originally published when Season 2 premiered in April on Hulu. If you've already watched the subbed version of Season 2 in its entirety, you can check out our full One-Punch Man Season 2 review here. You can also stream OPM via Viz Media. One-Punch Man is finally back with an exciting new adventure set in a world filled with demonic robots, terrifying monsters, and some bad-ass action scenes to boot. The exhilarating Season 2 premiere - ~Return of the Hero~ - gives Saitama and Genos some time apart. And while it's sad to see the dynamic duo not sharing a lot of screen time, their individual quests are equally captivating. In terms of Saitama's narrative arc, he has the most to prove in Season 2. Sure, he may be the most powerful superhero ever, but unlike a Bruce Wayne or even Genos, Saitama doesn't have a compelling backstory yet (and that seems to be the point). And speaking of origin stories, ~Return of the Hero~ does a solid job of alluding to OPM's past with the help of flashbacks. That's not to say we don't appreciate Saitama's disinterested approach to being a superhero, but it would be nice to learn more about him in future episodes. Genos, on the other hand, is the most fleshed-out character in One-Punch Man, and his story gets more profound in Season 2. He's a complex guy who wants to prove himself to his sensei - Saitama - while also continuing his search for the one responsible for destroying his village and loved ones. It's exciting to watch the young cyborg go up against a demonic AI named G4 in the early moments of the episode. There are endearing subtleties to Saitama and Genos' relationship expressed before the fight even begins. The trust they share is apparent, as Saitama leaves Genos to deal with the scary robot on his own. Saitama may not be the most empathetic hero, but the respect he has for Genos is definitely there. One-Punch Man's supporting cast in its Season 2 premiere is also charming, especially a newly-introduced Class S, Rank 7 superhero named King. Like Saitama, King's past is shrouded in mystery and the two develop a thought-provoking relationship that we won't spoil here. Other notable returns include the villainous Speed-o'-Sound Sonic and the Minister Officer of Justice for the Hero Association, Sitch. The premiere gives little away in terms of everyone's motivations, but it's clear that Saitama is no longer the reclusive do-gooder he used to be. There's also talk of Madame Shibabawas prediction about the Earth being doomed, which is why there are so many new monsters for our heroes to fight. OPM's writers wisely tease out these enticing little bits of the story throughout the episode to whet your appetite before the main course. If only we could all of Season 2 right now... One-Punch Man is still equal parts funny and emotional in its long-awaited return, but let's talk about the controversial aspect of Season 2: the animation. OPM's shift to a prevalence of 3DCG in fight scenes is a bit jarring at first, but it's not a deal breaker - at least not in this reviewer's opinion. OPM remains one of the best anime around with its thrilling action, imaginative characters, and the engaging relationship between Saitama and Genos. If you can get past OPM's new look, the story is still worth sticking around for. One Punch Man's Season 2 premiere lays the groundwork for what should be another round of exciting fights, terrifying villains, and more Genos and Saitama adventures, which is always a good thing. While the hard shift in animation to 3DCG is difficult to ignore, OPM's story is still engaging, and worth sticking around for if you can look past its fresh coat of paint.", "date": "Oct. 15, 2019,"}
