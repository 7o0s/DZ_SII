It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop. Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing  move, shoot, collect  and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play. Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class. Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group. Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals  slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well. The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up. When so much of the MMO experience is pared down for ease of access and quick play, it's a shame that the controls aren't as tight as they should be for the arcade-style shooter gameplay. Movement with the WASD keys sometimes gets gummed up if you're clicking around to shoot a lot while changing direction. Holding the firing button down or toggling auto-fire smoothes this out a bit, but it's frustrating to die because you get stuck walking in the wrong direction for a few seconds longer than you meant to and wind up charging into the middle of a rampaging horde of angry elves. Fortunately, it's not a game-breaker. While the control wonkiness is a pain, the absorbing gameplay drowns out the irritation it causes.
