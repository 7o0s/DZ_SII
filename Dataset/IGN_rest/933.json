This story-light, puzzle-heavy, co-op adventure is almost as essential as Lara's third-person excursions. There's really only one thing missing from this version of Lara Croft: personality. The high-angle isometric perspective may work in terms of showing large sections of the visually distinct temples and properly framing the brain-bending puzzles, but even when engaging in rare banter with her team of co-op allies, this iconic adventurer heroine doesn't show anything resembling emotion or even vulnerability as we watch her explore the gorgeous yet dangerous environments from afar. Its the Temple of Osiris itself that fills that void with creative level designs: From the lavish golden flourishes of a mirror-based temple to creepy green eyes adorning the poison-tinged traps, the biggest carrot dangling in front of me wasn't the resolution of Lara's battle against the Egyptian god Set or more loot, it was seeing what new hazardous wonders awaited Lara Croft and company. Much like Lara Croft's original adventures, combat in Temple of Osiris largely exists to fill the gaps between puzzles. While there's a level of excitement that accompanies testing every new gun as you find them  machine-gun pistols, a magic staff, a rocket launcher, and a high-powered rifle  the resurrected rank and file populating Egypt never really poses much of a fight, save for a few boss fights and wave-based battle challenges available in the hub world. Fortunately, the obstacles put in Lara's path more than make up for the average gunplay. The pacing of the puzzles throughout this six-hour adventure is the key. As you start each of the nine tombs you're given an introduction to the core puzzle type, whether it be reflecting the orb-destroying beam from the staff of Osiris, lighting torches that power gates, or finding the correct path through spike-laden grounds that escalate quickly into some truly tricky trials at the end of an excavation.In addition to the stages througout the campaign, there are also five ~Challenge Tombs,~ each featuring a puzzle even tougher than the mandatory stuff. Whats really impressive is how the puzzles in Temple of Osiris scale in scope when youre playing them by yourself or with a party of up to four. Where a solo puzzle had me pushing combustible orbs to temporarily depress switches or using my momentum while rappelling down a wall, replaying it with partners added variables. Switches would be moved to different areas, orbs would removed entirely, and brick walls would be put where a clear path used to be in order to force teamwork and communication. It's a bit jarring to go from having a full suite of puzzle-solving tools on hand as a soloing Lara to depending on one of the two magician class characters to properly wield the essential Staff of Osiris.I found my couch co-op experience far more conducive to the adventure than playing online; I could easily point my partner to a specific spot where I wanted them to go, or even switch controllers if I felt their skills were better suited to use the archaeologist-exclusive grappling hook to solve a given puzzle. When playing online, those things become a bit tricker, but either way, working out a complex puzzle with a friend or team is even more fulfilling than solving a single-player stumper. Additionally, a strictly solo experience won't include cooler, action-packed co-op activities like flanking enemies, rappelling off a partner, or doing a tightrope walk between two tethered friends. Playing solo, the first run-through for each of the nine temples took 15 to 20 minutes, though there's are plenty of reason for return visits. Beyond gathering the new weapons, you can collect gems to spend on treasure chests that contain one of two accessories. More common are rings that can increase attributes like bomb radius or rate of fire, but often detract from another, such as defense level. Even rarer are items that change your projectile weaponry to add fire damage or transfer enemy damage into your health. However, since rings only affect combat, which isnt anything special, their usefulness is limited. I wish the amulets could have come into play a bit more, but they're only activated after amassing multiple kills or collecting a lot of gems, and the effects run out pretty fast. Additionally, the amount of single-hit kill obstacles like spikes or pits that drain your entire combo meter in death often render amulets useless. That led to a trickle-down effect where jostling co-op partners for our own gem collections wasn't as competitive as it could be, since the bigger-ticket collectibles like permanent stat boosts and new weapons are shared amongst the group. Pros Enoyable soloBetter co-opExcellent puzzles Cons Disappointing lootLightweight story The real treasure in Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris wasn't Laras story, bipedal alligator warriors, or a bounty of gems, but solving complex and varied environmental puzzles with friends. Playing alone, discovering the different flavors of each new temple and figuring out the solution to a brain-busting puzzle all by myself is satisfying; replaying with others doubled that satisfaction because developer Crystal Dynamics renews the challenge with creative new twists on previously conquered obstacles that require teamwork to overcome.", "date": "Dec. 9, 2014,"}
