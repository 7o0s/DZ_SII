No! They had to put pretty much everything they encountered into their mouths, one at a time, to figure out which was tasty and which was deadly poison. There was a lot of hard work, repetition, and death that turned out to be completely unnecessary in hindsight. Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey does its very best to recreate much of that maddening blindness and futility and some of the associated sense of discovery in a beautiful prehistoric world, becoming an apt metaphor in the process. Ancestors prides itself in withholding information on how its most important systems work or what youre supposed to be doing, beyond the broad goal of evolving a group of chimpanzee-like common ancestors toward modern humans faster than they actually did. We wont help you much, the introductory text declares. As a result theres some mysticism to it in the opening hours as both you and your tribe of primates attempts to figure out the world around you at the same time. But once youve demystified the basics of how systems like skill progression and combat work, you begin a long, drawn-out, and repetitious slog toward sentience. If someone had just told me the basics, I mightve had a better time appreciating the majesty of nature around me. To be up front, I havent yet reached the end of Ancestors  which, I assume, means becoming human. I have, however, spent roughly 40 hours starting and restarting the journey, each time learning at least one crucial Well why didnt you just tell me that? piece of information that allowed me to get much further the next time around. Somehow, the many tips on the pause screen and help section of the menu avoid getting specific enough to be useful. For example, I still dont fully understand how the indicator in the lower right corner of the screen works, though I have some theories. Knowing what I know now, I could get back to where I am in a fraction of the time. Im sure that, knowing what I know now, I could get back to where I am in a fraction of the time, and I could explain a lot of that crucial information here in a few sentences  but that would ruin the fun of anyone setting out to explore it. Instead, Ill just point out one of my biggest annoyances: its absurd when an ape who I was controlling when I evolved a tolerance to eating eggs somehow forgets that when he gets old and has to relearn it. Thats weird. In my most successful run Ive progressed roughly half of the 10 million years between the starting and ending points (which does not appear to have a 1:1 relationship with time played), and Ive seen some stuff. My main complaint is that much of that stuff has looked new but been otherwise exactly the same as the stuff I saw before, and does not give me a lot of confidence that what comes next will be significantly different. At first, controlling a small group of common-ancestor apes in a prehistoric African jungle is intriguing. Animations are a highlight, and the way they move and interact feels lifelike and authentic. Ive found it to be more of a gut-punch when one of these animals is in distress or dying than with a typical human character. They each have their own monosyllabic names like Kwu and Na and Mo, too but theyre otherwise disappointingly interchangeable and almost entirely disposable. Thats probably for the best because the AI of those you arent controlling is pretty bad at keeping them alive. Besides which, these are effectively your lab rats and you definitely should not get attached. I ended a few early lineages by failing to prioritize the next generation over the current one. And, because you cant revert to an earlier save state, losing your last ape is really the end of the line. The way apes move and interact seems lifelike and authentic. Its during this early exploration and experimentation that Ancestors taunting figure it out yourself vibe seems a little out of touch. You have to consider that having access to the internet is an actual prerequisite for playing in the first place, since theres no option for a physical copy at the moment (it wont even be out on consoles until December). Because Minecraft has trained an entire generation to do so, I have no doubt that when the vast, vast majority comes into contact with, say, a basalt stone, the first thing theyre going to do is Google it and find out everything it can possibly be used for. If you want to surprise people these days you have to do procedural generation, which (as far as I can tell) Ancestors does virtually none of. But, since Im playing before launch, I got the experience that developer Panache seems to hope everyone will: exploration and pure trial and error, literally banging rocks together to see what happens. It comes with its fair share of frustrations. Some things turn out to be much simpler than youd assume. Hereditary, for example, tracks only a given apes parents and their children, and nothing beyond that - so history is completely lost over just a few generations. And theres no real individuality or complexity to breeding because every evolutionary advancement you make is collective. The only bit of individuality is that babies are born with spontaneous mutations that give them special abilities, but they only become available after you trigger a generational advance and they become adults  and then everybody gets them (even though the mutant ape hasnt even had children yet). The way you progress your lineage is a pretty standard skill tree dressed up as connecting neurons in a brain using neural energy (aka XP), which is a cool way of representing it. But theres a catch: every time you decide to advance a generation or make a much larger evolutionary leap that effectively resets your game but preserves your evolution, youre given a set number of lock-ins to use (determined by factors that arent revealed to you) and everything that isnt locked in is lost and must be unlocked again, with newly earned experience. Thats a hassle that feels designed to slow down progress, especially when you waste a bunch of time figuring out how it works and how to optimize it. Getting across a rushing river or a steep cliff takes some effort, and it all feels well thought out. So its not an attachment to any particular ape or lineage, but the surprisingly large world (for which there is no actual in-game map, just landmarks to navigate off of) thats kept exploration interesting for me. The lush jungle you start out in is fairly pretty, thanks to a diverse range of plant and animal life to discover and lots of rivers and waterfalls and caves to stumble across. Its more that its clearly hand-built to make getting from point A to point B a puzzle, and the routes between the discoverable landmark areas are rarely a straight line. Getting across a rushing river or a steep cliff takes some effort, and it all feels well thought out. Discovering points of interest is one of the best ways to gain experience, and in order to do that you have to get your apes to move outside their comfort zones and face the fear of the unknown (another weird process that could use more explanation early on), so theres a lot of incentive to stay on the move. All of that African habitat is heavily populated with predators, but once you understand how evading and fighting back works it quickly becomes apparent that the many jungle cats, snakes, crocodiles, enormous birds, and more who try to eat you are effectively all the same, and none poses a threat. Dont get me wrong  there were still moments when I was taken by surprise and they scared the bajeesus out of me, but its almost entirely shock value. I wont tell you how combat works because you might want to figure it out yourself, but I will tell you youll probably be disappointed to learn that fighting a hippopotamus or buffalo is mechanically identical to killing a wild boar. Before you figure out how simple it is to craft a stick to defend yourself it often makes a lot of sense to stay off the ground as possible, since predators are almost exclusively on the forest floor (even snakes, which youd think would be decent climbers). Swinging from tree to tree is a thrill, except the fact that were doing this from a third-person perspective and flying through leaves means that you cant really see whats coming. When the branches run out unexpectedly you get to go down in history as the one who invents the concept of the face plant. Part of that is never really knowing how far you can fall without injuring or killing your ape (its pretty far) but once you figure out the confusing three-layered stamina system you can do a lot of climbing and swimming to get over pretty much any obstacle. Importantly, it's not a game about amassing large piles of resources to manufacture into walls, tables, and chairs. Ancestors is a survival game in the sense that you have to periodically eat, drink, and sleep to keep your stamina up and not die, but theres rarely a scarcity of food or water or places to take a nap so thats not much of a nag. Importantly, its not a game about amassing large piles of resources to manufacture into walls, tables, and chairs  you have no real inventory outside of your own two hands (which are managed independently and somewhat clumsily) so thats not really an option. Instead, I was usually carrying a fashioned tool that could be used to quickly sharpen sticks into pointier sticks that could be graphically shoved into the eye socket of whatever jungle cat or boar or alarmingly large python decided to take a shot at me as I was minding my own business and inventing escargot. It gets a little more advanced than that, but not much. The goal of all of this is evolution, which (contrary to what Pokemon may have taught you) requires many generations of gradual change. That means making lots of babies, but tragically act of procreation in Ancestors is deeply, deeply unsexy. Not only is courtship a matter of very mechanically locating a suitable mate for the ape youre currently controlling and pushing B to groom them for 20 seconds, but then you summon them to the mating bed with a shriek and a thump on the ground and then are forced to watch a full one-minute cutscene for every birth. Now, Im a dad, and Im the first to admit that deeply ingrained in just about every proud parent is the desire to compel everyone around them watch a montage of videos of their first year with their newborn. Its a sickness  we all know it, and we do it anyway. In Ancestors, Ive gotten an overdose of my own medicine: youre forced to watch the exact same minute-long unskippable cutscene again and again, every time a new baby is born. And babies are a thing you need to have a lot of  the more successful your clan is, the more babies it will bear, and my best strategy thus far is to do nothing else until every female ape has had the maximum two children. With your starting tribe you can expect to watch this four times every generation, and it only goes up from there. The cutscene is literally long enough for me to get up and make myself a drink while it happens. That is, unless Im doing something wrong, which I might be because again, Ancestors wont help you much. Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey's greatest challenge is working out  or simply Googling  how its basic survival, crafting, and combat mechanics work. Once you understand them they become mostly trivial, and the main appeal becomes appreciating the exploration of the huge and lush prehistoric African map. Evolving your tribes abilities feels artificially drawn out and there are far too many unskippable cutscenes, but its hard not to develop a soft spot for these disposable apes because of their authentic animations.", "date": "Aug. 26, 2019,"}
