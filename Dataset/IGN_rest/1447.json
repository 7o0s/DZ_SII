Looks like their followers aren't so much in the following mood anymore and have decided to build towers tall enough to reach the heavens. Naturally these gods, in there infinite grace and wisdom, decide that the only proper course of action is to blow the heathens to smithereens using their assorted implements of destruction. One of them grabs a PS3/Xbox 360 controller, another grabs a PlayStation Move and the other plugs in the Kinect. This is the problem with Babel Rising. Depending on how you choose to play it, the experience can be anywhere from short lived fun to completely torturous. Despite having a unique premise, its overall lack of content and subpar controls keep it from being enjoyable enough to spend money on. At its heart, Babel Rising is more or less a turret defense game where you are the one and only turret. Your erstwhile followers come up multiple paths in droves, constructing a tower piece by piece with the intention of taking you down. Your job is to use the elements of earth, wind, water and fire to dispatch them with extreme prejudice to prevent the tower's construction. Before each stage you choose two elements to use, each of which has two associated standard attacks and one ~ultimate power.~ You can hurl down lightning bolts Zeus style or you can get all Lil Wayne on a follower and make it rain on 'em. If you have a penchant for overkill, then feel free shower the tower with an apocalyptic onslaught of fireballs. Commanding these powers is by far the best thing Babel Rising has going for it. But it just isn't enough to hinge a game on, especially when the only control option that really works happens to be the one the least people have access to. I never thought I would ever write these words, but the PlayStation Move controller is without a doubt the best way to experience this game. Aiming your powers feels completely effortless with it. You'll be pinpointing key targets with falling rocks and smoothly gesturing hurricane force winds across the precise path that your godly whims dictate. There are moments, where you're on the brink of defeat, with followers swarming the tower, and you suddenly hit this rhythm  deftly switching from power to power, skillfully bringing your entire elemental arsenal to bear. In these moments, Babel Rising feels like a good game. But those moments are rare, even with the Move controller. The parts leading up to those moments boil down to ~point at thing, click to kill it.~ It takes too long for stages to build to those satisfying crescendos, and since you can only ever command two elements in a stage, I got bored of using the same handful of attacks to kill hundreds of mindless drones. The game tries to throw a few curveballs in, such as brief interludes where you have to sink ships coming in to port and enemies that have immunity to one element or the other, but they feel more like distractions than challenges. You know those opening moments of a level in a tower defense game? The ones you normally fast forward through because nothing exciting is happening? That's what the first five to 10 minutes of a stage in Babel Rising feel like, except instead of fast forwarding through them, you have to play them. Are you a god? And if you aren't playing with a Move controller, good luck. If you play with a standard control pad, the controls remain functional and the camera becomes a bit more intuitive thanks to having an analog stick, but you will definitely find yourself falling behind faster as you get into the later waves of a stage. Imagine playing a game that was made for a mouse and keyboard on a controller instead, and you start to get an idea of what the difference is like. But there is no metaphor in any human language that can accurately convey the rage inducing folly that is playing Babel Rising with Kinect. Everything from menu navigation and basic targeting to camera control and special power activation is a complete mess. Just hitting an enemy with a normal attack felt like a challenge, let alone managing the hectic fracases that come late in a level. CLOSING COMMENTS For brief, glimmering moments near the end of a stage, when using a Move controller, Babel Rising is a decent game with average visuals. The rest of the time, it's an entirely ho-hum riff on tower defense despite its clever inversion of the Lemmings formula. What's more, it goes from ho-hum to below average with a controller, and from below average to atrocious with Kinect. The campaign is clearable in a couple of hours, leaving you with nothing but an endless mode and some limited multiplayer to extend the life of your purchase. But even at $9.99, Babel Rising isn't terribly worth purchasing in the first place. IGN RATINGS FOR BABEL RISING (PS3) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 5.0 Presentation No real story to speak of and the game fails to exude any sort of energy or character in how it presents itself. 6.0 Graphics The game runs smooth enough, but it fails to be anything more than visually workmanlike. None of it looks bad, but I forgot what it looked like as soon as I turned it off. 5.5 Sound There really isn't much in the way of music aside from an occasional chant from your followers. Sound effects for powers get the job done, but lack the godly oomph you'd expect. 5.0 Gameplay Stages take too long to get fun and once they do, they end. Move controls are very well implemented, but using the controller feels a bit clumsy. The Kinect controls are nigh unusable. 4.5 Lasting Appeal You can see all the content in one short sitting. After that, there isn't much left to do but replay the levels in endless mode. The multiplayer scene is... not strong. 5.0 OVERALL Mediocre (out of 10) For brief, glimmering moments near the end of a stage, when using a Move controller, Babel Rising is a decent game with average visuals. The rest of the time, it's an entirely ho-hum riff on tower defense despite its clever inversion of the Lemmings formula.
