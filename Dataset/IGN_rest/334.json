By stark contrast, Demeo takes many of the most enjoyable conventions of D&D  including its strategic turn-based combat, deep character classes, and an extensive bestiary of goblins and ghouls  and juices them into a digital formula thats condensed to be immediately engaging. The result is an infinitely replayable, widely accessible, easy-to-learn (yet difficult to master) tabletop-inspired game that feels just as good in a VR headset  such as the brand-new PlayStation VR2 or the portable Meta Quest 2  as it does on any gaming PC.Up to four players can pop into the same session at any time, and thanks to wide crossplay support extends across a number of VR and non-VR platforms (notably absent: Nintendo Switch and Xbox), and aside from a few bugs  like characters getting stuck in geometry and refusing to move in some of the worst instances  its all pretty seamless. Even when things arent going well, Demeos versatility makes it just as much fun to play whether you choose to head online with up to four strangers in Quickplay mode, gather your established tabletop buddies in a private room, or go it completely alone in Skirmish mode.Five visually-diverse campaigns are broken down into three floors apiece, each more difficult than the last until you face the area boss  like the macabre Elven Queen or the deadly Serpent Lord  on the third and final floor. For the sake of convenience, it can take roughly 30 minutes to one hour to complete each floor  but its usually on the quicker side since all you need to do for the first two floors is find the key and make it to the locked door in one piece. It all takes place on a simulated game board with miniatures and tile-based topography that evokes the sense of playing a game within a game. Youre affecting a fantasy setting rather than being fully transported to one, and to this end, Demeos basement kitsch works notably well  it makes me feel like Im playing in the comfort of a buddys house rather than in an actual dungeon.It makes me feel like I'm playing in the comfort of a buddy's house.Theres no complex story to speak of, though each campaign is accompanied by an interactive pamphlet that lets you flip through the details about the area boss, various monster types (including their strengths and weaknesses), and a few general story tidbits explaining whats going on. This means Demeo always sticks to its most essential basics, like a one-shot pen-and-paper campaign you might find in a game store (or in the depths of an internet forum) and its great that it doesnt need a human dungeon master to run the show. While the gameplay might look like an isometric CRPG in the vein of Divinity: Original Sin 2 or Baldurs Gate from a distance, but dont be confused: Demeo deftly takes you directly to where the action is without getting bogged down in story, and thanks to its intelligent monster AI that keeps you on your toes with plenty of status-altering spells, movement-deterring group attacks, and smart use of chokepoints  its much more of a tactical board game than an RPG.Each of the seven playable classes is decked out with a dynamic, constantly revolving set of powerful abilities unlocked through a randomly generating deck of cards. Defeating monsters gradually refills your card meter until a new card is drawn, but its slow enough to make you think about when to unleash your best abilities. Its a slight disappointment, though, that each of the characters available to use in your party is entirely premade, name and all. Also, its a bit of a bummer that Demeos account-wide progression system is only cosmetic  meaning you wont see your characters gain any persistent progress through an extended series of quests and adventures.You or anyone else can immediately drop into an ongoing session, pick up a character, and that's it.This can seem oversimplified, but the prime benefit is that you or anyone else can immediately drop into an ongoing session, pick up a character, and thats it. You can just play without any knowledge of the rules, and the rest is up to a mixture of skill, strategy, and fate. Much like its tabletop counterparts, Demeo is governed by a dice-rolling system, but its way more compact with three potential outcomes  either your attack or spell works as intended when the dice lands on one sword, delivers a critical hit when the dice lands on two swords, or misses and potentially strikes a teammate when it lands on a skull.Things are kept nice and clean by the fact that each character gets two action points per round. For example, moving from one tile to another, delivering a basic attack on a monster, or redeeming a card to unleash a unique ability will generally take up one action point. But its nice that some cards  like health potions  are treated like free actions that dont use any points at all. Demeos initiative system is also pretty straightforward: monsters and players make their moves on alternating rounds, and you can comfortably view everyones move order on your right wrist in VR. It also feels smooth to just pick up your character and plop it down wherever you want when its time to move or attack, and the card deck system is stylishly represented by a literal deck held in your left hand. It pops out when you turn your left palm toward your face, and its cool that you can use any ability in your deck by grabbing the card and dropping it onto the map.Each campaign is themed around different creatures with different tactics, but Demeos monster encounters always feel challenging without immediately overwhelming you, and its tense turn-based combat tends to be unpredictable no matter which campaign youre playing in. Since each characters basic attack only does three points of damage, combat often leans more in favor of the dungeon masters minions than the players. But considering each campaign only takes, at most, three hours to complete from end to end, its never really that big of a deal if you lose. Its a nice consolation prize that youll still earn at least a little progression XP at the end of a floor, even if your party wipes before beating the final boss.It's never really that big of a deal if you lose.If you get bored or distracted, you can just save at the end of a floor (while speaking to the card merchant) though its frustrating that you cant save in the middle of a floor if reality calls mid-run. And if you forget to save before quitting mid-game, you lose all the experience points that you would have earned toward your accounts progression had you simply died. This makes sense as an incentive to keep people from quitting in the middle of an online session, but I missed out on too many opportunities to earn XP in the single-player Skirmish mode just because I saw where things were heading and didnt feel like narrowly carving my way out of danger or waiting for my party to wipe.That said, Demeos satisfyingly asymmetric combat encounters can feel like tug-of-war at their tensest moments; often managing to remain tight enough to make you think carefully about each move, but never so much that youre left completely out of options if you have a few odd cards and some spare patience and creativity to figure something out. Its only when the odds are most stacked against your party that the rich interplay between Demeos classes gets to shine, and theres a level of nuance here that you dont often see in true-blue RPGs.For instance, the Barbarian has a grappling hook that he can use once per round, allowing him to quickly propel himself to a distant tile, bring enemies closer, or capture an elemental trap (like an exploding oil pot) to use as a projectile on his next turn. This means a party of four Barbarians can rapidly travel across the map in a group, barraging an opponent with wave after wave of elemental traps  including poison and fire traps that magnify one anothers effectiveness  then quickly move away together. Its a remarkably different strategy than what would be tenable in a party containing one speedy Barbarian, a sneaky Assassin, a tanky Guardian, and one courage-inspiring Bard, each class bringing its own unique skills to create a bevy of strategic possibilities.In VR, you get an impressive amount of control over the camera.Granted, the camera can be a bit finicky. This was especially the case when I approached Demeo from outside of a VR headset on both the PS5 and on Windows, where the maps geometry often occluded important details and moving it around wasnt always as intuitive as I would have liked. But in VR, you do get an impressive amount of control over the camera. Grabbing the world with both hands and stretching it out or spinning it around to get a better view of the board always felt natural to me, even though I felt like I was constantly moving it around and altering it to get a better angle. Its cool that I could even zoom all the way into the board if I wanted an up-close look at the miniatures. I also appreciate the level of detail that developer Resolution Games placed into each of Demeos colorful zones, like the desert village of Izteria, and it all holds up while standing directly inside of them in VR.Other players in Demeos multiplayer modes are represented by masks and hands, but theres just enough detail there to give you the essence of social interaction in a physical space  that is, without the added hassle of setting up a game board and tearing it down after. Its also pretty neat that you can unlock different cosmetic skins between sessions and, for what its worth, theres no microtransaction shop here  so dont even think about paying for a decked-out pair of dice. My final gripe is that the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Rift versions have an exclusive Heroes Hangout mode which is missing from its PS VR2 and Steam counterpart, and its here where you can paint your own miniatures and read up on the various campaigns  or just kick back with a few arcade games. Even then, though, sucks that you cant bring your own painted miniatures into actual Demeo sessions. Demeo is a delightful alternative to the mechanically engrossing (albeit burdensome) tabletop RPGs and board games to which it lovingly pays homage. It might not offer the same width or depth as a true RPG, and it may not satisfy a pen-and-paper purists love of creating and growing with their own heroes, but its such an enjoyably compact yet intelligently riveting experience that, if you can get past its occasional bugs, Demeo is a great introductory game for anyone whos interested in seeing what D&D or VR is about.", "date": "Feb. 28, 2023,"}
