It joyously exhumes the corpses of both fallen genre titan LucasArts and Grim Fandango itself, whose out-of-print and unsupported status had rendered it nearly impossible to find  let alone play  over the past decade and a half. Adventure games tend to age better than other genres because their gameplay is so story-focused, and so its no surprise that Grim Fandango remains a fine experience in 2015. However, one missed opportunity for improvement is that, like many games of the 90s, there is no tutorial available. Youre simply thrown headfirst into the adventure, and any How do I do that? questions that wouldve been answered by the thick instruction manual you were expected to read before you played (heck, it was part of the fun!) are left a mystery here. As a $15 download, Grim Remastered obviously doesnt include a booklet. And while you can check the button layout in the Options screen  Fandango feels completely natural on DualShock 4, by the way, and theres a new feels-like-it-was-always-there point-and-click interface option on PC  youre given no other context for what youre actually supposed to do. If youre familiar with Telltales modern adventures, youll have a basic idea, but Grim is a much deeper, more complex quest than the Walking Deads and Wolves Among Us youre used to nowadays. As I progressed, Grim reminded me that adventure games of yore expected a lot more from players than most games do today. Thats hardly a bad thing, but it can be a bit jarring if youre coming to this classic for the first time. Over this beautiful and dramatic 12-hour adventure, youll have to talk to a lot of memorable characters, collect a lot of items, and use them in creative and often bizarre ways, so youll need either an excellent memory or a notepad and pen to keep track of your current goals (especially if you take a day or two off in the middle of your playthrough). Its a lot to keep track of, and Grim Fandango wont help you out in any way. The four-year tale of Manny as he tries to work off spiritual debts by selling expedited afterlife travel to paradise (read: heaven) so he can eventually get there himself is a gripping one, packed with film noir influences, a stellar jazzy soundtrack, and light touches of comedy too. Its split into four years, with each one  particularly the film noir-heavy Year 2  chock full of locations, characters, and items. Glottis, your netherworld demon sidekick whose sole reason to exist is to drive vehicles, is easily my favorite character  particularly as his role evolves into piano player, lounge singer, and shipman. But even the archetypal NPCs are well-written, well-acted, and generally interesting. I say this is a 12-hour story, but like any adventure game, youll only progress as fast as you can solve puzzles, and that will vary depending on how good you are at sussing out wacky adventure game logic. Most of your challenges make sense, but I wouldnt call any of them flat-out easy. More often than not, theres something that requires you to dig into your gray matter a bit deeper than a modern game would. Frustration is inevitable  its part of the genre  but when you finally figure out what you missed, its incredibly rewarding. However, while I never flat-out cheated on any puzzles by looking up their solutions online, I do wish Grim Fandango Remastered had added a hint system similar to the stellar Monkey Island 1 and 2 Special Editions, which provided bigger and bigger hints as you continued to press the hint button before ultimately giving you the solution. The one puzzle that made me absolutely mental was (no spoilers) the multi-part counterfeit betting-stub machine task near the end of Year 2. Be ready for that. Just as the excellent craft behind Grims story means its no less engrossing today than it was in 1998, its 3D graphics have also held up surprisingly well. Because Grim has such unique art direction, its low-polygon characters havent aged as poorly as youd expect. In fact, the original pre-rendered backgrounds help the graphics look borderline modern. Thus, switching back and forth between the original and remastered graphics on the fly only changes the characters, whose detail and lighting are cleaned up for 2015. The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a true 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (a stretched 16:9 option is available, but it looks awful), which means were stuck with black bars on the sides of our screens. Not much has changed about the content of this game, but the developer commentary track, which serves up stories and memories from over a half-dozen key creators, including designer Tim Schafer, is a delightful cherry on top. Its filled with fun facts and humorous retrospective observations about what was going on in the heads of the tightly bonded team who put this thing together. Theyre sprinkled liberally throughout the story, and theyre only a button press away. And since the commentary almost never spoils puzzles, I highly recommend turning it on in the Special Features menu before you begin. PlayStation Vita Impressions Should you elect to play Grim Fandango Remastered on the Vita, youll be in for a portable treat. The handheld version cleverly offers both the PS4s gamepad controls and the PCs point-and-click controls simultaneously, letting you mix and match on the fly and on a whim. Visuals look clean on the Vitas screen, too, though the 4:3 aspect ratio is extra painful here because of the already limited screen real estate (again, do not attempt to use the hideous 16:9 stretching option). On a similar note, the Vitas screen also occasionally stings during scenes when the camera is pulled way back, making Manny a mere few pixels tall. But Cross-Buy and Cross-Save functionality means your $15 gets you both PlayStation versions, and youre able to seamlessly carry your save files back and forth between the two. Thats a huge plus. Pros Gripping storyArt directionDeveloper commentary Cons 4:3 aspect ratioNo hint system The passage of time has done little to diminish Grim Fandangos reputation as one of the finest adventure games ever made, and the fact that so little needed to be done to modernize it only reinforces its place as a classic of the genre. While it may seem punishing at times to modern gamers, remember that failure is impossible. I wish this new version had incorporated a hint system to make it more accessible to the new generation, but whether youve never played Grim Fandango before or you replay it every year and just want to dive into Remastered for the insightful developer commentary track, this is a reverent re-release whose few bygone era warts are minimized by its timeless story.", "date": "Jan. 27, 2015,"}
