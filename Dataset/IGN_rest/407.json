An iconic but now-aged hero plays a prominent role, comforting old fans and tugging on their nostalgic heartstrings for much of the story while passing the torch to a new generation of heroes. The plot structure follows many of the same recognizable beats of the tale that started it all, and by the end youve been on a great ride that is both familiar and new at the same time. No, Im not talking about Star Wars Episode VII, though there are a number of interesting (if coincidental) similarities between it and the approach Microsofts taken to its first internally developed Gears of War game. Gears of War 4 is set 25 years after the events of the original trilogy, with Marcus Fenix playing the Han Solo mentor role, while his son JD and JDs longtime friends Kait and Del sub in for Rey, Finn, and Poe. As the torch is passed to a new generation, I was left reassured that this is in many ways the same Gears I know and love. Lets get something out of the way up front: if youre looking for Gears of War to be completely reinvented, Gears 4 isnt that game. That full-on reboot day will likely arrive eventually, but everything about this entry in the series hews closest to the first Gears, which is probably the one Id also choose to emulate: the mystery of a new, unknown enemy lends a survival-horror feel to the gritty shooter tone, the occasional fork in the road offers both gameplay variety and replayability, and the plot revolves around a search for family  here, its Kaits missing mother Reyna Diaz in place of Dominic Santiagos wife Maria. Thats not to say Gears of War 4 doesnt bring new elements to the series cover-based shooting formula. On the campaign side, the new DeeBee robot enemies and Seran Swarm foes attack differently than their Locust predecessors, thus requiring welcome new offensive and defensive strategies to combat them. For instance, the larger Heavy DeeBee jump-jets over cover and self-destructs when it takes enough damage, while the skybound, front-shielded Guardian is best flanked from multiple sides in order to expose its weak spots. And the Swarms Pouncer flings deadly quills from its tail and hops on top of cover, pinning you to the ground like a Hobbes from Hell if you stay in one place for too long. All of these put a lot more pressure on you than ever before in a Gears game, and are especially inviting for challenge-seekers playing on higher difficulty levels. On a similar note, Gears of War 4s new weapons integrate nicely into the established universe alongside the familiar Lancer and Friends, both in campaign and multiplayer. The Buzzkill fires lethal, high-velocity sawblades that spectacularly instagib foes when they connect. The Overkill packs a wicked, if short-range, double-barrel shotgun-esque punch thats especially gratifying when other human players feel its wrath. Finally, the DeeBees EMBAR is a no-scope rifle thats not nearly as cumbersome to wield as the traditional Longshot. Design-wise, the new Gears campaign succeeds thanks to stellar execution of a focused game plan. Variety is a welcome pillar of its eight-hour trek, as, aside from one exception in Act IV, youre never in one place doing the same thing for too long. Gears 4s campaign  playable in two-player split-screen or online co-op (and even supports cross-platform play with the PC version)  packs several gameplay styles, including a few thematically appropriate instances of Horde mode along with a couple other enjoyable changes of pace. (A friendly suggestion: do not watch the Gears of War 4 Launch Trailer; it gives away a few of the campaigns fun gameplay surprises.) And laudably, Gears 4 never relies on the annoying design trope of requiring you to run a frustrating gauntlet through large groups of the toughest enemies youve already fought individually in order to reach its conclusion; its got a much smarter endgame up its sleeve. Visually, this Gears doesnt pack the same jaw-dropping punch the original did back in 2006 when it showed the kind of leap forward that the Unreal Engine was capable of, but it is a very pretty game throughout. Thats not because its one of the first Xbox games to support HDR if youve got an Xbox One S and a capable TV, because while I could tell a difference compared to non-HDR, its nothing to write home about. Gears 4s most graphically impressive moments are tied to the weather, with Windflares (basically giant electrical dust storms) producing swirling dust, swaying trees, and dancing foliage. Smartly, the heavy winds actually affect weapons that fire relatively slow-moving projectiles such as the aforementioned Buzzkill, whose shots will arc such that they become almost useless at their normally reliable medium range, forcing you to choose your gear extra carefully in the inclement weather. Like its fellow first-party mainstay Halo, Gears of Wars campaign has always been complemented by great multiplayer. That hasnt changed with Gears of War 4. Both Versus and Horde, like campaign, have evolved rather than been reinvented, with predictably fun results. Gears multiplayer has always managed a brilliant balance of tactics and fast action to go with its borderline-cartoonish violence, giving it standout appeal over the glut of other multiplayer shooters. Gears 4 brings 10 maps and plenty of modes  most of which are great, tried-and-true staples from other games or previous Gears entries. A standout is Arms Race, which is basically Call of Dutys Gun Game, in which each team in a races to get three kills each with every weapon in a certain order. It works just as well here. Escalation, aka Domination or Territories, on the other hand, simply drags on far too long as a best-of-13-round duel. If Gears 4 were patched to cut that in half, Escalation would join the other modes in the winners circle. Meanwhile, the now-expected private-match customizability also grants Versus plenty of staying power to play exactly how you want. The five-player Horde mode, however, is once again where Gears multiplayer shines brightest. The tower-defense elements introduced in Gears 3 have been iterated on for the better here. Killed enemies drop resource chits that must be collected and brought back to your Fabricator  your mobile emplacement builder, basically  and deposited into a team-shared pool used to erect fences, sentries, turrets, and more as you fight through 50 waves of DeeBee and Swarm foes. Every tenth wave brings out a random boss to contend with, such as the Snatcher, who steals downed allies and carries them away, or the Kestrel, an attack helicopter who forces you to change your eye level. And a new class system emphasizes teamwork by encouraging specialized roles that grant specific action bonuses. For example, the Engineer is more lightly armed but can repair damaged emplacements. My groups best run ended at wave 42, and we immediately jumped back in for more. So expect many hours of replayable fun with your friends. PC Version Update After spending time with the PC version (included free with digital purchase of the Xbox One version, and vice versa), I'm happy to report that performance is buttery smooth  my GTX 970-powered PC never dipped below 60fps, and it would've been consistently higher if not for the refresh-rate limitations of my aging monitor. Keyboard-and-mouse controls feel great and are as configurable as you'd expect from a PC game, with only the default binding of the gamepad's A-button functionality set to the spacebar annoying me enough to want to re-bind it to the left shift key. Cross-play is completely seamless  I played Horde on Xbox One with two PC teammates (marked as such by a monitor icon next to their gamertag in the lobby) and two console teammates, and both progress and achievements carry over to either version. Aside from 4K resolution, which I wasn't able to test, the PC version's biggest draw is a 60fps campaign, which is capped at 30fps on the Xbox One. It's not a problem at all on console, but it's noticeably smoother on a capable PC. I never expected to compare Gears of War 4 to The Force Awakens, but I couldnt be happier to do so. Like the latest chapter in the story from a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Gears of War 4 is directed by a new generation of creators, shares a lot of similar narrative structures to the beloved first piece of the trilogy it succeeds, and is an experience youll walk away from with a big smile on your face  in campaign, Versus, and Horde modes alike. Its about as good of a franchise reawakening as I couldve hoped for. J.J. Abrams would no doubt appreciate what Gears 4 accomplishes.", "date": "Oct. 12, 2016,"}
