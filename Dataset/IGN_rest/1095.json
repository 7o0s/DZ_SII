Its dark, gritty nature and fast-paced combat is a refreshing change from the more syrupy tone and traditional turn-based battles that dominate the JRPG scene. Yet clunky controls, repetitive gameplay, ugly graphics, poorly written characters, and massive framerate issues make the idea of playing again to see another ending completely unappealing. In the first of the 40 hours I spent with Drakengard 3, I noticed the subpar graphics and framerate. (Yes, I know, every game in the Drakengard series has suffered from these issues, but repeating a mistake doesnt make it less of a mistake.) There are jagged edges everywhere, the framerate plummets whenever theres a lot of activity on the screen, the color palette for the world is bland and uninspired, and textures are so undetailed and boring they look like they belong in the PlayStation 2 era. Its all a terrible strain on the eyes. The next issue is the poor level design. Drakengard 3 is an extremely linear game, and areas have very little to see and explore. Linearity can be a great experience if its done well, but outside of the way developer Access Games differentiates each location with a special feature (a dark, creepy forest maze, a desert with drastic weather fluctuations that affect your characters health, etc.), any attempts at innovation are ruined by the constant backtracking and limited variety of enemies encountered along the way. Drakengard 3 is an extremely linear game. Even the sidequests are repetitive, with protagonist Zero returning to the same handful of places to acquire items before time runs out (a nod to the original Drakengards timed missions). The writers use self-deprecating humor as a passive mea culpa for all of this repetition, but after a while the jokes wear thin, and only served to remind me just how annoying having to revisit the same locations over and over again is. This game is a bloody mess. The series Rubiks Cube approach to storytelling doesnt really work here. An entertaining story and interesting characters couldve made all of that worth suffering through, but Drakengard 3 is devoid of both. The series Rubiks-cube approach to storytelling doesnt really work here  Drakengard 3 is too slow to reveal its secrets, and relies heavily on fans remembering what happened in the original Drakengard (which came out 10 years ago) in order to understand whats going on. It doesnt help that Zero and her disciples are poorly written, and no amount of rifling through Drakengards database or attempts to engage Zeros Disciples in conversation reveals much about them. Even Zeros motivation for her quest to kill her sisters isnt fully explained until quite late in the tale. Again, thats something that can be done well if the mystery is properly built up, but here it left me feeling directionless. If you really want the full story, youll have to go through all four endings (with the last ending only accessible by collecting every weapon). Drakengard 3 has one bright spot: Zeros combat abilities. I loved being able to dispatch an entire phalanx of enemies with a few quick swipes of a sword, and changing weapons on the fly kept the pace of combat fast and furious. The most exciting combat feature is the Intoner Mode, a special overdrive that makes Zero nearly impervious to damage in battle. The scream, thrilling music, and accompanying camera spin as she transforms is impressively dramatic. Its in these brief moments where Zero is invincible that Drakengard 3 really shines. Its too bad her human A.I. companions are utterly useless in battle (seriously, theyre dumber than a bag of bricks), but I rarely needed their help anyway. I did appreciate the English voice casts attempts at making the asinine combat banter somewhat meaningful, at least. But while controlling Zero is fun, controlling her flying dragon companion Mikhail is not. Im not sure why the aerial combat is so terribly executed, but whenever I had to fight using Mikhail, I would grit my teeth and curse the developer for the clunky controls and unwieldy camera. It really ruined my overall enjoyment of the otherwise fun combat system. Fighting with a dragon is a real drag. Pros Intoner ModeGreat Soundtrack Cons Terrible FrameratePoor VisualsRepetitive Gameplay I did everything I could to overlook Drakengard 3s shoddy graphics, repetitive gameplay, poor controls, and shallow characters. Alas, this RPG is its own worst enemy. Everything about it feels underdeveloped and cobbled together. If theres ever another Drakengard, I hope the developers do it justice and invest in smoother technology and a better-written script.", "date": "May 21, 2014,"}
