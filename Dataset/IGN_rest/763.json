I do my best to capture the former and avoid the latter, diving between the tracks three lanes as needed. Im dialled in to the action, head nodding to the music as I struggle to keep up with the flow, which becomes more challenging after the song crescendos and dynamically generated hell breaks loose in response. This is Audiosurf 2 at its best  a hypnotic rhythm-action game powered by songs from your PC or Soundcloud. Like the original, however, the at its best part is confined to a few modes; the rest of them, sadly, are more miss than hit. The no-nonsense score-chasing mode Ive described above is called Mono. It was the most played mode in the original and it will likely be the most played in Audiosurf 2. Of course theres more to it than simply dodging bad things and grabbing good things. Snagged blocks are collected  Tetris-style  at the bottom of the screen. After three or more blocks are linked, theyll disappear after a short period of time. Collecting more blocks resets the timer, allowing you to keep filling up the three lanes. The more blocks in the grid, the higher the score awarded when theyre cleared. Reaching the top of a lane triggers an instant clear, so you often have to actually avoid blocks to fill the grid. Hell, you can even deliberately hit a spike to reset the timer. Sounds straightforward, but youre generally trying to do this while flying at a breakneck pace along a path bouncing and swerving and thick with blocks. Theres definitely a high multitasking skill ceiling here. Advanced players also need to pay attention to where the power-ups are on the course. The idea is that they pop up at climactic moments, and the more blocks in your grid when you nab that power-up, the higher the score reward. Youre meant to anticipate these moments in the music, but I found myself looking out for the tell-tale loops on the horizon. Real time leaderboards (top right) are a sweet inclusion. The note highway is different every time in Audiosurf 2, so you dont really know what the sequence of blocks leading into each power-up is going to be like, and that makes it feel like a little luck is required to get a new top score. The added complexity initially feels at odds with the purity of Mono in the original, but Ive come to appreciate the extra layer, as its very much an extension of the core gameplay. That said, the reason I (and I suspect many others) played Mono over other modes in the original was because it didnt contain unnecessary complications. Other original Audiosurf modes have you matching coloured blocks like a match-3 puzzler, pushing them left or right as you collected them, collecting them to use later: mechanics that are at odds with the pace of the gameplay and the enjoyment of the music. Audiosurf 2 offers up a similarly uneven smorgasbord of additional modes. Wakeboard is the flagship new mode, and is exactly what it sounds like: youre pulled along, riding a wakeboard and moving across the highway (or stream in this case) collecting blocks to try and fill your grid. Again, theres an anticipation element, with big moments in the backing track represented by literal drops, so the goal is to fill the grid ahead of these moments then launch off the lip and catch serious air. Its quite spectacular to soar above the track doing an (automatic) trick, but the readability of the grid is pretty poor because theres so much going on. Wakeboarding is fun, but it's no Mono. Other than two Wakeboard modes, most of the developer-created modes are variants from the original Audiosurf and fare about as well here. Even the promising two- to four-player mode Audiosprint  where you slide under or dive over blocks  didnt hook anyone in the IGN AU office. Instead we just went back to taking turns testing different songs in Mono. Mono mode, in case it isnt clear, is worth the price of admission on its own. Every track is a different journey, and the algorithm for analysing music and building fun and challenging courses is superb. The blocks and spikes sync up to the audio incredibly well, no matter what I threw at it, as does the course topography. Audiosurf 2 also has a bunch of skins out of the gate  including the phenomenal Dusk, which transforms the track into a highway at dusk, where the spikes are cars to overtake - and thanks to being in Steam Early Access for so long also hosts countless other options via Steam Workshop. (Same with modes  theres a heap to check out, and some radically change the game.) Soundcloud integration is seamless too  its included in any search results, while if youre logged in you can browse by the producers you follow. I love the way Dusk grounds the game in a Sin City-esque reality. Audiosurf 2 is definitely missing some important functionality to make the most out of its focus on scores and the accompanying leaderboards, though. The core is there  each track has a global leaderboard, regional leaderboard, and friend leaderboard. And when you play it you see how youre doing in real time. You can send friends challenges and get email notifications when a score you posted has been dethroned. Thats all great, but theres no way for me to know whether anyone has posted a score on any of the tracks in my collection without first selecting a track. For really popular music theres a good chance therell be scores to beat, but a lot of the music I want to play in Audiosurf 2 is niche in the wider scheme of things. Id like the ability to see at a glance if theres an existing leaderboard for a track. The interface for browsing is pretty poor in general, too. Aside from being buggy  Ive experienced numerous crashes trying to navigate my collection, with the recent songs folder being a particular offender  the options here just arent user-friendly enough. Why cant I set the my music folder to a location other than my iTunes folder? I dont use iTunes. Instead, I have to laboriously browse my way back to my collection every time I play the game. Why cant I favourite songs? Why cant I specify where the auto music find functionality looks? The range of skins on offer is vast. Its also disappointing that Audiosurf 2 doesnt have a proper media player built in. You cant preview from within the music browser  just from the main screen. Theres also no way to scrub through tracks, so you have to listen from the start which sucks if its a seven-minute house track with a full minute or two before it kicks into gear. All of these gripes may sound nitpicky, but the reality is we live in a world where we have more music to hand than we could ever possibly listen to. Audiosurf 2 would be a much better game if it actively helped make that collection manageable. As it stands, theres a lot of groping around in the dark for what I want to play. Pros Mono modeVibrant lookModability Cons Lesser modesMusic organisation Despite its organisational problems, Id still play Audiosurf 2 over the original in a heartbeat. The representation of the music is just so much more alive than it was before  these courses absolutely buzz with life and energy. Audiosurf 2s core mode is still thoroughly compelling, and it represents a fantastically immersive and nearly endless way to interact with music you love.", "date": "May 31, 2015,"}
