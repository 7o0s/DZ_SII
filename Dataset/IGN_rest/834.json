In the alternate timeline of Aztech Forgotten Gods, we get to see what that might have looked like: a thriving, technologically advanced metropolis that blends Mesoamerican-inspired design with a Tron-like aesthetic. Described by Mexico-based developer Lienzo as a cyber-stone action-adventure, Aztechs memorable setting can be delightful to explore  that is, when the wonky camera and frustrating boss fights arent getting in the way.Aztech Forgotten Gods is a fairly linear, eight-hour adventure about Achtli, a young woman so haunted by her past that she cant move forward in life. After uncovering an ancient artifact  a giant stone arm that replaces her prosthetic one  that allows her to soar high above the city streets, Achtli finds herself facing off against a number of newly awakened ancient gods that threaten to destroy Tenochtitln and all of its inhabitants. The story works well enough but Achtli is underserved by the fact that the dialogue is text-only and often accompanied by repeating animations that show characters moving their lips and bodies in the same way over and over again. Even so, I became fond of the defiant Achtli, her ride-or-die best friend Tepo, and her supportive mother Nantsin thanks to their snappy writing and the enjoyable story.Flying from one edge of the city to the other felt amazing once I got used to it. Launching Achtli into the air, soaring around in every direction, and using speed boosts from strategically placed floating rings feels natural and fluid (though its a little weird that there are so many of them when Achtli is the only person who can fly). Youll spend most of your time in the air, though a depleting energy bar sometimes requires you to be thoughtful about when and where you land, particularly when trying to take down a rampaging stone giant. Few games have made flying feel so intuitive, and this system sets Aztech apart from other action-adventure games that take place largely on solid land. Flight sets Aztech apart from other action-adventure games.That said, despite being large and full of structures, the city often feels empty  hardly the bustling metropolis and global superpower its supposed to be. There arent many inhabitants, and the NPCs that do meander around dont have much to say. There are a few off-the-beaten-path spots where you can engage in combat or race challenges or discover missing memories to find, at least.Unfortunately, Aztechs combat isnt nearly as enjoyable as its exploration. For the most part, fighting both the smaller enemies that pop up throughout Tenochtitln and the oversized stony gods is an exercise in button-mashing. Achtli does have a few special moves  a powered-up super-punch, shooting energy-based projectiles, a downward strike  but its rarely worth it to use this entire skillset because doing so requires precise placement and timing in boss battles that are largely chaotic. Instead, it was much more effective to spam basic attacks unless otherwise required and fly away to recover when Achtlis health bar got too low.Boss battles can feel like more of a chore than a challenge.Speaking of those boss battles, thats where youll do the bulk of the fighting, and they can feel like more of a chore than a challenge. These hulking masses of stone and mythology typically require several steps to defeat, but the objectives of each phase are often unclear and the bosses dont react visibly to your attacks. There were times when I couldnt tell if I was doing any damage outside of watching the health bar at the top of the screen, and all I felt after each giant battle was a sense of relief that it was over, not satisfaction.Still, the most challenging foe youll face in Aztech isnt one of the titular forgotten gods  its the camera. Though youre technically in control of its movement, it sometimes feels like it has a mind of its own, especially when youre getting knocked around. Rogue camera angles can remove Achtli from view entirely, which isnt an ideal way to play a third-person action game. The camera might also switch angles depending on where she lands, messing up the fluidity of the otherwise-delightful mobility. This is a big reason why the boss fights can be frustrating; its not fun taking the time to set up an attack, only to have it thwarted when the camera switches around seemingly at random.Aztech Forgotten Gods certainly isnt a display of high-end graphical tech, but what it lacks in polish  such as the frequent clipping issues we see in Achtlis hair and apparel  it makes up for in style. The Mesoamerican inspiration shines through in the customizable outfits and hairstyles, character design, and the sprawling city itself. The small but memorable cast of characters would definitely stand out in a crowd, and the dialogue sprinkles in bits of Nahuatl language that helps bring this futuristic version of Tenochtitln to life. It feels like this vision of an alternate-history Aztec empire was crafted with care and consideration, which went a long way towards making me willing to overlook the more frustrating parts. It may be a little rough around the edges, but Aztech Forgotten Gods certainly has its charms. Its refreshing to see a rarely seen historical setting brought to life in a new way, and Achtlis struggle to overcome her own past while grappling with the history of Aztec civilization makes her a worthy heroine. But while it can be an enjoyable adventure in its own right, Aztech doesnt stand out among the more ambitious big-budget games its competing for attention with right now  especially when its disobedient camera, weak combat, and aggravating boss battles drag its otherwise satisfying flying back down to Earth.", "date": "March 9, 2022,"}
