The latest in SNKs premiere fighting games plays it safe by focusing on subtly refining the already solid mechanics of 2016s King of Fighters XIV and bringing the graphics up to a more modern standard, but never really reaches beyond that in an attempt to take the series to the next level. Because of that lack of ambition it wont do much to grab the attention of those who dont already have eyes on the series, but for longtime fans this is a reliable return for the king. As is tradition, KOF XV is primarily a 3v3 fighter (though it can be played 1v1 in casual modes), with the twist of there being no tag or assist mechanics to speak of. Instead, matches play out in a series of 1v1 duels with the winning character staying in play with a persistent health bar until the opposing teams three characters are all defeated. This means you dont get the team dynamic and synergies found in tag fighters like Marvel vs Capcom or Dragon Ball FighterZ, but KoF requires you to think strategically in making sure that you craft a well-balanced team from the roster of 39 characters. Since you get more bars of super meter as your team is depleted to two and then one, you have to consider the order in which you place your characters. (Those who can build meter but dont necessarily need it should go first, while those who excel at dealing massive damage once theyve got a fully stocked set of five meters should be used as the anchor in the third position.) Its a great and well-proven formula, and while Ill personally always prefer to only have to specialize in one character at a time as opposed to three, King of Fighters XVs team mechanics allow for exciting matchups with great potential for comebacks thanks to its big-damage combos that can essentially delete your opponents life bar in a single combo, if you have the resources for it. What We Said About The King of Fighters XIVKing of Fighters XIV offers an astonishing amount of content, with nearly double the playable characters of most other games available on day one. The fighters themselves are interesting and well designed, both visually and mechanically, and they push limits with an execution ceiling higher than perhaps any other fighting game. King of Fighters XIVs netcode and technical shortcomings are itis biggest stumbling blocks, but mastering its characters and leveraging what youve learned remains satisfying regardless. There are no shortcuts to becoming the new King of Fighters, but the journey to the top is well worth taking. - Darry Huskey, August 24, 2016Score: 8Read the full The King of Fighters XIV reviewTaking it to the MaxOn a fundamental level, KOF XV plays very much like a prettier version of KOF XIV. Theyre both four-button fighters with two light attacks and two heavy attacks; both have those tricky hops and super hops that help make approaching from the air hard to react to and awkward to punish; every character in both games can roll to safely move through projectiles and close the distance; and both have those auto-combos that people will be arguing about on Reddit threads, message boards, and social media until the end of time. Auto-combos are actually even more powerful this time around as just mashing light punch from close range will net you a four-hit combo that ends with the most powerful super move your meter can afford. If you have at least three meters stored, thats a nearly 50% damage combo just for hammering a single button. That sounds dramatic, but even the simplest of combos that incorporate a level 3 super can deal more damage than that, and if you were to use KOFs trademark system of canceling supers into each other, its very easy to leave a button masher in the dust. Still, its an awfully high reward for a bad habit, which does more harm than good for players truly looking to get into the series. KOF XV plays very much like a prettier version of KOF XIVBeyond the changes to auto-combos, there are two really big changes that keep KOF XV from feeling like a complete retread. The first is a new universal Shatter Strike that will crumple an opponent when it hits, allowing you to extend a combo. More importantly than that, its also a great defensive ability that can absorb hits and simultaneously deal one that will stun your opponent, much like a focus attack from Street Fighter 4. I love this addition because, among other things, it gives every character a really strong anti-air option that reduces the need of remembering specific special moves with anti-air properties. KOF XV is a game where jump-ins are extra effective because of the multiple angles of aerial approach that having both short hops and regular jumps allows for, and giving every character an answer to that problem helps to bring up those who dont have those built-in anti-air options.The other substantial change is a revamp of MAX Mode that disappointed me at first, but Ive come to appreciate it as a worthwhile trade off. MAX Mode still grants you a limited-time buff that increases your damage and lets you use EX specials and super moves without spending actual meter, but it now costs two bars of meter instead of one, which means it's much more expensive to convert damage off of pokes in the neutral and really requires you to get in close if you want that bigtime damage. Not only that, but canceling an attack into MAX Mode now triggers a shorter version of the buff called MAX Mode (Quick) that has a much smaller meter and doesnt offer the same damage buff that regular MAX Mode does. To compensate for this, EX Special moves can now be performed outside of MAX Mode and only cost a half a bar of meter, which greatly expands every character's options when it comes to getting in and starting their offense. A Royal InvitationEven though 39 is fewer than the number of characters that KOF XIV launched with, KOF XVs roster is still a very impressive number relative to most fighting games right out of the gate. Newcomers to the series include Dolores, a psychic who looks like she was plucked straight from Bayonetta and uses sacred dirt to attack her foes; Isla, a stylish young girl who fights with phantom hands that allow her to attack from mid range and use some really tricky crossups when she rides them towards her opponents; and Krohnen who  lets just be real  is basically Tetsuou from Akira. Apart from those three, who are brand new, Shermie and Elisabeth make their return to the roster [Correction: Chris, Ash, Yashiro and Shizuru also make their return to the roster]. Elisabeth was in KOF XIII and only returns after taking just one game off, but Shermie makes her first return to the mainline franchise since 2002. The other 34 30 have basically been plucked from KOF XIV wholesale, with very little changes outside of better-looking character models. A handful of characters have gotten new level 3 Climax Super Moves, but many others have all of their animations ripped directly from KOF XIV, and thats kind of disappointing, because even though the new models do look great, theyre just a fresh coat of paint on animations that are now six years old. Hitting Where It Matters MostWhile King of Fighters XV is certainly a modern-looking KOF game, it still feels left woefully in the past when it comes to its modes. Its tutorial does the bare minimum of teaching you its mechanics without going any further into conveying when or why you should use things like a MAX Mode (Quick) cancel; its story mode is the same archaic style of arcade mode that just has you fighting a series of uncontextualized battles that culminate in a unfairly balanced boss final boss fight, with the only reward being an unvoiced ending cinematic with static pictures and text boxes; and its mission mode offers only five combos per character. As far as single-player content goes, thats all there is to it. With games like Mortal Kombat 11, Guilty Gear Strive, and even fighters on the indie scene like Thems Fightin Herds all raising the bar both in terms of how they introduce new players to their mechanics and their single-player story modes, King of Fighters XV feels utterly bare bones by comparisonKing of Fighters XV's rollback netcode is fantastic.Fortunately, it makes it up in the area that matters the most to fighting game communities: excellent online fighting. Its rollback netcode is fantastic; its super easy to set up a private lobby with queues, spectators, and customizable rules; theres an online training space where you can practice with a friend; you can search replays by character to study up on a match up; and there are both ranked and casual playlists for matchmaking. Of course, this is going off of my pre-launch experience playing against other journalists and content creators, but even in matches against people who were across the country, outside of a small handful of exceptions that werent even that bad, performance has been consistently smooth. King of Fighters XV is not the most ambitious or revolutionary fighting game to come out in recent years, but what few changes have been made to distinguish it from its predecessor are done well. Its a significant step up over KOF 14 in terms of its detailed character models (if not animations), there are a handful of smart adjustments to its fighting mechanics that give you more options than ever before, and its large roster of 39 characters features a wide variety of different character archetypes to choose from. Its disappointing that SNK still hasnt figured out how to provide value for those who are looking for single-player content in their fighting games, or a way to learn to play better using the actual tools provided by training modes, but those shortcomings are easy to overlook in the face of its fantastic netcode and simple, but effective online modes.", "date": "Feb. 11, 2022,"}
