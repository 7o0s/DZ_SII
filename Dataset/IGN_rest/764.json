There were moments when I felt like a true sorcery savant, furiously tapping out the perfect elemental combinations in the nick of time; at others, my efforts felt artificially thwarted by cheap, unavoidable deaths, especially when playing solo. Magicka 2 can be an unreasonably cruel mistress, but its charming world and sophisticated mechanics kept me coming back, particularly when I brought a friend or two along for some chaotic co-op. By entering combinations of 10 magical elements one button at a time, Magicka 2 lets you experiment to discover a crazy number of different spells  and amazingly, all of them wind up being useful at one point or another. Theres a clear logic to how the spellweaving works: fire and water make steam, water and cold become ice, and so forth. Once I got the many rules down, I almost immediately went mad with power. Need a circular wall of stone that protects and heals you? Go for it. Need a spell that arcs to multiple targets like lightning, but burns like fire? Create it. For as much power as Magicka 2 gives you, its well-matched by encounters that require you to wield that power intelligently. For example, you might get drenched walking through a shallow creek. Suddenly, casting lightning spells becomes a painful and ineffective mistake. I handled it by heading back to dry land and casting a weak fire spell on myself to dry off, followed by a combination of three water elements and a barrier to become H2O immune. This allowed me to stand in the middle of the water and happily pump my sword up with as much lightning as I pleased while my enemies charged towards me all soggy, ready to take tons of bonus damage from my melee attacks. Through its relatively short six to eight hours, Magicka 2s campaign had me thinking and chuckling in equal measures, with a constant drip of sly pop-culture references to shows like Archer and Game of Thrones peppered throughout the ever-more-devious combat scenarios. The thing is, situations like the one I just described require you to remember all those combinations, and to enter around 10 to 15 button commands in a matter of seconds on the fly. Its a complexity that reminds me of a fighting game, which is great, except that unlike a fighting game there arent any proper low execution options to lean on when youre under pressure, so even simple situations can be mechanically demanding depending on how you want to approach them. There are hotkeys for certain powerful spells, but those are more long-cooldown heavy hitters than general use tools. Magicka 2 is demanding, to a far greater degree than its playful, colorful countenance would seem to imply. If you manage to get it all to click though, theres a unique sense of mastery to reward your hard work. Unfortunately, even once you feel like youve mastered the art of sorcery, there are several insane difficulty spikes that, if youre playing alone, might make you feel like you never had a chance. Some enemy attacks will arbitrarily knock you clean from one end of the screen down a bottomless pit on the other, and others will simply insta-gib you if you havent prepared the appropriate defensive spell in advance. Youll get hit with multi-element combinations of crowd-control spells, freezing, slowing, or juggling you, and/or blocking your escape path, leading to unavoidable deaths as you scramble to cast the appropriate spells to counter them all. The worst was when Id get knocked off-screen, causing the camera to glitch out. Id watch in maddening frustration as enemies walked off screen to kill me while my character sat unresponsive in the ether past the edge of my television, waiting to die. In moments like this, Magicka 2 feels actively hostile towards solo players. However, the second a friend would jump in to help, all the frustration melted away. You can play up to four-player co-op, and I highly recommend that you do, because allies can continuously revive one another. That more forgiving balance of life and death often turns freak accidents into side-splitting comedy instead of progress-robbing disasters. Friendly fire is in full effect, so there are lots of opportunities for things to go delightfully wrong, and about as many chances to cooperate in interesting ways  like breaking the Ghostbusters rule and crossing streams of opposing elements to create explosive, area-clearing vortexes. Having partners in crime also rounds off the mechanical demands. Since youre no longer the sole damage dealer, you have more time to think and more opportunities to play more of a support role, should that be your thing. To that end, theres a surprising number of unlockable robes, staves, and melee weapons you can don to specialize your little wizard. Magicka 2 doesnt bring full-on RPG-level gearing options or anything, but choosing the right tools for your style can make quite the difference. And hey, who doesnt want to wield stick with a jesters head in one hand and a chainsaw in the other? You can even unlock a bevy of modifiers to activate in any combination youd like to change up your experience. Eliminating specific elements or exaggerating player death animations makes playing back through specific levels with friends a blast. Pros Great spellcastingCrazy co-opCharming humor Cons Cheap deathsSolo difficulty Though it momentarily made me want to commit crimes against my controller at certain points when playing alone, Magicka 2s one-of-a-kind magic system made it difficult to stay mad for very long. Add in the zany, unpredictable nature of co-op and the many ways in which you can alter the experience, and Magicka 2 can provide long lasting, if somewhat demanding and occasionally frustrating good times.", "date": "May 31, 2015,"}
