If my slice can somehow reach the hairdryer on the other side of the room, it'll be able to toast itself to perfection. It shouldnt be possible, but the slice flops forward, gripping the cabinet door with one of its corners. Slowly I swing it upward, grab the door with a different corner, and repeat the motion until the slice reaches the top of the cabinet  which turns out to be surrounded by mildew. As the bread's edibility rapidly diminishes, I reflexively lurch it away, only to watch helplessly as it plummets toward the watery floor and soggy doom. It's moments like this that typify I Am Bread: awkward, frustrating, and a little exhausting, but with just enough bizarre charm to justify another try. I Am Bread has a story, surprisingly, but all that really matters is your bread slice's single-minded drive to toast itself by whatever improvised means are available. Like Bossa Studios' other hilariously clumsy physics puzzler, Surgeon Simulator 2013, much of I Am Bread's challenge lies in simply coming to grips with its purposely awkward grab-and-flop controls. Each corner of your slice corresponds to a different key or shoulder button (theres controller support), which makes them grab whatever they're touching, creating an axis from which you can flip or fling your slice. Touch the floor or some other filthy surface, and your slice's health  or ~edibility~  drops (along with your final score) until you can swing to safety. And when you need to climb, make it quick; your bread can cling to anything, but it can only do so for as long as its grip meter holds out. It's difficult, but not impenetrable. Like anything else, manipulating your toast-to-be gets easier with practice, and toward the end of I Am Breads story mode (which takes around four to six hours to complete, depending on how good you are), I was able to get around with some degree of speed and even accuracy, halted only by hazardous surfaces and occasional confusion over which corner was which. Also, if you're totally stuck, failing a level a few times causes a power-up to appear that grants you infinite edibility and grip if you touch it. It's tempting to turn your nose up at this and the dismal end-of-level scores it brings, but it's an excellent way for the easily frustrated to experiment with each level without the constant frustration of failure  and experimentation is a big part of I Am Bread's fun. Each of the eight suburban-themed levels is a huge physics playground, filled with breakable objects and rewarding secrets to find. Aside from ~get toasted,~ there isn't really any direction, so there's a certain thrill in discovering that  for example  rubbing up against butter and jam improves your deliciousness score, or that flopping onto a skateboard can create a safe path from a table to a counter. And while the radiator on the other side of the room might seem like an obvious toaster substitute, it's a lot more fun to find out that you can also smash a TV in the same room and toast yourself on its fiery wreckage. That sense of discovery also extends to the non-story modes, which unlock gradually and reshuffle each environment. Rampage, for example, is a wonderfully cathartic mode that swaps out your bread slice for a destructive baguette, and fills your surroundings with smashable objects. Cheese Hunt seems boring at first, but after a while, ferreting out stinky cheese hunks as a fragile cracker becomes strangely satisfying. On the other hand, Free Roam's lack of danger or goals may be great for experimentation, but quickly turn dull, while Bagel Race  in which you roll an unsteady bagel through a high-speed obstacle course  is too linear and unforgiving to really be enjoyable. Both are rendered insignificant, however, by the engrossing Zero-G, which outfits your bread slice with realistic space thrusters and challenges you to find a way to toast yourself while navigating a minefield of floating objects, all while accompanied by serene choral music. Once you get over the initial frustration of learning to survive in each new level, learning its secrets can be hugely rewarding  provided you can also put up with I Am Bread's myriad glitches. Some of these are the stuff of YouTube gold  touching certain objects just right, for example, can send your slice spiraling wildly around the level, and getting stuck on level geometry can turn your bread into an uncontrollable mass of flailing corners. Other bugs are less entertaining, like repeatedly falling through the world at one level's start (which was fixed by quitting out and coming back). Certain levels also consistently caused performance problems on my test PC, dipping the framerate from a steady 30fps to an unplayable three, so there's clearly some work still to be done. Pros Rewardingly toughBread physicsLevel design Cons Initial awkwardnessTechnical issues While it's not quite the absurdly violent physics spectacle that Surgeon Simulator 2013 is, I Am Bread has its own unique charms, with a darkly silly tone, a minimal but effective story, and open-ended level design that's richer than the simple premise might lead you to expect. Its clumsy controls make it disheartening at first, but it's worth it for the reward of eventually overcoming them and finding destructive new paths to toasty success.", "date": "April 14, 2015"}
