The remake of the 2008 Nintendo DS dungeon-crawler offers up copious amounts of gratifying dungeon exploration and fun, challenging enemies, all wrapped in an inoffensive JRPG story. Things start off on the right foot with the option to play either Classic Mode (the original format) or Story Mode, which incorporates new characters and a new locale into the plot. Both choices are solid ones, but though I like how Classic Mode gives me the freedom to build and customize a team of explorers from scratch (a series staple), I prefer Story Modes predetermined team and their more meaningful relationships and better reasons for traversing the world. Admittedly the untold portion of EO 2: Untold isn't overly exciting: a nameless youth -- who mysteriously gains the power to go into Beast Mode during combat -- and his motley crew of explorers must escort a princess through a sacred ruin to perform a sacred ritual. Along the way they learn the ruins' secrets and the reason behind the hero's transformation, and eventually must (surprise!) save the world from impending doom. Its not the greatest tale ever told, but I really enjoy the camaraderie between friends thanks to Atlus clever localization and quality performances from the English voice cast. That was enough to keep me going for the more than 40 hours of this adventure. The story modes may be a little different, but Etrian Odysseys celebrated dungeon exploration is the same, and Im happy to report theres a lot of it. Most everything you do is connected to the Labyrinth: a sky-scraping, multi-tiered tower filled with man-eating moas, creepy fishmen, and heaps of treasure that is fun to explore. If you play in Story mode youll also have the chance to search the Ginnungagap ruin, though I find its monochromatic corridors and Halloween-themed monsters (giant spiders, pumpkin heads, etc.) make it a bit bland. In contrast, I enjoyed charting my progress through the lush autumn leaves and frozen tundras of the Labyrinth, using the map on the bottom of my 3DS screen to note every poisoned floor tile and hidden Snow Bloom I came across. (You can use automapping, but I feel like it detracts from the experience.) Enemies and dungeon floors have been completely revamped in 3D, which along with crisper visuals, help keep Fafnir Knight from looking old and tired. Speaking of enemies, combat is decidedly brutal. I like how even in easy mode I couldnt just headbutt my way through monster encounters, especially when it came to skull-smashing Field on Enemies (visible boss types that stalk dungeon floors). Instead, I used drawbridges, thorny vines, and floor traps to maneuver around Fire Drakes and Attack Cactus. Finding solutions to these walking obstacles is enormously satisfying. Even still, my team of five would occasionally run head-on into a Terrible Hunter, and an intense turn-based smackdown would ensue. The turn-based battle system is standard but entertaining RPG fare, with characters using a combination of weapons, magic, and overdrive mode (known as Force) to take down baddies. The thing I like the most though is being able to use Grimoire Stones -- items that boost character stats when worn (always a plus when up against curbstomping FOEs). Stones like Aegis, which can help a character withstand a mortal blow, helped me survive more than one knee-knocking encounter. I also appreciate the super-effective Fafnir class, which allows your Story Mode protagonist to turn into a powerful entity and pummel enemies. Out of combat, the hubtown of High Lagaard holds a couple of nifty things to do among more mundane activities like buying equipment at the item shop or accepting sidequests at the local watering hole. The first is visiting a cafe where you can store and trade Grimoire Stones, trade guild cards with friends via Street Pass, and create stat-enhancing meals like Forest Paella and Yggdrasil Sprout Tea, which always felt like time well-spent when I returned to combat and felt the benefits. The second is town development, which allows you to invest in High Lagaard and sell home-cooked dishes to the increasingly hungry population, which proved a good way to earn extra cash. Neither cooking nor town devlopment are particularly innovative features, but they do help break up the monotony of fight/sleep/explore/repeat that can sometimes cause Etrian Odyssey games to become monotonous. Pros Clever dungeon explorationChallenging enemiesGrimoire Stones Cons Bland new dungeonLess than exciting story Etrian Odyssey is a meaty adventure with dozens of dungeon floors and bone-crushing challenges to overcome with its competent turn-based combat. The story isnt perfect, but I was happily kept busy with exploring the world, battling bosses, and feeding the hungry citizens of my hubtown.", "date": "Aug. 9, 2015,"}
