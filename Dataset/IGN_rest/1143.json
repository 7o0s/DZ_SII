Companies like Twitch and uStream have grown from relative obscurity into goldmines, propelling professional gamers into the spotlight. Even next-generation consoles tout streaming with just a few clicks, so that anyone whos good at a game can proudly show off their skills to the world. To supplement this, there have been a number of hardware devices that have entered the market to help gamers who would like to record videogame footage and stream it to their fans. One such device Ill be looking at today is the very compact Elgato Game Capture HD. Build Quality & Design Its easy to be slightly unimpressed when you first look at the Game Capture HD. After all, its about the size of a portable hard drive, and has a few connectors on it. But dont let its innocent looks fool you  the Game Capture HD is a fully fledged capture device, capable of capturing footage from almost any video game console or HDMI source. What makes the Game Capture HD great is that its portable  thin enough to slip into your bag along with your console or laptop, ready to capture footage as and when you need it. The device has an HDMI In and an HDMI Out, as well as a separate connector and supporting cables to connect a PS3. Powering the Game Capture HD is a single USB cable, which ups the Game Capture HDs portability factor even more. You get all the necessary cables to get up and running, and you download the accompanying software from the companys website. Setup & Connectivity Setting up the Game Capture HD was just a matter of downloading and installing the required software, and then plugging the device into a free USB port on my laptop. You can then either plug in a HDMI-compatible source such as an Xbox 360 or a PC, or use the special connecting cables if youd like to connect a PS3. Once youve got your source connected and powered on, you simply start up the Game Capture HD software and within seconds youll see your video source in the software. Everything is very simple to use, and theres little to no chance of connecting something incorrectly. Software & Capture quality The Game Capture HD software is fairly comprehensive  you can adjust a games audio, add live commentary, or even stream the source live to one of four available methods. When youre ready to go, you simply hit the red record button at the bottom, and the software takes care of everything else. You can adjust various settings such as the quality of the resulting video, audio sources, and even frame rate, ensuring that the captured video is as smooth as possible. I recorded a few clips from The Elder Scrolls Online (viewable here), which was running at approximately 63fps on my PC. The recorded video was in full HD, and butter-smooth. There was no lag or any drop in quality, which was superb. Of course, the file size of the captured footage is no joke  one hour of full HD recording will weigh in at about 3.72GB. Still, the software can automatically divide up the video into manageable 4GB chunks automatically, so you dont have to manually stop and start recording each time. Pros Easy to setupGood capture softwarePortable and lightweight The Game Capture HD is a great and portable solution for anyone whos looking to record or stream videogame footage. Perfect capture quality and the ability to livestream a game from the software itself are features that any enthusiast will appreciate.
