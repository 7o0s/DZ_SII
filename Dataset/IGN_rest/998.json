Maybe it was because they included a stylus, or that the manufacturer used the big screen to try out new software features, or maybe it was because Samsung took the idea of a huge phone more seriously than others. Regardless of the cause, it's clear that the Note line has affected nearly every major smartphone manufacturereven its biggest competitor, a company that had never sold a phone with a screen larger than 4 inches until about a month ago. But just because the Note has been popular in the past doesn't mean that Samsung can lay back and enjoy continued success while the competition gets more and more crowded. Between the LG G3, Nokia's Lumia 1520, and the iPhone 6 Plus, there are plenty of quality big phones to choose from, but with the brand-new Galaxy Note 4, Samsung has once again shown why its phablet line has not only stood the test of time, but why it has influenced an entire industry. As expected, the new Note boasts top-of-the-line specs. With its 1440p display, 2.7Ghz quad-core processor, 3GB of RAM, and 16-megapixel camera, you'll find only a few other phones as well-equipped. It retains the same 5.7-inch screen size as its predecessor, with its resolution upgrade from the Note 3's 1080p display being the biggest difference. Like with LG's latest flagship, the high-res screen of the Note is completely overkill, and it's possible that the phone could have benefited from a more common resolution. The Super AMOLED display does look fantastic at this size, though, so it's hard to complain about all the additional pixels. The new Note is slightly thinner than last year's model, although is a bit tallerbut compared to the iPhone 6 Plus, the Note 4 is actually shorter, despite Apple's phone having a smaller 5.5-inch display. The faux-leather backing has made a return, but thankfully the fake stitching has been removed. The material still works great for a phone this size, since it provides some grip while also adding a nice look and feel to the device. The Note 4 has also done away with the cheap, plastic frame found on the Note 3 and this year's Galaxy S5; instead, the company has chosen a metal frame like the one wrapped around the premium Galaxy Alpha. The new band really makes a difference, toonot just for functionality and rigidity, but it also gives off the vibe that this is a high-end device. That's not an association typically made with Samsung's mobile products. Along with the leather case, the rear side of the phone is home to an upgraded camera with optical image stabilization. The Note 3's 13-megapixel shooter was fantastic at the time, and the new 16-megapixel version is just as great. Whether dealing with action shots, low-light photos, or landscape pictures, the Note 4 captures images with great clarity, color, and speed. There are plenty of shooting options for both still images and video, including slow-motion video capture and live HDR preview for standard photos. Beneath the camera is a sensor that can be used to track your heart rate and oxygen saturation by scanning your fingertip. Both seemed to work well and provided consistent results, and add to Samsung's increasingly robust S Health software. The phone can also be used to help manage your activity with its built-in pedometer; you can manually input other information like your diet; and you can track your sleep habits when the handset is connected to a compatible wearable. Fitness-related features are becoming more prominent in the mobile space, and the new Note keeps pace by offering more than a few ways to keep up with your health. Borrowing from the Galaxy S5, the Note 4 also includes a fingerprint scanner that is built into the display. Unfortunately, using this as a method to unlock the phone was incredibly inconsistent. More often than not, it would take at least three attempts to successfully unlock the phone, and I eventually switched to less frustrating method of security. Once past the lock screen, the Note 4 presents users with Android 4.4.4 Kit Kat combined with Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It certainly isn't the most attractive manufacturer skin, but it works. The company is known for completely flooding its phones with extra software features, but in the case of the Note, some are incredibly useful and highlight the larger form factor (which is more than I can say about the ridiculous amount of AT&T bloatware found on our review unit, but I digress). While it's tough for big phones to attract people with smaller hands, the Note fortunately offers a ton of options to simplify use and I commonly used a few to make everything easier. The option I most often relied on created a smaller screen size by a simple swipe in-and-out from the side of the display. This decreased the viewable area, and the new windowed UI can be moved around the screen or made smaller or larger for easy one-hand use. This method also created on-screen navigation buttons so that I wouldn't have to reach all the way to the bottom of the phone to move around the OS. There is also an option to add navigation buttons to the right side of screen, which makes two-handed use less troublesome by placing the buttons right next to your palms and where you thumbs are naturally located. Other standard Samsung features, like split-screen and windowed apps and the option to move the keyboard to one side of the display, are also available if you'd like to use them. Samsung's S Pen brings with it some intuitive tools as well, especially the quick-launching Air Command; particularly impressive is the ability of the S Pen's software to convert chicken scratch handwriting into legible text. With its RAM and high-powered Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, the Note breezed through most of the operating system with no problems, although there were a few areas where I regularly noticed performance hiccups. Scrolling in Chrome was choppy, which may actually be an issue with the app itself, and I also noticed delays when opening and using the phone's recent app list. Playing games was not a problem, despite the high-resolution screen, with both XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Asphalt 8: Airborne running smoothly on the device. In our benchmark tests, the Note 4 took the top spot using Geekbench 3 and AnTuTu X, besting the Galaxy S5, 2014's Motorola Moto X, and the HTC One (M8). Using Ice Storm Unlimited, the new Note trailed just behind the company's regular-sized flagship, but still beat out other top-tier Android devices, as well as the iPhone 6 Plus. Notes have long been known for having outstanding battery life, and the newest model and its removable 3,220 mAh battery meets expectations. Heavy users can make their way into the night, even when streaming a few television episdes and podcasts during the day. Moderate users should find themselves into the next day before having to hit the charger, and light users have absolutely nothing to worry about. If you'd really like to make the battery last, there are optional power saving modes available. In the case that you do need to add some juice, Samsung has ditched the wide USB 3.0 port for a standard micro-USB cable, but included Adaptive Fast Charge capabilities. The company claims that using the Note's included cable and wall unit can charge the battery from 0 percent to 50 percent in about half an hour, and real-world results were similar. Pros High-quality, premium build.Long-lasting battery.Fantastic camera.Lots of software that highlights the big screen. Cons Inconsistent fingerprint scanner.Occasional performance hiccup. The Galaxy Note 4 demonstrates exactly why large phones should exist. Its high-resolution display makes it easy to enjoy all types of content, and the numerous single- and two-hand navigation options make the phone surprisingly versatile. And thankfully, Samsung heightened the build-quality this time around, making you forget about the cheap, plastic phones that the company is notoriously known for producing.<br/><br/> From its fantastic camera and great battery life to its premium materials and stylus implementation, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the complete package.", "date": "Oct. 16, 2014,"}
