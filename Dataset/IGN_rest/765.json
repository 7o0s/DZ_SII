It doesnt fix Destinys story woes or its stingy loot system, but it does introduce new, sensible gear upgrade paths, a fun new campaign with a few surprises, and rewarding endgame activities, as long as you have an established group of friends to run them with. House of Wolves feels insistent to get players to the new level cap quickly. New legendary gear drops at a high light level so players dont have to spend too long chasing Bounties and experience points to level up. Weapons still require some investment, but not nearly as much as they did before. Unfortunately, this approach only applies to the new House of Wolves exclusive gear, and Destinys loot system still feels as miserly as it did before. Given the effort a weekly Nightfall Strike requires, the chance that it could gift you with 10 Strange Coins feels like a paltry reward. A welcome in-game drop, called Etheric Light, does allow you to ascend previously acquired gear to the new damage threshold, but in typical Destiny fashion, it seldom drops in PvE. Speaking of PvE, the short five mission campaign is fun while it lasts, sporting well-designed encounters that add some fresh gameplay twists. For instance, the new Heavy Pike sets the campaign off with a blast - its side-mounted mine launchers are invaluable when taking on a Spider Tank head-on while hordes of enemies dog your flanks. The new Strike, The Shadow Thief, is arguable HoWs crown jewel, with a novel boss battle that ends up stretching out over the better part of an entire map. Still, outside of livelier performances by characters Petra Venj and Variks, theres not a lot of plot here, so dont expect any storytelling miracles. The other piece of House of Wolves PvE is Prison of Elders, a fun wave-based activity that suffers slightly from lack of objective variety. For instance, theres not a big difference between shooting mines and standing over them to disarm them. The higher level bosses at levels 33 and 34 spice things up considerably though. One forces your team to stay off the ground for a period of time while he burns the stage with rage, demanding strong communication and teamwork. Its not as impressive as a new raid, which House of Wolves notably lacks, but its unique enough to stand on its own merits. The bigger blow though, is that the gear rewards seem insubstantial compared to the gear obtained from PvP. Expert PvP players have a lot to look forward to in House of Wolves though, thanks to Trials of Osiris, a hardcore 3v3 elimination mode that rewards top performers handsomely with great gear and weapons. A scorecard tracks your teams record, and at three losses, youre forced to cash out. Within a round, you cant respawn on your own, so if you go down, youre completely reliant on your teammates to get you up and fighting again, a fact your opponents will use against you. Its tense, tactical, and the generous rewards for a perfect 9-0 run make it feel totally worthwhile. Pros The Shadow Thief StrikeFair upgrade systemMission design Cons Weak storyStingy loot House of Wolves wisely eliminates the worst parts of The Dark Below by offering a faster method to level gear, a better campaign, and varied endgame activities, assuming you have a regular crew to partake of them with. If you dont, expect to get a lot less out of this expansion, but overall, its still a step in the right direction for Destiny.", "date": "May 31, 2015,"}
