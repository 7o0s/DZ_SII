The immersion can be a little too intense for some, but Rigs still manages to use VR in a smart way - making aiming and movement in its multi-tiered maps feel fluid. Ultimately, it successfully made me feel like a superstar cyber athlete even though I was sitting on the couch the whole time. But if you want to play competitively in online matches against other humans, the slow matchmaking and long load times might erode your interest. Simple controls make Rigs easy to pick up and play. The Dualshock handles most of the mechs movements and is a comfortable way for FPS veterans to jump, strafe, and start shooting their way through skirmishes. The only major adjustment you have to come to terms with is the PlayStation VR headset, which defaults to using your head like a right analog stick for looking and aiming. Rigs gives you the option to switch, and I preferred turning using the right stick since using my head to control the direction I was moving didnt feel natural at first. Even with the modified setup, I often felt the edges of the cockpit UI were in my way when I lined up some of my shots. Rigs forces you to watch a lengthy, rather boring tutorial, but its a half-decent way to ease you into moving around in virtual reality. However, be warned: this is an action-heavy first-person shooter-style game, and if you have a history of getting motion sickness it can make you very ill. Even with lots of individual VR comfort settings enabled, like one that focuses your vision into a narrow view or others that mask stomach-churning transitions (not kidding!) I found myself feeling queasy if I played for more than 10 minutes at a time. Rigs has some lengthy load times and even longer matchmaking waits Assuming you have a sturdy stomach though, theres plenty of fun to be had despite the thin set of match options. You can choose between basic team deathmatch, Endzone (which is basically football with mechs and guns), and Power Slam, which is a hybrid of mech combat and basketball where you have to accumulate energy to hit an overdrive state and then survive long enough to jump through a special ring to score. I found myself favoring team deathmatch because of its simplicity, but the other two modes are equally satisfying, despite the repetitive and often nonsensical commentary coming from its play-by-play announcers. Some of my favorite moments came from close comebacks and high-drama finishes, like the time where I scored a tie-breaker goal after dominating two opponents with mere seconds left on the game clock. Events like this stay with you long after you take off the headset. Online matches perform well, but Rigs has some lengthy load times and even longer matchmaking waits as it searches for suitable opponents. This can lead to a lot of downtime with nothing to do and a VR headset strapped to your face. You can host your own matches, which eliminates the wait if you have friends to join you, but custom games sadly dont provide a lot of options to choose from. Single and multiplayer both unfold through a season of scheduled sport events, as you try to win games and build a following of big name sponsors and ravenous fans. Its an apt format for Rigs that benefits greatly from its first person presentation since you feel like the superstar at the center of it all. Completing challenges rewards you with standard run-of-the-mill currency to buy new mechs, which helped keep me playing. Theres a decent amount of variety in these battlebots, and I enjoyed experimenting with and buying more advanced Rigs. Each of the four mech classes has a unique feel on the playing field along with unique stats that make them more resistant to damage or faster in combat. As you clear requirements to unlock more Rigs to use, you can start to sample their unique abilities, like the Mirages double jump, or the Tempests hover. Each mech can quickly switch into one of three power modes by using the face buttons on the controller: one built for powerful shots, another built to quickly get you around the map, and one that can repair your battle damaged bot. Combined with four maps full of multiple elevation points for vertical combat, lots of cover, and neat pathways specifically made for smaller mechs to escape dominating foes, and you have a cool playground that feels different depending on the mech you bring in. Rigs does an impressive job of conveying a sense of scale and the mech sounds are cool, but the realistic art direction doesnt look great in VR. The arenas, characters, and rival mechs look blurry due to PSVRs resolution limitations (especially if you inspect them closely during pre-match cutscenes, which I couldnt help but do). The rough graphics only look worse due to some stiff mech and character animations. I couldnt help but find myself constantly distracted by these flaws, which left me wishing this world just looked better. Rigs: Mechanized Combat League brings fast, intense multiplayer action to the PlayStation VR, but with a few notable caveats. While there was enough variety in the mechs to keep me playing through a full season of matches, the sub-par visuals distract, and big matchmaking issues made online wait times unbearable. Its fun to play with friends, but try to take it for a spin before committing, if only to make sure your stomach can actually handle it.", "date": "Oct. 26, 2016,"}
