The core Pokmon games have been taking the world by storm for more than a decade now with their addictive, turn-based mechanics and hyper cuddly/collectible monsters. Nobunagas Ambition, on the other hand, is a more obscure strategy RPG series - one that draws inspiration from the Sengoku period of feudal Japan, and focuses on broad, sweeping themes like war and conquest. The two concepts couldnt be more disparate, even contradictory - and to throw them together seemed to portend an abomination in the making. And yet its not an abomination - far from it, in fact. Thanks to some brilliant execution (and teamwork) by developers Tecmo Koei and the Pokmon Company, Pokmon Conquest not only works, its possibly the most cohesive, fully realized spinoff in Pokmon history. The premise is simple  in the land of Ransei, warriors and warlords share the unique ability to communicate with Pokmon. The people believe that if one warrior is able to conquer the 17 kingdoms that comprise Ransei, the legendary Pokmon that created the region will awaken. Naturally, the nature of the person who does the conquering will affect whether this awakening results in the unification or destruction of Ransei. Its up to you and your ever-growing army of warriors and monsters to overthrow all 17 kingdoms before the ambitious and ruthless Nobunaga can beat you to it. Its a clever, straightforward premise that sets up a whole new, fantastical world  one that draws inspiration from both franchises while paving its own way as a separate and unique experience. Its a world crafted to aptly house both pocket monsters and some delightful caricatures of Japanese historical figures, the basis of a new canon that remarkably manages to feel on par with the core Pokmon entries. In fact, the world of Conquest feels so fleshed out, so fully realized, its hard to believe it was created from the ground up for this singular, experimental experience. Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition. Who knew? The simplicity of the story acts as a brilliant backdrop for the surprisingly deep combat Conquest offers. The basic gameplay unfolds something like similar strategy JRPGS such as Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics Advance - but extra touches (which Ill get into momentarily) make the whole experience feel fresh, despite the game sticking close to tradition. The pacing of the combat is much slower than a traditional Pokmon affair  a pace that strategy fans should be quite familiar with, one that recalls a long, satisfying game of chess. Its all about forward thinking, creative micro-management, and apt planning. You must think about who to take into battle and exactly how to use them. You must make the board work for you while trying to surmise your opponents strategies (and see that they dont interfere with your own). It further differs from the traditional Pokemon experience because you not only think about attacking and reacting, but also about positional strategies. Where your monster is on the board, if its within attack range of your opponents monsters, making sure its back isnt turned to enemies so it doesnt take extra damage - all are factors you must take into account to ensure success. Whether the goal of the match at hand is to defeat all enemies or claim all the banners, each is a thoughtful, slowly unfolding experience that effectively engages the mind and should give any strategy fan plenty to wrap the their brain around. The type strengths and weaknesses that all but define the Pokemon experience are also present in Conquest, and add a whole other layer to the already strategic encounters. Try to take a Psychic type Pokmon into the Ghost kingdom of Spectra and you likely wont like the results (youll probably get pwned, in other words). Whereas taking some Water monsters to a Fire-fueled battlefield is, naturally, a much better idea. To further elevate the experience, youre also battling against the stage itself. Each of Ranseis 17 kingdoms offers its own unique set of challenges (like falling meteors, boulders that can be rolled into opponents, trap doors to transport you elsewhere in the stage, jump pads, poison bogs, and so on). The kingdoms and the arenas housed within are quite varied and creative, affecting the battle just enough to keep you on your toes, but not enough to add an unfavorable level of randomness and prove a nuisance. 12", "date": "June 17, 2012,"}
