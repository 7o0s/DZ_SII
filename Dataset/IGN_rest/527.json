This is less a breezy lads tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when theyre all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake. What lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dogs leaner, more inventive predecessors. Smooth Criminal This level of polish and slickness permeates Uncharted 4. During traversal you can now reach for platforms by controlling Nate like a puppet with the DualShock thumbstick, which leads to fluid, unbroken climbing. A new 4x4 controls well over tricky terrain, and Uncharted 4s camera worships Nates grappling hook, lovingly zooming out as he swings off of cliff faces to bring home a magnificent vista. Steep gravel paths (a personal favourite) send Nate slipping across cliff faces like they were waterslides. Naughty Dog has expanded its terrain in order to make the most of these new tools. While I would have enjoyed more to do in this larger land mass - theres disappointingly little to reward exploration of its various nooks and crannies beyond the occasional sparkling bit of treasure and a great view - I appreciated that occasionally there was more than one pathway to reach my goal. For a series defined by linearity, even the suggestion of choice is refreshing. There are a couple of wonderfully choreographed action sequences. The same can be said for the stages of more violent action. While youre occasionally flung into the middle of a group of mercenaries with little to do but shoot your way out, other encounters take place on elaborate adventure playgrounds allowing for more stealthy play. I appreciated the option, even if this is fairly pedestrian and routine stealth gameplay in 2016: characters can be tagged for tracking, long grass is there for silent takedowns, and enemies linger on ledges begging to be grabbed by the ankle from below or kicked off from behind. Thats not to say its done poorly  its as polished as everything else in Uncharted 4  it simply doesnt do anything surprising or interesting. More, considering AI switches to a cautionary state at any sign of trouble, I was disappointed I couldnt move bodies. If youre noticed, Uncharted 4s bad guys will spring into action and distinguish themselves in combat. Open level design allows them to pull relatively intelligent moves like flanking, and theyll rarely forget youre there if you try to hide (while hanging off a ledge, for example, theyll stamp on your hands). Such credible behaviour means you have to keep moving in battle; crouching behind an indestructible pillar to regain your health is no longer feasible. While shooting in Uncharted 4 is satisfying if unremarkable, enemies are now savvy enough  and thankfully less spongy  that theres a genuine satisfaction born from each kill. Its fun, frantic stuff. Somehow, the visuals keep up with it all. Unlike past Uncharted games where very strict linearity allowed for very carefully orchestrated beauty between stretches of more utilitarian sections built for action, Uncharted 4 manages to be all gorgeous, all the time. The big vistas are predictably impressive, but its the little details that really astound: the way snow settles on Nates hair, the shocking green of an underwater plant, the reflection cast off of an oil painting. The regularity of such beauty borders on ridiculous: it may be capped at 30 frames per second, but this is the prettiest game Ive ever played. A Thief's End With such strong systems at its disposal, then, it's disappointing that Naughty Dog doesnt build more theatrical context around them. Regarding the series trademark outrageously choreographed action sequences, Uncharted 4s campaign suffers from a curious lack of imagination. There are bright spots: theres a brilliant car chase in Madagascar and a vertigo-inducing section involving clambering up a clock tower that really stand out. But otherwise the thrills here tend to be of a more predictable nature: lots of handholds breaking at the last minute, buildings coming down, an occasional easily solved puzzle in an opulent interior. Its 2016, and after three Uncharteds (and two contemporary Tomb Raiders) weve seen it all before. This becomes a big problem in Uncharted 4s third act, where the pacing slows down to a crawl. This jungle section is repetitive, and Nate and friends do little in it but climb and shoot, rinse and repeat. After a while, every encounter blurred into one amorphous amalgamation of shootouts, cliff faces, and pushing crates off of ledges for your companion to clamber up. As its the longest section in Uncharted 4, it eventually became a slog. Things pick up significantly by the end. The thoughtful exploration of these characters and their relationships with each other has a subtle payoff which bucks against the typical action coda, and its to Naughty Dogs credit that its unafraid to stay true to its characters and their motivations, even if they arent as explosive as one might expect. Uncharted 4's visuals astound. After The End Theres not much to do in the main campaign once youve finished it, bar completing your treasure collection, but theres extended life to be had in Uncharted 4s confident 5v5 and 4v4 multiplayer. Though its still a sideshow to the main campaign in scope, its four modes  Team Deathmatch, Plunder, Command, and Ranked Team Deathmatch  embody the series most enjoyable qualities: camaraderie (your teammates can be revived when in a downed state), sheets of bullets, and a constant sense of momentum. On the latter point, it helps that the stages for play have been opened up from previous games thanks to the grappling hook: zipping around to high vantagepoints to get the drop on enemies lends itself to a dizzying sense of verticality. Deathmatch is ranked, which lends competitive longevity and appropriate skill matchmaking to Uncharted 4s multiplayer, but Plunder and Command are the most fun. Command is a map-domination variant that places greater emphasis on teamwork by putting a target on the back of the strongest player in each team - the ,aptain. As you try and capture territories and hunt the enemys captain, you also have to protect against the opposing team trying to kill yours. Youve got to be even more alert than usual, even as youre pursuing an objective. Plunder works similarly to previous Uncharteds, where the goal is to carry an idol to a central point on the map before the other team reaches it with theirs. Slowly heaving an idol to your teammate across a giant ravine while being shot at on all sides makes for a hilarious contrast in pace. A sense of chaos is further encouraged by the outrageous abilities you can now harness in all of Uncharted 4s multiplayer modes. Spending earned points to temporarily wield supernatural powers like teleportation, which hurtles you across the map, and summon a sarcophagus that attacks the enemy with flying evil spirits can totally interrupt the rhythms of what would otherwise be a normal firefight. The AI sidekicks available for every player are a clever new addition, too. Instead of buying flashy powers, you can summon enormously handy AI-controlled helpers in battle. Theyre capable of fulfilling basic tasks like sniping, brute-force shooting, and healing  as well as giving your opponents something to shoot at that isnt your head. If youre up against them, theres a franticness born from trying to take them down while being attacked from all sides. It plays beautifully. Because it runs at 60fps, the shooting feels better than it does in the main campaign, and theres just as much fluidity to scaling walls and swinging, but now with a palpable smoothness. Naughty Dog does a great job at twisting familiar environments from the main campaign into interesting shapes across eight maps: soaring through the air against a boundless Mediterranean sea before leaping into the opulence of an Italian auction house  all the while shooting at other players  is exhilarating. These maps are well suited for shootouts, leaping, and magic powers. Wide open spaces peppered with lookout spots make for dramatic shootouts, winding corridors under heaving pirate ships are there for intimate encounters, and spots for the grappling hook are everywhere, meaning every game feels alive with motion. While its difficult to say what Uncharted 4s multiplayer will look like in the future, there are enough unlockables and perks to act as a carrot for completionists, and Naughty Dog has promised more maps, mysticals, and a co-op mode in the future that Ill be sticking around for. Pros Great storyStunning visualsSlick gameplayFun multiplayer Cons Bloated third act Uncharted 4: A Thiefs End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though its let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, its a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters weve known for nine years. A worthy thiefs end, indeed.", "date": "May 11, 2016,"}
