The script might be intriguing and the voice acting passable, the graphics detailed and the range of activities diverse, but it's a game that can never quite decide whether it wants to give us control or have us sit back and watch a story unfold. This internal struggle, as well as some technical ones, end up making gameplay frustrating and dull. Even more crucially, it undermines the character of Sherlock himself. Whether reading about his adventures, watching them on the big or small screen, or interacting directly with them through a game, the key to any presentation of Sherlock is that he should seem almost supernaturally powerful through his intelligence and deductions. He should always be the smartest person in the room, his mind should already have worked out what you're going to be thinking tomorrow, and he should never be stuck for a solution or next investigative step. This magical perspective of events surrounding and entangling him is at the core of his appeal. He's the suave, smart, sophisticate that we wish we were. Developer Frogwares is very adept at telling us that this is who Sherlock is, but it struggles enormously when it comes to putting us in his shoes. As I worked through the five self-contained cases of The Devils Daughter, each running roughly two hours, not once did I feel that swell pride in my chest that I typically associate with solving a puzzle or uncovering a mystery. Surely, this is a sensation you'd reasonably expect from a game that positions you as such a famous detective? You're blocked from figuring things out more quickly than the designers expected. The problem is derived from the rigidity of its design. Essentially, this is a point-and-click adventure in which you move from place to place, talk to bystanders, and interact with objects. Engaging in these tasks provides you clues, and it's those clues that lead to the solving of the mystery introduced at the start of each case. Which would be fine, except that theres a strictly enforced set of rules that blocks you from making speedy progression by actually being a detective and figuring things out more quickly than the designers expected. At points your reason for being in a certain place is obvious and you've found all that is useful to find, but youre not allowed to progress until you've clicked on some remaining item in the room. All too often this item represents a minor stepping stone to a realisation that Id already come to. There are far too many moments in which I couldn't have felt more constrained. As a result, interaction with The Devil's Daughter is epitomised more by scanning rooms for unclicked objects than it is by conjuring up clever theories that might blow a case wide open. Having to scan every photo in a room, for instance, or click on every footprint around a suspiciously altered statue are not tasks that are terribly entertaining or enlightening to begin with, and once you've already come to an understanding of the situation in your mind theyre a chore. Despite playing a character known for momentous creativity and an ability to think outside the box, there are far too many moments in which I couldn't have felt more constrained. Diversity of action is attempted by incorporating various one-off minigame events. These range from an early stealth sequence in which you must stalk a person of interest through the streets of London, to cracking a safe, to playing a game of lawn bowls. While the variety is undoubtedly impressive, these tasks are fleeting in nature. Events come and go, never to be seen a second time. Before you have a chance to properly engage with their concepts and take pride in mastery of them they're removed and you're on to the next thing. Yes, they serve a purpose in breaking up the pointing and clicking, but their transience means all they ever are is a distraction. They matter so little youre allowed to skip them entirely if you want. The best moments give you the freedom to interpret mystical happenings as you wish. Before you get to those disappointments, The Devils Daughter lays some good groundwork. The initial setup for each case is interesting and often provocative, with some doing an excellent job of hinting at the existence of paranormal elements. The best moments are those during which you're given the freedom to interpret these mystical happenings as you wish, without it ever explicitly correcting you if you decide that there's something happening that's beyond our human comprehension. The acting, too, with one or two exceptions, gets a passing grade thanks to the cast managing to resist the urge to make every character sound as though they've been plucked out of an overly enthusiastic and clichd rendition of Oliver Twist. Certainly, there are more than a few games featuring English characters in which everybody speaks using slang and tone not witnessed since 1830s London. Voice work is accompanied by remarkably detailed visual presentation, particularly in interior locations. Rooms are densely packed with interesting items that don't necessarily relate directly to your investigations; Sherlocks apartment, for example, is crammed full of mementos, books, and clutter that work to inform his personality. These help tempt you into thinking that this is a world that could exist with or without your presence and, as such, its the environmental design more than any of the available interactions that evokes the sensation of this being a story that belongs within the world of Sherlock Holmes. Just when you're enjoying the view, though, technical problems raise their head and bring the positivity crashing down. Animations are frequently awkward and noticeably jerky, and the consistency at which you get temporarily stuck on corners of scenery is inexcusable within a game that asks you to so deliberately move around the world and absorb it. The loading times are, to say the least, lengthy. Then there are the loading times, which, to say the least, are lengthy. These are particularly irritating when you're asked to visit a location for only the briefest of moments in order to pick up an item or change clothes. Without exaggeration, the loading screens that bookend these swift trips can take up twice as much time as your actions themselves. Getting stuck on technicalities, rather than feeling as though you're playing Sherlock, sums up the majority of The Devil's Daughter. Pros Detailed, evocative visualsIntriguing storylines Cons Rigid, restrained investigationsUnderdeveloped action sequencesUnacceptable load times Despite some engaging storylines and well-designed environments, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter fails to deliver any sense of actually playing the part of Sherlock. Its gameplay is too rigid and predictable, and at times comes across as too technically underdeveloped to ever wow or amaze. If anything, this stands as proof as to just how difficult it is to deliver a story whilst also making us feel as though were in control of our own destinies. If The Devil's Daughter were presented as a visual novel, however, there wouldve been little to complain about.", "date": "June 21, 2016,"}
