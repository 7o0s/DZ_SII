As I played through the prologue, throwing Caps shield and listening to Deadpool and Wolverine bicker, I was filled with glee at how good everyone looked up close and personal. Unfortunately, after the starting excitement wore off this superhero-powered co-op horde mode game quickly became repetitive due to the very similar feel of the heroes, bosses, and maps. The training level has heroes interacting with each other and a hint of a story, but these aspects are not parts of the main game. Instead, a team of four heroes defends relays, finds power cells around the map, and fights bosses. My favorite part of a round is the first part, the relay defense, because its where you can just try out all of your superpowers on a whole bunch of small enemies like robots or Hydra soldiers, and that feels great. The animations are cool, creating combos is fun, and its immensely satisfying to sling webs as Spider-Man and smash into enemies as the Hulk. My personal favorite character to play is Iceman because he sets the whole team up for success and he is an underrated character in general. He can freeze tons of enemies, leaving them open to finishers from his teammates, and looking down to see your icy blue arms is just the right amount of jarring. Bosses can all be fought with an identical strategy.Every now and then a boss will pop up that you have to deal with, but theyre not that exciting because whether its Magneto or Madame Hydra, they all fight using the same pattern. They go up to heroes one by one, throw projectiles, and do a big AOE attack until you whittle down their health. Thus, bosses can all be fought with an identical strategy of kiting them and using ranged weapons. I found myself trying to get boss fights over with as quickly as I could so that I could get back to wrecking the horde with my sweet powers. Also, you cant pick up Loki and smash him into the ground as the Hulk like the puny god he is. Ill say this in the bosses favor, though: they definitely startle me and keep me on my toes. I played a round as Rocket, who is adorably small and makes the enemies look huge, and when Venom popped up behind me I was genuinely terrified. The weakest part of a round is the final stage, in which your team has to collect eight power cells scattered throughout the map to power up a generator. Someone has to run around and pick up the cells, and you often have to go to areas with no enemies to get them. This means that whoever bites the bullet to go after the cells isnt using their cool superhero powers, theyre just moving around as fast as they can using the left stick to freely walk or whatever power their character has. (That can make you slightly nauseous if youre more of a teleportation kind of VR person.) Note that if youre playing solo with AI teammates, congratulations: you have to go get all eight cells yourself because the AI wont pick up any of them. Your rewards for completing these rounds are loot boxes with character skins and cosmic cube shards. After some grinding the shards eventually unlock an underwhelming Thanos boss battle. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions  this is just here to keep you from grabbing the items you really want as quickly as possible so youll play a little longer. You can pick these rewards up in the central hub, a place where you can do the most important things in all of Marvel Powers United VR: pet a dog and gaze lovingly upon baby Groot. Its a pleasant place to mess around in while youre waiting on matchmaking, and its filled with Marvel Easter eggs. All of the 18 playable heroes have voice lines that do a good job of capturing the spirit of their characters. Hawkeye pokes fun at his lack of superpowers and Iceman makes ice-based puns. Its charming, but I wish the heroes would interact with each other during the match to make this feel like the epic crossover it should be. If Gamora proclaims that shes better than Star-Lord in a match where Star-Lord is present, it feels out of character for him not to quip back. Theres some differentiation between the abilities of the characters, but not as much as an 18-character roster would have you believe. While Hawkeyes arrows and Hulks fists are one of a kind, there are 6 characters whose main skills are hovering and some type of magic blast, many of which have similar effects. Captain Marvel uses energy beams to attack her enemies and Doctor Strange uses mystic powers, but their mechanics are nearly identical. The maps dont change anything about the rounds other than the backdrop of where youre playing, either. Theyre all beautiful. The icey backdrop of Jotunheim or the urban setting of Knowhere are gorgeous places to fight some robots, but picking a different map doesnt add any variety to the gameplay. Marvel Powers United VR is at its best when you're playing with friends in true team-up fashion.Luckily, multiplayer prevents Marvel Powers United from becoming outright boring. You can play single-player with bots, but like Left 4 Dead or Gears of Wars horde mode, its clearly not a game meant to be played with AI teammates. Besides the fact that bots just arent that competent, Marvel Powers United VR is at its best when youre playing with friends in true team-up fashion, watching Black Panther dab, and setting up awesome combos between heroes. You can fill in the banter that is missing between your characters and divide the less desirable tasks equitably. And when its just you and the AI you stand at the rounds end screen sad and alone. With real teammates, your end screen will probably feature the Hulk trying to glitch into the floor. What ends up really killing the mood is the lack of challenge. Enemies supposedly scale in difficulty based on your performance, but it didnt seem to keep up with me. I never failed a mission, and so I was never forced to adapt and discover new strategies. Marvel Powers United VR makes me feel like a superhero, but fails to give exciting or varied enough missions to put my skills to the test. While the characters and environment successfully showcase the personality of Earths mightiest heroes, repetitive gameplay and lackluster rewards stop Powers United short of being marvelous.", "date": "July 31, 2018,"}
