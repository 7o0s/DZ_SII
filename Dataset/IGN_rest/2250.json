There will be three Super GPUs; the RTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 Super, with the two lower-end models available on July 9th, and the 2080 Super arriving July 23rd. As far as these three graphics cards go, the RTX 2070 Super could be in the sweet spot because at $499 it's $200 less expensive than the RTX 2080 Super, and just $100 more than the RTX 2060 Super. It's unknown if there will be a 2080 Ti Super, but we can certainly hope. The RTX 2070 Super is an upgraded version of the RTX 2070 that maintains the previous GPU's launch price, so overall it's a pretty good deal since the RTX 2060 Super comes with a $50 price bump. Also at $500, it's less than half the price of a 2080 Ti, since those go for $1,200 or so online. It will be going head-to-head in the near future with AMD's upcoming RX 5700 XT, which is priced at $449 but has similar specs to the original RTX 2070. If you were hoping that information is in this review, sadly it is not, so please be patient. So what's so super about it? Nvidia claims the changes made to the card allow it to surpass the legendary GTX 1080 Ti. Also note that there will be 2070 Super cards from Nvidia's partners as well as this one, made by Nvidia. The company is also offering copies of Control and Wolfenstein: Youngblood for a limited time to people who buy a Super GPU, starting on July 9th. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super  Design and Features Though Nvidia performed open heart surgery on the RTX 2060 Super and gave it a serious upgrade, the changes to the 2070 Super are a bit less dramatic. The CUDA core count has been bumped up by 11-percent, and there are 27-percent more texture units too, which is a decent improvement. Ray tracing performance has improved as well, with the card now able to produce one more ~Gigaray~ than the previous model, edging it ever closer to the RTX 2080's on-paper performance. Otherwise, the memory subsystem has been left untouched, so there's still 8GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit wide bus, allowing for 448GB/s of memory bandwidth. The spec sheet makes all this a bit easier to digest: Clearly, AMD was directly targeting the RTX 2070 with its upcoming Navi GPU, the RX 5700 XT. Who could have guessed that Nvidia would move the goal posts before Team Red could take its shot? Regardless, they did, so it'll be interesting to see if AMD's latest matches up to this new Super GPU. The 2070 Super is similar to the previous version, which is now End of Life, there's not a whole lot to discuss aside from the modest spec bump. The card is exactly the same physically aside from a shiny new coat of metal on its midsection, and it has the same backplate and overall design as before. It still looks snazzy though, and for a $500 card, it looks and feels like it should be more expensive. Output options are plentiful, with three DisplayPort connectors, one HDMI, and a USB Type-C for VR stuff. Total power consumption has gone up a smidgen to 215w, and an eight-pin and six-pin PCIe connector are required now instead of a lone eight-pin like the previous model. The chip inside is a variant of the same one used on the RTX 2080, and it's a 12nm die that's about twice the size of the one in the upcoming Radeon card, so that's something to consider. AMD has the advantage of a 7nm chip, while Nvidia is still at 12nm, hence the disparity in size. This leads to the obvious question of what a bigger AMD chip will be like, and hopefully one day we will find out! Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super  Benchmarks and Overclocking To test the RTX 2070 Super it was wedged into the IGN test bench, which consists of an Asus Z270 Prime motherboard, Intel Core i7-770K CPU, 16GB of Corsair DDR4 memory, a SanDisk SSD, and an EVGA PSU. Since this is a high-end GPU, tests were performed at all three common resolutions, at maximum settings, with no anti-aliasing enabled. Similar cards are included in the benchmark chart, but again, we don't have the Radeon RX 5700 XT numbers yet  please be patient. As far as Nvidia's claim that this GPU is as powerful as a GTX 1080 Ti, that does appear to be true. In some cases it's much faster, and it even matched the more expensive RTX 2080 is some games as well, which is impressive at $500. Overall performance improvement compared to the previous card ranges depending on the game in question, but it's safe to peg it around 10 to 15 percent overall, which is pretty typical of a mid-generation refresh. The big changes won't come until Nvidia moved to a smaller 7nm node, where AMD is currently operating. Still, the changes Nvidia made to this GPU have allowed it to move up one rung in the product stack where it's essentially equivalent to the RTX 2080, which was always the equivalent of a GTX 1080 Ti, but with ray tracing and DLSS added as a bonus. That is a pretty sweet deal considering the RTX 2080s go for between $700 and $800 online. Compared to the 2080 the Super 2070 is a smoking deal. Still, this is not quite the best GPU for 4k gaming at maximum details, but it's really, really close. That honor still lies with the RTX 2080 Ti, and hopefully the 2080 Super will be added to the 4K/60 club soon as well. In terms of its ray tracing prowess, I was able to fire up Shadow of the Tomb Raider and watch the demo, though i wasn't able to get a final score. Based on my eyeball-based evaluation though, from watching the frame counter, the 2070 Super looks like it averaged somewhere in the low-to-mid 70s at 1080p with shadows set to Ultra. It dipped down into the 50 frames per second area in really intense scenes in the jungle, but since the 2060 Super can do 60fps at this setting it seems like 2070 Super is good for about 70fps. I also also able to run SOTR at 2560x1440 with shadows set to Ultra, and it hit about 40fps. For now though, the really interesting analysis hasn't even taken place because we don't know what AMD's $450 RX 5700 XT is capable of. Can it beat the RTX 2070 Super for less money? Stay tuned! Finally, as far as overclocking goes, the RTX 2070 Super managed to perform slightly better than previous Turing cards, hitting a stable clock of 2,050MHz at 75C. When I nudged it up to 2,065MHz I saw immediate artifacting, so this is the speed that this particular card was able to run without issues. It should be noted that Nvidia lists the maximum temperature for these GPUs at 89C, so you can see that even overclocked the cooler is more than adequate. Purchasing Guide The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super isn't available for purchase yet, as it goes on sale July 9th. Though we don't know how the 2070 Super fares against the upcoming RX 5700 XT, it's a great GPU regardless with excellent performance and very good acoustics and thermals.", "date": "July 3, 2019,"}
