Or the eagerness to devour myriad unidentified berries and mushrooms. Or the fact that I slurped gleefully from every stream I came across without boiling the water first. Or the wounds I incurred trying to kill a feral dog with a crowbar. Whatever the case, my first outing into the post-apocalypse of point-and-click RPG survival with NEO Scavenger left me very, very dead. But Ill be damned if the exciting mysteries Id started to uncover didnt have me anxious to roll a new character with some more botanical knowledge. To call the cartoonishly bleak, sprite-decked hex grid that stands in for the ruined Michigan countryside unforgiving would be a fatal understatement. Flung from a cryo-stasis pod with only a hospital gown and a roster of pre-selected skills like Tough, Medical Knowledge, and Tracking, I was forced to satisfy my avatars persistent needs for food, water, warmth, and sleep. Every skill I chose mattered, both in opening up new story paths and easing my day-to-day struggle against the forces of nature, which added welcome weightiness to my initial build choices. But unlike the Hardcore modes of similarly themed games like Metro: Last Light and Fallout: New Vegas, sheer survival was nearly always my primary concern, as opposed to combat or questing. Scavenging buildings and the open wilderness for essentials, carrying containers, warm clothes, and useful tools introduced me to further peril, like diseased cultists, werewolf-like Dogmen, and other folklore-inspired enemies. The turn-based combat is brutally realistic, in that everything has deadly consequences. Even minor scrapes earned in a scrap with a cowardly, drug-addled looter could become infected and end my lifepermanently, as NEO Scavenger has only one save file and no option to reload from an earlier state. A high-level character with night vision goggles and a sniper rifle need only sip from a stream without boiling the water, and he may well be dead of gastroenteritis in days. Disinfectants and bandages are just as valuable to a combat build as ammo and sharp objects. The interface also leaves something to be desired. Everything from looting to crafting to combat uses a drag-and-drop system in which items, skills, and actions are slotted into an outcome box to produce different results. It was naggingly counter-intuitive at first, and progressed to merely inoffensive by the end. I didnt even figure out how crafting was supposed to work until my third or fourth character, partially due to the skimpy tutorials and hints I was presented with. Pros Gritty survivalIntriguing storySkills matter Cons Very difficult to complete the storyClunky interface NEO Scavenger is a deep, exciting sandbox for discovery with some truly surprising and inspired moments of storytelling. Its detailed and gritty survival mechanics bring an edge of realism, but often serve as a daunting barrier to some of the best parts of the story. If the point were simply to survive, the issue would be less glaring. But as there is a well-crafted plot that was presumably meant to be experienced, the crushing difficultywhich can be fantastic in a survival is its own reward sort of waybecame a barrier even more frustrating than the unintuitive interface. Its a design that makes NEO Scavenger highly recommendable to hardcore survivalist gamers, but a big red flag for everyone else.", "date": "Dec. 23, 2014,"}
