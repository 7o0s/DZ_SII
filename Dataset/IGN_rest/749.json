With them, Payday 2 has only gotten deeper and more playable, though it hasnt gotten much better looking, and the bots that assist you when going solo are still useless. The beauty of Payday 2 is in how completely it assumes the identity its chosen for itself. Its totally a co-op crime-sim; not a cops-and-robbers-themed arena shooter, or a horde mode dressed up as a caper flick. Its mechanics are so deep, and its structure so foreign compared to standard shooters, it can seem overwhelming when civilians are running every which way, your thermal drill is jamming up on your target bank vault, and police sirens are getting louder and louder in your ears. But its that chaotic start that gives Payday 2 such a powerful sense of progression. Once my four-man crew and I had developed our skills and arsenals to the point where we could take out security, control crowds, and get into and out of a vault in minutes, I felt as if Id graduated from a band of clumsy thugs to a formidable crew of criminal masterminds. For more specifics on what made the original version so great, check out our 2013 PayDay 2 review. Payday 2: Crimewave Edition builds on these strengths in a number of significant ways. The inclusion of a fifth skill tree, focused on survivability and evasiveness, makes a number of new character builds possible, including a dodge-based one that makes you extremely tough to hit. A wealth of new weapons and mods are also included, and Payday 2s rich weapon attribute system allows all of them to differentiate themselves effectively. Whether you want an easily concealed silenced pistol or a bulky bullet-hose that scares civilians into submission with its throaty report, Crimewave Edition has a gun for you. Aside from an expanded armory and skill tree, theres also a bunch of quality-of-life and balance changes that have been made. Seemingly little things, such as being able to move hostages around or being able to hack into ATMs with an ECM jammer, make interactions that used to feel clunky easier to get use out of. Given how much has been fixed or fiddled with, its really too bad nothing has been done to address the state of AI teammates. Sure, Payday 2 is a multiplayer-focused game, but it provides a way to play solo with three bots  and if the option is there, it shouldnt be a bad way to play and practice. Sadly, it is. Bots still physically cannot interact with objectives of any kind, making many missions practically unplayable. Need to grab four bags of money from a vault and out into a van? Have fun running back and forth four times, since your AI teammates cant touch em. It just doesnt make any sense that in an objective-based game, the AI is physically incapable of playing said objectives. Its also odd that the PS4 and Xbox One versions are both locked at 30 frames per second. Payday 2 wasnt nearly on the bleeding edge of graphics tech when it originally came out on the old generation of consoles, and it definitely shows its age here, especially indoors where environments look flat and angular throughout. Its more aggressive lighting effects help pretty it up a bit compared to the old PS3 and Xbox 360 versions , but on the whole, theres nothing here to convince me that locking the framerate at 30 was a necessary sacrifice. That said, visual appeal was never the reason to play Payday 2; its tactical depth is. Crimewave Edition delivers here in a big way, both because of all the new skills and gear, and because of the addition of the pre-planning function for many missions, which allows you to call in favors and spend cash in exchange for camera access, support snipers, and a number of other mission-specific assistance that can help you mold the perfect caper. Its a useful, logical extra layer of depth for a game that already had plenty. That depth expresses itself most fully online when playing with three friends or strangers, though the Xbox One version is having some difficulty there. Getting into a match and maintaining a stable enough connection to see missions through to the end was too much to ask at times, where I didnt run into such issues on PS4. Overkill is aware of the situation, and has worked to rectify it, but in my experience, the PS4 version was the better online experience. Pros Tons of contentWell-executed conceptGreat character progression Cons Dated lookBots still useless Though it doesnt exactly put the added power of the PS4 and Xbox One to full use, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is the best-looking console version of Payday 2 you can get, and the best value on any platform for obtaining its wealth of downloadable content. Its mildly disappointing to see the framerate capped, and that bots are still in the same state after all this time, but Payday 2s deep mechanics and purity of vision still make it one of the best, yet most overlooked multiplayer games you can play today.", "date": "July 2, 2015,"}
