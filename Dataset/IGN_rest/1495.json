Its strategy was just as bafflingly deep, its oddball demon characters just as quirky, and its randomly generated item worlds just as bottomless. But that familiarity was perhaps its problem -- the 2008 PS3 game felt like the 2003 PS2 original. On the Vita, though, Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention does not have to compete with the grandeur of Metal Gear Solid 4, and can just be the best damned strategy game on the system. Disgaea 3 is like Final Fantasy Tactics' crazy uncle. Set in the Netherworld (the demon world), Disgaea games tell humorous tales of demons putting on a big evil show but eventually finding their moral compass. Absence of Detention is set in a demon school called the Evil Academy, where the bad kids are the honor students and the do-gooders are considered delinquents. Our antihero, Mao, is the son of the Overlord and sets out to overthrow his father because the behemoth accidentally stepped on Mao's game console, causing him to lose millions of hours of save data. Surely, we can all relate to this motivation. There are many likable characters and while the overall story arc is entertaining, its delivery is the cause of Disgaea 3's greatest weakness: it's way too talky. When you just want to get into a battle there may be dozens of talking head dialogue screens in the way, delivering mostly frivolous exposition. Sure, you can skip these scenes, but what does that say when you don't want to absorb the story? Otaku (fans of Japanese anime, manga, and video games) will be very glad to hear that a Japanese voice track is included, though. While story scenes drag on for too long, I love the anime art. If you are at all weak against Japanese turn-based strategy games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Ogre Battle, you'll become happily lost within Disgaea 3's seemingly endless dungeons. With a small army of your own design at your disposal, you assign actions one at a time with the simple goal of defeating all enemies on the grid. The environments themselves play big roles in battle, as ~geo blocks~ dot the horizon and attach statistical benefits or detriments to certain squares beneath characters' feet. For instance, if a geo block provides ~50% exp,~ any character standing on the affected area receives bonus experience points. These environmental effects are one of the features that make Disgaea cleverly unique and allow you to approach battles in creative ways. Do you try to position your forces on positive geo symbols? Throw enemies onto negative symbols? Try to destroy all the symbols for bonus loot and cash? All of this complexity will be a turnoff for some and a delight for others. The entertainment will last as long as you want it to, as every item in the game contains a randomly-generated world inside. This is where you go dungeon diving to level grind and power up items. If portable gaming is about keeping you busy during your commute/plane flight/hospital stay, all those waiting hours will disappear into Disgaea 3's item worlds. What's new for Disgaea 3 on Vita? All of the DLC that was released on PS3, which includes new characters for after the game is beaten and a side story following a main character named Raspberyl. Item Customization: Change the look of your favorite items. New Story Quests and Bosses: A couple bosses from Disgaea 4 make appearances here. Touch Controls: Use the touch screen and pad to navigate menus, rotate the camera, and zoom in/out. GPS Functionality: Earn extra experience points as you carry your Vita around. New Class-specific Skills Super Moves: Execute advanced moves when low on health. Data Shop: View your friends' stats and rankings via the PlayStation Network. New Magic Spells Disgaea 3 makes for a great Vita game. Once inside the bowels of an item world, you can only exit every 10 levels (unless you have a certain escape item). This could make for inconveniently long play sessions on the PS3, but here on Vita you can easily put the system in sleep mode and return to right where you left off when you're good and ready. Also, some people weren't impressed with the way the pixilated character sprites looked on their HDTVs when Disgaea 3 originally arrived on PS3. They look great here on the small screen, punctuated by very attractive anime art during story scenes. The sprites are particularly cute when acting out their hilariously exaggerated super moves during battle. Closing Comments Whether you're a strategy fan that hasn't been introduced to the delights of Disgaea or a series veteran that already played the third offering on the PS3, Disgaea 3 is highly recommended on Vita. The nature of the system makes for more forgiving ventures into the depths of the game's item worlds and the pixel art may be easier to forgive on the smaller screen. Platform aside, this was already an excellent turn-based strategy game that, although too heavy on frivolous exposition, can be explored and enjoyed from here to eternity.
