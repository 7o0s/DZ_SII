So thats it? The novelty of a VR Star Wars experience had worn off a while ago, and Vader Immortals threadbare mechanics had long since run out of steam, leaving only its mediocre plot. Maybe its partially because Im fresh off the far superior storytelling of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but to put it mildly, this finale was underwhelming. Virtually nothing new is introduced during Episode 3s 45 short minutes as Vader Immortals weirdly mystical, MacGuffin-based adventure resolves. If youre played Episodes 1 and 2, it goes pretty much exactly the way you probably expect. There was never anything even approaching a surprising development outside of its trite deus ex machina ending. And while Vader is as large and imposing a presence as ever, I couldnt help but think about how similar the climactic lightsaber battle it had all been building toward was to sparring with droids in the first episode. The most satisfying moment of using the Force is, once again, a very brief and simple puzzle in which you slot power crystals into sockets. It feels like the objects youre moving are partially guided toward the slot, but in a way that feels intuitive and smooth. Its a shame Vader Immortal didnt lean into this telekinesis further with some more interesting puzzles, because its disappointingly limited to that single scene. Episode 3 has precious little going for it.And so, Episode 3 has precious little going for it. Where Episode 2 has the exciting Goro-rancor encounter to spice things up, Episode 3 goes back to the basic, repetitive combat that slowed Episode 1 to a crawl. After a quick moment where you direct droids to fire at targets by pointing your lightsaber (the payoff of Episode 2s ending), you almost immediately relinquish control of them and go back to battling wave after tedious wave of Storm Troopers. First they chase your moving skiff on small flying platforms to fire slow-moving blaster bolts at you, then its pretty much the same thing except they run out onto catwalks to take their potshots. Time and time again, you deflect their shots back or simply grab the poor saps with the Force and throw or drop them. You can Force-pull their blasters away and use them to shoot others, but the shooting is weirdly sloppy and imprecise (not to mention uncivilized). You get to throw the odd thermal detonator, but thats about it in terms of combat variety. It doesnt help that almost every time you do, Maya Rudolphs ZOE3 recites a repetitive line about how you got those bucketheads. Once again, shes not given much to do. Theres also a single, simplistic miniboss battle that you beat with the same deflecting of blaster fire you use to defeat basic Storm Troopers. The only enemy who ever gets close enough to you to hit with your lightsaber is Vader himself. Beyond that, we get another iteration of the same lightsaber dojo survival challenge, which this time takes place in an outdoor area and integrates some Storm Troopers into the mix of enemy waves. There are a few new weapons and Force powers to use, and it does get fairly intense when enemies are all around you. Its definitely good that the dojo is here to give more life to Episode 3 than the story does, but at the same time its not terribly different from the previous episodes and is very much more of the same as a result. Vader Immortal Episode 3 finishes out the Star Wars VR series with a dull thud. If this werent a Star Wars game it would be pretty unremarkable  the decent lightsaber-on-lightsaber combat is barely used this time, and using Force powers and weirdly unsatisfying blasters to knock down an endless parade of Storm Troopers gets old very quickly.", "date": "Nov. 27, 2019,"}
