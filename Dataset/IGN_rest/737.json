What was last year's version like? What does the new one have? What are my other options right now? If F1 2015's PC version were free of context, it would simply be forgettable licensed racing game that I could recommend to fans of Formula 1 racing. But it's not. F1 2015 is the sixth installment of Codemasters' Formula 1 series, and unfortunately it is one of their most feature-poor and PC-unfriendly releases in years. Let's dig into some of that context, and talk about where I'm coming from with this review of the PC version. While the series is meant for everyone from casual racing fans to gearheads, I've always treated the PC versions as a place to drive a serious racing sim. It gets pretty nerdy: I've played every version using a TrackIR head-tracking device and a force-feedback wheel.And while there have been years when Codemasters improvements were too marginal to justify the cost of a new game, I've generally loved this series. I've also enjoyed playing it with an Xbox controller and treating it a little more casually when I don't feel like going full Walter Mitty with my racing fantasy life. Thats the great thing about previous editions of the F1 games: they all give you options. Career mode, all kinds of granular difficulty and realism settings  even vintage cars in F1 2013! By contrast, F1 2015 gives you only the choice between the 2014 and 2015 season, and the choice between playing playing either of those seasons with custom realism settings (Championship Season) or with full realism settings (Pro Season). Those are your two main game modes. Calling Pro Season a different game mode, when really it's just a bunch of difficulty presets, is a bit like when students try to fake out their teachers by slightly increasing the line spacing and margins on a writing assignment. All that could be forgiven if F1 2015 were a huge leap over previous editions. To be fair,there are some things that are markedly better in F1 2015 than they've ever been before. One of them is tire-wear. In F1 racing, you'll hear people talk about the ~performance cliff~ for racing tires. F1 2015 absolutely nails this. It happens suddenly, and often at the worst possible moment. I can feel the grip going away from the car a little bit as I get deeper into a stint, but there will come a moment when suddenly it's like I'm driving on ice. I'm braking, trying to turn, and the car just isn't responding anymore. Staying on top of the tire situation finally feels important. Likewise, wet-weather driving is better than it's been. It no longer feels like a simple modifier to your car's handling: ~Longer braking distance, more oversteer.~ No, on a wet track in F1 2015, you can feel the car slip and skid the way it would in real life. There's more lateral movement in turns, and theres a general feeling of instability that's challenging to handle. Fuel economy is another factor that's played a big role this season, and F1 2015 really brings that aspect of the strategy to life. Your engineer is constantly feeding you important information over the radio, and you have to be adjusting your driving on the fly to conserve your fuel load, which is an interesting layer of nuance to consider beyond simply going as fast as you can. On the other hand, what good is a better handling model when you can't really feel it? Not only do I generally find F1 2015 much simpler to drive than in previous years, with less demanding handling, but I don't feel like I'm as in touch with the road. Less feedback is translated back through the controller and speakers, so I just don't feel the same connection with the car. On a gamepad, F1 2015 feels kind of ~point-and-squirt~ compared to older versions: the car instantly goes where you tell it, then you stand on the gas until the next turn. The biggest driving challenge I've faced is the PC version's faulty controller calibration, which seems to change every time I play. Sometimes there's a faint pull to the left as I drive, other times there's a weird wobble around the 0 value on the X-axis, like the car simply won't hold a straight line. Sometimes the steering wheel is locked to the left and the gas and brake are both at maximum, making the care wholly undriveable. Only in F1 2015! And that's the real kiss of death for F1 2015 on PC. I'm not having a tenth the lock-ups and crashes that many, many people on the Steam forums are complaining about  with the exception of controller issues, its working just fine for me. It just happens to be a third-rate PC port of a second-rate racing game. It might be the only F1 game around, but PC gamers have way too many other options to tolerate this poor quality  F1 2010 through 2013, for a start. Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, and rFactor all offer plenty of open-wheel racing that could scratch that F1 itch, without all the limitations and drawbacks. Pros Great grip modeling Cons Lifeless graphicsFew game modesBad controller calibrationsDetached handling feedback F1 2015 is a lesser game than its predecessors, and pales in comparison to the current crop of PC racing games in nearly every way. To give it credit where its due, Im impressed by some of the driving modeling and the fuel management prompts, but those alone arent nearly enough to recommend F1 2015. <em>[Note: Our review of the console version of F1 2015 will be posted next week.]</em>", "date": "July 20, 2015,"}
