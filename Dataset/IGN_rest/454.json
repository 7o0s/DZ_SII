Over its four hours this happens far too often: to expose you to a storyline that has no stakes or stakeholders, to explore its colorful but empty world, or to fight painfully repetitive battles. Its hard to get invested when theres little to care about, and the gameplay never provides any of the addictive challenge it really needs. Valleys first-person, mech-suit-powered platforming gets its excitement from playing with momentum - running down a hill will pick up speed, letting you launch yourself across colossal gaps. Its a thrill that has you look at the world in a different way - there could be a hill you can speed your way down, just to be flung off of a jump at the very bottom, landing you safely on a platform that looked unreachable from the ground. In those fast-paced sequences, you feel a whole lot like a superhero, but sometimes Valleys own mechanics have a habit of ruining them. If youve built up speed and then you hit a corner, youre abruptly slowed down by the walls around you while you try to turn, no matter how hard you try to avoid them. Its like it cant keep up with its own speed. A few of those glorious jumps end in poorly thought out locations, too, abruptly ripping your speed from you by landing right in front of a rock that you couldnt have possibly seen and avoided from the sky. All of those gameplay moments take place in large but linear environments, though, and are unfortunately spaced apart by long sequences of walking through tight hallways in dull facilities, uncovering a story through the audio files of two long-dead characters who are dealing with a struggle thats very hard to care about, as well as some notes scattered around the world. The history of the area is breadcrumbed out for you slowly enough to be a little enticing, and it is full of curious mysteries with a solid foundation of lore, but considering youre the sole person in the valley there are absolutely no stakes. Everything and everyone youre learning about is already gone, and if you hadnt shown up the Valley wouldve remained untouched, so you dont have much to fight for. Valleys coolest idea, and a fairly intelligently addressed ethical issue in the story, actually kicks in when you die: every death makes the world around you shift and die a little, too, and that leaves a lasting sense of responsibility. Dying takes away from the Valleys overall health, since it was used to bring you back to life again, and if all of the trees die, you lose the ability to respawn. That would be a very clever way of representing a health bar if it didnt deplete by a seemingly random amount every time you die, making it difficult to read, and if Valley werent so pointlessly easy. There are very few challenges that are actually likely to kill you, and the energy pickups that power your suit (and represent your health and ammunition) are so plentiful that I actually had to try to die, just to see the outcome. My most common cause of death was mistaking water for a rock and jumping into it and drowning, which I feel pretty content blaming the art style for rather than a semblance of difficulty. I wished for more hazards, though, because as the trees around me died the interesting visual evolution teamed with the ability to replenish health by giving those trees your own energy is encouragement enough to explore the world, and as long as youre outdoors it is usually pretty. The trees are bright pink or bright orange, certain mushrooms in caves glow, and one specific area has the sky lit up by an Aurora Borealis - its varied and colorful, but feels unfortunately empty. There are a few collectibles but no characters and very little ambient life except for a few deer - how are we supposed to worry about a world dying if theres no life in it? There are some weak combat sequences that seem to be randomly dumped throughout the campaign, too, but theyre just as uninteresting. Theyre fought against two enemy types who attack in the exact same way and are dealt with in the exact same way: strafe to easily avoid their slow-moving attacks and shoot your own slow-moving attacks. If you see an enemy, firing off three quick shots will kill them before they even seem to notice that youre there, or you can just keep running and pretend you never encountered them at all, because theyre too slow to hit you - thats how little impact they have. Theres no variety outside of a single easy boss fight, and even that boss looks the same as Enemy Type Number Two. Every fight feels identical to the last, and the last wasnt fun to begin with. The one new mechanic thats introduced to mix things up is a hook that lets you attach to things that are roped between trees, but instead of letting you swing freely between them like Spider-Man, they control the direction you move in. You cant tell where its going to swing you before you attach, so youre forced to slow down and make note, rather than flying between them yourself. In moments of immense speed, Valleys basic first-person platforming creates some excitement. But those are just moments, and theyre spaced too far apart with empty environments and forgettable combat between them. There are some interesting ideas scattered throughout the world but theyre very hard to care about, since theres nobody around to be influenced by your actions. A seemingly pointless resource management system presents some interesting aesthetics, but overall, Valley very rarely presents the challenge or consequence it really needs to be addictive.", "date": "Aug. 24, 2016,"}
