Whether it's a gaming PC or gaming laptop, you can pick and choose the parts and pieces on the inside  and even customize the outside  to create your own personalized prebuilt gaming rig. The EON15-X is just one of the latest examples of this approach from Origin. With this build, you get the option of a desktop AMD processor and either an RTX 2060 Max-P or 2070 Max-P GPU. The end result is a desktop-class computer in a laptop chassis, and outside of a couple of issues, it's a dream to use. Specs There's a wide variety of configurations and builds you can purchase from Origin. On the low end, you're looking at a build priced around $1,700. If you really want to get crazy, you can put together a version of the EON15-X that will cost $4,312. I've been testing a build that walks the line down the middle. Here are the specifications of the Origin EON15-X I've been testing: Model: Origin EON15-X (NH57AF1) Display: 15.6-inch IPS 144Hz FHD (1,920 x 1,080) Processor: AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core 3.1GHz (4.3GHz Max Boost) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 8GB GDDR6 Max-P Memory: 16GB DDR4 2666MHz OS: Windows 10 Home Storage: 500GB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVME SSD, 1TB Seagate 2.5~ FireCuda HDD Webcam: 2MP webcam Ports: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4 via USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, 1 x HDMI, 1 x miniDispayPort 1.4, 1 x USB 2.0, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 2, 1 x microSD Card reader, 1 x 3.5mm audio combo, 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Connectivity: Intel Dual Band Wireless-Wi-Fi 6 AX200 + BT M.2 Dimensions: 14.2 x 10.1 x 1.2-inches (WxDxH) Weight: 5.9 pounds Price: $2,270 Design Despite all of the desktop talk and claims from Origin, the EON15-X isn't huge. Don't get me wrong, it's big, but it's nowhere near as big as the MSI GT75 Titan I reviewed previously. My back still hurts thinking about carrying that 10-pound monster and its dual power supplies The EON15-X only weighs 5.9 pounds and measures 14.2 x 10.1 x 1.2 inches. Take one look at it and you'll see it's undoubtedly a gaming laptop, thanks to its sharp edges and otherwise bland look. At least, the unit I was sent is boring. It's all black, save for the silver Origin logo on the back of the lid. You can customize and tweak the outside of any Origin laptop with HD UV printing, metallic finishes, hydro dipping or custom laser etching. Of course, those all come at an extra cost over your configured build. I'm a big fan of the port arrangement on the EON15-X, mainly because the power and display connections are found in the rear of the housing, making it easier to hide cables. Specifically, there's a DisplayPort 1.4 via USB 3.2 Gen 2 (USB-C), miniDisplayPort 1.4, HDMI, and the power connector on the back. On the left side are two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an RJ-45 Ethernet port, and a microSD card reader. On the left side you'll find a USB 2.0 port, a combo audio jack, and a dedicated microphone jack. Centered along the top of the 15.6-inch 144Hz full HD display is a 2MP webcam. The bezels are fairly slim, which is why Origin is able to fit a 15.6-inch screen into a device that measures only 14.2-inches wide. The keyboard is a typical affair, with a single RGB LED lighting zone and slim hard plastic caps. The touchpad is centered with the keyboard, not accounting for the 10 key to the right side. There are two physical buttons with the trackpad. I don't dislike the keyboard and trackpad, but the lack of multi-zone RGB or individually lit keys is a disappointment. The keys are just fine to type on and are well enough spaced when gaming that I wasn't accidentally pressing random keys and unintentionally lobbing grenades. Performance and gaming Inside this particular EON15-X is an impressive lineup. There's an AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-core processor, 16GB of 2,666 Mhz DDR4 memory, Nvidia's RTX 2070 with Max-P, a 500GB Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD, and a 1TB 5400 RPM Seagate FireCuda HDD. Before we dive into benchmarks, let me just say: This build is the fastest RTX 2070 laptop build I've ever tested. Not only does the use of an AMD desktop processor help, but performance is boosted by using a Max-P GPU over a Max-Q variant. In short, the Max-P version of Nvidia's mobile GPUs are more powerful and offer better performance. The benchmarks and my personal testing confirm that claim. Here's how the EON15-X stacks up against the Gigabyte Aorus 15G and Predator Helios 700: As you can see, the clear winner across the board when it comes to performance is the EON15-X (I'll get to the battery test in a minute). And that goes for every RTX-2070 equipped laptop I've put through the same tests  including the Helios 700 that had a standard RTX 2070. In fact, the EON15-X outperforms most RTX-2080 with Max-Q laptops I've tested. Yea. It's fast. The Max-P version of the 2070 that Origin is using has a base clock speed of 1,260MHz and a boost speed of 1,455MHz. Compare that to the RTX 2070 Super w/Max-Q used in the Aorus 15G, which had a base and boost of 930MHz and 1,155MHz, and it starts to become clearer as to why the EON15-X performed so well. Of course, these cards will be outperformed by the new 30-series RTX desktop cards, but mobile variants of those haven't been announced yet and likely won't be for at least several months. Real-world testing was more of the same: Solid performance all around. Whether I was dropping in on Warzone in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or Battlefield V, both of which support ray-tracing, I was experiencing an average of 115 FPS and 85 FPS, respectively, at the highest settings, to boot. All of this performance comes with a big downside: The fans are loud. Like, really loud. So loud that my wife has taken to calling this laptop the ~Jet Engine.~ It's so loud, you can't game without headphones. They are absolutely required and should come in the box. Footsteps, far off gunshots, other odds and ends? Yea, you're not going to hear any of that when this baby is going full tilt  which is pretty much from the moment you launch a game. Cranking the system volume to 100% helps, of course, but the speakers sound muffled and after a few minutes I would become overwhelmed by such a noisy machine I'd just put on my headphones and drown out the fans. I could have set custom fan curves, but the GPU was already reaching 86-degrees with the default settings so I didn't want to make things worse. There are power modes that help tame the fans, with Performance being the most egregious, but it's also the only mode that unlocks the full performance of the EON15-X. Entertainment, Quiet, and Power Saving all drop the frame rate, with Entertainment going from 115 FPS to under 100 FPS in Warzone. Power Saving and Quiet would bring it down to around 40 FPS. The 500GB main SSD is enough for a couple of your favorite games, with the additional 1TB HDD serving as added storage. You can remove the bottom of the housing and upgrade the memory, swap out the HDD, or add another M.2 NVMe SSD with relative ease. Battery life Battery life is a disappointment. Putting the EON15-X through IGN's battery benchmark test which consists of looping a video in VLC with the display brightness set to 50% and all extraneous connections disabled saw the EON15-X's battery give up after just 57 minutes. And that was with the Entertainment power mode enabled. Software There's not a lot when it comes to software that's reinstalled on the EON15-X. Origin's Control Center app is front and center, giving you control over the power modes, keyboard lighting, fan speed control, and Flexikey macros. Outside of the Control Center, the rest of the pre-installed apps are the standard affair for Windows 10 and nothing you can't remove if you don't have a need for it. More importantly, you won't find any bloatware or antivirus software preinstalled. Overall, the Origin EON15-X is impressive. In spite of poor battery life and loud fans, the performance I saw from this machine was in line with far more expensive  and bigger  builds. Whether you're looking for a gaming machine or a work machine for video editing and some gaming on the side, I suggest going through and creating the build you want from Origin.", "date": "Sept. 23, 2020"}
