When I started episode one, I decided to make all the ~good~ choices and be a role model for Clementine. When episode two came around, I wrote about the greater good and said ~It's time to decide if Lee's going to be an upstanding person or a cold-hearted survivor.~ Now, with Episode Three: Long Road Ahead behind me, I can see how foolish all that talk was. Faced with the toughest Walking Dead decisions to date, there was no debate over how a choice would make protagonist Lee Everett look or affect the group. Something happened, and I reacted. Me. Not Lee. Like few games before it, we are the main character in The Walking Dead: The Game. The third of five episodes (a new one is released about every two months), The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is best described as a series of peaks and valleys. As Lee, we see our group through some seriously screwed up and emotional moments, as well as a whole bunch of conversations and light gameplay problem solving with the third-person adventure control scheme. The bandits have nowhere else to turn now that the dairy farm is out of commission, Kenny and Lilly are still at odds, and there's a thief in our midst. It might not sound like the most amazing pace, but it works incredibly well. By this point, it's safe to assume you've polished off episodes one and two, so you know these characters and have feelings for them -- one way or the other. So, when the season-defining choices appear in Long Road Ahead, there's an emotional aftermath for us as players. When the cast was on the other side of one of the game's big moments, I wanted to wander around and see what they were going through, to talk about what the hell just happened. That's a true testament to the story developer Telltale Games delivers. Since episode one, the team has talked about your choices creating your game on a relationship level, but there's an emotional context to all of this, too. Sure, Kenny will still give me crap for siding with Lilly back in the meat locker, but I love the guy as he's always had my back. Maybe you don't because of a choice or fight you had with him, but I do. In my playthrough, these guys are bros. Long Road Ahead strains the personal narrative Ive built, fracturing the web of relationships established over four hours. Telltale built these foundations, and now it's testing them. It's infinitely exciting if not extremely depressing at times. As usual, the game looks sharp with its bold lines and comic-style art, and the voice acting is above reproach. These two facets really allow you to get lost in the story and notice Lee's pet name for Clem, Duck actually being useful, and Lilly's grief. But, also as usual, the game can stutter in the framerate department. Still, the problems aren't prevalent and the fascinating story carries you through rough patches with ease. If there's any deviation from what you've known about the game up until this point, it's that Long Road Ahead is perhaps the most ~adventurey~ episode so far. It uses the downtime before and after reality-shattering moments to have you bum around environments trying to figure out how to get from here to there or how to make something work with the objects in your inventory. These aren't challenging puzzles, but the tasks work well to counterbalance those peaks I was talking about -- these lulls are perfectly paced to give you a reason to talk to your fellow survivors and not immediately be on to the next event. CLOSING COMMENTS I've been asked if The Walking Dead: The Game -- Episode 3: Long Road Ahead is the best entry yet in Telltale's season, but I don't think it's a fair question. Just like I watch Rick Grimes evolve every month in The Walking Dead comics, I get to see myself evolve through the lens of Lee Everett with each episode of The Walking Dead: The Game. That's fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Each episode makes me care more and more about these characters, so the events of Long Road Ahead make it the most impactful episode to date. It's a disturbing, depressing and entertaining entry in a journey that's been nothing short of excellent so far. IGN RATINGS FOR THE WALKING DEAD: THE GAME -- EPISODE 3: LONG ROAD AHEAD (XBOX 360) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 8.0 Presentation The story and pacing of this episode are superb. Of course, they wouldn't matter as much without the first two episodes. 8.0 Graphics Still love the comic vibe and art style. Still gets framey when action pops off. 9.0 Sound The voice acting and soundtrack is excellent. I didn't notice any audio drops this time. 9.0 Gameplay Things are more varied this time around. There's shooting, problem solving and the excellent conversation system. 8.5 Lasting Appeal When I beat the episode, I jumped right back in to see how choices could've played out differently. On top of that, it makes me want to play all three episodes back to back to back. 9.0 OVERALL Amazing (out of 10)", "date": "Aug. 29, 2012,"}
