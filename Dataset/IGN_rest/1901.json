Its not just a great toybox to experience the DualSenses haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, microphone, and more, it also delivers the best proof-of-concept pack-in Ive played since Wii Sports. This is a truly joyous homage to PlayStation history, as well as an experimental platformer I can only hope to see turned into a larger experience during the PS5s lifetime. Developed by Team Asobi, Astros Playroom follows in the impressive footsteps of its excellent PSVR exclusive, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. Much like that adventure crafted its levels and challenges around the concept of viewing a platformer in VR, here Team Asobi has really considered what it means to build one around the DualSense. You could technically play these levels without any of the DualSenses new functionality, but like its predecessor Playroom serves as a strong argument for just how immersive an experience can be when fully using this new technology. Astros literal Playroom is, amusingly, the inside of your PlayStation 5 console, with its CPU Plaza hub offering you gateways to four main worlds: Cooling Springs, GPU Jungle, Memory Meadows, and SSD Speedway. Each offers a unique approach to conveying sensation through the DualSense and features its own platforming hooks, ranging from the just alright act of rolling a ball around using the touchpad in Memory Meadows to the enjoyable jumping frog suit of Cooling Springs to the stellar monkey climbing and swinging of GPU Jungle. All of that is, fundamentally, tied around the fun of using the DualSense controller.Across all of them, youll still mostly be getting around with the basic running, jumping, punching, spin attacking, and hovering present in Rescue Mission. Its a simple control scheme that anyone should be able to grasp easily, with Astro still having quite the sensitive jump and hovering window that really requires some precision. By keeping Astros basic movement options simple, Team Asobi is able to keep layering new ideas and new mechanics on top of those controls, which creates a continuous stream of inventive uses for them in Playrooms various worlds. All of that is, fundamentally, tied around the fun of using the DualSense controller. As the first real showcase of how its haptic feedback allow players to feel things like the trudge of a character walking through mud, or the difference between being in water versus on a grassy plain, Astro Bot does an impressive job of showcasing the variety of what it can pull off. Water emits a light, wavy pulse through the controller to mimic Astros swimming, while ice offers light, consistent taps of rumble that are coupled with a simulated ice sound coming from the controllers speaker. One way Astro Bot cleverly sows the seeds of these concepts  which do a remarkable job of consistently tricking my brain into buying into the different topography  is the lobby hallway ahead of each world. Before jumping into any of the locales (all of which are just a simple animation away, with no loading screens in between), the portal to each world features the type of terrain youll primarily encounter. So, before hopping into Cooling Springs, theres a small pool for Astro to splash around in, or ahead of SSD Speedway, I can stomp around the mechanical mesh platforms that will blanket the upcoming levels. Theyre the most subtle uses of the DualSense, but its a nice way to set the scene. PS5 DualSense Controller Review By Mike Epstein Verdict: With the DualSense, Sony has both made a more comfortable gamepad for traditional gameplay, and introduced some very exciting features. The haptics and adaptive triggers make an immediately noticeable difference in games that make use of them, and they offer the exciting potential for new and interesting gameplay experiences. Except for battery life, which remains a weak point, the DualSense controller is everything you want to see in a next-gen upgrade. Score: 9 Read the full PS5 DualSense Controller Review But once you do dive in, theres no shortage of joy that comes from how Team Asobi has translated in-game surfaces, objects, and movement into different DualSense sensations. Hail hitting my bot on the head causes little pops of rumble to strike all around the controller, the pull of a bow and arrow requires some added pressure on the trigger coupled with the satisfying plunk of release as the arrow shoots out. But perhaps the aspects that best show how developers can successfully elicit the feeling of swimming through water or pushing against a gust of wind is when Team Asobi combines multiple DualSense features to produce a result greater than the sum of its parts. Hail hitting my bot on the head causes little pops of rumble to strike all around the controller. The combinations can be something simple like running a finger up the touchpad slowly to zip Astro into a new suit, while the realistic sound of a zipper cinching up plays and the DualSense thumps depending on how slowly or quickly you zip. Or it can become more complex, like the Memory Meadows-specific mechanic of a little spaceship suit Astro can wear, which uses both adaptive triggers to control the velocity of your ships thrusters, for which theres also haptic feedback to indicate how much the ship is rumbling (or if you bump into any walls) while the rocket exhaust sound lowers and raises depending on how fast youre going. Yes, the haptic feedback plays a big part in all this, like when raindrops start falling harder on Astros head and the pitter patter tremble of your controller simultaneously grows  but its the added hook of rain sounds emanating from the its speaker that really made me think Oh no, I need to get out of this rain. Dressed for the Occasion A lot of the ways Team Asobi integrates these features are experiential  feeling the flow of grass as Astro runs through a field, the gust of wind that tries to blow you off a platform, or the odd, rippling rumble as you swim through water. But the world-specific gameplay mechanics are where some of the studios genius most lies, in mixing fun platforming curveballs with some of the DualSenses coolest sensations. Each Playroom world is structurally the same: two sets of two alternating levels, the first and third featuring more traditional 3D platforming and exploration, while the second and fourth offer a world-specific suit for Astro to wear. And its most of these portions where Team Asobis knack for inventive levels really shines. My favorite of them is GPU Jungles full robotic monkey suit, which leads to vertically-scrolling, 2D-view levels. As the monkey, Astro scales upward by grabbing onto rock climbing handholds, which require you to alternatingly grab on with a trigger (representing one hand), physically turn the DualSense left or right to raise the other arm, and then grab a subsequent handhold. Broken up by cables the monkey can spin around and launch off of, some handholds necessitate you only squeeze the trigger slightly or risk causing them to crumble and drop you to your doom, making this mechanic a real test of delicacy. The world-specific mechanics deliver Astro's Playroom's most inventive DualSense uses. Other suits have Astro hopping into the aforementioned ship, which actually controls quite like the ships of digital PS3 classic PixelJunk Shooter  it can be quite easy to overshoot and hit an electrified wall, so theres a nice balance of joyously zooming around and precise movement needed to survive. The frog suit of Cooling Springs is an absolute treasure in its DualSense use, though the levels are not necessarily my favorites. The reproduction of a spring coil via haptics, the triggers, and the speaker is outstanding, but I also found it unwieldy to actually aim and pretty easy to overshoot or just miss a precariously small landing spot. Look Back: What We Said About Astro Bot Rescue Mission Verdict: Its hard to overstate how incredibly different and exciting Astro Bot Rescue Missions new perspective is for the platform genre. The depth of the PSVRs 3D leads to some truly incredible moments, like when Captain Astro leaps from eye level down to a trampoline metres below, only to bounce up and over your head. In almost every level I audibly gasped or smiled with delight, like when I needed to duck my head underwater to watch the little robot swim through some pipes or simply when Captain Astro would stand close enough to touch. The challenging platforming and natural implementation of VR make it one of the most interesting and genuinely new-feeling games in recent memory. Astro Bot Rescue Mission delivers on the potential of PSVR and is a must-buy for owners of the device. - Dan Crowd, October 4, 2018 Score: 9 Read the full Astro Bot Rescue Mission review Lastly, the final suit turns Astro into a ball that requires you to constantly flick a finger across the touchpad to propel yourself forward, pressing it to stop the balls momentum entirely. These levels are fine. Theyre challenging enough to test your reflexes as you try not to fall into a cloudy abyss, and the screeching halt of a stop allows for some pretty precarious sections, but its not too different from any sort of rolling ball puzzle Ive played in plenty of other games. A paintball machine gun sputters the DualSense with every round fired.These varied suits nicely keep the pace from ever slowing down, with the first level featuring any of these mechanics often being a good place to learn the ropes and the second offering some sincere challenge. The more traditional levels between them are less about challenging you and more about exploring every nook and cranny, though they still offer some fun variation with weapons like a bow and arrow that adds resistance to the adaptive triggers as you pull the string back, and a paintball machine gun that sputters the DualSense with every fired round. Astros Playrooms little details like that ensure the DualSense lives up its name - its not just called the DualTouch (which, lets be frank, would be a terrible name)  genuinely making what I saw on screen more immersive. In fact, the only use of the DualSense that seemed superfluous to me was the microphone. Ive seen uses like blowing into a mic to get an in-game fan to move since the days of the original Nintendo DS, so it doesnt necessarily bring anything all that fresh here. There's an absolute abundance of PlayStation Easter eggs.Of course, it is worth mentioning that any DualSense uses here, and in all future games, likely can and should never be the only way to experience a game. For many, simply holding the controller through all its intense rumbling and trigger resistance could be difficult or damaging, while others may not be able to hear whats coming through the speaker. The PS5, at a system level, lets you shut off or adjust the DualSenses added feedback  and if you were to play without that feedback, Astros Playroom is still a fun and at times challenging platformer with plenty to discover thanks to its loads of collectable puzzle pieces and artifacts to uncover, a host of unlockable speedrun levels to keep aiming for better times on, and an absolute abundance of PlayStation Easter eggs. It certainly raises many questions for me about the necessity of what the DualSense has to offer, but I cant deny how enjoyable all of its bells and whistles are. Trip Down Virtual Memory Lane But the joy of Astros Playroom, while largely focused on its use of the new controller, is also thanks to Team Asobis dedication to turning this pack-in into a mini-museum of PlayStation history. The hidden puzzle pieces come together to form wall art murals tracing PlayStation console history all the way back to the original, while each of the main four worlds hold hidden artifacts belonging to the four respective eras of past PlayStation hardware. (And dont worry PSP and Vita fans, you arent forgotten.) Some of these are more expected pieces, like recreations of the DualShock 4 or the PS2, but there are some appreciable deep cuts, like the PSP GPS plug-in, or throwbacks like the PocketStation. All of them are put on display to be looked at or hit to produce sound effects, pop open disc trays, and more. As youre exploring Playrooms levels youll also stumble across Astro Bots wearing a blue cap and holding a camera. Thats the signal for a reference to a PlayStation game, and levels are littered with them  for example, you might find a boat with a robot inside that has a familiar tattoo, axe, and BOY alongside it, or a larger robot head made up of many smaller ones in a nod to LocoRoco. Theyre mostly there for the fun of it all rather than to accumulate anything, but every single one of them made me smile, even the few that I had to take a moment to try and guess at. I wont spoil any more here so as to not rob anyone of the joy of first discovering them. But, much like with the hardware artifacts, every era of PlayStation is represented in some truly hilarious ways. While hunting for realistic depictions of PlayStation systems or spotting a robot wearing the costume of a beloved PlayStation mascot may stick out, it all feels of apiece with Astros charming overall design. Running at a smooth 4K 60fps, Astros world may not be massive and require huge draw distances or populate the screen with hundreds of enemies, but its certainly pretty. Natural environments come together with PS5 internal parts and other pieces of hardware in a beautiful blend of the environmental with the technological. A grassy plain looks beautiful in 4K, only for the plants to be topped with PlayStation face button symbols rather than flowers. A rocky wall you need to climb has cliffs jutting out that are actually recreations of trigger buttons. It is yet another sign of Team Asobis dedication to imbuing Astro with a sense of nostalgic fun when coming across the many ways they insert PlayStation references into the world. And thats on top of the way it blends some audio Easter eggs into the world that are perhaps best discovered while playing. Astros Playroom surprised and delighted me. This PS5 pack-in most certainly hues closer to a technical showcase, essentially a loosely-structured sandbox to mess around in and discover what the PS5 has to offer. But it has enough collectibles, creative ideas, and genuinely exciting uses of the DualSense that PS5 owners shouldnt brush this one aside in the launch lineup. After months and months of hearing how the DualSense would immerse me like never before, Astros Playroom put promises into practice and impressively proved whats possible with the PS5s new controller.", "date": "Nov. 6, 2020,"}
