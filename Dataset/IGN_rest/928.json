In Vainglory, a mostly excellent iOS MOBA, the key to victory is to play in the same physical room with your two teammates. As good as it is at distilling the fast-paced, skill-heavy action of the genre into a mobile format with 10 strong heroes and a great three-lane map, coordinating with an online team is a tremendous challenge. Vainglory isnt an attempt to approximate genre giants League of Legends and Dota 2 on an iPad -- its a strong, carefully constructed MOBA that exists on its own terms, and welcomes newcomers with open arms. Its scaled down, rather than scaled back, and thats a crucial misstep in most other MOBAs on the platform. Developer Super Evil Megacorp has done a marvelous job with Vainglorys map design, which leverages a superb jungle to give its simplistic design interesting layers. When working with my LAN team, we dominated nearly every game, usually because we refused to give up that place of opportunity. Capturing jungle control points increases your gold and minion strength, giving you more of an advantage as matches progress. Controlling those points is imperative  equally important to lane dominance  because it can turn the tide of a game. Additionally, the 10 compelling heroes stand out. All are entertaining to play, and have fun relationships in combat. SAW, the lumbering machine-gunner, dominates in lane, but is too slow to jungle effectively. As such, laning with Petal and her three damage-dealing pets almost assures lane control, and she can dip into the jungle so a stronger SAW can kill on his own. Their designs are fun, too -- Joule with her mech suit, Krul with a glowing sword planted through his chest, and Ringo with his monk garb and gargantuan guns. Its difficult to comment on balance, however, because my teams ability to verbally call for assistance or to plan out our attacks was always an enormous advantage. Allowing players to coordinate the strategy necessary to outplay another team, and without text or voice chat, multiplayer loses the nuance and effectiveness. Also concerning, Vainglory often pops up with messages like Ally has been killed, or Enemy has been killed, but not which has been killed. This makes it difficult to know whos still in play to support or slaughter you. But sitting side by side, my team could set up huge plays, recover from bad ones, keep each other alive, and roam the dense jungle beneath the main lane hunting for easy kills. We almost felt bad about it  even first-timers will feel powerful playing this way. This is simultaneously satisfying and concerning. Vainglory matches last around 20 minutes, typically because one team snowballs out of control and becomes too powerful for the enemy team to gain an inch. If one side takes an early lead based on quick kills and jungle control, theyll have the advantage at the 15 minute mark, when the enormous, game-ending Kraken creature spawns. Capture the Kraken, and itll flatten enemy turrets. If youre lucky, you can turn around a losing battle by gaining control of Kraken -- the monster absorbs massive amounts of damage, allowing you to wipe out distracted opponents -- but it was rare in my experience, because the game is effectively decided by that point. Frequent lopsided battles may indicate balance issues in Vainglory, though like most MOBAs its frequently patched. But in a game prone to one team already running away with it 15 minutes in, unleashing a Kraken seems like an excessive addition of insult to injury. In a mediocre MOBA, these wouldnt be notable issues. But, because Vainglory succeeds handily in translating the best of MOBAs onto phones and tablets, it drew my attention toward finer details. Vainglory is commendable in this way -- its characters, map, and general design are so good that I think about how its balanced, rather than how it failed to accomplish the fundamentals. Vainglorys touch controls work beautifully on an iPad, which has enough real estate to effectively scroll across the map, navigate your hero, and have a skill-based ability hit its mark. On iPhone, even on the large iPhone 6 Plus, Vainglory feels cramped, and alerting teammates with visual pings, attacking specific enemies, and keeping track of the action can be challenging. Im hoping to see more added to Vainglory. With 10 heroes, many matches see similar team compositions based on which characters are free that week  which, to be fair, is generally more than half the roster. On the other hand, some are arbitrarily, prohibitively expensive to buy permanently, to the point that purchasing premium currency seems the only option. Its inoffensive, but inconsistent, and therefore annoying  but Ive been completely satisfied playing free heroes. Pros Great heroesSmart map designLocal co-op Cons Communication limitationsExpensive characters This isnt just a good MOBA for phones tablets, its a great MOBA that happens to play well on iOS machines, and suffers from the big communication problem no ones figured out how to solve yet. Vainglory hits the highest highs of a great MOBA, but only when playing locally with friends against a team thats doing the same. Queuing into a random game with strangers spotlights massive communication problems that get in the way of Super Evil Megacorps smart level and character design. Its accessible for first-timers looking to get their feet wet, while offering enough depth to satisfy those with hundreds of hours of experience on more complex PC strategy games. Just make sure to bring friends.", "date": "Dec. 11, 2014,"}
