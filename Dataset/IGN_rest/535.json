Thanks to an interesting cast of characters, impressive performances, and a respectful mix of drama and Telltale Games-style quick-time event action, 1979 Revolution kept me hooked all the way through and even managed to deliver an engaging history lesson along the way. The hope, passion, danger, secrecy, and tragedy of the real Iranian revolution makes it a fascinating time and place to set a story and 1979 Revolution manages to hit on all these points in its short, but sweet two hours. Its set just days before the tragic turning point in the revolution known as the Black Friday massacre, which left several dozens of civilians dead in Tehrans Jaleh Square after the army opened fire on a crowd. A period as tragic as it is severely misunderstood. As dissatisfaction with the Western-backed Pahlavi dynasty grew, more and more Iranians had begun taking to the streets in protest. People from all walks of life and political backgrounds joined in street demonstrations: leftists and communists, nationalists, Mujahideen, students, and more. All had different ideas for the future of Iran, but most agreed on one thing: the Shah must go. The eventual declaration of martial law and several other factors made for a period in Irans history that was as tragic as it is severely misunderstood in the present day. By placing such a bloody fate just over the horizon, 1979 Revolution maintained a constant sense of dread as I navigated Reza, a likable young photographer, through the streets of Tehran. Roped into a diverse circle of revolutionaries by his close friend, Babak, Reza finds himself in the midst of the revolutions most impassioned demonstrations and the sharp men and women at the forefront. His initial caution and confusion is your own as you learn to diligently navigate the heated politics and dangers of the countrys civil unrest, an adventure that drew me in with the amount of careful detail put into the people and places. I loved seeing the heart and soul of Iran, even during this tumultuous time, on full display. From the lone, banner-waving protester atop the pedestal where the Shahs statue once stood, to the mass of praying figures in the middle of a deserted street, the spirit of the revolution is rendered with much-appreciated respect for the time and place. Thats true even when certain elements were clearly condensed down for the sake of encompassing as much of the historical event as possible, like representing every prominent political party with a single character, or packing a single city street with examples of protest both pacifistic and more riotous. The Future of Iran Despite that, I loved seeing the heart and soul of Iran, even during this tumultuous time, on full display. Half my family hails from Iran and experienced the revolution first hand, so my personal attachment to the events represented in 1979 Revolution is strong. I felt chills watching the opening credits, which juxtaposes live-action footage from the revolution against innocent home movies and in-game footage. In an opening chapter, I even recognized the bank where my grandfather used to work in Tehran  to see that kind of representation, no matter how mundane, in a medium where my culture and the Middle East at large are usually portrayed as desert war zones, was touching. But 1979 Revolution doesnt just get credit for exploring uncommon subject matter. Its the care and respect with which it treats its subjects that truly make it shine.

A personal connection to or prior knowledge of the events explored here arent required to appreciate 1979 Revolutions story or historical backdrop, thanks to the way were introduced to it. The photographer role is an obvious, but smart way to drop us into the middle of a complicated conflict without demanding we brush up on our history first, and thats a convenience 1979 Revolution uses to great effect. 1979 isn't afraid to dive deep into the heart of the revolution's most emotional and horrific aspects. From a city rooftop I used my camera to zoom in on a crowded street, tracing my shot over the dense gathering of civilians until the focus ring turned green. Some points of interest were less clear than others, which made locating some key photo opportunities feel like pixel hunting. But because of the amount going on in each scene, I felt compelled to look at and zoom in on as much as I could anyway, stumbling upon most of these shots incidentally. After snapping my first picture, a similar photo  a real one this time  appeared next to mine, accompanied by a caption explaining how half a million protesters marched through Tehran in September 1978. 1979 Revolution brings up real-world photos based on your in-game snapshots. I shot more photos of striking oil workers, a homeless mother, people waving signs in support of a pro-democratic Ayatollah  each with some interesting historical or cultural fact to go along with it. Key encounters with certain characters or points of interest, from people distributing political speeches on the streets to posters of Iranian pop stars, also add extra bits of information to a handy booklet in the pause menu.

A demonstration turns into a riot after the army roughs up a group of student protesters. Smart, nuanced writing, along with some powerful performances bring even the most minor characters to life. During all of this excitement (good and bad), you also get to make plenty of choices, ranging in importance from mundane to life or death. In an early chapter, I was given the option to fight or talk down a pro-communist revolutionary, angered by the prospect of a religious Mullah leading Iran. In another chapter, I had to choose whether to throw a rock at the soldiers violently arresting Babaks friends or go the pacifist route. Later, I could confront or avoid questioning from student revolutionaries on whether or not Rezas brother was really part of the SAVAK, the Shahs infamous secret police. While compelling in the moment, many of these seemingly important decisions end up feeling inconsequential in the long run, especially in light of the rather abrupt cliffhanger ending.

It might never go too deep into the specific politics of each party, but the web of clashing character motivations and distinct personalities on display were enough to illustrate how complex and multilayered the revolution really was. This is an event that reshaped Iran forever, one with effects still being felt today, worldwide, and 1979 Revolution does it justice both on a fictional storytelling level and an educational one. Pros Great performancesEngaging storyCompelling settingEducational Cons Unpolished in places Despite some inconsequential decision-making and visual roughness, the amount of heart, character, and unflinching honesty in 1979 Revolutions short two-hour tale is impressive. As an Iranian-American myself, its incredibly refreshing to not only see this subject matter explored, but done so in a smart and sensitive way that succeeds in educating as much as entertaining.", "date": "April 22, 2016"}
