It manages to pull together some of the best elements of the comic books, the Guardians film adaptations, and Telltales ability to deploy well-paced and witty comedy with just enough interactivity to make you feel like a part of the action. Like Telltales recent Batman game, this version of the Guardians doesnt seem to be ripped directly from either the comics or the movies but is rather a respectful pastiche that skews heavily toward the latter. Rocket, Groot, and Drax are almost indistinguishable from their cinematic incarnations, while Peter Quill, Gamora, and Yondu (the blue guy with the big red mohawk-thing on his head) incorporate a lot more traits from their paper-and-ink equivalents. There are also lots of small, clever easter eggs to find for devoted comics fans, which I definitely appreciated. The voice acting is applause-worthy, especially Nolan North as Rocket. Despite Norths voice being heard in just about every video game ever, he turns it into something so energetic and over the top here that I wouldnt have known it was him if I hadnt been told ahead of time. It's a spot-on replication of Bradley Coopers endearing and memorable performance from the film. Scott Porters version of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, the primary hero, is a little lighter on the quippy delivery than Chris Pratt but brings a relatable, emotional depth to the character that fills in the gaps. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown early in the episode is a major highlight.Guardians gameplay doesnt stray too far outside the Telltale formula weve come to expect, with only minor but welcome additions like Peters rocket boots allowing vertical exploration in some areas. There are semi-tedious detective segments where you wander around looking for the right thing to click on that make me long for the more difficult, puzzle-focused challenges of adventure games past. There are quippy, well-paced conversations with timed dialogue that affect various characters impressions of you. And then there are the extended quick-time events which, while they dont involve any twists beyond hitting buttons really quickly at the right time, are some of the best Telltale has put together, presentation-wise. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown with one of Marvels most iconic supervillains early in the episode is a major highlight. You get the joy of controlling each of the guardians and their unique abilities in an alternating fashion, becoming part of an exciting, well-choreographed brawl that looks like it could have come right off the pages of a comic. When Draxs fists arent flying, and Rocket isnt pointing a firearm three times his size at anything that moves, Peter is forced to step in (with your guidance) to hold a group of big personalities together through a time that calls into question what their place in the galaxy really is. Its impossible to keep everyone happy all the time, and some of your friends will be almost literally at each others throats by the episodes end, forcing you to take a side. Well have to see how impactful these choices end up being in later episodes  it says Rocket will remember that I didnt want to do his crazy, dumb plan, but its entirely possible everyone will be singing Kumbaya when the credits roll no matter how poor a leader I was. That would be unfortunate in terms of making our choices matter within the story, but for now at least Telltale has done a good job of making these decisions feel important and causing me plenty of enjoyable stress from trying to step up and do what a captains gotta do amidst all the intra-team drama. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands.That mood is kept light by Guardians comic relief. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands. There are at least a couple moments I laughed out loud at, and most of the dialogue writing is as clever and satisfying as the music choices, which delightfully echo the soundtrack of feelgood classic rock director James Gunn put together for the Guardians movies. Where the writing chops behind the episode really show, though, is in the more emotional and character-driven scenes. Intimate conversations between long-time friends experiencing big changes are authentic and moving. Particularly, a flashback scene between a young Peter and his mother felt all too real, injecting a grounded, well-executed B-plot about a kid whos still not over losing a parent into the swashbuckling space opera. One of my only other disappointments was how quickly it seemed like Tangled Up in Blue came and went. The bombastic, action-movie pacing worked well in some ways, but also prevented me from feeling like I really got to settle into and experience the world Telltale created as much as I did in the pilots for their take on Game of Thrones or any of the Walking Dead seasons. I look forward to returning and seeing the continued aftershocks of the multiple, major plot stingers (which are worth not spoiling for yourself!) as I chill with a likable, ably written and acted cast in future installments. Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely starting off on the right foot, with a great script, great actors, and a universe packed with personality (and backed by catchy tunes) to explore. If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltales catalog. I just hope that now the series has introduced itself, the series gives its environments and characters just a bit more time to breathe in between speeding the plot along.", "date": "April 18, 2017"}
