And man oh man, did I fail  over and over again. It's part of Kerbal's experimental nature. By the time I finally built a rocket that achieved successful orbit I had failed so many times that in almost any other game I would have given up completely. But that's where the genius of Kerbal really is: hard work pays off, and once I was able to determine the cause of my failures, be it staging woes or my nose pitching violently at 1000 meters, every successful launch was a thing of beauty. Kerbal on PlayStation 4 is for the most part exactly the same as its PC counterpart (read our Kerbal Space Program PC review), with the big exception of the control scheme. I found it daunting at first glance: there's a lot going on in every single screen, and accessing the in-game help files did nothing to put me at ease. To accommodate Kerbals made-for-mouse-and-keyboard complexity, Certain buttons on the controller behave as modifiers that, when held down, give each of the other buttons different functions. It sounds like a hot mess, but I was amazed at how quickly I was able to figure the controls out without a cheat-sheet in front of me. The button assignments have a really intuitive feel... although I often accidentally hit X during EVAs, causing my Kerbal to let go of its module and float helplessly into space. So human error is a factor. In its Career and Science modes, Kerbal Space Program creates an incredible sense of accomplishment with each successful feat of rocketry. Through hours of trial and error, I finally came to a design and flight technique that did what I wanted it to, and it was fantastically satisfying because each accomplishment is just a step toward bigger and better things. Every success (such as reaching a new record altitude) is really just a place to start over, only with better stuff. It's a lovely feedback loop that I can't get enough of. Striking the perfect balance between thrust, weight, and fuel made me feel brilliant.I spent the majority of my time in Career mode, where all the challenges that come with actually blasting an object into space come into play. Balancing funding, scientific progression, and reputation forced me to put thought into each launch, and the limited selection of spaceship parts made me think hard about how I could get the most from each rocket engine, fuel supply, or science module. Going higher requires more thrust, which requires bigger engines. Bigger engines require more fuel, which make the ship heavier. A heavier ship needs more thrust to go higher, which requires more engines. And so on. Striking the perfect balance between thrust, weight, and fuel with only the parts and funds unlocked in Career mode made me feel like a brilliant rocket scientist. I enjoyed Science mode less. It retains the tech tree progression of Career mode, but removes other restrictions so the stakes aren't as high. Without the goals of Career mode, though, I'd rather be playing Sandbox, where everything is unlocked and my imagination is the only limit. When I'd get to a point in Career where I was having trouble progressing and started to get frustrated, I'd switch to Sandbox and build to my heart's content. Sandbox allows for truly ridiculous designs - the sort of insane, utterly impractical rockets I built just to see how far I could push Kerbals physics. Leaving the symmetry option turned up to its highest setting, I quickly built an excessively powerful pinwheeling rocket. I didn't design it for science, or for speed, or to see how far I could make it fly; I built the thing just because I could. When I took it to the launch pad and set it off and it didn't immediately explode, there was a brief second just before the whole thing failed violently where I thought, ~Hey, maybe I'm onto something here.~ It was a glorious second. Unfortunately, Kerbal Space Program suffers from occasional framerate stutters, which become more frequent and severe the more complicated your builds and missions become. Even leaving the atmosphere during the earliest hours with a simple engine/command pod/parachute design causes some hiccups. And as fun as Sandbox mode is, it's also where I ran into my biggest issues with framerate. Given the total freedom to build meant my designs became increasingly ridiculous and complex, and all those engines and moving parts slowed the framerate way, way down. At times, when I really pushed it, it dipped below 10 frames per second. For the most part, these are avoidable by reigning in your creativity just a bit. When things go wrong, Kerbal makes getting it right easy.But when things go wrong, either from overdoing it or simply discovering your crazy idea for an unconventional spaceship wasnt quite crazy enough to work, Kerbal makes getting it right easy. If you don't like the way a launch went, you can just revert back to the launchpad with no penalty. If my design was clearly a failure, I could revert right back to construction. Quick and fun experimentation is the name of the game. Getting off the ground is only the first small step for Kerbal kind. After finally landing on a design that got me into space, turning a vertical trajectory into an orbital one presented new challenges. Once I mastered orbit, I set my sites to the moon (or,a s Kerbals call it, Mun). The tutorials were a big help in explaining orbital mechanics, which are all very science-y and absolutely need to be understood if you're going to make it to any of the numerous celestial bodies in the Kerbal solar system. This is where the challenge, and experimentation, become almost limitless. I almost felt bad blowing up so many brave little Kerbals in my pursuit of the stars. With their self-assured mannerisms, they work so well to lighten the mood while learning rocket science. Kerbal Space Program doesn't have any voice acting, other than the occasional nasally whine of approval from one of the Kerbals, but the flavor text is smart, wry, and funny. Pros Funny and smartEncourages experimentationFull of content Cons Minor staging issuesBlah graphics Kerbal Space Program does the improbable: it makes learning a complex subject fun. Its cute, clueless characters and sense of humor turn a hardcore physics simulator into something replayable and addictive, and well worth getting over the hurdle of learning the controls. Designing, flying, and then retrying missions again and again is a tough challenge that goes right up to the brink of frustration (and sometimes beyond the limits of the PlayStation 4s performance), but the eventual success of achieving virtual space flight is rewarding and even inspirational.", "date": "July 19, 2016,"}
