Now, we look at Steelseries latest mouse, the Steelseries Rival, an optical gaming mouse the company swears is its finest product yet. If the Steelseries Rivals reminds you of the Razer Deathadder 2013, you are not alone - the inspiration is clear. But Steelseries has added enough of its own ingredients to make a stand out product - a weapon of choice for gamers that lives up to its name. Design & Comfort The thing I like about Steelseries products is that they are never overly flashy (bar some accessories), and the Rival conforms to those guidelines. For a device that will remain under your palm for most the time, the Rival doesnt need to be a fashion accessory or a style statement. Instead, Steelseries maintains its focus on delivering a device that is comfortable, feature-rich, and high-performing. The Steelseries Rival follows some familiar design principles seen on most other gaming mice. The surface is covered in a rubberized matte black finish that feels great to touch and adds a bit of grip, although due to the nature of the coating it is susceptible to scratches and sweat blotches, so one has to be careful with it. The sides of the mouse are supported by anti-sweat direct injected molded rubber for better control and grip, and for someone who sweats quite a lot while playing games (especially multiplayer matches), this was a delight to have. At 2.76 in (W) x 5.23 in (L) x 1.8 in (H) and a weight of 128g, the Rivals is a bit lengthy and weighty than Steelseries other gaming mouses like the Sensei RAW. This means the Rivals is only limited to those that have medium to large fingers. I like to believe I have medium length fingers, and at first I did have trouble gripping the mouse, especially coming from my regular Sensei RAW which fits snugly inside my palm. However it didnt take me too long to get comfortable with the Rival and maneuver it naturally. The mouse features six buttons - the left and right buttons, two thumb buttons on the right-hand side, a DPI switcher, and a middle click. Each is fully programmable to do just about anything, from assigning it a keyboard function, to media controls, to a macro script. The buttons have a nice, soft tactile feel to them, where they are just punchy enough to feel satisfactory. In terms of how easy it was to reach the buttons, the Rival needs only minimal movement to reach the thumb buttons, although I did have some difficulty reaching Button 5 in the heat of the moment. Like most Steelseries products these days, the Rival too features illumination options. The scroll wheel and the logo can both be customized to feature a dazzling array of colors, and you can set it to pulse or breathe for extra effect. Steelseries also goes one step further allowing users to customize the nameplate at the bottom of the mouse, provided they have a 3D printer at their disposal. Software & Performance The software is where most companies either make it or lose it. Steelseries proprietary Engine 3 control panel is thankfully one of the best out there, and supports the Rival with an intuitive interface that allows one to setup the mouse just the way they like it. Other than being able to programme the buttons, the software also features various toggles that gives users the depth to make the mouse feel and behave according to their needs. Users can set two sensitivity settings which they can change on-the-fly with the DPI switcher. They can also set the acceleration/deceleration of the cursor in accordance to the speed of movement and sensitivity, and also adjust the angle snapping and polling rate of the device. The macro editor works by recording all keystrokes and mouse clicks, and every recorded session can be customized by introducing a fixed delay or removing the delay entirely. While each input and delay can be edited, there is unfortunately no way to manually add another entry, which can get quite frustrating if you are trying to record a particular macro and just arent able to get it right. The Steelseries Engine 3 also allows the creation of profiles, with each having its own user-defined settings and an associable program. This means that users can set a different of set of macros, sensitivity, and illumination options for each game they play, and have those configurations auto-launch with the game. When it comes to performance, the Rivals latest Pixart PMW3310 optical sensor truly delivers on its promise of pure 1:1 tracking, zero hardware acceleration, and incredibly smooth and precise movements. I game on relatively low sensitivity (about 1700 DPI), and in games like TitanFall, which demands ridiculous precision, I felt completely in control, with the Rival tracking my movement and placing the cursor exactly where I wanted, and when. The Rival offers few improvements in terms performance over other high-end laser mice like the Steelseries Sensei RAW, but I have to admit I felt more in control over my movements with the Rival than I have with any mouse I have used recently. For at about $60, the Rival goes up against the likes of Logitech G500 and Razer Deathadder, but the Steelseries easily holds its own with a set of fantastic features, great build quality, and an ergonomic, well-thought out design. Granted the Rivals length and weight may not be for everyone, but beyond that, its hard not to recommend it if you are looking for a premium mousing solution.", "date": "May 13, 2014,"}
