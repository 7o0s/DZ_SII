Its handling of death, exploration, and NPC design is fresh and confident, especially in the crowded zombie genre. Yet, when its time to fight -- and it often is -- Zombi encourages some of the dullest, most repetitive combat Ive seen in this generation of games. These opposing ideas keep Zombi from realizing its potential, but the heights it reaches are still pretty darn high. Nothing about Zombis garden-variety undead surprised me. Aside from a few special variants, theyre slow, dumb, and deadly in numbers. Their one powerful advantage is that, if they kill you, your infected character is permanently added to the zombie horde. Any weapons or supplies you were carrying in your BOB (Bug-out Bag) remain with your old, zombified character until they are retrieved -- a task made all the more difficult if you didnt hide away extra equipment for your next random playable survivor. Preparation is key. This was also the main hook of ZombiU, the 2012 Wii U game. Here's our old review. Zombi, if you didnt know, is a new version of that game, now made for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It includes a few updates, but ditches the multiplayer mode which required the Wii U gamepad. Because valuable goods (like bullets) are so rare, and because fighting zombies takes so long (more on this soon), Zombis unique death system adds welcome and constant tension to every encounter, no matter how small. However, the game puts no effort into making me care about my characters in a human way. Despite different names, ages, and genders, all my survivors were really the same thing: a vessel to carry the possessions I actually did care about. Its a shame, because while Zombis main story events are predictable and silly, the characters I met along the way were each well-defined, motivated, and just insane enough to keep me from trusting them. Theres the Prepper, a man who heeded 400-year-old prophetic zombie warnings and now, for reasons I dont want to discuss, allows survivors (myself included) to live in his safe house. Another man fortified Buckingham Palace and used its resources, including imprisoned test-subject zombies, to work on developing a cure. The cast grows much larger in the second half of the game, and I welcomed the mad ensemble for the flavor it brought to an otherwise familiar setting. In exchange for shelter or new technology, most people wanted something from me. Their quests sent me deep into zombie-infested districts of London, which are silent and eerie, and usually stayed that way unless I ran around like an idiot. It isnt a particularly beautiful game world, but Zombi rightfully puts the emphasis on sound and lighting rather than a raw pixel count. The rough edges didnt matter when I crept along at a snails pace with my eyes locked on the next dark hallway. The artists and sound designers nailed the atmosphere. Zombis high-stakes and dark environments demand caution, but it also gave me the tool I needed to make that caution as painless as possible. Early on, the Prepper hands over the appropriately named Prepper Pad, which allows you to quickly see which containers and bodies were worth looting, which doors could and couldnt open, and, simply, which direction you need to go. I didnt waste any time rummaging through empty bins or searching dead zombies for healing cake and soda. Its nice to see a game respect your time, especially one so punishing in most other aspects. However, that specific praise went right out the window when it was time to fight. Zombis zombies were tough suckers. They killed me with a handful of good swings, and they took several hits to bring down. I started with a cricket bat, which usually took out one enemy with four or five solid swings -- more if the enemy was wearing a helmet. Zombies often rushed me two or three at a time, making combat a slow, rhythmic back-and-forth, swing-and-hit dance, void of both skill and variety. Sure, there are firearms, but they feel too weak, and Zombi constantly stresses how important it is not to use my ammo. From the rarity of bullets to the limitations of my storage to the Prepper straight-up telling me bullets are the new precious metals, I was trained not to shoot unless there was a Capital-P Problem. This was one of the major complaints from reviews of ZombiU, and the developers appear to have listened -- sort of. Extra melee weapons were added to Zombi, and they are stronger than the cricket bat, but not by much. It says something about the combat system when I scoffed at a double-barreled shotgun but felt overjoyed when I picked up a shovel. Melee weapons simultaneously feel like a bad option and the only option. Pros Death mattersGreat atmosphereInteresting NPCs Cons Repetitive combatYour characters don't matter Zombi is the textbook example of a game that needs a sequel. Within the trope-ripe grounds of the zombie shooter, it builds interesting NPCs, delivers genuine scares, and makes deaths mean something more than a respawn. With more exciting combat, Zombi might have been a must-own for horror fans. As it stands, its a fun game that does most things right, but constantly reminds you of its biggest flaw.", "date": "Aug. 23, 2015,"}
