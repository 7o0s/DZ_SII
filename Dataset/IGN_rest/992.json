First things first: the original Gabriel Knight adventure is my favorite game of all time. My favorite shouldnt be confused with the best, though; the quirks that bugged me in 1993 (like an incongruent action sequence near the end) are still fully intact in the 2014 version. This 20th Anniversary Edition is a straight remake, not a reimagining or reinvention of the first game. While the art has received a 3D-ish makeover to support todays higher resolutions and wider screens, its a nearly perfect reproduction that replicates the gameplay, puzzles, dialogue, and atmosphere of its ancestor in all its glory. That said, it helps to remember that this Gabriel Knight, like the first one, is set in 1993, and that the plot - in which Gabriel investigates a murderous Voodoo Cult in New Orleans - pre-dates gorier, more sophisticated fare like The Walking Dead. Its a bit like opening a time capsule; for example, Gabriel doesnt carry a cellphone, gets daily updates from a print newspaper, and unashamedly tosses out sexist come-ons to female characters that would make Duke Nukem blush. Some of the tone-setting dialogue that served to overcome the originals visual shortcomings now come off as over the top and sometimes even silly. (The evolution of Gabriels relationship with socialite Malia Gedde now seems particularly sudden and overwrought.) One of my personal misgivings about the remake was that the original voice casts performances were unsalvageable, meaning that Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Picture Shows Dr. Frankenfurter) doesnt reprise his role as Gabriel Knight. Though the British actor was ridiculously miscast as a Cajun, his leering, guttural delivery turned out to be a guilty pleasure of virtual scene-chewing. Im happy to report that the new Gabriel tackles the role with the same zeal, growling each line with winking gusto. In fact, the entire cast does a stellar job in recreating the vocal performances of the original. The soundtrack has been similarly remastered to good effect, though some selections seem totally out of place. For example, I really couldve done without the inappropriately jaunty march (complete with whistles) that plays in the police station while Gabriel is discussing mutilated corpses with his cop pal, Mosely. The gameplay and puzzles remain as challenging and head-scratching as ever, though. Only a handful of new mind-benders have been added to the remake, so if you remember how to defeat the deadly python attack in the original, youll be able to do it again now. If you dont, a very handy hint system is available to help jog your memory or eventually give you the answer outright. The mouse-driven interface remains easy and intuitive to navigate, allowing you to look at, talk to, investigate, or interact with a person or object seamlessly. In some cases, what worked 20 years ago works just as well today. The pacing of the story remains one of Gabriel Knights strengths, with new locations and items revealed as each day of the adventure passes. Often the resolution to a conundrum will be in plain sight, perfectly logical and easy to suss out if youve been paying attention. Its one of the reasons Gabriel Knight stands the test of time for adventure purists; theres little of that nonsensical adventure game logic to take you out of the experience. One of the more enjoyable inclusions here is a treasure trove of background material from the making of both the first game and the remake, including comparisons of each location with how they appeared in the 1993 version, interviews with the original developers, and early concept art for the main characters. Its fun to see just how far adventure gaming has come in the last 20 years, and how visual and processing limitations affected Gabriel Knights design back in 1993. Pros Authentic remakeChallenging puzzlesFun voice acting Cons Feels dated (it is!)Silly dialogue Adventure gaming has changed a lot since 1993, and Sins of the Fathers is a product of its time. When it first came out, Gabriel Knight was one of the first dark and scary adventures in a sea of light-hearted fare like Kings Quest and Monkey Island. How does Gabriel Knights baptism by fire stand up 20 years later? For those of us weaned on old-school click-and-point adventures (or anyone who wants to experience Sierra On-Lines glory days), theres no question - this is a must-play. The rest of you may be fascinated by its anachronisms, but still be dazzled by its dramatic story and classic puzzles.", "date": "Oct. 24, 2014,"}
