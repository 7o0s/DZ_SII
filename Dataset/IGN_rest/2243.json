Be sure to check out our One-Punch Man spoiler-free review of the Season 2 premiere. Season 1 of One-Punch Man is one of the best-looking anime to ever grace our screens. Its dynamic camerawork, electrifying brawls, heart-stopping action scenes, and gorgeous animation left fans drooling after each episode. Then came the news that Season 2 would switch animation studios from Madhouse to J.C. Staff due to time restraints and the team who made Season 1 having their hands full with other projects. Alarm bells started ringing, and then the trailer dropped, which showed stilted animation, uninspired shot composition, awkward facial animations, and a lot of black screens. So, after all of this, does Season 2 of One-Punch Man hold up? Well, the answer to this largely depends on what you want from your anime, and what youre willing to sacrifice. One-Punch Man is defined by three things: intense and exhilarating fight scenes between fun and campy heroes and villains; a philosophy based around searching for a purpose in life and feeling unfulfilled; and jokes based on both the fights and the philosophy. In Season 2, just as in Season 1, we get the latter two. The jokes are still there, delivered expertly by the voice cast, especially our protagonist Saitama - however, many of the jokes in Season 1 relied on physical comedy and slapstick, but with poorer animation, some of that is lost in Season 2. And the philosophy is still there, but that is all handled by the writer of the manga, so the story, themes, and big ideas are going to be carried forward effortlessly, regardless of how the show looks. If you love One-Punch Man for its characters, relationships, gimmicks, costumes, personalities, and agendas, then theres nothing to dislike here. If youre invested in the story and want to know how it can possibly build on the ultimate sucker punch that is the ending of Season 1, then you wont be disappointed by Season 2. But if you are hoping for Season 2 to deliver those same visceral fight scenes that we were lucky enough to see in One Punch Man's freshman outing, then the new episodes will probably leave you underwhelmed. The animation is slow and lazy, taking horrendous shortcuts to get the fights done and dusted in as simple a way as possible. Gone are the intricately detailed character action shots, with dynamic slow motion and constantly-shifting camerawork. Instead, we have flashes, cuts to black, and machine-gun punches all reminiscent of the drawn-out fight scenes of Dragon Ball Z from more than twenty years ago. For a show with ~punch~ in its name, not a single blow leaves any lasting impact. Overall, the plot is built upon nicely, as are the shows core themes - although they're explored with far less nuance this season. For example, theres a moment in episode 9 where the recurring theme of unfulfillment and boredom is spelled out in a tte--tte with King - a new character introduced in episode 1 as an accidental (and fake) hero. Its very patronizing, implying that the audience has not been following Saitamas plight all along. Kings words are wise though, and reminiscent of the message given by Zeus at the end of Disneys Hercules, as he comes to terms with the fact that ultimate strength does not equal true heroism. This, at least, turns an awkward moment of exposition into something a little more worthwhile that does advance Saitamas character, just not in the most elegant of ways. And there are moments of tonal dissonance like this peppered throughout the season. When it comes to the climax of the season, the final episode of Season 2 doesnt feel final. Though fans have been clamoring for a second batch of episodes, Season 1 still feels like a complete story, while Season 2's finale could have been the end to any other episode, rather than offering any closure. And, although it doesnt have to necessarily matter, the final three episodes are almost entirely one long and arduously drawn-out battle, with hardly any Saitama to be seen Again, this is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z, especially that one infamous moment when Frieza threatens that Namek will explode in one minute and that minute is then somehow drawn out over several twenty-minute episodes. Its 2019! This kind of poorly-paced storytelling shouldnt be happening. Not when Season 1 of One-Punch Man consistently delivered on its jokes, its fights, its music beats, its plot, and its character growth. Season 2 of One-Punch Man is a half-baked jumble of poor and lazy animation that is far more concerned with staying relevant than being crafted into something worthy of the season that came before it. If youre only in it for the advancement of the plot, its all here. But its also all in the manga, and that looks an awful lot better than this season. So, really, theres not much of a reason to watch Season 2. Instead, watch Season 1, then re-watch it because its that good.", "date": "July 10, 2019,"}
