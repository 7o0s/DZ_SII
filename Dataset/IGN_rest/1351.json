A year before PlayStation 3 hit the market, developer Sucker Punch released Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves on PS2, and then the studio moved on to the Infamous series, was purchased outright by Sony and seemed to have left its old mascot behind. But that didnt stop a green, eager developer from attempting what, to many, would be completely unthinkable. Without permission or funding, Sanzaru Games began working on a PS3 version of Sly Cooper. When they finally showed it to Sony in prototype form, the corporation was so impressed that they gave it their stamp of approval and their blessing to continue what Sucker Punch had started. Now, here we are in 2013 with a fourth Sly Cooper game -- Thieves in Time -- and needless to say, Sly Cooper fans around the world should be thankful for Sanzarus daring, albeit flawed, gambit, as it represents a true return to the series they love. Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time isnt only a spiritual successor of the PlayStation 2-era series; its a faithful continuation of it. Slys signature 3D platforming with a hint of exploration and a spice of stealth is here in full effect. The game looks pretty, runs well (minus the heinous load times) and contains a fully fleshed-out story mode that, if explored in its entirety, could easily take 20 hours or more to complete. Plus, its on both PS3 and Vita, and you get both for the price of one as part of Sonys commendable Cross-Buy initiative, complete with cross-saving perks. Like many of the 3D platformers that populated the shelves of your local game store during the previous two console generations, Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time revolves around exploring wide open, cartoony locations. Set missions funnel you through the game, but like any good title in the genre, theres plenty to do beyond merely advancing the story. Much of Sly 4s draw is provided not only by its great cast of characters and compelling worlds to scour, but by the fact that you can put as much or as little into it as you want. You can just take in the story, or you can explore each and every nook and cranny of a map to find little rewards. The latter play style will obviously draw in those looking for some bang for their buck, but its safe to say that even the main story taken on its own is worth the price of admission. The game isnt difficult and rarely provides a true challenge, but its still great for both kids and adults. Sly Cooper: Thieves in Times story is silly  nonsensical, even  but the characters surrounding the plot will quickly draw you in to the experience. Sly is as dashing and cunning as ever. His best friends, Bentley the tech-savvy turtle and Murray the oversized pink hippo, round out the core squad, and the constant exchanges between these three are laugh-out-loud funny. Their dialogue is expertly written and the voice acting is superbly done. Expect to chuckle often, whether Bentley is making fun of Slys strange sense of humor, Murray is talking about himself endlessly in the third person, and more. Its not every day a game comes along that can make you laugh; Thieves in Time does so with regularity, and its what I love most about the game. Its commendable quirks  from a humorous one-liner to a goofy enemy design  are around every corner. He's back. A cast of new characters enter the fray in Thieves in Time, rounding out its story and giving players a slew of fresh faces to fall in love with. Paramount among them is the games antagonist, a thieving skunk named Le Paradox. Le Paradox, in a feat of time traveling madness, has set his eyes on relics from the past in order to bring him fame and riches in the present, and it just so happens that hes targeted very specific items owned by some of Sly Coopers ancestors. Shockingly (or not), Sly is drawn in to the intrigue when its clear that these thefts have hit very close to home. This requires him to make quick work of Le Paradoxs cast of goons, from a rapping, ice skating bear to a frustrated elephant reeling from a failed musical career. In other words, vintage, over-the-top Sly Cooper. Slys ancestors  ranging between a bumbling cave man and a skilled ninja to a sharp-shooting old westerner and a smooth-talking knight  constitute all-new playable characters for you to experiment with. Furthermore (and perhaps more importantly), traveling to these ancestors native times and meeting them will give Sly access to new outfits that will grant him special skills on the fly. Slys Renaissance-based ancestor will give him archery skills, allowing Sly to use arrows to hit far away switches and connect distant areas with ropes, while traveling to ancient Arabia will allow Sly to slow down time, giving him an edge both in battle and while platforming. Platforming can be frustrating from time to time, especially due to occasionally wonky camera angles and Slys emphasis on old-school mechanics: you still have to jump towards a rope, pillar or spire and then press circle to land on it. But Slys hodgepodge of new costumes  and hence moves  keeps things fresh and fun, even if its built over a style of game thats admittedly archaic. In a game that rarely emphasizes (or even encourages) combat outside of boss battles, learning new skills gives players different ways to interact with the games various environments. Exploration and dodging confrontation is often the name of the game in a Sly Cooper adventure (even as youre robbing your foes blind), so while you can openly explore environments with Bentley, Murray or even Slys sometimes-girlfriend Carmelita, youll likely find the most gaming pleasure out of playing with Sly himself, as he provides the most versatility. Regardless of your character preference, however, when you consider that all five of Slys ancestors are playable, plus Sly and his friends, youre looking at an impressive roster of nine totally unique playable characters in Sly 4 by the time you reach the endgame. As each of the games five core territories are uncovered, it will quickly become clear that there are certain things that cant be done and certain areas that cant be accessed. With moves learned in the future (sometimes literally), Sly and his friends can travel back to a previous location to see and do everything. Even though Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time has a robust story delivered linearly, with a bunch of missions in each area, territories can be explored non-linearly. There are a bunch of collectibles to find  bottles, masks, treasures and the like  and finding everything will keep you very busy apart from the narrative itself. The more time you sink into the game, the more you can extract out of it. In this sense, the game provides a great balance, as well as a fantastic stick-drawn carrot that keeps you plunging further and further into the digital ether, but only if you really want to (and I suspect you will). Time to explore. Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time takes full advantage of Sonys commendable Cross-Buy program; its available for both PS3 and Vita, and you get both for the price of one. Better yet, that price isnt $60, but $40, making Sly Cooper  pardon the totally intentional pun  an absolute steal. Saves can be transferred seamlessly between the PS3 and Vita via dedicated cloud saving, and the games play pretty much identically on both platforms. It is worth noting, however, that the Vita version of the game takes a noticeable graphical hit; indeed, the game is far more at home on the PS3 in nearly every conceivable way. But no matter which version you play, youll be dealing with Thieves in Times heinous load times, which are completely inescapable and easily represent Sly 4s most glaring technical problem. Youll also have to deal with the occasional bout of motion controls on both platforms, something seemingly ripped out of 2007, and something that suggests a subtle tone-deafness in terms of modern game design. THE VERDICT Whats perhaps most striking about playing a Sly Cooper game late in the PS3 generation is how it proves that the brand itself is still relevant, as is the mascot-based 3D platformer. While similar PlayStation series like Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank have either disappeared entirely or gone in new and strange directions respectively, the fourth Sly Cooper game is true to itself. The decision to remain true to what made Sly great in the first place is daring in an age where the 3D platformer can come off as a dinosaur. Sure, Sly 4 has ridiculous load times, occasionally frustrating gameplay and some bizarre, archaic motion controls, but dont let that deter you: Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a worthy game to add to your library on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. It does so many things right and harkens back to a different time in gaming while modernizing the experience for a new generation. It may not wow you like some of the best PlayStation exclusives have in the past, but needless to say, the wait for a continuation of the Sly saga was officially worth it.", "date": "Feb. 6, 2013,"}
