The majority of Turf Wars, the second of Spider-Mans three-part DLC plotline, takes place almost entirely against a slate-grey sky, sapping the colour from this usually vibrant depiction of New York. Its an intended and effective metaphor, of course  things have taken a dark turn, with mob boss Hammerhead running rampant across the city. But, unintentionally, it sums up how I feel about Turf Wars, too  this is a greyer experience than first outing, The Heist. Peter Parkers more worried (and crucially, less quippy), and the mixture of extra story missions and challenges is beginning to feel rather expected. Its still the same game fundamentally, it just doesnt feel quite as exciting. In fact, the structure is identical to The Heist. Setting aside the story for a moment, we have more emergent crimes to fight, this time swapping the last episodes Spider-Bot diversions for a far more interesting recurring mission in which you protect a police convoy from threats on its route through the city. Rather than paintings to find we have Hammerhead Fronts to take down, but these completely recycle the Demon Hideouts' structure, right down to making you enter through the roof (albeit placing the fights in more interesting locations than just generic warehouse). Finally, there are the Screwball Challenges, which not only force us to listen to more of the purposely irritating supervillain/streamer but introduce a frankly terrible new stealth minigame to the mix which, mercifully, you only have to play through twice. Please, Insomniac: let this be a lesson that time-based scoring, wonky targeting, and milky, hard-to-see, instant-fail spotlights should not be reused when Screwball inevitably pops back up in part three. The sweetener here is that completing all of the above unlocks one of the best outfits yet, the anime-styled (and proportioned) Spider-Clan suit, which finally gives the fantastic comic book-shaded suit a run for its money. Thankfully, the hour and a half of extra story content is far less predictable than the extra gameplay around it. With a mob boss as our new villain, Petes back working alongside Captain Yuri Watanabe, who gets a chance to develop a more fleshed-out personality than the role of superheros phone-a-friend she played in the main story. Sadly, I have to report that some fans favourite character, Spider-Cop, does not make a return alongside her. Together, the duo uncover and attempt to thwart an ever-thickening plot from Hammerhead as he attempts to wrest control from other Mafia sorry, Maggia families across Manhattan. In the course of events, were introduced to a new enemy type: mob wiseguys whove swapped suits for jetpacks and energy shields, and have a tendency to rhino-charge your way. Theyre not a brilliant fight in and of themselves, but they add another wrinkle to some already busy combat. As befits a fight against crime, this a far more action-oriented set of missions than The Heists more stealthy approach, more often than not turning into mass brawls pretty quickly. Thankfully, The Heists best innovation in that area  adding extra objectives mid-fight  returns more than once, with one finale set-piece involving a concrete mixer feeling particularly perilous. All this fighting is, once again, definitively end-game content. Even with 100% completion and a full complement of abilities and gadgets under my belt, the sheer scale and length of some of the fights here led me to a few retries. Its another welcome chance to test your skill after tens of hours of practice. As is so often the case with a second act, the end is where Turf Wars truly shines. As the cloudy day gives way to a moonlit night, everything kicks up a notch. Fights give way to a boss battle, which in turn gives way to a tantalising ending. Where The Heists cliffhanger left me fairly certain I knew what might be going on in Turf Wars, the second DLCs conclusion leaves me far less sure about where episode three, Silver Lining, is headed. It might not be the standout standalone pack some will want, but Turf Wars is definitely doing its job as the second of three parts by leaving us ready and waiting for a far brighter finale.", "date": "Nov. 22, 2018,"}
