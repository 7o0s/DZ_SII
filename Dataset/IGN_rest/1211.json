How does the balancing act at the centre of all families - the small decisions that we make to keep each other happy - ultimately affect the people involved? These are the questions that The Novelist poses, and though it doesnt answer them brilliantly, the fact that it poses them at all makes this an interesting way to pass a few hours. Some shortcomings in its story and characterisation make it less sympathetic than Id hoped, and as a result The Novelist not quite as impactful as it wishes to be. The Novelist is superficially similar to Gone Home, in that you explore a family home and uncover their relationships and secrets, but here you play as a disembodied presence  a spirit that can inhabit light fittings and briefly possess the three members of the Kaplan family to hear brief snippets of their memories. By learning more about each of them, you find out what would make them happy, and whisper suggestions to them as they lie dreaming that determine the course of events. Its about the difficulty of balancing work and family life, and the seeming impossibility of both realising your own selfish dreams and keeping the people that you love happy. Its purposefully simplistic, working well within the design constraints implicit in a game made by one person; both you and the family are restricted to within the walls of the house, and apart from staying out of sight, all you really have to do is observe. The titular novelist is the familys father, Dan, who is suffering both writers block and a failing marriage, and takes his wife and child to a big old isolated house for a three-month summer break. As a ghostly busybody, you spy on them, reading their letters and staying out of sight  they get spooked if they notice you drifting around, but in practical sense the stealth element is meaningless, and there are only consequences for being seen if youre extremely careless. At the end of each day you have to choose which family member to please by, say, suggesting that Dan take Tommy to the beach rather than try to write another chapter, and watch the sometimes unexpected consequences of your choice play out. Theres a second aspect to the plot, and thats the history of the house itself, which has put a roof over the heads of many troubled souls in its time. At the end of each chapter (there are three in each of the three acts), you can explore the house freely whilst the Kaplans sleep, reading historical notes from the past that give a glimpse into the lives of previous occupants and hint at what you, as this ghostly presence might be doing there. This element is under-developed, limited to a few written diary entries that cut off abruptly and dont offer a satisfying resolution (it also makes no sense that they suddenly appear at night), but its a welcome break from the Kaplans nonetheless. Its a rather clichd premise (if not for a videogame, then certainly for fiction in a wider sense), but The Novelist sustains interest through its gentle element of mystery, and draws its characters well enough for you to care about what happens to them (and relate to them, now and then). It sometimes forces you to choose between them in terms of what will make you happy, which is not always an easy decision; I found myself constantly trying to keep the child happy, which is a very natural impulse, but its the parents happiness - particularly Dans - that drives the plot.Dan doesnt turn out to be quite the stereotypical self-obsessed writer type that I feared he would be, and gratifyingly his wife is more than a foil for his emotions and problems. The strained relationship between Dan and his wife is the most gratifying and believable aspect of the plot. Enjoying The Novelist requires a certain suspension of disbelief. This family indulges in a LOT of written communication in letters and journals, seemingly at the expense of actually talking to each other; as they go about their daily lives, all they ever say to each other is little soundbites. This is obviously a result of developmental constraints, but it still lends their lives an oddly sterile aspect. (Ive also got to ask why this novelist is still using a typewriter, though Im assuming its because The Novelist is set in the not-too-distant past.) Its not just that, though; the story isnt entirely consistent, either. It plays all the right emotional notes, but theres a lack of depth here that robs it of the impact that it wants to have. The two parents are reasonably well developed, if rather archetypal (he the tortured writer, she the sensitive artist), and their relationship is fundamentally believable, but its their child, Tommy, whose characterisation falls short. His emotions are conveyed entirely by the conveniently transparent pictures that he draws, showing himself and his dad on the beach, or bullies mocking him at school, or a scribbled-out picture of a book of reading exercises. You dont get any real sense of how he feels, and his communication with his parents is almost non-existent. Its an over-simplified portrait of childhood feelings and of the parent-child relationship, and you dont need to have small children in your life to notice its shortcomings. The plots resolution, too, oversimplifies what is otherwise a nuanced portrayal of the balancing act that goes on within families. Throughout the three months of the summer, making choices that serve one member of the family over the others shows short-lived but manageable consequences, but the final choice forces you to pick between two options, each of which is shown to essentially ruin the lives of different members of the family. However well youve balanced the Kaplans needs in the run-up to this decision, it will turn out one of two ways. Its jarringly determinist, and undermines the plots subtlety. The idea that one summer would determine the entire course of a familys life strikes me as narratively lazy, and its too convenient  thats just not how life works. Its as if, after they leave the house, they never once face another significant decision that might affect how their lives turn out. Life also isnt a binary choice between your own happiness and your familys. Its strange that The Novelist appears to initially understand that, but ultimately sets up a conclusion that reinforces that bizarre message. Pros Novel ideaDecent writingEffectively minimalist Cons Characterisation shortcomingsLacks depth As a game about family relationships The Novelist is interesting and relatable up to a point, but it doesnt have a great deal of emotional depth, and the further you get into it the more you notice the flaws in its characterisation. Despite that, though, its worth a few hours of your time. I cared enough about these characters to take an interest in their lives, and though the parent-child relationship comes up short, the parents struggles both individually and together are better realised.", "date": "Dec. 11, 2013,"}
