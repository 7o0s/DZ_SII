Based tangentially on characters and imagery from the 2015 interactive horror story from which it draws its name, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood fails to deliver anything new or remarkably exciting as a virtual reality experience, an arcade-style first-person shooter, or an Until Dawn spinoff. And yet, despite its relative blandness, there's something inviting about its cheesy brand of carnival-themed horror, casual arcade shooting, and gimmicky rollercoaster-based structure. While Rush of Blood is a pretty standard rail shooter, the ability to look around when you hear something creeping around behind you or see an enemy out of the corner of your eye makes the experience far more engaging in VR. Your field of play is effectively widened by the ability to quickly turn your head, so I was constantly scanning my environment  first out of caution, but eventually, when I realized Rush of Blood wasnt going to be very scary, out of obligation. Baddies often pop into your peripheral, making it important to actively look around so you can start blasting away with your dual firearms before they get too close. The shooting mechanics are simple and easy to grasp with either a DualShock 4 or the Move controllers, and feel just as fun and responsive with both. You always have two firearms at any given time, which you can control independent of each other with the Move controllers. Using a DualShock 4 grants you less precise control by keeping the guns locked together, but doesnt sacrifice too much in terms of ease of use. You can still use the motion controls to point them freely, but need to make use of the analog sticks to widen or narrow the gap between. Once your targets lined up, its a simple pull of the triggers to shoot, and either the DualShocks bumpers or the Move controllers center Move button to reload. There's never a shortage of things to shoot.When it comes to targets, there's never a shortage of things to shoot, including inanimate filler objects to help keep your point multiplier going if youre chasing a high score, as well as special collectibles that kept me hyper-aware of my environment at all times. One major collectible announces its presence with the distant sound of a baby wailing, and thats one of the neat ways Rush of Blood uses sound to both build atmosphere and direct gameplay. Optional targets range in size from large crates to small vases and other objects, all conveniently marked with bullseyes. Some of the most satisfying moments in Rush of Blood came not from shooting away at waves of enemies, but quickly one-shotting every last optional target in a room. The flashlight beams that emit from both firearms act as laser sights that, in the absence of a crosshair, make sniping especially faraway objects possible in the darkness. None of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations.New weapon pickups are frequent and often placed before areas where youll need them most. Theyre also easy to see in large, festively colored crates that stand out against the drab greys and browns of most levels, with an easily identifiable silhouette of the weapon type on the front. Shooting a crate flings that weapon only into the hand you shot it with, so you can have fun mixing it up: I often found myself going for the short-range firepower of a shotgun in one hand while keeping one pistol for the long-range accuracy. Weapon crates always come in pairs though, so the option to trade off both handguns for alternatives, like the more powerful but ammo-limited dual revolvers or the speedy dual machine pistols, is always there. Special weapons are temporary, but its easy to glance down at the dashboard on your rollercoaster train to see how much ammo you have left. Once depleted, they automatically switch back to the default handguns, but that never felt like a bad thing. The starter pistols are reliable enough thanks to their infinite ammo and quick reloading to use exclusively  that is, if you can keep up with the longer waves of enemies in later levels. Until Dawn: Rush of Blood starts out strong, especially once it hits its stride after the tutorial-heavy first level. Youre introduced to the rollercoaster structure by a circus ringleader-type played by the same actor who portrayed The Stranger in Until Dawn, but who I believe is meant to be a different character. Rush of Blood seems to take place in the mind of Josh, considering the frequent cameos from his twin sisters, so it would make sense for him to reappropriate people hes met into new and strange roles. Not even this connection to the main game is very satisfying in terms of carrying on the Until Dawn story, though, and isnt really necessary to enjoy the experience. Still, the invitation to take a ride on a hellbound rollercoaster is tempting, albeit cheesy, and the ringleaders introductions to each of the seven total levels lent an admittedly lame, but flavorful sense of foreboding for what was to come.

Feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a walkthrough haunted house.Sadly, none of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations across the roughly 2 to 3 hours it takes to complete them all. Rush of Blood starts to show the most potential for scares in level two, a meandering tour of a slaughterhouse for giant pigs. After a few silent turns through a room full of oversized carcasses the killing machines sprung into action, filling my ears with the sound of whirring saw blades and shrieking pigs. This incredibly gory sequence then segues into an Until Dawn-inspired nightmare that presented some of the strongest imagery in the entire game. In one part, the rollercoaster train rolls down a steep drop into a pitch-black abyss and slows to a pace once it reaches a crowd of huge, naked, empty-eyed dolls representing Joshs friends. One of the dolls has a camera, filming you as you ride on past, just as they did with his sister Hannah the night she disappeared. The scene embodies the chilling nature of what these people did to humiliate their friend very well, but ultimately serves as an unusually eerie and bizarre high in a ride full of bland, boring lows. After level two the environments get less and less interesting, blurring together into the same boring combination of rickety buildings and musty caves with equally uninspired enemy designs. Youll fight evil clowns, annoying crows, giant spiders, and the dull, zombie-like wendigos recognizable from the main game. Sometimes, you can change things up by shooting railroad switches that pop up occasionally in most levels to change tracks and explore hidden side-passages full of targets, collectibles, and a much-needed change of scenery if youre on a second or third playthrough. Despite its blandness, it's still a decently fun ride.No matter how many detours you take though, it always culminates in an unremarkable final bossfight against an incredibly stupid-looking monster that seems out of place in something related to Until Dawn. I was drawn in far more by the use of 3D sounds in each level, which built an uncomfortable atmosphere while having the practical effect of alerting me to nearby threats. But as a result, jump scares are telegraphed way too often and the horror almost completely evaporates. After I realized how tame Rush of Bloods scares were going to be it took a lot of the edge off, and the experience suffered. Long stretches of inaction serve as a breather from the mostly wave-based combat, and a way to rest your arms from the inevitable fatigue caused by the motion controls, but happen a bit more frequently than I wouldve liked  a problem in levels that last only about five to 15 minutes. More often than not, Rush of Blood feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a slow walkthrough haunted house, and its about as scary too. Even as a mere horror-flavored rail shooter lacking in any serious scares, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood isnt terrible. Responsive, arcade-style shooting, the frequency of collectibles, optional side passages that add some sense of exploration to the linear rollercoaster, and an end-of-level letter grade system offer plenty of casual replayability. Coupled with its smooth, motion-based controls, and barring some of its weaker stages, Rush of Blood actually makes for a decently fun ride.", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
