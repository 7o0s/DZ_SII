Both present a hopeless, post-apocalyptic situation navigated by two characters  an adult and a child  with nothing but absolute despair surrounding them. Like The Road, The Last of Us is perpetually dangerous and unpredictable, and like The Road, what happened to get society to a point of rapid decay isnt the focus. Its the story of the characters at hand, and those characters alone, at the center of both plots. The beauty of The Last of Us when compared to The Road, however, is that its fully interactive, complete with all of the vulnerability, uncertainty and perpetual insecurity such a situation inherently provides. The Last of Us seamlessly intertwines satisfying, choice-based gameplay with a stellar narrative. It never slows down, it never lets up, and frankly, it never disappoints. Its PlayStation 3s best exclusive, and the entire experience, from start to finish, is remarkable. I lost myself in Naughty Dogs vision of a pandemic-ridden United States, in the characters that populate this unfortunate wasteland, and in their individual stories. The 17 hours I spent playing through the campaign are among the most memorable Ive ever spent with a game. Joel remembers the world before the pandemic. Players are cast in the role of Joel, a grizzled and tired survivor stuck in a cycle any person could imagine finding oneself in two decades after the collapse of society. He takes odd jobs, acquires food, clothing, and shelter, and repeats the process endlessly, a process that only gets more arduous and desperate as time goes on. Joel does whats necessary to stay alive, and in the ruined United States he travels around, his survival often means someone elses untimely death. Occasionally haunted by his past but living in his dystopian present, Joel is surprisingly easy to root for. In many ways, hes strangely relatable. He retains shreds of his humanity as best he can, considering the extraordinary circumstances he finds himself in. He has a sharpness to him, but a tenderness, too, which he occasionally displays to his partner, a woman named Tess. In the 17 hours or so it took me to beat The Last of Us, I came to care about Joel, and I became invested in his story, and the stories of those he meets along the way. The Last of Us takes place in 2033, so the regular world Joel harkens back to on occasion is one you and I understand. Its fascinating to think about how hes evolved since the world crumbled around him, and even if he does whats necessary to stay alive  including stealing and murdering  its hard to fault him for it. In fact, one of the great ironies of The Last of Us is that youll be pulling for him no matter how dark things get, or how violent his actions are. He does whats required. Joel knows its either him or them. Theres no gray area. Joel can be cold and ruthless, but those around him have the propensity to be far worse. As riveting as Joel is, he isnt the only character of consequence in The Last of Us. Indeed, calling him the main character is true only to an extent, because its his companion, a young girl named Ellie, who truly steals the show. Joel makes a business arrangement early in the adventure to help transport Ellie across what remains of the United States, a wasteland marked with boundless wildlife alongside cities and towns ruthlessly reclaimed by nature. From there on out, the two are virtually inseparable, even if they are at first skeptical of one another, forced together by circumstances in a world where trust and faith are in extremely short supply. Joel and Ellie develop a sort of dysfunctional father-daughter relationship as their collective experiences bind them, and rooting for Ellie in particular is commonplace in The Last of Us. Her success means the player is successful, and her hardened exterior is the perfect complement to her complete ignorance of the world before it was destroyed. Ellie was born after the collapse, and as such, shes full of questions and wonder, often communicated through the many contextual conversations she and Joel share. Shell pick through records at a music store, become fascinated with wildlife shes never seen before, and ask a million questions about the past. You watch her learn, grow, and gain meaning. Its impossible not to become attached to her. The interplay between Joel and Ellie, as well as the other characters you meet on your adventure, is one of the great highlights in The Last of Us. Voice acting is not only consistently superb, but the games graphical beauty makes the events of The Last of Us overflow with realism. Everything that happens is immediately more memorable, more powerful, and more poignant because your surroundings are so believable. Forests, fields and wooded trails are overgrown, dense, and lush. Abandoned villages and metropolises alike are eerie, silent, and crumbling. Each environment is unique, thoughtfully created, and bursting with little details, including notes, letters, voice recorders and more that tell ancillary stories of survivors you rarely ever meet in person. The game took me so long to beat because I was obsessed with seeing every inch of it. The Last of Us demands exploration, not only to scour for needed supplies, but to satisfy your curiosity. Joel and Ellie's endless chatter is one of The Last of Us' highlights. The Last of Us is undoubtedly pretty to look at, but that beauty is often overshadowed by imminent peril. Joel and Ellie will confront enemies in all of the various locations they visit, and these battles represent the other side of what makes The Last of Us shine. Combat is tense and nerve-racking. Fighting is as emotionally taxing as it is physically dangerous, because the people Joel fights are, like him, just normal folks trying to survive. In a world where everyone has a singular motivation to keep breathing for one more day, its hard to judge even the harshest remnants of humanity you encounter. Stealthily killing entire rooms of enemies is incredibly satisfying, so much so that when you blow your cover, its hard not to feel a sense of disappointment (especially when one of your companions occasionally fires a gun or walks in front of an enemy, which you cant control). Holding down R2 while crouching lets Joel listen carefully to his surroundings, giving him a glimpse of enemy locations in his direct vicinity and an edge in staying away from danger. Some players may consider this a bit cheap, but Id merely call it gamey. Just like the L3 prompts that tell you where to look and hints that appear if the game determines youve been stuck in an area too long (all of which can be turned off), Joels listening skill can simply be ignored if you feel like it doesnt fit. But rest assured, its very helpful, especially later in your quest. The beauty of stealth in The Last of Us is the incredible, uncomfortable realism youre forced to witness each and every time you execute a silent kill. Watching a survivor fruitlessly swat at Joels arms as he strangles him to death is disturbing, as is quickly shiving a man in his neck and listening to him gurgle some parting breaths as he collapses to the ground. The Last of Us does a phenomenal job of making each and every enemy feel human. Every life taken has weight and each target feels unique and alive. Its hard not to think about some of the older folks in particular, ones that remember the real world, lived in it, and were once normal. Theres an emotional pang when youre taking out thugs that look a whole lot like you and your allies. Of course, there are enemies that are decidedly inhuman in The Last of Us, too. The collapse of society was instigated by the sudden prevalence of a fungus that wreaks havoc on the human mind, and those humans  known not-so-lovingly as The Infected  are alive, but not well. No matter which faction of humanity a person falls on, whether hes with the remnants of the federal government, or rogue groups known as Hunters, or even the mysterious resistance organization known as The Fireflies, everyone is united against The Infected. This is simply because The Infected can in turn infect others, further eroding humanitys already dwindling numbers. They are a perpetual threat to even the slightest hope that humanity can one day step back from the precipice of extinction, and running into them is always frightening. Unlike your human adversaries, who often work together, audibly communicate, plan their actions, and practice self-preservation, The Infected attack with reckless abandon, with absolutely no regard for their safety and with every intention of killing you. Fighting them is terrifying, especially during your first few encounters, and feels completely different than your engagements with pockets of humanity. The lesser versions of The Infected, colloquially known as Runners, can be taken out with firearms and melee strikes alike, but its the Clickers  characters so infected by the Cordyceps fungus that they cant even see  that will haunt your dreams. They can only be killed with silent shiv strikes or via firearm  silence is more often than not your best weapon against them -- but if they so much as get their hands on you, its game over. In this world, they are the true threat. Its unlikely youll ever get comfortable dealing with them, of being mere feet away from them, crouching, hoping they dont somehow sense you. Another brilliant aspect of The Last of Us is its crafting options, all of which happen in real-time. With the exception of actually going to a pause menu, theres no way to stop the action, so you need to find lulls in order to scavenge for items, put them together and create new goods that can be used both curatively and offensively. The system is extra tense considering you can use, say, alcohol and rags to create either a healing pack or a Molotov Cocktail, but not both with the same goods. Thoroughly exploring environments nets you the components necessary for item creation, giving you yet another reason to inspect surroundings already begging to be rummaged. And item scarcity, a perpetual issue in the world of The Last of Us, means that everything you find is precious in its own way. There arent any factories making more of anything you find, and that includes the greatest prize of all: bullets. Ellie is undeniably the star of the show. This perpetuates real consequences based on your decisions. Will you use those scissors and some tape to create a shiv? Or will you attach them to the end of a pole to create a makeshift weapon of war? Will you create a smoke bomb only because you found sugar in the environment and can only carry more if you use what you already have? Or do you bypass the sugar and hope you dont need it  or what you can make from it  later on? Will you opt for melee strikes to save ammo for another day? Or will you walk in guns-blazing and hope you find shells on the bodies you leave in your wake? How you choose to navigate these forks in the road have considerable effects on how you approach future enemy encounters, adding a special dynamic to The Last of Us not found in very many games. Joel can also upgrade himself with pills and other supplements hidden throughout the adventure, though here youll also have to make careful choices, as there isnt enough medicine in one playthrough to fully upgrade him. Likewise, all of your weapons, from pistols to shotguns and rifles, can also be upgraded using parts and tools found on your journey. Similarly, you wont be able to max-out everything, so youll need to make thoughtful decisions. This adds an analytical, tactical slant to The Last of Us not found in the likes of Uncharted, though if you really want to upgrade Joel and his goods fully, you could always take advantage of The Last of Us very welcome New Game+ feature. While the campaign is absolutely worth playing through multiple times, The Last of Us also comes packing a robust, rich multiplayer mode that isnt simply a retread of Uncharteds. In fact, The Last of Us multiplayer seems decidedly scaled back in order to fit it into the context of the post-civilization United States, with small player counts and only two modes that pay exceptional detail to the greater context of the single-player campaign. The Last of Us online functionality exists within a mode called Factions. Once you begin, you choose one of two sides and then jump into one of two sub-modes: Supply Raid and Survivors. Both are atypical in their approach, especially Survivors, which presents players with a best-of-seven series in a four-on-four match where death is brutally permanent. Survivors forces meticulous play virtually ripped right out of the campaign, except instead of fighting AI-controlled partners, youll be dealing with even smarter humans. Its a truly fun mode, one where every player on the map is overflowing with nerves and afraid to make a mistake. Supply Raid, on the other hand, is about whittling down your team by eroding their overall life count. Its more generic than its counterpart, but the idea of having a shared number of lives forces you to strive for better play. It makes you not want to be the reason your team loses, it makes you not want to make silly blunders. Like Survivors, Supply Raid also allows you to craft items on the fly using components found on the map and feels a whole lot like the single-player game. By scaling back the modes and the player counts from the likes of Uncharted, Naughty Dog has removed the tall barrier between single player and multiplayer and has made the two feel interconnected, even ancillarily. Playing The Last of Us online is exceptionally fun. Whats especially neat about The Last of Us online functionality is the metagame that transcends everything you do. When playing online, your character  who is fully customizable in both appearance and loadout  is the leader of a band of survivors. Successfully navigating online matches, collecting items and engaging in one-off challenges called Missions helps grow your band. Of course, if you fail, your band decreases in size. Its a simple system in premise, but its undeniably addicting when you start getting into it. It creates another, higher level, a different way to gauge your overall success by something other than wins or losses and your kill-to-death ratio. Like the single-player campaign, which judges your actions based on future consequences, so too does multiplayer in The Last of Us reward or detract based upon performances that, at the time, may not seem entirely consequential. Then again, The Last of Us is still all about its single player campaign. Many players will never jump online, and frankly, they wont be missing out on what truly makes the overall package so incredibly special, so exceptionally noteworthy, such a must-play experience. THE VERDICT PlayStation 3 isnt only well-known for its number of exclusive games, but for the sheer number of quality exclusives. Thats what makes The Last of Us even more impressive, because not only does it join the ranks of Uncharted, Killzone, God of War, Infamous and more, but it bests them all. In short, Naughty Dog has crafted a game that impresses in virtually every way. The Last of Us is a true feat. Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013. Pros Upgraded graphicsRuns at 60 FPSEnhanced gunplayPhoto modeDLC bundled in In 2013, I called The Last of Us on PlayStation 3 a masterpiece. The same holds true of its PlayStation 4 ~Remastered~ sibling. You cant go wrong with either version, but with Remastered youll get a better framerate that smooths out gunplay, a prettier, sharper look, and a bunch of DLC content rolled into the package from the get-go (not to mention a whole fresh set of Trophies to earn again, if you have a whole lot of time on your hands). Whether youve already experienced it on PlayStation 3 or have no idea what youre missing, The Last of Us: Remastered is worth your time and attention.
