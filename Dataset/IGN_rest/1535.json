How refreshing, then, that Warp puts us in the skin of a visitor from outer space escaping the cruel experiments of callous humans. The gameplay is described by the title: you can warp through walls and, delightfully, into the bodies of the people hunting you down. Turning people inside out will be one of this year's great enjoyments. Watch seven minutes of Warp. Warp mixes the old school, top-down stealth action of Metal Gear with the puzzle-solving, sense of humor, and white-and-orange color palette of Portal. Your goal is to warp your way out of the underwater laboratory where you and your fellow aliens are being held captive. For example, if a guard is coming you can warp into a canister and hide until the coast is clear. The underwater setting is both functional and awesome: it answers the question ~Why not just warp outside?~ and makes for some memorable scenery like when a giant shark swims by. Teleportation isn't the only trick this alien is capable of. You'll gradually gain the ability to create decoys of yourself that will distract the guards, launch projectiles in order to push far away buttons, and more. This is not a repetitive game -- each small victory brings new enemy types and new powers to play with, even late in the adventure. The developers were very clever in how they planned out the facility you must escape. Obstacles can often be overcome in multiple ways, giving players the chance to assess the situation and proceed as they see fit. Even though bursting people is gruesomely enjoyable, it is also possible to finish the game without killing anyone (and there is a trophy for doing so). Exploration is encouraged, as hard-to-reach grub worms can be ~spent~ to unlock alien upgrades. Checkpoints are placed in all the right spots, alleviating the frustration you might otherwise feel with this sort of trial-and-error gameplay. The only time Warp frustrated me was during its final boss fight, an experience I found to be the opposite of fun, unfortunately. In general, the game started to fall apart in its final moments, with framerate issues beginning all of a sudden and a weird glitch that let me see the cut scene after the final boss fight even though I hadn't defeated him, yet. Warp doesn't boast the highest production values on PlayStation Network and you can tell where corners were cut -- there is one voice for all the scientists, everyone wears a mask to hide their individual faces, and the one face you do see has lips that don't move. But the game is so much damn fun, all of that can be overlooked (even that disappointing final boss fight). Warp tracks all kinds of data to feed its leaderboards, everything from distance traveled to enemies killed to the number of times you've warped. When you reach a milestone your progress will appear onscreen, measured against those of your friends. It's a really nice way of making a single-player game feel like a communal experience. It took me just over five hours to complete Warp. Outside of the story are several time challenges that live up to their name. CLOSING COMMENTS Brainy and amusing, Warp is highly recommended stealth/puzzle fare, despite some hiccups right at the end. From a humble, enticing premise -- an alien that can teleport needs to escape a laboratory -- layers of gameplay variation are neatly introduced until you've warped your way through a rich, satisfying adventure. It does just the right amount of hand-holding so that you always know what needs to be done and where to go but often leaves the ~how~ up to you. Perhaps most importantly, it lets us do something we haven't done before -- bring our enemies' insides to the outside. And that's something I'll remember.
