The first handheld installment of the excellent Super Smash Bros. series lives up to incredibly high standards. Like its console siblings, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS elegantly packages decades of Nintendos best video game mascots into a pick-up-and-play portable game. But the real surprise here is the diverse modes of play thatve kept me playing feverishly for days. Smash 3DS builds a fast and fun four-player brawler out of prolific video game characters and universes. Each one uses the same inputs to activate their unique moves, so once youve learned one, you can play all 48 of them. Winning is about knowing the right time to use Marios fireball, which is different from Marths Dancing Blade, in effort to knock everyone else out of the ring with a perfectly timed Smash attack. Characters, stages, items, and assist trophies pull inspiration from a diverse selection of games and showcase lots tiny details that highlight each ones special qualities. From the start, the variety of the 36-character roster impressed me, and 12 more fighters are unlocked over time. Newcomers like Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening, Rosalina & Luma from Super Mario Galaxy, Little Mac from Punch Out!!!, and more join the battle alongside mainstays like Mario, Link, Pikachu, and Samus. Even non-Nintendo characters like Pac-Man and Mega Man are embraced with genuine reverence to their source material. Wii Fit Trainer is a great example of the humor: This silly callout to the massively popular Wii Fit series transforms the peaceful art of Yoga into a fun fighting style. I love how she doles out helpful advice in between all the hits. That same attention to detail in all the characters meant I was constantly finding something new and fun for dozens of hours. All of the action in Smash 3DS moves at a solid 60 frames per second. I noticed that characters appear a little chunkier than their console counterparts, but that has the effect of making them easier to see. A helpful red or blue outline communicates which side youre playing for in Team versus mode, which is a big help in a crazy brawl. However, Nintendo hasnt managed to solve one significant issue when bringing Smash Bros. to the 3DS: Namely, its difficult to keep track of characters whenever the camera zooms out in heated four-player matches. Theyre just too tiny! A targeting box activated via the 3DS touch screen helped a little, but it feels like a band-aid solution for a larger problem. Scaling down to three player free-for-alls makes things much easier to follow, but one-on-one play shows off this handheld version in the best environment possible. What really impresses me about Smash 3DS is the many ways to play, and its many layers of unique customization. Building custom fighters is an easy process, too. It lets you define layers of equipment that affect easy-to-understand parameters of power, defense, and speed. Improving one area decreases the value of another, so I could weigh out several options and settle on the fighter that works for me. Mii Fighter special moves are, thankfully, all unlocked from the start, but custom moves for main roster need to be unlocked. Menus feel a little scattered, but once I learned where everything is, it was easy to jump into solo, local, or online play. I can easily switch up rules before a match, and select from several different stage variations. Theres even a helpful lobby to practice in before a host launches a local match. Online play is carefully separated, so you can jump between ranked matches, smashing with friends, spectating online bouts, or even a custom replay channel where you can watch one character to learn what attack combinations people are using. Of the eight modes Smash 3DS gives you to choose from, I spent a lot of time switching between regular matches, variations of Multi-man Smash, and online one-vs-one play the most. All-Star mode took me through a chronological history of Smash Bros. that started in the early 80s and ended in 2013. Classic mode resembles the single-player mode in GameCubes Smash Melee, but with a twist: I could choose my next challenge on a map and pick up trophies and gold to unlock even more stuff. Sadly, the random nature behind the exclusive 3DS mode, called Smash Run, make it the one part of Smash 3DS I had trouble enjoying. The core idea itself is a gluttonous stat grab where you have to spend five minutes at a time collecting power ups that increase speed, jump, attack, special, arms, and defense to prepare for a final battle or a randomized competition like a race. The AI enemies in Smash Runs generic sprawling area are unrelenting, which is fine, but the randomly selected final match could be something Im completely unprepared for because I didnt have the right stats needed to win that type of challenge. Being the slowest runner in a race just isnt fun. If Smash Run leveraged some insight into the final fight, it could be a lot more memorable than what it currently is. Pros Easy controlsGreat modesLots of unlockables Cons Tiny 4-player charactersSmash Run mode Smash 3DS is impressive and, for the most part, feels right at home on 3DS. The multitude of ways to play and awesome customization gave me many reasons to keep fighting - and Ive been at it for more than 45 hours already. It all produces a fun feedback loop of engaging in matches to unlock custom moves and trophies, then jumping into another match to try out the new stuff. Even the online modes feel carefully considered and focused on what the series does best, and what the 3DS can reasonably do. Its a little disappointing that the four-player antics that are the best part of the console games dont really work on a small screen, but theres still more than enough that does work to make Smash a great 3DS game.", "date": "Sept. 26, 2014"}
