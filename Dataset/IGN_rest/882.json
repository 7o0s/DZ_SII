The good news is Apotheon successfully captures both the artstyle of Ancient Greece and the feel of its ancient predecessors by featuring clever level designs filled with allies and enemies that evoke images of powerful Greek gods and heroes. The bad news is slightly clumsy controls and a flimsy story prevent Apotheon from reaching Olympian heights. Man vs. Olympian is an ancient plot, and nothing new to games. God of War, Kid Icarus, The Battle of Olympus, and even Altered Beast all tackle the subject with varying degrees of success. But while God of War has a complex story revolving around a complex hero, Apotheon does very little to establish its protagonist as a person. All I know about the heroic Nikandreos is that he must travel to Olympus and defeat gods who no longer have a use for humanity. True, the 80s sidescrollers Apotheon emulates had almost no story whatsoever, but I was disappointed developer Alien Trap didn't create a deeper tale to match its art. I did learn quite a few things about ancient Greece during my 15-hour adventure, however. There are numerous stone steles sprinkled throughout the immortal realm of Olympus, with enjoyable quotes from ancient writers explaining the character and purpose of each Olympian. Hera has reared a violent son whom she has borne to Zeus: Ares, a god irascible, hard to govern, one whose mind knew no respect, warns Aeschylus on a stele outside the war gods domain. Clever level designs meanwhile feature environments and enemies that reflect each gods power, such as Ares blood-soaked arena full of crazed hoplite warriors, and Athenas palace, where a revolving platform maze full of puzzles and deadly mechanical devices require as much mental effort as physical; fitting for the goddess of war and wisdom. Each gods domain can be visited in almost any order too, which gives the world a refreshingly quasi-open feel. I also dug how weapons and armor have accurate names, and behave as expected: I used long-shafted spears called doru (historically used in phalanx battles) to keep enemies at a distance, but when they got in close I had to either quickly switch to my xiphos (a short sword), defend myself with a shield, or roll out of the way. And if that didnt work, I could try luring enemies into a well-placed trap. Having to use different weapons and strategies on the fly added a nice sense of realism to battle, though using the quick-toggle feature to navigate my inventory columns wasnt as smooth. More than once I got killed because I couldn't cycle through weapons quickly enough to equip what I needed when I needed it (as opposed to one-button equipping), which was difficult to do when enemies were dogpiling me. (I could pause combat and access my inventory from the main menu, but that slowed the flow of gameplay.) And although I had a type of auto-aim for launching missiles at enemies, manually trying to line up a shot (as is required by certain puzzles) was an exercise in patience due to a fussy aiming mechanic: I wasted about 20 arrows trying to hit a device that would open a door in Athenas maze. Neither of those issues was nearly as annoying as the sticky platform controls, though. Many fights against the Olympians required being able to quickly leap from platform to platform to avoid attacks, a tricky thing to do with a hero that sticks to corners like gum. There were also times when Nikandreos refused to land on a platform that it looked like he should be able to reach, as if his trajectory was always just slightly off, which resulted in some nasty falls that drained my health. These issues didnt bother me much in the beginning, but as levels became more platform intensive and battles more fierce, my feelings or frustration began to grow. I cursed Apotheon out after repeatedly getting hit by lightning bolts because Nikandreos refused to jump onto a column, then clung to the corner of a statue just a second too long, giving the enemy time to attack. While I have mixed feelings about the platforming and inventory management, I have no doubts about Apotheons stunning look and feel. Im smitten by the art style, which pays homage to Greek amphora found in museums throughout the world. Vibrant coral reds and creamy yellows evoke the colorful glazes used to decorate ancient pottery, and real statues and murals are lovingly recreated. (The Statue of Zeus at Olympia is one example). And I love the pinwheel joints and enigmatic expressions of the characters, which are so emblematic of the Archaic style. The music is just as authentic; the soothing sounds of a plucked lyre while hunting in a sacred forest, and heavy drums booming as I sparred with guards who caught me pilfering jars in the public market creates a great atmosphere. Apotheon includes local two-player competitive mode, which allowed me and a friend to take up arms against each other. The result was a brief run of amusing moments, like when my partner accidentally set himself on fire after throwing a boulder into an oil lamp, or when I comically flew backwards after being skewed by javelin. However, after a few rounds our heroic duels became repetitive. Pros Beautiful artAtmospheric musicWeapon realism Cons Frustrating movementTricky inventory I give Apotheon high praise for its homage to old-school side-scrolling adventures and its ability to recreate the captivating style of Ancient Greek art. Unfortunately, a ho-hum story and frustrating controls prevent me from doing the same for its moment-to-moment gameplay. No matter how pretty it is, unless it nails the feeling of movement and smooth combat, an action-platformer cant be much more than an enjoyable diversion.", "date": "Feb. 5, 2015,"}
