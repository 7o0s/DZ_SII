{"name": "Zero Age", "name_review": "Zero Age Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/zero-age-ipad/95474/review/zero-age-review", "text": "At first glance ZeroAge looks just like another game in the AppStore; however when you fire it up and give it a go, this one is quite a gem, especially if youre a fan of puzzles. The idea of the game is to move a tiny wizard-like character through a geometric multilevelled maze by manipulating square blocks in one way or another to construct a way for him to get from point A to point B. Things get harder once other abilities (such as transforming existing blocks in different ways via newly unlocked beam powers) are introduced in to the puzzles making the puzzles a whole lot more complex and challenging with every step. You start off just by moving blocks either vertically or horizontally to construct a staircase for the wizard to get through to the end point (marked by the red outline). As you progress through puzzles, things get more complicated with the addition of not only multiple blocks but also vertical and horizontal beams, all made to work together somehow. In addition to all of the above, the wizard needs to avoid threats like lasers (which can be blocked by one of the blocks). As things get more complicated, its handy that puzzles can be reset if you ever find yourself royally stuck with one. For practice you can head over to the Sandbox and toy with manipulating the blocks this way and that until you get used to the controls and figure out the various ways the blocks can be manipulated in the game. Some blocks can only be moved horizontally whilst others can be moved vertically and so on. The sandbox is very handy, if youre new to the game, otherwise, the initial levels of chapter 1 work like a tutorial by providing handy hints about manipulating the blocks or the game environment around you. In a way, the game play is somewhat reminiscent of games such as Portal and Smash Hit. Primarily, it is the idea of figuring out how to get from one end of the room to the next of Portal blended in with the geometric environment of Smash Hit; however, Zero Age stands alone and apart from such games, and it stands well on its own two feet, at that. The game features gorgeous visuals, sleek graphics and an environment one can easily get lost in, in part thanks to the choice of music which also supplements the gaming environment. The first time I fired up the game and heard the classical piano tunes of who turned out to be Sergey Rachmaninov, I thought huh, this is different. The soundtrack and the choice of character (just a pointy hat with a coat, really) adds another level of genius simplicity to the game itself. It just works, somehow. The character is also kind of cute, Ive found myself talking to the lil guy several times to get him to move where I want because the controls can get a little tetchy at times, failing to respond the way you intended them to, which is perhaps my only major annoyance with the game. Having said that, the game developers do warn that Zero Age is best experienced on the 4th Generation iPad or later, so if you have an earlier iPad, this could explain the sluggish controls from time to time. Pros Great visualsChallenging puzzles Cons No hint option if youre stuckControls can be a bit annoying It can be easy to tell yourself just one more puzzle and I can put my iPad down and go to bed/go to work, not so fast. Ive found myself playing well into the night and the wee hours of the morning whilst trying to solve one puzzle or another, only to slap myself across the forehead when Ive finally figured out the solution and it was so blindingly obvious to boot. It can be frustrating yet fun at the same time. A hint option would be handy if you find yourself hopelessly stuck on a puzzle for hours; however it can defeat the purpose of the game. Perhaps if the option was only available when youve spent an X-amount of time on one puzzle otherwise it can cause the player to put the game aside out of frustration. If you think you have great spatial awareness skills already, Zero Age will no doubt put them to the test. If your spatial awareness skills arent that great, thats fine, you can use this game as a tool to enhance those skills whilst you have a bit of fun doing it. <br><br> Zero Age is available for iPad now, at $2.99, its money well spent on a game that manages to toe the line of complex yet simple game play and strike a beautiful balance between the two.<br><br> <em>Editor's Note: A former freelance writer for MEGamers (now IGN Middle East) worked on Zero Age's development.
