EA has certainly put on a good show, and laid a sound foundation upon which to build the next UFC game, but several errant balance and design decisions regarding both striking and grappling knock the teeth out of what should feel like a high-stakes game of inches. UFC was built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it shows. These are some of the most impressive character models and animations Ive ever seen in a game. Even up close and in motion, they appear natural and believable. Especially during pre-match introductions, these virtual fighters convincingly exude the personalities of their real-life counterparts. Georges St-Pierre conducts himself with measured discipline, and The Axe Murderer creepily rolls his hands while maintaining an icy cold stare. Combined with the spot-on TV-style presentation and energetic commentary, these touches help successfully bottle the tone and energy of a big UFC pay-per-view event. Even when fists start flying, good transitional animations and hit reactions keep things looking fluid and organic, though its disappointing that most of the grappling animations are the same from character to character. That doesnt keep the sheer detail of the animations from impressing though. Skin ripples with impact, fighters visibly wince in pain with every crushing leg kick, and hands flail for leverage when the fight heads to the ground. These are flesh and blood warriors, not a pack of uncanny-looking puppets. Mixed Martial Arts is an extraordinarily complex sport, and Im pleased that EA tried not to dumb it down at all. There are a ton of options for attack, defense, stand-up, and mat-work, but its more than the control scheme can readily handle. Be prepared to hold multiple shoulder buttons while fiddling with the analog sticks and face buttons  all simultaneously. I got used to it, but this isnt a game most people should expect to pick up and play quickly. Where UFC really gets into the weeds is with its overall balance. Having watched a good share of mixed martial arts, its off-putting and deflating to see how the whole cast shrugs off shots that would fell even the stiffest-chinned fighters in the world. If Anderson Silva is whipping you around in a thai clinch, landing repeated knee-bombs to your face, that should be a wrap no matter who you are. The same goes for submission battles. The system behind these grappling chess matches is actually pretty fun, and its cool how it takes fighters stats and stamina into consideration. But every sub attempt becomes a minute-long, multi-staged duel no matter what. In fairness, this can happen in a real UFC fight, but just as often, great jiu-jitsu practitioners will find an opening and slap a quick hold on for a decisive tap-out. Its unpredictable and dangerous to attempt. The fact that you can absorb a seemingly endless amount of punishment, and have forever to wiggle free of submission attempts made me feel safe no matter the situationand safe is the opposite of how I want to feel in an MMA game. I want to think twice before throwing a punch when The Spider starts bobbing and weaving. I want to tremble in fear when BJ Penn starts smothering me with his rubber guard to set up a gogoplata. The same lack of stakes permeates the entire grappling game too. Sweeping and passing is just too easy, since you will always succeed unless your opponent does the correct counter. That might sound fair on paper, but in practice it takes all the urgency out of the ground game. Im never more than a single click of the analog stick away from getting back to my feet if my opponent misses their counter window, which makes fighting for a dominant position more or less meaningless. Is this real life? Outside of the ring, UFC has little of value to offer. Theres a series of challenges that teach you things that probably should have been in the annoyingly unskippable tutorial you get wrangled into on first boot up. Online play is functional, but the career mode is more or less an endlessly repeating cycle of boring, repetitive menus, and cheesy atta boy! FMVs. Customizing and progressing my fighter would have been a lot more fun if I didnt have to wade through so much tedium to do so. Pros Great controllerLots of media and peripheral optionsEasy gameplay sharing Cons Interface needs refinementNo DVR integration At the Xbox Ones launch, Microsoft took the position of wanting to be the console that offered everything in one place, but it didnt fully deliver on that. Now, a year later, the Xbox Ones major features have been strengthened enough so they clearly stand out, and the media-saturated environment they live in has also been nurtured and grown. Whether you come to your living room to watch video content or TV, listen to music, or play games, theres a lot to choose from in each category.<br><br> That said, there are still areas that need to be honed. The Xbox Ones interface needs refinement to make controller-only navigation feel simple; it cant rely on its alternative controls (SmartGlass, the optional Media Remote accessory) to shore up the gaps. And it wouldnt hurt if Microsoft worked with developers to eliminate lower resolutions and framerates in third-party games, as it currently makes the Xbox harder to choose for people who want to play the likes of Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age: Inquisition. But if Microsoft pushes out the same amount of substantial updates between now and next yearas it did between last year and nowthe Xbox Ones poised to become an amazing system by November 2015, no matter if it has Kinect or not.", "date": "June 21, 2014,"}
