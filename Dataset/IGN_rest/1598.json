Triple Town is a devilishly addictive puzzle game, masquerading as a town builder. Players place objects like grass, bushes and trees in a 6x6 grid. When three of the same object touch, they merge into a single new ~leveled up~ structure, earning players more points and freeing up valuable real estate. Three trees become a house, three houses an estate, three estates a mansion, and so-on. The better a player plans, the longer their round will last. Play it right and you'll perfectly line up three mansions & wrack up big points. But one mistake can lead to churches, houses and other structures littered around the field, making it tough to progress. Did we like it? Like all great puzzle games, Triple Town's simple concept hides an impressive amount of depth. It starts off light and breezy - turning grass into bushes, and bushes into trees. But due to all the triplication, making say a mansion requires 243 grass. Hence the need for expert planning. Triple Town is perfectly tuned  any time things are beginning to look too dire a wild card crystal or object-deleting robot comes up, allowing the round to continue. Triple Town's core matching gameplay is extremely addictive, but the package itself is brought down by its lack of depth and options. All players get is one 6x6 grid and a high-score table. Why not a puzzle mode, with pre-set challenges? Or pass-and-play multiplayer? Or more boards? The package feels a little light. Should you buy it? Triple Town's biggest downer is how developer Spry Fox has decided to monetize the title. The app itself is a free download, but it limits how many turns a player can make in one day. Purchasing unlimited turns (essentially unlocking the full game) is done via a $3.99 in-app purchase  perhaps a bit much for a tiny puzzle game. Players can also purchase wild card matching items and other power-ups via in-app purchase, somewhat tarnishing the game's leaderboards. Complaints aside, every round of Triple Town leads to at least an hour lost, staring into your iPad's screen, attempting to divine exactly where that bush needs to go to set you up right 20 moves down the line. Lost time is the true mark of any excellent puzzle game, and Triple Town gobbles it like a black hole. CLOSING COMMENTS Triple Town would be better off if it were sold like a standard puzzle game and included a few more options. But even in its basic state its match-3 town-building crack.
