Explore the Dungeon Because I DONT KNOW! is none of these things. Its a stunning disappointment that a game based on Adventure Time should display this little imagination. Explore the Dungeon doesnt set its sights too high, which is an encouraging sign for a licensed game that presumably had to be made in a short time with a limited budget. It doesnt attempt to be anything more than a simple dungeon crawler, sending you down into a 100-level dungeon to smash up skeletons and monsters, collect loot and meet occasional bosses as a group of four (Finn, Jake, Marceline and Cinnamon Bun, initially). Aesthetically, it goes for 16-bit retro, depicting its characters as colourful sprites and opening with a chiptune rendition of the awesome theme tune. But the execution messes up even this simple set of ideas. The most fundamental problem is that there is nothing interesting in the dungeon. Nothing whatsoever. There are no cool enemies, there are no hidden routes or secret passageways, there are no stranded characters or mini-stories or sub-quests to find, and most bafflingly there is no good loot. Basically all you ever find is money. You can pick up new weapons and badges that do things like slightly increase your max health, but there arent enough of them, and they dont appear with nearly enough frequency 15 levels down, my friends and I were finding exactly the same items in chests as we were at the top, and though the selection does expand further down theres never any mystery, and never any sense of excitement about what you might pick up. It completely fudges the basic Diablo-style compulsion loop that this genre relies upon. The enemies, meanwhile, are stunningly generic. With a cartoon universe as madcap as Adventure Time to draw upon you would hope that youd encounter more than skeletons, blobs and bats, but most of the time thats what youll be smashing. Theres also almost no skill at all to the simple combat beyond a timed block, which negates damage. Thats it. There are no special skills, and each character has just one special move. There was never much danger of dying  the reason I returned to the surface every five levels was not to regroup, but because I was so bored that I couldnt stand one more identikit, lifeless floor. The scenery changes now and then as you get further down through the dungeons levels, but not significantly enough to maintain interest. At first it looks like it might be randomly generated from a selection of generic walls, pits, enemy spawners and sparse decoration, such is the uninspired arrangement of these levels, but no  theyre the same every time. Every 20 floors theres a boss, but even these failed to imbue my play sessions with any excitement. What was the point of that?, said one of my exasperated play companions after wed vanquished the second one. It says a lot for Explore the Dungeon that the addition of other people, which can elevate even the most boring games, does nothing for it. It fails to provide the basic elements of co-operation and competition to make it an interesting multiplayer experience. Some characters can float over pits and others cant, which makes staying together difficult, and results in everyone wandering in disparate directions rather than working together as a team. It doesnt matter much, as working together is pointless when characters dont have complementary moves or skills. Its an exercise in collective tedium  nobody I played this game with wanted to persist after the first ten minutes. As if to hammer this home, when I first started playing on PS3 it froze up after the first ten levels and erased my progress twice  this was fixed by an update, but having to experience those dungeon floors three times gave me ample opportunity to admire how devoid of interest they truly were. Another deep-running problem is that Explore the Dungeon has no tangible sense of progression. Smashing up enemies doesnt yield XP, so youre not levelling up. Every time you dive into the dungeon you lose all the loot you gathered before, turning the game into an endurance test  you cant save up, so the only way to accumulate a decent amount of loot to buy new stuff is to stay down in the dungeon for as long as you can stand it. I have played countless average dungeon crawlers that manage to get that basic fight-loot-improve compulsion loop going, but Explore the Dungeon sadly isnt even average. The one thing it gets right is cute little 16-bit-style cutscenes , which retain a tiny bit of the Adventure Time spirit. But beyond the inclusion of the appropriate characters, you wouldnt be able to tell this is an Adventure Time game. Nothing about it really relates to or ties into the show in a meaningful way. Adventure Time is just a skin for an almost impressively boring dungeon crawler. Some of the dialogue even seems to have been ripped directly from old episodes rather than specially recorded. Pros Characters and voices from the show Cons Fundamentally boringStunningly unimaginativeNo good lootNot even fun in co-op Its unfortunate for Explore the Dungeon that we are living through an amazing period for dungeon crawlers and roguelikes, but even if we werent, it would stand out as depressingly uninventive and simplistic. Unlike the show its based on, its both deeply boring and devoid of imagination. For a real sense of adventure, play Spelunky.", "date": "Dec. 6, 2013,"}
