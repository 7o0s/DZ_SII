Released almost a year ago, the pocket-sized gamepad felt flimsy and cramped, but somehow commanded an $80 price tag at launch. And yet it was the best early option by far. That's no longer the case, thanks to the recent Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i and the MOGA Rebel, and now SteelSeries has upped its game with the Stratus XL. The difference between the two Stratus pads is night and day in every respect. Using the Xbox One controller as a clear inspiration (albeit with parallel analog sticks), the Stratus XL feels like a premium device. It's weighty and nicely contoured, and the surface doesn't have the low-grade feel that's unfortunately so common with mobile gamepads. In terms of build and design, it's easily the top pick for iPad gaming. And I specify iPad, because while it's certainly compatible with iPhone and iPod touch (wirelessly via Bluetooth), the Stratus XL breaks from the recent trend of including a foldout or attachable clip for mounting smaller devices. With many iPad owners also rocking an iPhone, simply sticking with a traditional console controller design seems a little shortsighted. And aside from creating your own mounting solution on a seatback or other confined space, I can't imagine many scenarios in which you'd want to use a controller at a distance from such a small screen. But there's a counterargument to be made, and it's a strong one: the Stratus XL seems so solid and well built because there aren't moving parts, and there weren't design considerations made for attachments. And there are surely iPad owners who don't have an iPhone, as well as those who probably don't want to play the kind of larger-scale, console-style gameswhich this kind of controller is built foron a tiny phone screen. If iPad gaming if your only focus, then it's a strong option. One caveat, however: the analog sticks do feel a little stiff, and the resulting inputs are a bit less subtle than desired. I found that increasing the analog sensitivity in certain games helped balance it out, like in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. And for most console ports or console-esque games, like BioShock, Real Racing 3, and Oceanhorn, the sticks totally did the job. But for a twitch game like Impossible Road, which doesn't have a controller sensitivity slider, the Stratus XL just can't handle the super-slight stick nudges needed for success. The MOGA Rebel responds similarly, after going back to compare the two, but the Micro C.T.R.L.i offers better analog sensitivity. That's why Mad Catz's smaller pad is still the best all-around iOS controller option today, but I suspect that the vast majority of players are more likely to use the Stratus XL with console-like 3D games that don't live and die with the most minute of analog inputs. At $70, the Stratus XL is still strangely more expensive than a DualShock 4 or Xbox One controllerbut compared to, say, Mad Catz's iOS pads, you're paying a little more for a sturdier-feeling peripheral. And note that the controller takes two AA batteries, although with a promised 40 hours of battery life, you shouldn't run through disposables too quickly. Pros Console-quality designPremium buildLong battery life Cons Stiff analog sticksCan't attach iPhone The SteelSeries Stratus XL is the first iOS gamepad that not only looks like a console controller, but finally feels like it too, with impressive heft and design plus a really durable build. The analog sticks are a little less sensitive than desired for subtle movements, which can make it a tricky option for certain twitchy, quick-reflex games. But for most controller-supporting games, it performs admirably, and should satisfy almost anyone looking for a console-like experience on iPad.", "date": "Feb. 12, 2015,"}
