Thats exactly what were doing today with the new MSI Optix MAG 321CQR Gaming Monitor (See it on Amazon). Its a large 32-inch curved display that aims at the sweet spot for features and performance. With a vertical resolution of 1440p and 144Hz refresh rate, its competitively priced at under $425 as of this writing. The market for these features is becoming increasingly crowded, so does the Optix MAG 321CQR do enough to set itself apart and demand your hard-earned dollars? Ive spent the last two weeks with the monitor to answer that exact question. MSI Optix MAG 321CQR Gaming Monitor  Design and Features Theres no way around it: the MAG 321CQR is a big monitor. At 32-inches, its panel takes up substantially more of your field of view than even a 27-inch monitor like the Gigabyte AORUS AD27QD I reviewed previously. Depending on your setup, this can be either a strength or a weakness. Youll need more space, for one, but 32-inches is about the point where I find myself having to turn my head slightly to take in the full screen. That said, 32-inches is easily my favorite screen size for gaming. After a couple of days, I adapted to the larger format and could begin sinking in to enjoy what I feel is a genuinely more immersive game experience. The extra screen real estate really does help to draw you into the game, especially in first-person shooters and RPGs like Skyrim. The 1800R curve - the same found on many Acer Predator gaming monitors and the AOC AG273QCXalso enhanced this effect. Until trying curved screen monitors for the first time last year, I was skeptical of whether or not the curve would make any difference at all; with TVs, I frankly didnt see the benefit. Since youre sitting so close to a monitor, the curve gives a slight wrap-around effect that you can actually feel and does enhance the experience slightly, especially on a massive panel. The effect is subtle; it doesnt make this monitor but it is a nice feature the improves the overall experience. I also didnt notice any text distortion at the edges which Ive encounters on smaller curved displays in the past. MSI has gone with a super narrow bezel design their product page describes as edge to edge. This is not an edge-to-edge display. A quarter inch black border trims the screen before getting to the plastic bezels. Super narrow still feels remarkably accurate, though. The plastic bezels themselves are only a couple of millimeters thick, so even with the black edges on the screen, it still feels very spacious. Compare the bezels here to the those on the Acer Predator XB273K and you can easily see the difference this style makes. The monitor comes with a high-quality stand that offers just over five inches of height adjustment. It also offers -5 to -20-degrees of tilt which came in handy when I wanted to stand at my desk. Theres no rotation since it's curved, however, so portrait mode is off the table and if you need to turn it, youll have to turn the entire stand. My biggest complaint about the stand is that it just doesnt grip the desk enough. More than once, I went to adjust the height and accidentally slid the monitor back so the rear leg pushed right off the edge. I also wish that you were able to lower the display more. If Im turning my head, usually its to look up and being able to move it just an inch or two lower would really help with that. Thankfully, the monitor supports VESA mounting, so its compatible with most aftermarket stands and mounts. Looking to the rear of the panel, we find the joystick for navigating the OSD and a little bit of RGB for ambient lighting. The lights are only on one side and really serve to accent the glossy black design on the back. Its a nice touch but like most rear-monitor lighting is forgotten about once the monitor is in turned around and in place. Theyre also just off or on, so there are no special effects built into the monitor to choose from. The implementation of the joystick is well thought out and I found it much easier to navigate than standard button controls. Navigating the OSD on the MAG is intuitive. It really is as simple as pressing in the direction you want to move and clicking to select. The large screen size also opens the door to picture-in-picture/picture-by-picture. Inside the OSD, MSI has hidden a handful of game-centric settings including a handful of preset picture effects for genres like Racing or FPS, a black tuner to quickly change the brightness of scenes, response time options to eliminate ghosting, and Anti Motion Blur and Zero Latency to ensure the picture stays crisp and input lag non-existent. Theres also an Alarm Clock setting which will display a countdown timer of anything from one minute to ninety minutes on different parts of your screen. You might be wondering why theyd call it an Alarm Clock when theres no alarm and no clock, and, well, so am I. Elsewhere in the OSD, youll find settings to adjust color balance, enable dynamic contrast, and change the shortcuts tied to the joystick. The large screen size also opens the door to picture-in-picture/picture-by-picture. Historically, Ive avoided PIP because the square is either too low or it takes up too much of the main display. Here though, its actually functional (though still small), so if you want to run two inputs and, say, stream an episode of Game of Thrones will you grind mobs, you can actually do that. On the other side, we have our I/O and power header. The MAG 321CQR supports two HDMI 2.0 inputs and a single DisplayPort 1.2. We also have two USB 2.0 headers, as well as a larger Type-B to transmit data to and from the PC. At this price point, Im disappointed to see USB 2.0 instead of 3.0. It will work fine for most peripherals but if youre using a thumb drive to transfer large files, the older standard can feel painfully slow. We also have a headphone jack as the monitor functions as a sound device but doesnt feature any speakers of its own. I'll give MSI kudos for including USB ports at all. Everything is fairly standard when it comes to I/O and Ill give MSI kudos for including USB ports at all. Its not a feature that I expect on monitor whose pricing is clearly skewed toward the large, high resolution and refresh rate screen. What I dislike is that theyve gone with an external power supply and the flimsy single pole connector in the back. The power brick for this display is large (roughly what youd find on a gaming laptop) and difficult to cable manage around. The header is also much less durable than the standard three prong connection used with most monitors. Its not a deal breaker, but Ive used multiple monitors with external power supplies and theyre always more trouble than theyre worth. Finally, we come to the bread and butter of this display: the panel. MSI has opted for a VA panel here which offers better colors, contrast, and viewing angles than the TN panels usually used in gaming monitors. Theyre a touch slower and more likely to result in ghosting, though companies have gotten quite good at driving VAs to be fast enough for competitive gaming. In fact, MSI quotes a response time of 1ms, which is identical to competitive TN panels. MSI has opted for a VA panel here which offers better colors, contrast, and viewing angles. The improved color reproduction and contrast also makes the MAG 321CQR fitting for hobbyist creative work. MSI quotes the DCI-P3 color spectrum at 92% and the sRGB reproduction at up to 122%. Interestingly, there is no sRGB mode, so youll need to manually flatten colors if you prefer to edit with less saturation. Likewise, this display doesnt support HDR and tops out at 8-bit color depth and 300 nits of brightness, so its not the best suited for real professional work, and HDR is a no-show. The MSI MAG 321CQR features a 2560x1440 resolution (1440p or 2K) with a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz. Tech writing has privileged me with the ability to try just about every major resolution and refresh rate popular on the market today and I firmly believe that this is the sweet spot for price, performance, and visuals. While 4K gaming might be tempting, the performance demands are huge. Even with two 2080 Tis, it can be a struggle to get new games to run at a consistent 60 FPS at 4K (Im looking at you Rage 2). At 1440p, however, even a last-gen GTX 1070 can push high frame rates. If you want to run at a full 144Hz, youll need a more powerful graphics card, but by and large, you can run a monitor like the MAG 321CQR far easier than any 4K display and youll have vastly improved visuals and smoothness over a normal 1080p/60Hz monitor. When I upgraded from 1080p/60Hz, I was surprised that even my desktop felt more smooth. The MAG321CQR also supports AMD FreeSync for gamers on Team Red. If youre running an Nvidia card, youre in luck as I was able to turn on and enjoy G-Sync just by checking the option inside the Nvidia Control Panel. It worked flawlessly; no hitching or stuttering, just buttery smooth gameplay thanks to the adaptive frame rate syncing. MSI Optix MAG 321CQR Gaming Monitor  Performance and Gaming To test the monitor, I used Lagoms LCD test pages. On the Black Level test, I was able to clearly make out each square, but when I assessed White Saturation, the pattern became washed out on the highest two squares. This indicates that while dark tone reproduction is good, you may lose some detail in the brightest scenes. On the Contrast and Gradient tests, I didnt notice any banding at all, so color presentation is in great shape. The gamma was ever so slightly too bright, though, and, bizarrely, theres no gamma control built into the OSD. I had to tweak contrast to bring it in line. Next up, I ran the Response Time and Ghosting tests. In the Response Time test, the darker squares (A-D) showed very pronounced flickering, indeed probably the worst of the last half dozen VA panels Ive reviewed from companies large and small. This indicates a slower response time; in fact, the flickering is substantially worse than the Massdrop Vast which quotes a 4ms response time on its VA panel - four times what MSI quotes! The lighter squares (E-H) were much better and showed almost no flickering at all. Changing the response time on the monitor didnt make any difference to these results. When I performed the Ghosting Test, I saw similar behavior with slower response in the darks than whites. In the picture above, you can see the two left-most bars in the center pattern are darker than the rest. These represent the dark-to-light transitions. The right-most bar is also dark, which shows the light-to-dark transition. Notice how the MAG 321CQR takes longer to transition out of black and into grey? Its worth noting that this behavior lessens the higher up the brightness scale you go. Ultimately, what this means is that, if the MAG 321CQR is going to show ghosting, its going to happen with dark objects turning light. In practice, while I thought I may have noticed here and there, it was never long enough or prevalent enough for me to say for sure. If I hadnt conducted the Lagom tests first and been actively looking for it, I doubt I would have noticed it at all. Ghosting is never a good thing but if its happening here, its so slight it's barely noticeable. MSI Optix MAG 321CQR Gaming Monitor  Performance To test monitors, my go-to genre is fast-paced first person shooters. Its a genre that demands responsiveness and detail to land shots and climb the leaderboard. As a result, I spent the most time in Battlefield V and APEX Legends. To round things out, I loaded up Divinity: Original Sin 2 to experience its gloriously saturated palette on the MAGs VA panel. In Battlefield V, the 1440p resolution looked glorious. The higher resolution allowed me to make out more details near and far. In the picture above, the far ridges were lined with snipers. I was able to pick out movement without looking through the scope, allowing me to spend less time hunting and more time lining up shots. The high refresh rate and FreeSync/G-Sync made movement feel extra smooth. There was no screen tearing whatsoever. Battlefield is a rough and tumble game series, as youre often diving onto the ground and whipping your weapon around in big arcs when on the move. Its important that the screen be fast enough to avoid motion blur or otherwise distorting the image. The MAG 321CQR did a good job here and stayed clear enough that I never once felt hindered. In APEX Legends, I was especially curious to see how well I would be able to pick out enemies in the highly saturated environments. In a game like this, improved colors and contrast should, in theory, make picking out hidden enemies easier. In reality, all the VA panel did was make the game look gorgeous with richer colors and better blacks. Where the VA panel did help was in dark settings at a distance, viewing enemies through windows, which is a directly result of its good contrast. I didnt notice any ghosting at all here or even suspect it. The real benefit came in just how smooth gameplay was. Like Battlefield V, the real benefit came in just how smooth gameplay was. If Battlefield V is about the rough and tumble, APEX is about the flow. With my RTX 2080, I was able to push upwards of 120 FPS consistently which G-Sync was able to control and make super smooth. Sliding down a hill in a mad rush to beat an enemy team at a fully synced 120+ FPS is a glorious thing. Finally, in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I enjoyed just how rich the colors were. The high refresh rate doesnt offer any competitive advantage but playing at 2K definitely allowed me to pick out extra detail in the environment. This helped me to sink into the world more and enjoy what the artists had created. Yet, for each of these games, I struggled to find something definitive about this display in particular. Companies like Viotek charge substantially less while offering very similar features and picture quality (with admittedly more limited stands). So while the MSI Optix MAG 321CQR is undoubtedly a good gaming display, I was a little disappointed to find that it didnt offer more to make itself stand out and in fact lacked in basic options like sRGB and Gamma correction. The MSI Optix MAG 321CQR is one of the most affordable 32-inch 1440p/144Hz monitors your can find from a major manufacturer. It has a great picture and it was good for gaming but comes with sacrifices in response time, color depth, and an external power supply that's kind of a pain. Faced with stiff competition from lesser-known brands like Pixio and Viotek, its a good monitor that falls short of great.", "date": "Aug. 22, 2019,"}
