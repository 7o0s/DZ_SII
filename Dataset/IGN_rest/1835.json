But while this adults-only point-and-click adventure initially resembles South Park: The Stick of Truth minus the turn-based fighting system, the combat isnt the only thing that its lacking. For starters, its story is somewhat poorly structured, with the Freakpocalypse event in question relegated to a cutscene in the cliffhanger ending. Its seemingly there purely as a device to set up the two sequels that are apparently planned for a later date. I was pretty surprised to see the closing credits roll just as I thought Freakpocalypses story had finally begun to get out of first gear, and I couldnt help but feel that  as a standalone game  Freakpocalypse comes across as noticeably unfinished, like abandoning a comic after reading the first panel in a three-panel strip. Happiness is a Warm Pun For the vast majority of its brisk four-hour runtime, Freakpocalypses plot centers around social outcast Cooper Coop McCarthy and his quest to avoid bullies, woo his crush, and perform odd jobs for his grandma, whose raging libido is played for cheap laughs. Thats not to say Freakpocalpyse isnt genuinely funny at times, and certainly I got a kick out of the mixed metaphor-riddled pep talks from Principal McNally and the freestyled song lyrics of the guitar-strumming Warren Wonderwall lurking outside of the school. Its also endearing that desperately asking a character to be Coops prom date is an option in just about every dialogue tree. But elsewhere, the humour is mostly either presented in the form of corny dad joke puns  with the kid getting a drink in the hallway being named Walter Fountain or another in the locker room showers named Hayden Shoulders  or its just toilet stall graffiti-style smut. When Coop eventually leaves the school and heads to Rods Pizzeria, theres a jar on the counter labelled Just the Tip... and if thats too subtle for you, theres also a picture on the wall of a towering sausage with two vegetables at its base. I appreciate low-brow humour as much as the next childish idiot, but the dick jokes here are a bit too, well, limp. Strip Search So too are the puzzles, which are far too basic to even tease your brain let alone wrestle it into a headlock and give it a rigorous noogie. When the school janitors closet is locked, you go and speak to the janitor who tells you the keys are in the boiler room, and sure enough they are. Thats it. Puzzle solved. Some of these fetch quests do get slightly more convoluted later on, but at no point did they stop me in my tracks or make me ever contemplate the use of the built-in hint system. Its initially cute the way that Freakpocalypse self-deprecatingly refers to its story and side objectives as ,hores, but less so when they very quickly start to feel a bit too much like brainless busywork. [Puzzles] are far too basic to even tease your brain let alone wrestle it into a headlock and give it a rigorous noogie.Not only are Freakpocalypses puzzles overly basic and lacking in variety, but theres also a slight clumsiness to how you progress through them at times. Early on Id already stumbled upon a rope and pulley and combined them to lift up a desk in the woodshop classroom to uncover a missing library book, before Id even encountered the librarian who tasks you with finding it. This meant that when I eventually did visit the library and open an initial dialogue with her, she sent me to search for a book that I was able to return it to her instantly, which came across as an unintentionally comedic exchange. There are some moments that cleverly play with the conventions of the point-and-click genre. When you try and drag a USB thumb drive from Coops backpack to the printer in the principals office, for example, it doesnt fit at first and returns to his inventory upside down for you to try and use again, because thats literally the experience of inserting any USB device into any USB port ever. But such inspired instances are rare, and despite there being an abundance of objects to interact with in every corner of Freakpocalypses vibrant small town setting, the general lack of surprise means its mostly all click and no point. Cyanide & Happiness - Freakpocalypse is a short and disappointingly simple point-and-click adventure. While diehard fans of the comics will likely get some joy out of interacting with familiar, far-out characters like Shark Dad and Seor Cleanfist, theres little else to latch onto beyond that shallow novelty, and the humour throughout is patchy at best. While Cyanide & Happiness - Freakpocalypse certainly nails the look of a comic strip, its plot and puzzle-solving are also every bit as paper thin.", "date": "March 11, 2021"}
