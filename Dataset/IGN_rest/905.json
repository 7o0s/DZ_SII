This brand-new area just outside of Sunset City includes a new batch of weapons, amps, collectibles, and more, but the biggest reinvigoration is a set of traversal methods that let you dive, dash, and leap across the water with Aquaman-like speed. Seven story missions reunite you with the bionic Troop Master Bryllcream, who proves his worth in hilarious fashion by launching you face-first at the opposition. Sadly, the only thing new about this variety of OD is a fresh coat of petroleum and seaweed  a simple reskin of the original enemies  as they dont offer any new challenges or opportunities for new tactics beyond the occasional pool of ignitable oil. The hostile scab workers are also more of the same. The Mooil Rig itself, on the other hand, is a wonderful extension of developer Insomniacs level design. Its brightly colored shipping crates, life rafts, and shipwrecks offer platforms with a great deal of verticality. The new aquatic traversal methods make zipping around the new area easy and fun as you dodge massive tentacles that destroy platforms left and right, or protect targets from incoming mortar fire. Its all backdropped by a picturesque sunset that frequently bathes you in orange hues as you glide across the water. In the weapons department, this DLC is batting .500. One of my prayers from the main campaign is answered here with the Feel The Burn, a close-range flamethrower. However, the Rivet Blaster, which you can only buy after finishing the missions, feels out of place on the oil rig. Its great against robots, but there arent any here. While Mystery of the Mooil Rig is delightfully varied by having you pilot the Glider one moment, and chasing a giant tentacled beast the next, the whole thing feels like just the tip of an iceberg that melted before I could get my fill. I managed to complete everything in around four or five hours  and that included all of the story missions, two side-quests, 20 collectibles, and handful of challenges. Its definitely time well-spent, though, and the excellent humor that had me chuckling frequently. Theres plenty of pop-culture nods, and Insomniac isnt afraid to point out after a Psycho-themed sidequest that, The saddest part about that whole thing is, most people under 30 wont get the reference. For all the laughs however, the story barely has enough time to lay itself out before its all over, and the main objective of the story-based DLC ended so suddenly I wondered if Id missed the punchline. Thankfully, the story culminates with a decent final boss fight that lets you switch up your tactics, and incorporates your buddy Bryllcream in an ingenious fashion. Youre rewarded for the quick romp with two new guns and amps that prove useful both on the oil rig and back in the main map, as well as the ability to use your new water traversal methods back in Sunset City. Pros New traversal methodsVariety of contentGreat humor Cons Light on missions Palette-swapped enemies There are a lot of laughs in The Mystery of the Mooil Rig. A great new location, some creative missions, and a much-needed flamethrower make this off-shore excursion entertaining, but it felt like it ended just as it was getting started.", "date": "Jan. 13, 2015,"}
