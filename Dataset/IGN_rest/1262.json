China, Hong Kong, Singapore  all suffered a high number of casualties. The disease even brought death to the United States and Ireland. But Korea was left, peculiarly, unscathed. Flu is a biological disaster film that stems partly from that anxiety. Why was it unaffected? Why was it saved? And from that niggling uncertainty, it extrapolates a nightmarish virus that kills its host within days and tears a Korean city apart in weeks. Ultimately, FLUs a tad too long, which undercuts some of its good work, but thanks to very good performances, some thrifty special effects, and one deeply disturbing scene, Flu is an effective disaster movie that introduces the element of biological panic. Although the impact is ultimately felt at a geopolitical level, the heart of the film is firmly centred on Jang Hyuk, a rescue worker, and Soo Ae, a doctor specialising in virology. The two meet before the outbreak, when Hyuk rescues Ae from a car accident. The two strike up a flirtatious relationship, which is immediately put to the test when the outbreak hits. The source of the disease is rather curiously a shipping container of migrant workers from The Philippines. From here, the film changes gear entirely, moving from what starts off as very light romantic comedy to a dark, morally ambiguous disaster film. The entire look of the film sours, with the colour becoming yellow and sickly  its like the film itself becomes increasingly infected. Some creative use of special effects really lend the production a sense of scale, with society quickly crumbling and its inhabitants soon turning on each other. The government naturally intercedes, yet its makeshift solution is even more horrifying than the disease. Camps are quickly erected  a vast network of claustrophobic plastic tunnels, patrolled by doctors and heavily-armed soldiers take over the streets. People are stripped, tested, given numbers, forced to carry cards. Families are divided. Its impossible not to register the allusions, and theyre undoubtedly effective, terrifying, and for the most part, well judged. The middle sequences in the camps goes on for a touch too long, though, with a few too many false endings undercutting the horror. Yet when it does finally approach its climax Flu does so with a scene containing genuinely horrifying imagery. I wont spoil it, of course, but its truly shocking. And it doesnt resort to viscera or gross obscenity to achieve this effect. Its potent stuff. Amidst all of this darkness and malady, theres one really standout performance and its seven-year old Park Min-ha, who plays Aes daughter Mi-reu. Shes central to all of the films most emotive moments, not because of her vulnerability  its down to a performance thats way beyond her years. While the story stays predominantly with the the three leads, it occasionally, and rather awkwardly, transitions to a much higher, geopolitical level. These scenes involve the Korean president butting heads with members of his own cabinet and coming up against the draconian policies of a foreign bureaucrat. Its actually very difficult to take this character all that seriously, since he slips quickly into caricature, which totally undermines the drama and tension these scenes should command. Its all a bit Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room. The conclusion of this narrative thread is also a little bit cringe-inducing compared with the sincerity of the more personal story to which it serves as a counterpoint. Flu is a bit tonally messed up  romance and comedy freely mingle with very harrowing imagery and situations  but it blends to create a powerful if somewhat formulaic disaster film. Along the way theres one scene which is unforgettable, though I cant help but feel cutting thirty minutes wouldve intensified the experience.", "date": "Nov. 28, 2013,"}
