With a cast of instantly likeable heroes and bone-chilling villains giving emotional context to its bloody uprising against high-tech Nazis, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus has come to play. It really is incredible how well this story works, considering how absurd its sci-fi version of 1961 is and how wildly the tone shifts from scene to scene. One moment its ultra-serious and delivering a sickening dose of venomous racism, abuse, and cold-blooded cruelty. Not that we needed another reason to want to overthrow an alternate-reality Third Reich who won World War 2 and conquered the world, but its hugely effective in getting the blood boiling. And yet, the next moment itll transition to scenes of laugh-out-loud comedy before pivoting back to BJ Blazkowicz dealing with his own mortality as he withers away from the wounds he received at the end of The New Order. Wolfenstein 2 pulls this off without whiplash thanks to the impressive strength of its characters, who are outstandingly written and acted. Rousing scenes featuring BJs internal monologue, rebel leader Grace and her determined but sad eyes, and Super Speshs crazy conspiracy-theory rants and literal bathroom humor are all great and delivered with convincing confidence. In just a short time, each of them is given enough backstory that theyre immediately three dimensional  theyre a flawed group of people whove gone through a hellish war and decade-long occupation, and yet theyve survived, rebelled, and lived their lives. That said, with so many new and interesting faces, not all of the characters from the first game have much to do  notably, Max Hess and Bombate dont get a lot of screen time outside of a few gags. General Engel steals the show with her absolutely gleeful sadism.But its the evil General Engel who steals the show with her absolutely gleeful sadism whenever shes on screen. Shes unpredictable, often one step ahead, and completely without mercy, often toying with her prey for the enjoyment of it. Shes far and away the most memorably terrifying game villain since Far Cry 3s Vaas Montenegro. On top of that, the flashbacks to BJs childhood and his relationship with his abusive, monstrously (but not unbelievably) racist father are also extremely unsettling. Together, these are the kinds of threats that make running around chopping off Nazi limbs with a hatchet feel like justifiable homicide. All this goes to show that as long as you have characters who feel complex and human, you can get away with just about anything in a story. Wolfenstein 2s roughly 14-hour campaign takes full advantage of that to execute a few wild twists and turns that made my jaw drop. Gruesomely murdering Nazis is extremely satisfying.Gruesomely murdering Nazis is already extremely satisfying, but its made even more so thanks to the fast and smooth first-person shooting action, and the rewarding performances the enemies put on during their death scenes. Whether theyre reacting based on what body part youve shot, getting sliced up in one of the varied melee kill animations, or bursting into flame and vaporizing before your eyes when you rake a heavy laser weapon across the screen, its quite a show. There are a lot of Nazis to kill, though, so youre also encouraged to sneak into each encounter to thin out the herd by silently taking down troopers and, more importantly, their officers  if left alive to trigger the alarm, theyll summon reinforcements. Like The New Order, this isnt exactly a real stealth game, in that enemies dont raise an alarm when they spot a dead body (and you cant hide corpses) and will sometimes spot you when you wouldnt expect they couldve, but this stealth gameplay is a good way to mix up the action and prevent every fight from beginning the same way. Its also entirely optional; if youd rather go in guns blazing, that works too, and its more of a challenge. Blasting away with a machine gun in each hand feels just as great as before.Wolfenstein 2 makes the most of its somewhat standard-feeling assortment of weapons (theres a pistol, SMG, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, etc) by letting you mix, match, and customize them to your hearts content. Using Wolfensteins existing dual-wielding system to blast away with a machine gun in each hand feels just as great as before, letting you sacrifice accuracy for doubled-up firepower thats effective in close or mid-range combat. Dual wielding is also handy if you want to be able to quickly fire a shotgun blast if you blow your cover and the silenced pistol wont get the job done on its own. It effectively lets you choose your own alternate fire mode. Unless, of course, youre using one of the terrific high-powered guns salvaged from Nazi mech troopers that require both hands but often include their own built-in alt-fire mode. My biggest annoyance with dual wielding is that  without a late-game upgrade  you cant pause the action to switch weapons. That can be a clumsy process because theres just a single weapon wheel for both hands, and you have to select the switch hands option before you can access the left one. Good luck doing that while under fire without getting killed. Speaking of upgrades, each weapon has three potential enhancements like scopes, extra ammo capacity, and other things that change their behavior in ways more interesting than just bumping up the damage output. Upgrade kits are rare, so the choices you make feel more important  I only had around half the possible upgrades by the time I finished (though Im sure I missed quite a few). Another carryover from The New Order is the perk system, which gives upgrades just for scoring kills with things like headshots or flame damage. That encourages you to mix up your playstyle, and also gives a constant stream of rewards just for doing you. BJ may be a buffed-out killing machine with a suit of armor, but he's not a tank.BJ may be a buffed-out killing machine with a suit of armor, but hes not a tank. Youve got to keep moving and play cautiously to stay alive, grabbing health, armor, and ammo items where you can find them (often off of Nazi corpses). Thats an area where The New Order was rightly criticized for making us push the pick-up button for every single individual item we wanted to grab, including small-value armor scraps that fall off of enemies. The New Colossus finds a much happier medium between that and the more common first-person shooter design of Hoovering up any item you even look at  here, many items can be picked up by walking directly over them with a small auto-grab radius. Youll still be pushing the button quite a bit, but its not nearly as annoying as it was in the first game. Because of BJs fragility (and the fact that I played through on the Do or Die! difficulty level, one notch above normal) I died quite a bit  often without knowing exactly what had killed me. Every time that happened I wished there were a killcam that focused on the gloating enemy whod gotten me so that Id know what to look out for next time. But the only real problem I consistently had in combat is that BJs pretty picky about what hell jump over. I got killed more often than Id like because I got stuck on invisible obstacles while trying to vault over stuff  especially in the later levels. Every so often we hear from a relative of someone who died at the hands of the infamous ~Terro-Billy.~Wolfenstein 2s linear series of levels is made up almost entirely of the kind of dreary settings youd expect from Nazi-occupied America. The irradiated remains of New York, military facilities, and a New Orleans thats become a walled-in ghetto are all pretty gloomy with only occasional eye-catching spectacle, but theyre dotted with details and readable bits of life in a fascist alternate reality that make exploration worthwhile. Not only that, some of this reading material humanizes the Germans youre fighting, to some degree. Dont get me wrong, theres no moral question about whether a bunch of goose-stepping thugs deserve whats coming to them, but hearing, for instance, the perspective of a family who resettled in America after the war is interesting. And every so often we hear from a relative of someone who died at the hands of the infamous Terro-Billy  the Nazi propagandists name for one William J Blazkowicz. Its the non-combat areas in between fights that really distinguish themselves. Walking around a Nazi parade in Roswell, New Mexico and listening to SS troops chatting with Ku Klux Klansmen and finding common ground is eerie and chilling, and the detail in the windows on the main street is excellent. The same goes for the submarine that serves as a base for BJs rebellion, which is packed with characters and great incidental dialogue. Some of those side characters dont look so great next to BJ and his main cast of friends, however. This being a single-player game, its notable that there is some significant post-game content. Wolfenstein 2 recycles some of its maps for tough assassination missions (which must be unlocked by gathering items from dead Nazi officers) that allow you to gain some upgrades that were mutually exclusive with choices you made during the campaign. And theres a reason to start all over, too: one of the first things you do is repeat a choice you made in The New Order to spare the life of one of two characters, which determines which one is alive in the sequel. That gives you access to a different weapon and has that person play a role in the story, and given the role that Wyatt played in my playthrough Im interested to see how the older, more grizzled Fergus wouldve handled things. On a technical note, after the first couple of hours Wolfenstein 2 ran beautifully for me on PC, with excellent performance and stability. I have to caveat that first couple of hours, though, because during that time it crashed consistently when I was trying to make the pre-game choice between Wyatt and Fergus, about 20 seconds into starting a new game. It was only after I quit out of just about everything running in the background that it ran successfully. Bethesda has indicated this is an Nvidia driver issue (Im using a GTX 1080), and there are already beta drivers available that may solve the issue if you encounter it. A second Nvidia-powered PC using a GTX 980 had no issues whatsoever. Both console versions, meanwhile, have run well and without incident. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a fantastic single-player shooter, but what really got me invested was the brilliantly written characters and the performances of its cast. BJ and his crew are full of spirit and personality, and General Engel is as memorable a nemesis as youre likely to find in games. Machine Games has once again turned the well-worn act of mowing down Nazis into something to get excited about.", "date": "Oct. 28, 2017,"}
