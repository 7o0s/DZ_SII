Because on paper, it does seem like a good idea: The platforming, exploration, and wacky firearms weve come to expect from Ratchet layered on top of an active, on-the-battlefield approach to tower defense gameplay. It may not be the full-fledged franchise installment fans have been clamoring for, but as a one-off $20 download, it certainly has the potential to provide an amusing stopgap... in theory. In practice, however, poor balancing, repetitive gameplay, and a handful of design flaws turn the experience into something more tedious, despite its initial appeal. Though the games story elements are disappointingly light, the campaign opens with some charming exposition: While reluctantly adjusting to civilian life, the thick-skulled Captain Qwark is hailed by a mysterious villain whos managed to deactivate the defense systems of some nearby planets, which of course leaves Qwark, Clank, and Ratchet to save them from certain invasion. The setup is simple and the humor feels true to the series, but the gameplay immediately distinguishes Full Frontal Assault from R&C games past. Each self-contained, arena-like level starts you in a base with six delicate generators and two bottlenecks that expose your base to the rest of the world. Your job is to reactivate the planets defenses by flipping a few key switches while preventing occasional waves of cartoonish aliens from destroying your generators. What are you up to now, Qwark? Sure, that sounds simple, but the flip-switching offensive portion is often directly at odds with the generator-protecting defensive half. See, in order to reactivate the levels main defensive system, you must venture out of your base and activate nodes in the surrounding area, thwarting bad guys, acquiring weapons, and collecting bolts (the games currency) in the process. Those bolts can then be spent on defenses like mines, turrets, and barriers. The problem is, no matter how many you purchase, those defenses absolutely cannot withstand an attack without you there to babysit them, which leaves you constantly sprinting back and forth between your base and your current objective. Since you never quite know when the next wave of base invaders will attack, youre constantly stressed and oddly conflicted. Its a shame since, independently, the games two components actually work relatively well. The endless ramps, rails, and jump padsnot to mention Ratchets lightning-fast Hover Bootsmake exploring the inventive, detailed environments immensely fun, and the solid controls and camera work keep the action tight. The ability to dismantle defenses and reuse the bolts to build something better adds a satisfying dimension of depth to the tower defense gameplay, which also graces us with distinctly R&C-flavored items like the dance-inducing Groovitron Mine. And end-of-level payoff for both the games offensive and defensive portionsan intricate platforming section for the former and a massive base invasion for the latteroffer an intense, satisfying conclusion to each mission. At the same time, however, both portions can also feel a bit simplistic. The shooting mechanics, for example, often require more patience than skill. Since none of the weapons actually recoil when fired, I would typically just aim loosely in an enemys direction, hold down the trigger, and wait for him to keel over. Either that or I would run out of bullets and be forced to arbitrarily equip whatever gun still had some rounds left in it. Similarly, funding my defenses proved to be more of an exercise in patience than strategy. With persistent waves of enemies constantly wrecking my gear and forcing me to upgrade, I spent as much time scrambling for bolts as I did activating the nodes that would actually help me beat the level. It seemed like as soon as I accumulated any real money, I had to spend it immediately just to stay afloat, which lead to some tedious currency farming. Maybe its some sly Marxist commentary about wage slavery and the plight of the working manbut I kind of doubt it. Fortunately, multiplayer helps ameliorate many (though not all) of the games problems. Taking on the campaign with a co-op buddyonline or split-screenalleviates much of the back-and-forth tension since one player can camp out at the base while the other collects bolts and activates nodes. That alone makes a major difference. The real saving grace, though, is the competitive multiplayer, which takes all of the games core elements and slightly restructures them. Familiar -- yet foreign -- gameplay. Matches occur in three phases: Recon, Squad, and Assault. Recon lets you loose on the world, where you must capture nodes to receive a continuous supply of bolts during the next two phases. Squad gives you a limited window to spend those bolts on attack units that will warp to the front of your opponents base during the aptly name Assault phase. This cycle repeats up to five times, assuming both your bases last that long. The addition of offensive units makes the whole experience that much more involving, though this too has its flaws. Whoever captures the most nodes has the most money, and when you can outspend your opponent, you win, regardless of how strategically savvy you may or may not be. Plus, with only three maps and two match typesone vs. one or two vs. twothe experience lacks serious longevity. THE VERDICT For every positive Full Frontal Assault musters up, there seems to be a negative lurking somewhere nearby. The exploration is a blast, but the shooting is a bust. Gradually upgrading defenses feels rewarding, but grinding for bolts proves tedious and stressful. In the end, the positives and negative battle to an uneasy stalemate that results in an experience that's simply middling. Full Frontal Assault is still plenty charming, and its smattering of unique ideas make worth a look, even if its only a passing glance.", "date": "Dec. 17, 2012,"}
