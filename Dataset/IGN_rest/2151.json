Obsidian, a developer thats made sequels to both BioWares Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Bethesdas Fallout 3, has merged those two distinctive flavors, and they taste great together. I wouldnt quite call this space-frontier themed adventure the best of both, but its a creative and well-made take thats both familiar and new all at once. The Outer Worlds takes place in a solar system-wide colony ruled by corporate feudalism and filled with dark humor. Everywhere you look theres a satirical slogan or crazy-eyed mascot, a worker being treated as hilariously disposable, and oppressive propaganda and policies keeping everybody in line. And, as a big fan of the short-lived sci-fi western show Firefly, I spotted its influences everywhere. From the on-the-nose Firefly branding on the energy weapon ammo to the fact that your junky transports young naive engineer lady talks pretty much exactly like Kaylee, its layered on thick in a way I appreciated. It isnt hard to picture Captain Malcolm Reynolds reading off some of the more sarcastic dialogue options, either. In some ways its nice that the story doesnt put a face on the evil corporate Board that rules over this isolated colony until around two thirds of the way through the roughly 30-hour campaign  and even when they do theyre not all that menacing. On one hand, The Outer Worlds feels aimless for a long time, but on the other, that means the quest to help a mad-ish scientist revive your fellow colonists from hibernation sort of fades into the background as you casually wander into the middle of morally gray local conflicts and pick winners and losers. Sometimes by throwing a switch to declare your preference for the winners, and sometimes by simply shooting said losers. The first big quest has major parallels to Fallout 3s signature Megaton choice, though while I did enjoy hearing about the philosophical differences between various factions, there arent many big surprises or Megaton-like wow moments in how quests play out. The Outer Worlds feels smaller in scale than that, though, so that works well enough. It's a very familiar format to anybody who's played a Fallout game.Its a very familiar format to anybody whos played a Fallout game, in that there are almost always multiple ways to fight, talk, or sneak your way through  and notably there are different speech skills to lie, persuade, or intimidate your way past adversaries. Those all result in the same outcome if your skill is high enough to enable the dialogue options (which are labeled to indicate which one is being used, as in Fallout: New Vegas) but it lets you have a say in whether your character plays the role of scoundrel, diplomat, or thug. Accordingly, theres a faction reputation system in play that keeps track of who youve helped or wronged, but it never really felt important because for the most part its only rewards are discounts of up to 25% at vendors, and using vendors is rarely necessary. But its nice to know someone cares. The nice thing about it is that losing some reputation is a somewhat meaningful consequence for getting caught stealing peoples trinkets other than a potentially game-ending fight with security or everything grinding to a halt while you break out of jail for the eighth time. One surprise is how bug-free it all is. Especially since the rushed development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian has carried around a reputation for games being buggy at launch, but if my experience playing through The Outer Worlds on PC is any indication it might be the game to change that perception. Ive only had one temporarily broken side quest (where I couldnt turn it in to the questgiver for a while) in more than 30 hours  other than that its been extremely smooth. (Your results may vary  bugs, almost by definition, dont affect everybody equally.) Update: How Does The Outer Worlds Work on Switch? By Jon Ryan, June 4, 2020 Like so many ports before it, The Outer Worlds Switch version packs as much of the original experience as it can into a hand-held package, but taking a game designed for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 to the lighter and portable hardware means there are some noticeable technical shortcomings. The most noteworthy issue in the three or four hours Ive sunk into the Switch version so far is how it struggles to keep up with the onscreen action during fights, even with the downgraded textures, shadows, and lighting. Framerate dips were constant, even with just a few NPCs on screen (not to mention the more egregious chugging that occurred during combat with multiple opponents), and there were plenty of moments where my run speed outpaced the Switchs ability to load the map quickly enough, resulting in a buffering screen that I got fairly used to by the time I left the Emerald Vale. Visually, The Outer Worlds character models - both for your companions and most all of the other NPCs youll interact with - still manage a relatively high level of detail. Thats to be expected, considering the real heart of an RPG like The Outer Worlds is how you interact with and affect these characters. The team handling the port at Virtuous games do their best to mask the environmental graphical concessions with some interesting depth-of-field trickery, as well. And while the default text size is small enough that can be tough to read on the handheld screen, theres an option in the menus that allows you to enlarge it (this was patched into the PS4/Xbox One versions after launch). That said, those cutbacks that allow Obsidians old-timey sci-fi dystopia to run on Nintendos small screen are still many and highly noticeable. Lower-resolution textures were to be expected, but coupled with its smaller LoD radius  which caused some very noticeable pop-in, especially in the more open outdoor environments  there are moments where The Outer Worlds Switch version has trouble looking like even an Xbox 360 game rather than something from the end of the Xbox Ones run, especially when its played on a TV instead of in handheld mode. But it does run, and if you can tolerate this reduced level of performance its certainly worth playing. As with Doom and The Witcher 3 before it, while the Switch port may be far from the best version of The Outer Worlds, its impressive that were able to experience this scale of game on a portable system at all. Along the same lines, anybody whos played a BioWare RPG will recognize The Outer Worlds extensive quests for its six companion characters. I wouldnt say theres a break-out star among the crew (though admittedly I never did unlock the sixth one  I only noticed him as I was about to embark on the final mission. Next playthrough!) but they all have engrossing backstories and there isnt a bad actor in the bunch. Even the meat-headed Felix has his moments. And because you can have two companions with you at all times, every pairing has lines of banter between them that adds extra personality. This solution makes a lot of sense.Not every idea is a remix of Bethesda and BioWare, though. Obsidian has its own clever things to add to The Outer Worlds, like the way its skill and perks systems incorporate companions into your character build by adding their stats to your own. So if youre concentrating your skills on guns and dialogue, you can balance yourself out by bringing along Max to boost your hacking and Parvati to boost your engineering. Since you cant control your companions directly, this solution makes a lot of sense. On top of that, you get a good amount of old-school control over companions gear and perks, as their weapons, armor, and helmets must be managed and updated along with your own. You can even tweak their behavior settings, such as whether they should prefer ranged or melee weapons or behave aggressively or defensively, without getting bogged down in the overcomplicated weeds. Maybe most importantly, each one has a special combat skill you can activate at will that effectively pauses the action so that they can deliver a cinematic smack-down to your target. Those come in especially handy when youre overwhelmed  the cutscene attacks can give you a breather in a big fight, and a lot of them have stun effects (on top of big damage) and that can be a lifesaver when a huge beast is bearing down on you. The first-person-only combat is definitely more on the Fallout side of the spectrum, but it distinguishes itself with a faster pace and more emphasis on precision aim. Where Fallouts VATS does the work of targeting an enemys weak point for you, The Outer Worlds tightly limited time-slowing ability rewards your good aim. Score a headshot and youll blind an enemy; target their legs to slow them; hit them in the arms to reduce their attacks; target them dead-center with a sniper rifle to go for an execution. Its certainly a lot less robotic than VATS, and especially once I turned the difficulty up to hard (normal can be a bit of a breeze) I began to rely on it to cripple tough enemies before they could smash me. Get character-building tips straight from Obsidian below. Your ship, the Unreliable, serves as a hub that lets you jump between the handful of worlds and space stations and lets you mingle with your crew. Its similar to the Normandy in Mass Effect, to the point where it even has a sassy AI lady to chat with, but otherwise it too is drenched in the homey vibes of Fireflys Serenity. Theres not a ton to do there but pretty much every time you return youre directed to see what antics your companions are getting up to while youve been away doing good or crime. The locations the Unreliable shuttles you to are varied: Most are different varieties of untamed frontier wilderness full of alien beasts and marauders, but theres also a run-down, Citadel-like space station and a future-urban capital city. Jumping between them as you chase various quest chains keeps things feeling fresh, and the colorful art style never feels drab or one-note. Yes, we have fun in The Outer Worlds.Because The Outer Worlds is split into smaller open-world maps, theres definitely not as much discoverable stuff out there to unexpectedly stumble upon between quest markers, but theres still a fair amount to hunt down. That includes a set of powerful and unique Science weapons, such as an honest-to-goodness shrink ray. Yes, we have fun in The Outer Worlds. Thats another cool thing about this skill system: it makes traditionally non-combat skills like science, persuasion, and hacking actually somewhat valuable in a fight by passively causing enemies to flee or cower. So even if you build toward non-combat skills youre still at least somewhat viable against wildlife or marauders who cant be reasoned with. Its kind of a shame that this isnt represented by in-game shouts about the enemys mammas driving them into shame, but since your character is mute I understand why it isnt so. Another very original feature of The Outer Worlds is faults, where you occasionally have the opportunity to opt into a weakness in exchange for a point that can unlock a powerful bonus in your perk tree (these range from carry weight bonuses to converting a percentage of damage taken to health, with a lot in between). I got a few in my run that gave me vulnerabilities to certain types of attacks, which are meaningful weaknesses but rarely affected how I fought because when I was charging into a fight I generally wasnt taking stock of whether they were shooting at me with plasma or corrosion. The one I had to consider more often gave me a debuff whenever I took fall damage  I like when a game thinks outside the box and influences my behavior without resorting to percentages. I dont know how many of those possibilities exist, but Im glad that they do. Theyre not a huge difference, but theyre an unpredictable random element that makes each playthrough unique, and that makes me even more interested to play through again. Meanwhile, the loot and weapon modding system lets you spend cash to level up a favorite gun and keep pace with your progress, and change the damage type to specialize when going up against different enemies. There weren't as many of these as I expected  I got a lot of the same low-value sites and barrels as I expected and few that proved worthwhile beyond that  but it at least gave me hope I'd run across something more potent. As for loot overall, theres certainly a lot of it  but inventory management was never too much of a hassle and you can always break stuff down instead of dropping it so it doesnt feel like its wasted.

And considering that new RPGs from either of those influential developers are still years away, this game couldnt have been timed any better. Its not as explorable as one big open world but it still packs in a large portion of flexible quests and conflicts within its series of smaller ones. And the combat, character, and companion systems have enough new spins on existing ideas to make it feel like an homage with its own personality rather than a copy.", "date": "Oct. 22, 2019,"}
