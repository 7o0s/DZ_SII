Its XCOM-style, turn-based tactics gameplay is just about the last thing Id have expected from either Mario or Rabbids, but its absurdist charm works against the odds and its far more difficult and meatier than you probably think. When you break it down, a lot of the challenge comes down to pure trial and error, but the moment of figuring out its tactical puzzles and chaining together a string of attacks delivers a strong shot of satisfaction. The bizarre story that brings Ubisofts Rabbids into the Mushroom Kingdom of Nintendos Mario and literally mashes them together embraces the fact that its complete nonsense on every level and just rolls with it. I couldnt help but think of the plot of The Fly as a sci-fi gadget merged unwitting denizens of Marios universe with an unintentional interdimensional invasion of idiot rabbit-things. There are some decent jokes that arise from the slurry, including at least one Game of Thrones reference, and a lot is owed to the Rabbids almost entirely physical comedy. I dont understand why the eight-character roster includes both normal and only vaguely related Rabbid-ized versions of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi, but I accepted it because of the humor. That said, I dont think Ill ever be totally okay with seeing those characters shoot enemies with guns (ranging from a knockoff of Mega Mans arm cannon to straight-up shotguns and Gattling guns) when Im accustomed to seeing them shoot fireballs from white-gloved hands, but other than that its the good kind of dumb fun. Mario + Rabbids obviously borrows liberally from the turn-based tactics genres current most prominent series, XCOM, most notably in its use of full and half-shield icons to represent full and half cover. But this style of turn-based tactics is vastly different. (Trust me: I went directly from XCOM 2: War of the Chosen to this, and it was quite a shock to the system  in a good, refreshing sort of way.) The way your three-person team works together, bouncing off each other and using complementary special abilities to maximize movement and damage, is a distinctive idea that forces an extremely aggressive playstyle and incentivizes keeping your team mostly together to make the most of their unique abilities. Attention to detail in animation constantly impressed me.While its a simpler setup than XCOM due to its more compressed maps and smaller squads, every team member gets to take more actions per turn, which amplifies possibilities. In just one move, a fully upgraded character like Rabbid Peach can dash-attack up to four enemies, leap off a teammate to extend her range, fire her laser pistol or launch a remote-control car bomb, and either cast a damage-dampening force field around herself or heal any teammates in range. Mario, meanwhile, can only dash-attack two enemies, but can bounce off an ally and land on an enemy for a signature stomp attack, then either fire his pistol or bash the heck out of the surrounding area with a giant hammer, and finally either activate a two-shot reaction fire mode or buff the damage of anyone around him. Its a lot of fun to watch one of those strings in action, thanks in no small part to the excellent animations of everything from the hero-pose landings after a big jump, to enemies hitting the deck when you take a shot at someone behind them, to Rabbid Peach leaning up against a slab of rock you placed her next to for half-cover. Attention to detail there constantly impressed me, right down to the quiver of Marios stache. On the other hand, all of that movement can make turns feel chaotic and confusing  especially in the early levels  because both your squad and the enemies on the board are so mobile that its tough to understand what youre capable of or predict what theyll do. Many maps have the signature Mario pipes (though now theyre white and have rabbit ears and tongues) which can warp you to higher elevations or across the map, or both, and using whats there is essential to understanding what the map designers had in mind for us. Generally, you have to assume that if an enemy is anywhere near you, he can probably outflank you, and there are annoyingly few ways to stop them. Even with reaction-fire ability from Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi has only a 30% chance of stopping most enemies in their tracks (if it triggers an effect like fire, push, or blinding ink), and those have long cooldown timers to ensure you can only use them a couple of times in a typical level. So its kill or be killed  and there are virtually always more of them than there are of you. There are a ton of good combinations to work with within the eight-character roster, though the mix-and-match opportunities are hamstrung by a couple of arbitrary-feeling restrictions: Mario must be the leader of every party (fair enough, his names on the box after all) and you must have at least one Rabbid character. That last one was a roadblock for a lot of my best ideas, which probably means its there to prevent unbalanced things like having three characters taking turns going on reaction fire and ensuring that no enemy movement goes unpunished during an abilitys cooldown phase. Mario + Rabbids is viciously tough - and it knows it.Which brings us to the biggest surprise of Mario + Rabbids: how viciously tough it is. Granted, most fights took me five or 10 minutes to get a perfect score by finishing within the turn timer limit with all three teammates alive. But every so often there was one that took an hour or more of trial-and-error attempts, testing out different combinations of the eight characters and slightly different approaches to the problem. Mario + Rabbids doesnt have save-scuming  not exactly, anyway. (Thats where you quicksave before going into a fight and reload when the battle plan fails to survive contact with the enemy.) When something goes wrong and your Rabbid Luigi gets slammed unconscious by a hulking enemy carrying a giant slab of ice as a bludgeon, or you forget that you cant fire through a Breachers front-facing shield, or you simply accidentally push A when the cursor was one square off from where you thought it was and now youve left your Yoshi exposed, thats often effectively a game-over and you have to restart the entire match. Most of them are short enough (three or four turns) that it doesnt sting much, but a few are multi-stage battles where hitting the restart button means youre in for the chore of going through the motions of a puzzle youre already figured out. In XCOM you have the option to continue after a loss, but here you have to keep beating your head against a wall until you overcome each challenge, and that can get tedious. Some of the difficulty spikes are really nasty, and Mario + Rabbids knows it. You can tell because at the start of every fight youre asked if you want to play in Easy Mode, which gives you extra health. But even with that boost I wouldnt call some of these easy, because if youre getting slammed hard youre probably not going to be saved by a few more hitpoints. You really have to understand how the mechanics work to win, which is a good thing unless youre just learning the ropes. It makes me wonder why Ubisoft didnt set up a normal mode between easy and hard, thus letting more people have a good time on their first attempt and avoiding the appearance of passive-aggression in offering a crutch for the poor baby gamer who cant keep up. There's a very respectable amount of enemy variety.Merging the intentionally obnoxious Rabbids with Mario mainstays like Boos and Piranha Plants produces lots of weird combinations, and that gives Mario + Rabbids a very respectable amount of enemy variety. There are the already-mentioned shield guys and bludgeoning guys (who advance toward you every time you shoot them), Centurions who can shield allies and fire machine guns out of their nipples (I wish I were making that up) and spectral enemies who can teleport long distances and then shoot you in the back from afar, whom I hate. There are bomb-throwers and shielded cactus guys. And then there are the bosses. Mario + Rabbids does a very good job of making its boss fights stand out. Whether youre fighting a giant Rabbid Kong who scarfs bananas to restore his health or a Phantom of the Opera parody who sings a hell of a song while you knock out the spotlights that sustain his ego, it never fails to make these battles feel distinct and interesting. You also go up against minibosses (or midbosses, as it insists on calling them) which tend to be much harder than the boss fights themselves but generally equal in goofiness. There are also several levels that have a strong gimmick, like the Chain Chomp who attacks whatevers nearest to it or fireballs falling from the sky in pre-designated locations. I wish there were more of these toward the end of the campaign, but overall it does a good job of mixing these special conditions with the normal ones like kill everything, get at least one of your team to a goal zone, and escorting an unarmed VIP through a gauntlet. Between fights, Mario + Rabbids throws some mostly simple puzzles in our path to cleanse the palette. Theres a lot of pushing blocks onto pressure pads and pushing buttons to adjust color-coded platforms  stuff I associate more with Zelda than Mario  and tiny obstacle courses where youre collecting coins as quickly as you can. For the latter type, where timing and accuracy matters, Mario + Rabbids has oddly tripped itself up by making the leader of your party on the real-time map a new character named Beep-0, whos basically a Roomba thats become a real boy. I have no real problem with Beep-0 as a character, and I kind of enjoy wondering how his bleeped-out dialogue text made it past Nintendo, but as a party leader hes terrible. 30 years of gaming history has taught me that I should focus on Mario.The past 30 years of gaming history has taught me that I should focus on Mario whenever hes on screen, but here hes always second in line in the train of four characters to Beep-0, of all people. When youre running away from the camera, you can barely see Beep-0 at all. So I found myself constantly turning too early because I thought I was the second person in a train instead of the first, and that made control feel imprecise. A few timed puzzles were harder than they shouldve been as a result. Also, there are a ton of them, but only one in four or five offers any sort of in-game upgrade (as opposed to a new piece of concept art or music), which is disappointing after I spend time solving a puzzle. Another stumble is the progression system, which doesnt make a lot of sense. On the surface its fairly standard: every time you level up, you have to spend money to upgrade your squads weaponry to the next tier. When you inevitably run out of cash to upgrade weapons (which you almost certainly will) and want to change up your party to counter a new enemy, like when you realize you need Rabbid Luigis Vampire-effect slide attacks more than regular Luigis sniper rifle (Luigis a sniper now, FYI) you have to revisit a previous fight to earn more. Thatd be a very traditional sort of grindiness  also objectionable in its own way  except that here you play the old levels with your leveled-up characters, which makes them so easy theyre a waste of time and the money basically free. Mario + Rabbids also comes with a few co-op levels that are unlocked as you finish each of the visually diverse worlds, though the concept of local co-op is a little silly in a turn-based tactics game because its no different from passing the controller back and forth between two people. Those levels do give you four characters instead of three, though, which opens up the tactics a little  but it just makes me wish I couldve done that in the campaign in single-player. If you dont want to wait for someone else to play with you can always play both sides yourself, holding one Joy-Con at a time like a sad person. Which I have done. All told, there are at least 20 hours of content here  and thats if youre not new to this genre. Thats good because I cant see a lot of replay value in going back to do it again other than to try the same scenarios with less appropriate teams. The only random factors here are whether or not you hit the coin-flip shots at enemies in low cover. To be fair, that can absolutely make the difference between a win and a loss, but since Mario + Rabbids gives you no choice but to reload when you lose, it doesnt have quite the same drama as in a game with permanent death. Based on its colorful world, beautiful animation, and source material you might expect Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle to be My first turn-based tactics game. But youre in for a surprise: even for XCOM vets some of its battles are challenging puzzles. Some of its tougher levels do devolve into a trial-and-error slog, but a good mix of enemies, objectives, and character abilities keep things interesting.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2017,"}
