Even on these barely recognizable alien worlds, the addictiveness of building cities, exploration, and tactical combat holds up well. From there, developer Firaxis runs a series of bold experiments with Civilizations established design. A few  such as the new Affinities system and streamlined unit upgrading  bear promising results, but cumulatively, enough of them go awry that I have to label Beyond Earth as my least-favorite Civilization in more than a decade. Of course, given the sky-high bar set by the series, its still a strong 4X game. A game of Beyond Earth begins with your spaceship landing and founding a colony, equipped with a minor starting bonus of your choosing that smartly removes the first few turns of tapping next until you build that first worker or soldier or basic building and allows you to get to the next decision. The eight all-human faction choices, based on hypothetical future-Earth alliances like the Pan-Asian Cooperative and the Slavic Federation, are unexciting; each has a small bonus to espionage or city growth or what have you, and you get to select from an extra menu of similar bonuses to layer on top of the cultural one (such as additional cash or culture generation), so theres some decent customization there. However, none of them has the recognition or implied personality of other Civ games historical leaders, and none have any memorable traits of their own. Faction design is basically what were accustomed to from Civ 5, with the notable absence of faction-specific military or trade units. Finding my footing in Beyond Earth was tougher than its been in most Civs because, like most sci-fi games, its so alien and unfamiliar. The map is pretty to look at (especially with the subtle depth of field effect that softly defocuses the edges of the screen) but tough to read at a glance, because terrain and improvements look nothing like those on Earth. Domes and futuristic machinery dont communicate function like a farm or windmill does. Likewise, the non-linear tech web is a strong idea on paper, because it forces you to make tough calls about which techs youll pursue and which youll forego completely. In practice, at least for the first several games, its confusing  who knows the difference between Alien Sciences and Fabrication unless you read up extensively on both? And when you have a dozen different research options open at any given time, its overwhelming. The only thing that saves it from totally bogging down is the search function, which lets you highlight the techs that will give you access to the kind of structures and units you need. Its the kind of thing that Im sure will get easier once Ive memorized my desired research paths. The next challenge youll face is the swarms of free-roaming alien insects and sea monsters, which pose a problem for the usual early-game Civ tasks of taming the wilderness, exploration, and establishing trade. These creatures may look more interesting than cave men with clubs, and theyre made of tougher stuff - especially these Dune-style siege worms - but theyre frustratingly unpredictable and cant be negotiated with. At least with barbarians I knew where I stood: they wanted to kill me, so I should kill them first. These aliens seem to strike at random, ignoring my units for the most part, then abruptly picking off trade convoys and taking pot shots at my soldiers without provocation. Given Firaxis history with making powerful, multi-faceted indigenous populations in Sid Meiers Colonization, Id expected these aliens to have a purpose beyond impairing your early expansion, and maybe even have a role to play in the mid and late game as allies if I chose to respect their right to exist. Strangely, there is none. After 150 or so turns, my technology advanced to the point where the aliens were no longer a threat, and they simply occupied space Id rather have my stuff on. Even the technologies that allow you to build your own alien units dont require you to keep the natural-born ones around, so there are few reasons not to wipe them out. They feel pointless. Wiping them out is a good time, at least. Battle is basically the same great tactics-focused one-unit-per tile system from Civ 5  and the AI knows how to use it reasonably well, too. Things are moved along quickly because Beyond Earths military units benefit from an instant and free upgrade system that triggers when you upgrade technology, eliminating a lot of the annoying micromanagement of obsolete units. Individual upgrades like Civ 5s situational bonuses are deemphasized, but I like how every time you earn an upgrade for a unit type you get to pick between two possible bonuses, such as better attack or faster movement. That allows you to tailor your units to the type of war you want to wage. Upgrades are triggered by the unlocking of Affinity points in three categories, mostly via technological advancement. These are another of Beyond Earths best ideas. Focusing on developing the Harmony Affinity, for example, gives your units strengths like immunity to (and eventually gain healing from) the hazardous miasma gas that pollutes the land, while Purity can boost combat and Supremacy aids you economically. The Affinity you concentrate on also determines which powerful unique units you unlock, like infantry mounted on aliens and levitating tanks, and eventually some great super-sized ones like the gigantic Xeno Titan. The choice is reflected visually in your cities through distinctive red, yellow, or green and curvy designs for the buildings, differentiating you from your different-minded neighbors. I do miss faction-specific units, but this meld of technology and religion has some interesting effects on both combat and diplomacy, since colonies prefer others that share their Affinity. Speaking of diplomacy, Beyond Earth introduces the concept of favors, where a colony with nothing you want at the moment will let you bank IOUs in exchange for trade goods. Its something Civs negotiating table has sorely needed. Other than that, though, diplomacy isnt highly developed; in fact, Ive communicated with my neighbors less than usual, probably due to the lack of luxury resources to trade and the buffer of aliens between us that keeps their troops from wandering into my turf. The other notable new feature is the satellite layer, which allows you to temporarily orbit a support unit above the map. It sounds cooler than it is in reality, because the reality of it is that these satellites are actually just area buffs that temporarily boost the production of certain resources on the land below. One exception to that rule is the orbital laser, which is great for bombardment, and theres some strategy to be had in protecting yourself from enemy lasers by distributing your own satellites, since they cant overlap. On the whole, though, theyre not that exciting. When it comes to deciding who rules your planet, there are technically five victory options, but effectively only three available to you at any one time: one for each of the three Affinities, a research-based option for contacting intelligent life, and good old-fashioned military victory. The Affinity-based options each have their own goal scenario that calls back to past Civ games space victory, where you must first build a structure on the map and then complete an additional task  charging it up, loading units into it, or settling Earth colonists that emerge from it  while defending it from attack. Its great to be able to militarily interfere with another factions victory plan without actually conquering their cities. However, trying to finish one of these when no one is willing or able to stop you is a huge, slow-paced chore that doesnt do the notoriously laborious Civ endgame any favors. The military and science victories are more practical goals. Whats strange, and unusual for a Civilization game, is that ending a game is frustratingly abrupt. For the first time I can remember, there is no after-action report recapping your colonys story whatsoever. Youre just dumped back to the main menu for another go. I once lost a game by one turn, and I wasnt even told who beat me or how theyd done it until I went back and reloaded from an autosave for a super-slow instant replay. Thats weird and disappointing, because I love recounting my epic journey in other Civ games. Pros Addictive strategyUnit upgradesAffinities system Cons Annoying aliensLacks personality Beyond Earth is nowhere near the strongest game in the more than 20-year-old Civilization series, but this big collection of interesting experimental ideas definitely still kept me playing long after I shouldve gone to bed. The Affinities and streamlined military upgrade system, and a colorful change of scenery make it worth the time to figure out the difference between Protogenetics and Surrogacy, and suffering through temperamental alien wildlife.", "date": "Oct. 23, 2014,"}
