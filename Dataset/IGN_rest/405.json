Yet thats the approach Tumble VR has taken in making use of the PlayStation VR, so even though there are some decent head-scratcher puzzles in this collection its hard to get excited about the mundane premise. The more than 30 puzzles alternate through several variations on the theme. Theres the ridiculously simple and easy stacking of blocks on top of each other to reach a given height, some dizzyingly complex light-reflection puzzles where blocks with mirrors must be used to redirect a laser through multi-colored objectives, the sometimes-frustrating job of stacking as many blocks as you can onto a platform as a bar moves back and forth to knock off anything over a certain height, a random-feeling one where you plant of bombs to knock over a stack of blocks, and building bridges between pillars. There are variations on those ideas, too, and some of the solutions made me feel clever for figuring them out after a few minutes of experimentation. There are many different materials, too, and each has weight and friction properties that have to be accounted for. Theres some depth to it. Yet there are a few limitations  some by design and some a result of the PlayStation VR  that constantly rubbed me the wrong way as I fiddled with the blocks. For instance, even with two Move controllers you can only use one hand and only manipulate one block at a time, which limits your options. You cant for instance, brace two blocks against each other  which would be very handy in the bridge-building puzzle type. Thats obviously the way its intended, because puzzles are built with that restriction in mind, but having these seemingly physical items in front of me and not being able to interact with them the way I would in the real world is irritating. PlayStation VR's motion tracking is usually precise enough. Next up, the PlayStation VRs motion tracking is usually precise enough to place a block right where you want it, and you can flip a block around 90 degrees in any direction as you hold it with the right stick to get it into the correct orientation to fit where you need it to go. But this is a good demonstration of where the tracking isnt always pinpoint accurate, since when your controller flickers around slightly its very noticeable. I also hit the borders of the small trackable area a lot because Tumble VR likes to make you want to reach up, down, and to the sides to grab and place blocks. You can generally move a puzzle around using the left stick in order to keep it in your tracking area, and some (like the stacking puzzles) move automatically, but you have to fight your natural impulse to try to grab something that looks to be within an arms reach. Also, because you cant pick up one block and use it to nudge another (theres no impact effect until you release the block youre holding), arranging Tetris-style blocks into place is extremely tough to do unless you line them up absolutely perfectly - the blocks that are already placed wont move at all to accommodate the new one youre trying to slide in. The only splash of personality added to Tumble VR comes from the cliche floating robot eye that makes sardonic, GlaDOS-style quips about the purpose of the tests youre doing, as has become all but standard in physics puzzle games. Isnt there some other kind of delivery we could try? At the end of the day, were mostly just stacking blocks in Tumble VR, and thats rarely going to be exciting. Even when it challenged me with head-scratching feats of structural engineering it bored me with the mundanity of its theme. Adding onto that some of the PlayStation VRs inherent limitations with tracking, and it was as often frustrating as rewarding.", "date": "Oct. 13, 2016,"}
