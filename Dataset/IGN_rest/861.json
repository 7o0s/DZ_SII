There's an island called Nuncio, filled with former postal workers. Its shores are covered in undelivered mail. There is a ~Dead-letter Office~ where a friendly rat-engineer used a special machine to retrieve and restore damaged post. In the basement, a storage room opens into a seemingly bottomless cavern, where all the misdirected mail of all the ages has gone to die. There's Port Cecil, where everyone obsessively plays chess with pieces of carved gemstone. When my captain sat down to play, he went into a trance and began making moves according to the will of the primeval forces that govern the underworld, and played until his hands began to bleed. Then I sailed onward to Mt. Palmerston, where I had tea with a lonely deviless who guards the road to a hellish volcano. She was charming and generous, and was very polite when she asked me to give her my soul. There is a mix of offbeat charm and profound, uneasy weirdness that permeates every inch of Sunless Sea. It's a testament to developer Failbetter Games' tremendous writers that this world, built almost entirely through text dialog boxes and suggestive map art, is so absorbing. But here's the rub: Sunless Sea is as much a text adventure (or hyperlink adventure, if you prefer) as it is a naval-combat roguelike. While most of your time in the game is spent piloting a tiny ship around the darkened Unterzee, encountering sea monsters and pirates, and discovering new islands and ports, much of the action unfolds via the act of reading snippets of text and then choosing from among a menu of options. This is familiar territory for people who've played Failbetter's Fallen London, a free text adventure. But for people expecting something a bit more like Sid Meier's Pirates, where different actions and encounters throw you into a different minigame, much of Sunless Sea might seem passive. It doesn't help that combat isn't all that involving. Enemies just slug away at you, and many of them can be easily outmaneuvered, especially if there are any rocks or inlets to help you confuse them. I rarely had much trouble taking on a bigger ship or a giant sea monster if I had a halfway decent gun and some hitpoints to spare. That's not quite as bad as it sounds, though. While it's a shame to just click past so much of the story after you've read it a couple times, the world and your needs change just enough that you won't always want to make the exact same choices each time through. I also ended up taking a lot of satisfaction in just how much easier progress became the more I played. My first expeditions were cautious grinds through the ocean, but by the time my fourth or fifth captain took to the sea, I was able to make up my lost progress in just a few voyages, and make some different story choices along the way. Frustration proved fleeting, and it was never long before I found myself launching Sunless Sea for just another couple voyages into the darkness. Pros Art and musicHilarious, haunting writingResource management Cons Weak combatRepetitious early game Sunless Sea gives you a wonderful world to explore and packs it with memorable written vignettes. Its permadeath flirts with repetitiveness, and combat is disappointing, but its far from running out of ways to inspire one more trip back across the Unterzee.", "date": "Feb. 20, 2015,"}
