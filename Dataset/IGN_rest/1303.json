In its judgmental eyes, for example, it said Im obese based on my body mass index, and balance is not my forte. Thankfully, it doesnt just leave you there to wallow in bad news. Wii Fit U has a huge variety of exercises to get your heart going, with only a few underdeveloped ideas tagging along as extra weight. The first thing Wii Fit U has you do is take a body test, in which you enter your age, height, and other information, and then you are weighed and subjected to a balance test. All of this is simple, quick, and fun, but the Balance Board can be highly inaccurate at times. This wouldnt be problem if you could choose to redo the tests or try them out with a practice run first, but neither is an option. Still, the Balance Board was able to collect accurate measurements most of the time. After your test, Wii Fit U recommends a proper BMI for you to reach. This ends up feeling limited because while your BMI is important, so is your body composition, which the Wii U has no way of measuring. If you feel like that goal is too demanding, or inversely, not demanding enough, you can tweak the weight gain/loss goal and the amount of time in which you want to reach it. The talking balance board character on screen is helpful when setting your goals, and it will make a point to tell you if your workout regimen is too extreme. This is great because unrealistic fitness goals wont help your motivation. Also, after your first test, Wii Fit U takes a picture of your face using the GamePad. Seeing your numbers improve is satisfying, but noticing improvement in before and after pictures is a tangible reward almost as satisfying as being able to tighten your belt a notch. Considering Wii Fit Us cutesy interface, it might convince you that it cant give you a good workout. The truth is that there are dozens of exercises for a huge range of fitness levels. Some are simple and might only elevate your pulse slightly. Stepping up onto the balance board in a Guitar Hero-like mini-game isnt very difficult; neither are some of the beginner yoga stretches. But some, like planking or jackknifes, will have you reaching for a water bottle. Special mention goes to some of the sillier games that wont burn many calories, but are good breaks between more rigorous sets. Holding the gamepad flat and delivering food to customers is a fun, simple exercise that tests your balance and speed, for example. When you go to select exercises, it feels like a random adventure at first. After completing one, Wii Fit U will suggests two others to pick from  usually one for cardio and one for stretching or flexibility. It can feel a little unfocused and unhelpful, especially if youre hoping to work up a good sweat. However, to counter this, it does have the option to schedule your own routines, which takes all the guesswork out of a daily workout. Scheduling them is simple, and you can make different lineups for different days that focus on yoga, strength training, flexibility, or other fitness goals. Once you figure out what you want to do and how long you want to do it, its as simple as getting on the board every day and following along. If you arent yet ready to create your own fitness plan, which is a reasonable position to be in, the virtual personal trainers offer a variety of fitness plans to select from. One, for example, is meant to boost your energy in the morning. One is a light, nighttime workout. The selection is almost too big, as some of them feel nearly identical. I would have preferred to see about half as many options, each with a distinctly different feel. When its time to weigh in with a new body test after some exercise, Wii Fit U can have some troubles. After a few days of work, the board read that I had lost over 200 pounds, which means I weighed about as much as a small dog. You can always do another body test, but its frustrating that you cant just redo the readings mid-test instead. Wii Fit U doesnt require you to use its portable step counter, but doing so is a great way to help keep yourself accountable. The meter records steps taken, and when youre back on the board you can transfer your data into the system and keep track of calories burned throughout the day. You can also see your steps visually represented in a few ways, like how far up a famous mountain youve managed to walk. This takes an activity as simple and forgettable as walking and turns it into something exciting, which is a great success. One of the best ways to reach your fitness goals is to work out with friends who will push you to keep going. Wii Fit U offers the ability to join a virtual gym with your friends, but its woefully incompetent. Competing with friends in mini-games could be fun, but you have to dig to find everyone elses scores. Theres no easy way to see who has done what, whos beating you at the hula-hoop game, or whos even a part of your gym. THE VERDICT Dont let Wii Fit Us cute, clean aesthetic fool you. When you turn it up a notch, Nintendos fitness game will have you breathing hard. Some of the options seem superfluous, and the gym functionality is totally ignorable, but its still a fun, effective way to get your sweat on.
