Heres how I summed it up then: ~State of Decays ambition reaches farther than most $60 titles, so its value is unquestionable as a $20 download  especially given how it manages to successfully meet so many of its lofty goals. I spent about 12 hours in this Zed-infested world, and while I saw most of whats there, I couldve spent a few more hours exploring. And since I focused on melee weapons the first time, I fully plan to start another game with a gun-centric character...Decay belongs in the pantheon of great modern zombie games alongside Valves Left 4 Dead series and Telltales Walking Dead episodes.~ Coming back to it on the Xbox One for the Year One Survival Edition, I realized Id forgotten how much I love State of Decay. Its deep, raw, unforgiving, and even emotional -- all in the very best of ways. Its neither a pure action game nor your typical open-world action-adventure. It is, in fact, a systems-based role-playing game with permanent (and sometimes far-reaching) consequences for your characters. Youll need to manage: relationships with fellow survivors, your groups resources, injuries to you and your group, your backpack weight, your influence, your fatigue, and more. That may sound like an intimidating list, but through an easily understood and managed interface (press up on the D-pad to access it anytime), Decays elements are intuitive and digestible. Year One Survival Edition also bundles in State of Decays two excellent expansion packs: Breakdown and Lifeline. Each tells a side story with a different gameplay angle: the former being a sandbox-emphasizing, challenge-oriented romp, and the latter letting you play from the perspective of the military -- a group at odds with the player in the primary campaign. Each is clearly meant to be played after you complete the main game, but its refreshing that neither is simply more of the same. Unfortunately, being re-released on a more powerful console has not cured its technical and presentation-based ills like Id hoped (and reasonably expected) it would. Clipping bugs, warping characters, and frame rate problems all still plague State of Decay on Xbox One. Even running in 1080p with higher-resolution textures and a few other minor cosmetic upgrades, Year One Survival Edition still very much looks like an Xbox 360 game. At least the annoying screen tearing has been rectified. But, please, do not judge this book by its cover. Everything I said in my original review still rings true: This is a special game, and captures the post-zombie-outbreak survival experience Ive always wanted to play. Is it worth double-dipping if you already played the heck out of it on 360? If you havent played the expansion packs, Id say yes -- particularly when existing State of Decay owners get $10 off YOSEs $30 asking price. If youve already squeezed every last drop of fun out of this game on 360 or PC, though, the additions here are minimal. Pros Same great gameplayTons of contentCleaner visualsStellar value Cons Still janky State of Decay deservedly shattered Xbox Live Arcade sales records in 2013: it is a potent mix of RPG gameplay systems that all fuse together to create an unpredictable and tense survival experience. Time hasnt taken anything away from that for Year One Survival Edition, and though it hasnt fixed its technical problems either, this zombie-bashing, resource-managing post-apocalyptic gem still stands out from the horde of brainless zombie games.", "date": "April 23, 2015"}
