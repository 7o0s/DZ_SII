Its creative approach to first-person shooting is also intriguing, since it has you floating above the action and calling the shots for a team of bots on the ground while firing away. But its not as smart as it looks, and what seemed like it could get interesting and tactical never really did. Disintegrations 15-hour campaign doesnt do a great job of setting up the conflict between the evil, red-eyed robots and the good, blue-eyed rebels, but a lot of that history eventually comes out in between-mission dialogue with your cohorts. Most of them have been integrated, which is the technology of transferring a human consciousness into a robot body. As former celebrity pilot Romer Shoal, you lead your team in a series of missions to take down the enemys massive flying fortress. The voice acting does lend those bots some good diverse personalities, and that gives the storys events a little bit of weight, at least. Our Thoughts On Multiplayer Read our Disintegration Multiplayer review in progress, which will be updated and finalized soon after Disintegration launches on June 16. There are a few Wha? moments from the opening minutes I have to call out: first, Romer knocks an evil robot unconscious by whacking him in the back of the head with a wrench. I dont think thats how robots work? A short time later, 12-foot-tall robot hulk Doyle backs down from attempting to intimidate a human who points out Doyles gun isnt loaded, as though Doyle couldnt literally squish this guy between his robo-toes like jam. It settles down after that but these eyebrow-raising moments set a strange tone for the rest of the story. Your guns will tear apart the environment in a pretty dramatic fashion. Disintegration is respectable but not the prettiest of games  its robots are well-animated but the textures, lighting, and effects are largely middle-of-the-road  but it does have some good diversity to its settings. Visually at least, no two are alike: youll start out in forests and move to canyons and junkyards and urban areas and more. Mission design, on the other hand, almost universally leans heavily on throwing wave after wave of the same handful of enemy types at you as you move through a linear gauntlet. Its not without variety in objectives, since youll often have to destroy a target or have your squad deactivate a jamming device so that you can use your gravcycles weapons again, but the process of fighting from point A to point B doesnt shake up too much because of limited enemy diversity, especially in the first half. To Disintegrations credit, blasting enemy robots like Star Wars battle droids is a fair amount of fun for a while. Not because their AI is especially good or anything, but because rather than literally disintegrating when you kill them they explode into chunks in a satisfying way, sending pieces flying. Thats one thing Disintegration does better than most games: your guns will tear apart the environment in a pretty dramatic fashion, reducing wood to splinters and even shattering concrete barriers that enemies were using as cover. Its not Red Faction or anything, since most of the environment is invulnerable, but this level of destructibility definitely makes the weapons and explosions feel powerful and look cool. And yet, combat gets stale pretty quickly because even though this is a squad-based game where you get a birds eye view of the battlefield, Disintegration isnt tactical at all. Where something like Mass Effect allows you to tell each unit where to go and what abilities to use when they get there, this is more like directing a mob. You cant tell your Iron Giant-style hulk buddy to play Rockem Sockem Robots with the big guys while the more agile soldiers take on the fodder because theres only one everybody attack this target or open that box button and they all act as one. Its very simple and one-note. There's only one ~everybody attack this target~ button  they all act as one. You do get to direct your squad members to individually use their special abilities, like grenades and ground-pounds, and they can be used as combos for extra damage. Missions side objectives will reward you, for example, if you can use the time-slowing bubble to hold enemies in place while Doyle bombards them with rockets. But these abilities arent really interesting to use because the positioning of your squad doesnt matter much  theres no setup required  so its just a matter of waiting for the cooldowns and then casting them again. You have to keep your team alive to use them, though, and also so they can absorb all the enemy fire that your fragile flying gravcycle cant. Depending on what gear youre given for a mission, that can be tricky to do  for instance, if you dont have any healing abilities and have to rely on pickups from certain enemy types or healing stations your crew can activate for you. But of course, if one of your bots goes down, all you have to do is retrieve their head and theyll rocket back onto the field a few seconds later in a shiny new body, so you dont need to sweat it much if they explode. Its important to keep them on the field to give the bad guys something else to shoot at, and theres a 30-second timer that will end the mission if you dont retrieve a head, but the stakes are largely pretty low. Then there are the boss battles, which look and sound great but are usually pretty weak. They boil down to shooting the giant four-legged Thunderhead walker (while dodging its slow-moving projectiles) until it goes down, then getting right up in its armpit  and I mean all the way up in its armpit  and hovering there while you hold down the fire button until each of four weak points explodes. It only got a little challenging when I had to deal with two at once, but the vast majority of these fights after the first one were painfully dull. Whats especially frustrating about Disintegrations campaign is that even though theres a whole area you walk around between missions where you can talk to your crew, you have zero control over your squad composition or your vehicles loadout. Every mission dictates all of that to you, and all you get to do is pump in a few upgrade points for boring but necessary stat boosts to weapons, cooldown reductions, and things like that. I get that Im being walked through different roles Ill need to know for multiplayer, like the healer and the sniper, but its a bit annoying to have things like how you heal yourself change from level to level and not being able to pick a favorite gun or robot and develop it. That lack of continuity made levels feel like a string of unrelated battles, and practically kills replayability because I cant return to a mission and play it with a different style of gravcycle and squad. Having no customization seems like a really poor design choice. Flying around and giving orders to cool-looking robots is a neat concept, but the simple shooting and squad management of Disintegrations single-player campaign make it fall pretty flat after a while. The surprising lack of customization and progression make the battles feel disconnected outside of the story, which has some decent characters but is otherwise a pretty straightforward rebellion against evil robot overlords.", "date": "June 10, 2020,"}
