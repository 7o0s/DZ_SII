{"name": "Beyond Eyes", "name_review": "Beyond Eyes Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/beyond-eyes/110132/review/beyond-eyes-review", "text": "Walking simulator is a fairly recent sub-genre term for a game whose only proper mechanics are, in fact, wandering through the story itself. In the case of Beyond Eyes, it can be applied almost literally. Its a fascinating premise for a novella in video game form and a noble attempt to express the sensory challenges a blind person faces, but with little else but the story to rely on, Beyond Eyes plot just isnt up to the task. Rae is a young girl in search of her cat, Nani, whos wandered away from Raes home and into the surrounding wilderness and villages. The feline hunt is a slow, methodical exercise due to Raes handicap: blindness. Because she has only her memories to tell her brain what things look like in the wake of a childhood accident that took her vision, her impairment is creatively and beautifully represented on screen as an all-white canvas that colors in piece by piece through touches, sounds, and smells that trigger those memories. At two to three hours long, Beyond Eyes never has a chance to overstay its welcome. But unlike Journey or many of Telltales short-form adventures, Raes story is debilitatingly barebones. Its entire script  delivered through the occasional update on Nani through on-screen text  is more like an outline that could fit on a cocktail napkin. Theres just not enough context to make me care for Rae beyond the empathy Id have for anyone whos lost their sight. Beyond Eyes fails to capitalize on its chance to tell a more emotionally impactful story in the context of Raes affliction. Even a piano-led musical score hints at a game wanting to do more, but the music is heard so rarely that usually youll be wandering in utter silence. Occasionally, Raes plight reaches out to give a meaningful moment of what a blind girls life must really be like; barking dogs and meddlesome crows become terrifying obstacles that cause Rae to physically recoil in fear (even though no harm can come to her in this game) and the thundering sounds of a rainstorm limit one of her remaining senses, inhibiting her ability to navigate her world. In those few brief moments, Beyond Eyes concept works. But the overwhelming majority of your time is simply spent wandering around each of its six chapters, running into dead ends and doubling back to look for a better route, hoping Nani is around the next corner. Just as my freshly poured disappointment began to harden like concrete, however, the end of Beyond Eyes emotionally affected me  finally! I wont spoil it to say quite how it did it, but know that I was happy that it had finally moved me. I had genuine, strong feelings towards the way the story concluded, and I left it appreciating that. If Raes tale had shown this side of itself prior to the last five minutes, it mightve been onto something. Pros Affecting endingNoble premise Cons Minimal storyPlodding paceUnderused score I badly wanted Beyond Eyes to use its attractively whitewashed look and novel, visually limited ideas to tell a much more moving story whose empathetic lessons couldve stayed with me long after the end credits rolled, but it didnt. Only its ending taps into this potential, and its a shame the rest of its short playthrough time couldnt follow suit.", "date": "Aug. 9, 2015,"}
