Its style, ease of use, features and overall performance set standards when it released back in 2009, and till date its been garnering attention from enthusiasts and professional gamers alike. But now its time for an upgrade,with the Steelseries Siberia Elite. This is the next-gen Siberia, a re-designed, re-imagined evolution in the popular headset lineup, and it definitely is a different serving. Design The Steelseries Siberia Elite keeps much with the design of the original Siberia, so you will still find the beloved one-size-fits-all headband suspension (now with a beaded metal finish), along with the retractable mic and the sophisticated white finish. The Siberia Elite does however, carry its own unique signatures, and features some wise and not-so-wise design choices. The Siberia has gained some weight - its plush with padding and feels luxurious to touch. Its got the same leather padding you will find in expensive cars, so the headset feels extremely premium. The extra padding on the ear cups doesnt leave much room for the speaker opening though, which is only about 2 in diameter and could create problems for some users (Ill expand a bit more in the next section). One of the cooler features of the Siberia Elite are the control dials. See the round object covering the headband joints on the ear cup? They are not simply for aesthetics and showing pretty lights (which are really pretty, by the way), but they double as control dials as well. Simply rotating the dial on the left ear cup will cause the microphone to mute or unmute, whereas the one on the right can be used for adjusting the volume. It takes some time to get used to it - you will simply not grab the right part in the first couple of tries - but after that its a very effective way to quickly access your settings instead of fumbling around with a in-line controller. Steelseries has also focused on connectivity with the Siberia Elite and has made it such that it works with just about everything - well, as long as you carry the necessary connectors with you. Its 1.2 meters cable ends with a proprietary USB port which can be connected to either of the two included 3.5mm connectors, the USB sound card, or to an extension cable for extra length. The right ear cup also includes a 3.5mm jack which allows you to connect another headset so two people can listen from one source. Comfort The Steelseries Siberia Elite feels like you are squeezing two baby cheeks against your ears. Its a crude example, but its the most apt one. The Siberia Elite is fantastically comfortable, with its thick padding submerging your ears in lush leather while blocking any external noise that may dare to disturb you. That said, the Siberia Elite may not be for everyone. Unlike the Siberia V2, the Siberia Elite sits on your ears rather than around it (hence, the small speaker opening). Its got sufficient padding to be comfortable, but it may cause pain to some users as the clamp force may prove to be slightly too harsh. While I had minimal to no problem using the Siberia Elite for extended periods of use, for others the mileage may vary. USB Sound Card & Software The included USB sound card is one of Siberia Elites biggest features. Its a small device that can take either the headset and mic jacks or the Siberia Elites proprietary USB port. I found using the USB port to be more compatible as the software would detect the headset as the Steelseries 9H otherwise...which is interesting. The USB sound card must be used in conjecture with the Steelseries Engine 3 and must be downloaded separately. The Steelseries Engine 3 only supports the companys latest products, so if you are sporting any of the previous Steelseries products, like I did with my Sensei Raw, you will be forced to run two separate softwares. It is kind of a bummer but thankfully the Steelseries software are extremely light on resources, so unless you are strapped for RAM, you should have no problems running two softwares except getting your Windows tray full. The Steelseries Engine 3 allows you to turn on some of the behind-the-box bullet point features of the Siberia Elite, such as the Dolby virtual surround sound, mic noise-cancellation, equalizer profiles, and to enable the very beautiful illuminations around the ear cups. Unfortunately, as feature rich and tweak-friendly the Steelseries software is, using the USB sound card means giving up on at least 30-35% of volume. The limitation is set via an update that is apparently issued to abide by certain laws that demand that volumes in headsets cannot go beyond a certain point. This completely negates the use of the sound card as it just doesnt have that extra support to deliver punchy sound effects and immersive environments. Enabling the Dolby surround sound makes it even worse, resulting in a messy, muddy sound quality with noticeable drop in details. Of course, the equalizer could be tweaked to produce more volume but it would require expert crafting of each frequency to ensure that it not only gives more volume but also retains details and sound quality, which entirely depends on the users skill. This is a huge drawback against the Siberia Elite as users are kind of forced into sacrificing other features like illumination, mic noise cancellation and equalizer options in favor of receiving the normal volume and sound quality back. Performance The Steelseries Siberia Elite is a gaming headset first and foremost and it doesnt shy away from that fact. The large 50mm drivers are tweaked to produce the most natural sound in games, and it nearly achieves that. The Siberia Elite does favor high notes a little bit too much, which could cause fatigue for some users. The crackle of a gun firing or close-quarter explosions does ring a little too close to comfort, which on higher volumes could be quite problematic. My test run included bouts of game time with Half Life 2 (the Ravenholm level), Call of Duty: Ghosts and Infamous: Second Son. The Siberia Elite excels in delivering incredible amounts of detail and punch while keeping the bass at its modest best. The distant screams of zombies in Ravenholm, the gurgle of the Gravity Gun, and the subtle thuds of fire and smoke escaping from Delsins hands in Second Son were a delight to experience, with everything sharp and crystal clear. The sound positioning is fantastic as well. I was absolutely, unquestionably petrified in Ravenholm as the Siberia Elite rose to the challenge of producing impressively engulfing soundscape that spared no change to scare the life out of me. The Siberia Elite proved great with Call of Duty: Ghosts as well, managing to achieve pinpoint accuracy of every ensuing gunfight and tracking of approaching enemy footsteps. When it comes to music, gaming headsets usually just completely dismantle and give up. But I am happy to report that the Siberia Elite does a fine job with music as well. I threw my regular mix of Hindi songs, from pop to hardcore bhangra to sufi music and it performed them with aplomb. A.R.Rehmans western Taal se Taal Mila was an absolute delight to experience. Pros Beautiful and sturdy designDat lightsStunning audio performancePlush padding for extra comfortRetains some of Siberias good DNA Cons USB Sound is a complete let downEmphasis on high notes, which may cause fatiguePricey The Siberia Elite costs $199, which is quite a penny to dole out for a gaming headset. They are certainly a lot more expensive than the Siberia V2 which still quite holds up when comes to sound quality. However, the Siberia Elite is definitely better, with an impressive set of features, stunning sound quality, and an excellent ergonomic design. The included USB sound card does cause it to lose a lot of the headsets volume, which forces users to sacrifice on some features for proper performance. And since it adds to the headsets final price, it requires a value consideration. Hence, the Steelseries Siberia Elite remains a superb gaming headset that does not quite justify its price tag.", "date": "April 8, 2014,"}
