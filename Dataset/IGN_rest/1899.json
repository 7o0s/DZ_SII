Though Ubisoft has dug up some of its stealth-action roots to make that style more appealing, Valhallas focus is on the absolutely massive recreation of Dark Ages England, brought to life with stunning beauty and a level of detail Ive rarely seen. Its been an impressive showcase for the Xbox Series X (and presumably the PlayStation 5, but Ubisoft only gave us access to the Xbox version ahead of launch), playing in 4K and a near-constant 60 frames per second. You have to put up with some new progression system ideas that dont quite deliver, and an abundance of bugs, but theres a staggering number of things to do, explore, and discover in and around Valhallas more atmospheric storytelling. Assassins Creed Valhallas story follows Eivor, a male or female Norse Viking who grows up with a chip on their shoulder and vengeance in their heart after some particularly dastardly events in the opening cinematic. From those starting moments, the table is set and soon you and your brother Sigurd are off on a grand adventure to England, a land ripe with wealth and glory, and already well-integrated with Danes and Norse from years of Viking invasion and conquest. That sets the stage for your arrival in England as you settle the land and forge alliances to protect and expand your fledgling homestead against the chaos and political dust storm of warring factions across Englands four kingdoms: Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria, and Wessex. The last time Assassins Creed tried letting us choose to play as a male or female protagonist the results were hit or miss, especially on the male side. Here, however, the performances of both the male and female versions of Eivor are admirable, though some accents drift a bit. (At one point I couldve sworn female Eivor made a stop in Boston from the way she crushed the word harbor, but quickly enough it was back to Norse normal.) These brief moments are absolutely the exception to the otherwise steady and earnest delivery throughout, which is also true of most of the main characters. Outside the main cast, though some random NPCs can be a little much. But special mention goes out to Sigurd, who channels fiery intensity and flirts with crazy in his performances, and that performance is accentuated by fascinating facial expressions that often lean uncomfortably close to the latter. The siblings' quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect.Even so, the siblings quest for wealth, glory, and power throughout England is darker, sadder, and more grounded than the tones of the past few games had led me to expect. There are moments throughout where the griefstriken, bittersweet, and just plain bitter resolutions reminded me of The Witcher 3s Bloody Baron delivery. This is a dirty, dingy world where life is cheap and nearly everyone is scratching and clawing to gain power  or to keep it  regardless of who gets burned along the way. One particular instance found me helping the leader of a nearby shire  regions within the four kingdoms (no hobbits)  who had discovered a traitor in her inner circle and charged me with rooting them out because she loved each one of them as family and couldnt trust herself to see past their lies. The resulting few hours of investigation brought me to the end of the road, and I made the best decision based on the available information I had. To be honest, Im not sure I was right; I still dont know. If the person I accused was guilty, Valhalla never gave me more clarity, and the uncertainty seems very intentional. My judgment was accepted and the consequences were swiftly doled out, and that was that. Ive found myself thinking about that decision ever since. But thats the business of eighth-century England, I suppose. A World Separated by an Ocean Valhallas vast interpretation of The Dark Ages of Britain is massive, and when coupled with a significant portion of Norway, Assassins Creed Valhalla presents a staggeringly large playground through which you ply your trade. And no matter where you are, its absolutely stunning. As I played it on the Xbox Series X, running 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, it may be the most beautiful Assassins Creed world yet; certainly the most satisfying to sit back and watch. The snow-blanketed tundras and mountainous ranges of Norway are breathtaking, especially at night as the aurora illuminates the sky above. The rolling green hills of England, cut up by iconic stone walls, are a ready canvas for the rays of light that pierce through the muggy cloud cover, casting shadows that slowly roll across the landscape. Its hard to overstate how gorgeous a scene can be when the various lighting and weather effects systems are all working in unison. When I stormed the banks of a small riverside church, ready to pillage and plunder, the streaks of light bombarding the dense fog lit up the screen and enveloped the Christian cross in a scene that couldve been pulled from a Dennis Villeneuve film, only with more heavy-handedness. Beyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassins Creed Valhallas England is in turmoil. Its home to clashes between Danes, Norse, Saxons, Britons, Picts, and more, all of whom have stuck a claim in one hunk of rock or another and will kill you to defend it  or to take it, depending on which side of the fence you happen to land on. Its a confusing mess of integration that creates an excellent social and political knot into which to tie this story, compounded by cultural and religious elements that really drive a sense of otherness in the many different regions, even if theyre just down the river. But as all Assassins Creed games do, the undercurrent of Assassins versus the Order of the Ancients runs everywhere. Its well represented in the various factions, and even in the decaying bones of the Roman Empire whose structures and architecture not only litter every region, but serve as excellent places to delve into the necessary long-forgotten tombs, crypts, and subterranean structures the series needs to hide its ancient order secrets. Again, thats similar to Assassins Creed Odyssey, but much of the legwork of hunting down The Order is optional outside the main antagonists that inject themselves into your tale and force that storyline. Beyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin's Creed Valhalla's England is in turmoil. In fact, the Assassins Brotherhood elements that rope Eivor in start softly, slowly weaving in and out of their story with admirable restraint before the usual Dan-Brown-ification picks up and reveals everything is touched by these organizations in one form or another. But the focus rarely shifts completely from the Eivors more-engaging efforts to build a network of alliances throughout Englands four kingdoms and its many, many shires. One final note before we move on, without spoiling anything: as a huge fan of mythology, Im stupidly excited for everyone to see Ubisofts interpretation of the Norse pantheon and Asgard. Tackling something so mystical and otherworldly had to be tough, but the end result is a more realistic and granular take on it than youd be used to if your familiarity revolves around the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comic books. Thats not a slight on either, just an acknowledgement that this is a refreshing change of pace, especially considering how insane Norse mythology is when you get into the weeds. To Go A Viking Many of Valhallas consistent high points come as you live the life of a stereotypical Viking. Aboard your customizable longship, youll sail along snaking rivers and lead your clan in raids against the gold-swollen churches and monasteries of England, bloated with supplies and materials needed to build your new settlement that then acts as your homebase and quest hub. The pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray. Even after so many hours, Ive yet to grow tired of blowing the horn as we approach the shore, and running up the hill as imposing stone steeples adorned in crosses and decoration tower over. Its a welcome distraction from longer and more involved quest chains, and provides a quick hit of combat serotonin when you just need to bury your axe in something. The pageantry of raiding is powerful: as you charge in, thatch-roof huts erupt in flames while priests and villagers wail and scurry throughout the fray. Like many wars of that time, eventually youre going to have to siege a castle or fortress, and thats where Valhalla really cranks up the medievalness. These mass assaults often serve as the payoffs for longer quest chains, pitting your armies against whatever upstart king, jarl, or noble calls themselves lord of the lands you aim to conquer. These battles are fever-pitched and chaotic, and while theyre often impressive to look at they usually require a small checklist of orderly tasks to complete: ram the gates to smithereens, breach the inner keep, and kill the despot at the center. After a few of these you can start to pick up the patterns, but often they involve scouting defenses and softening up the opposition before going in, so that adds an element of strategy to it even if it eventually boils down to you taking on the big bad guy at the end. Still, breaking through fortifications with siege weaponry and working toward the inner keep is a very cool spectacle and captures the grandeur of all-out warfare thats befitting a story of conquering kingdoms. But when youre done pillaging on your raid or shoring up an alliance with the new ruler youve installed, its time to spend those supplies and raw materials. For that we return to the Settlement, a place to invest your resources that serves not only as your quest hub, but as a separate layer of progression with tangible benefits. As you begin to build out your settlement youll construct vital locations like a merchant to quickly buy and sell goods, a barracks to recruit and hand-pick your raiding party, a stable to buy mounts and upgrade riding abilities, a blacksmith to upgrade weapons and armor, and much, much more. On the surface, these are welcome additions and giving you stake of land to handle your business definitely beats tracking down merchants in the big wide world. Its a little bastion of productivity that youll revisit again and again, and serves as the welcome come home location where youll plan your campaign across England, and dive into side character backstories and storylines. I'd love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay.At first, the settlement had me excited, because I love a good management experience  especially when everything offers some kind of reward to further power my character. Eventually, though, as upgrades and management started to slow down and shifted away from unlocking cool new things to getting statistical bonuses, the allure of my settlement began to dwindle and I found myself spending less on my building plans and more time just getting my shopping done before I went out to discover new interesting things. To be fair, there are strong elements at play in your settlement  like the shopkeepers and characters that live and work there which youll get to know and potentially care about  but I hope its a mechanic that Ubisoft continues to flesh it out in future Assassins Creeds entries because Id love to see more variety, customization, uniqueness, and integration into the core gameplay to make me want to spend time there for reasons other than a trade and quest depot. So, You Want to Be an Assassin? Since Assassins Creed Origins, Ubisoft has continued to transplant the series from the stealth-action genre to the more wider appealing open-world action RPG landscape. Its a change that Ive personally really enjoyed, since a big, immersive open-world loaded with oddities and things to do punches my ticket. But its come with the completely fair criticism that, when you carry the existing brand into new territory, it can alienate existing fans of the series that really miss and expect that subtle, nuanced gameplay of getting in, making the kill, and getting out without being seen. The stat-driven RPG nature of this new era of Assassins Creed games has made this next to impossible because assassinations are subject to leashed power based on your enemys level and your overall effectiveness at dealing backstab-y damage. So unless youre building into your stealth and assassination styles heavily, and trying to backstab enemies around your same level, odds are that when you stick them with the pointy end they take a ton of damage but dont actually die, and have to be finished off with a decidedly un-stealthy battle. I can see how thats frustrating for anybody who misses that kind of gameplay  especially since the series continues to trend toward emphasizing combat. Assassins Creed Valhalla, to Ubisofts credit, attempts to keep one foot on both sides, and it mostly succeeds thanks to a number of options that allow you to dial in your preferred style of play. The vanilla answer to this problem is in the skill tree. So if you play on the default difficulty, and default stealth difficulty (more on that in a minute), you can find ways to get closer to the original Assassins Creed style without going into the options menu. Specifically, theres a skill called Advanced Assassination that allows you to overcome enemy level difference and power imbalance as long as you hit the quick-time event prompt. I love this approach, personally, because it puts the onus on you to perform and seal the deal if your timing is right. If its wrong, youre going to pay for it when the big Viking turns on you and the alarm bells sound off. Thats the definition of a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. If thats still not close enough to home, youre in luck, because theres an outside gameplay tool in the options menu called Guaranteed Assassination that allows you to assassinate ALL enemies in one shot, regardless of level, every time. However, it does come with the following note: Please note that when choosing this option, you are not playing the game as it was intended to be experienced. So, take that as you will (itll probably lead to some missions being laughably easy) but know that its there. Finally, if you really want to dial in your assassination experience, youve got some control over the difficulty settings to get you there. Just as you turn on Guaranteed Assassinations for that old-school feel, you can independently crank the combat difficulty up as far as you can stand it in order to punish yourself for getting caught. And you can tailor the stealth difficulty as well, which manipulates a number of factors in the stealth system to allow for an easier or harder approach. So there you go. If youve been on the Its not an Assassins Creed game anymore train, Valhalla has a number of stops for you to hop off at should you take a detour through the options menu. Trying Things Out While Valhalla faithfully sticks to the open-world script of Origins and Odyssey, there are some new systems in play, for better and worse. This time around, skill progression and abilities have been decoupled, meaning you no longer gain cool new abilities automatically simply through leveling up. In fact, the entire level system is effectively gone. Though you still earn experience, and its still cached at steady intervals to reward you with skill points, you dont gain levels in the traditional format. Those skills points you earn are spent on the Skill Tree, which is more of a web, linking various clusters of unlockable upgrades into constellations that you work your way through along the three main regions: combat, stealth, and ranged. On paper its a good system, and slightly reminiscent of Skyrim in style, but for me its ultimately a step backward, for two reasons. First, while youll know which direction to invest in from the start depending on what pillar you want to go toward first, once youve unlocked the skill at the center of the cluster youve got to decide which direction to move from there. Do you work toward the left, to the right? Normally youd likely take a look at the skills further down the tree and figure out where you want to end up, but thats the rub: every neighboring cluster is hidden by fog until you spend the necessary points to unlock the node that connects one cluster to another. What this means is you dont know what the skill in the next group is going to be until you spend a few points to head that direction. Thats really frustrating early on, when you sink your valuable early points only to reveal a skill you dont care about. Numbers aren't fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you're a tornado of sharp edges? That's fun! But theres still value in the smaller nodes between the main skills in each constellation, you might say, being technically correct. And thats true. But these nodes are only minor statistical upgrades, offering +2 to melee or +1 to heavy melee attacks, for example. Those are useful, but theyre numbers. Numbers arent fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so youre a tornado of sharp edges? Thats fun! But do you know where that skill is? Not until you stumble upon it, or just look it up online. Thats not a great experience. Secondly, these unlockable skills at the center of the clusters are more passive, or augmentation to things you can already do, rather than the cool new abilities youd normally find in a skill tree. Granted, a lot of them are incredibly useful  vital even  but while being able to stomp on a downed enemy or control an arrow you fire from a predator bow are very useful, theyre not as impactful as being able to light your weapons on fire or kick someone off a bridge to their doom. Those game-changing new abilities are hidden throughout the world in books of knowledge, so unless youre exploring and hunting them from the get-go, the big-ticket abilities may not end up in your arsenal for dozens of hours. Because of this, for the first 10 or 15 hours I felt like Valhallas combat was underwhelming next to Odysseys bombastic style and flair. I was eventually proven wrong, of course, and it became as flexible, fluid, and brutal as ever after I unlocked enough skills and found enough abilities. But the whole system is skewed toward the mid-to-late game, which left me feeling fangless for over a dozen hours. It just takes way too long to start adding complexity to combat. So if this isnt your first Assassins Creed game, know that the initial scuffles can seem very bland hack-and-slash affairs until youve started discovering some tools in the open world. This Is My Axe; There Arent Many Like It, and This One Is Mine On the other hand, I adore the new direction Ubisoft has taken inventory and quests in here. For instance, theres far less loot in Valhalla than in Origins and Odyssey; instead of finding 400 junk-level bearded axes that youll inevitably sell to a merchant, Valhalla gives you different kinds of the archetypal axe, or shield, or greatsword, etc. Each weapon has a unique look, and even though two greatswords might be only slightly different statistically, they carry different passive bonuses for flavor preference. For example, one sword might do more heavy damage the more light attacks you land, while another might poison enemies youve knocked to the ground. Both are interesting, and useful, and offer you different ways to approach the same weapon style. If you find one you like, you can invest collectible currencies to not only upgrade its level, which improves its stats, but upgrade the quality, and that often comes with a new visual appearance and always allows you to upgrade its level even further. Its much less of a hassle and more rewarding in the long run than having to sift through two pages of greatswords, and weirdly allows me to grow more attached to them. As a pro tip, don't sleep on the spear.And as you further augment these weapons and shields with runes, youll find unique combinations of attack animations depending on which hand youre holding it in, for a nuanced system thats so much deeper than Id initially thought. As a pro tip, dont sleep on the spear. I know its not as sexy as the big two-handed axe, but its two-handed/left-handed heavy attack lets you stick an enemy and fling them in a direction of your choosing for massive damage. The other great change is in the greater flexibility and organic discovery of side quests and activities. Ubisoft has done away with the cascading list of side quests to track in favor of revealing colored-coded points of interest on the map for mysteries, wealth, and artifacts. Often youll find one of the many insane and light-hearted side stories  like one involving a crazy cat lady who happens to live next to a farmer whose field is overrun with rats (convenient!)  but it could also be a place of mystical power, a psychedelic hallucination challenge, or an ambush by bandits. These mysteries are, more often than not, much sillier than the main storyline, even farcical at times, but there are many that hide deeply unsettling secrets and deadly encounters. The beauty of the system is you dont know what youre getting into, but youre free to walk away at any time knowing that pale dot will still be there waiting for you when and if you decide to come back. Ultimately, theyre excellent quick reprieves from the darker, heavier tones of the long, multi-part main story quests, and the freedom to pick what you want to pursue without obligation keeps the elements of surprise refreshing and engaging. Look Back: What We Said About Assassin's Creed Odyssey Verdict: Assassins Creed Odyssey is a resounding achievement in world building, environment, and engaging gameplay with occasional problems throughout. Its incredible recreation of ancient Greece is something Ill want to go back to long after Ive finished its main story, and its excellent systems mesh together in a way thats hard to beat. While there are definite rough edges, Odyssey sets a new bar for Assassins Creed games and holds its own in the eternal debate over the best open-world roleplaying games ever. - Brandin Tyrrel, October 1, 2018 Score: 9.2 Read the full Assassin's Creed Odyssey Review Glitch in the Animus No matter where you go in Assassins Creed Valhalla, though, youre sure to encounter some lets call them quirks. Everyone and everything here is fighting a common foe: a large number of bugs and technical hiccups that span the spectrum of hilarious, annoying, frustrating, and downright broken. Ive run into half a dozen hard crashes that returned me to the Xbox dashboard. Ive cursed out loud at ore deposits and door barricades that just refused to break thanks to the attack animation of whatever weapon I was holding not connecting perfectly, I guess? Ive avoided a number of staircases that snag you halfway up and refuse to let you do the one thing they were made to do. Ive stood perfectly still as enemies ran tight, fast circles around me, or brazenly ignored the arrows Ive buried in their heads. Ive ridden nitro-powered rowboats that take flight whenever you dash onto the shore, and restarted Valhalla because quest progression came to a grinding halt when a vital NPC got stuck in a river or decided to just never move to begin with. Ive looked past lingering HUD elements that overlap or stay on screen. Ive raged against enemy Zealots  Valhallas version of mercenaries  that inexplicably regained health even when I was drowning them in a river or beating them to death with my bare hands, becoming effectively immortal. And friends, I swear to you, Ive seen a flying whale. No matter where you go in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, though, you're sure to encounter some let's call them quirks. Lastly, I dont know if this is a bug or just a result of the developers wanting you to be able to do cool aerial attacks, but the fact you can survive a 100-foot fall by performing an attack in mid-air seems like the former. Im not complaining, it helps speed up getting from point A to point B when I dont want to look for a safe landing space, but its just so odd. Anyway, you get it. Valhalla is buggy  really buggy. That said, it wasnt overpowering; looking back after over 60 hours played, all those nagging issues feel like small footnotes in whats otherwise been many great hours of exploration and discovery. And, in the moment, I think its easy to miss out on the forest for the trees. So while I may never forget that flying whale, its not the first, or second, or even tenth thing I think about when I think of Assassins Creed Valhalla. Assassins Creed Valhalla is a big, bold, and ridiculously beautiful entry to the series that finally delivers on the much-requested era of the Viking and the messy, political melting pot of Englands Dark Ages. It walks a fine line between historical tourism, top-shelf conspiracy theory, and veiled mysticism against the backdrop of a grounded and focused story. Fresh takes on several of the series established loot and quest systems help to keep the things fluid and nuanced, though progression could use refinement. Theres also a bigger than usual horde of bugs and blemishes to contend with from start to finish. But while it may not be the most stylish or polished, its rugged and brutal look at the muddy business of Scandanavian expansion is as memorable and dense as an Assassins Creed has ever been, and it makes great use of the new consoles.", "date": "Nov. 9, 2020,"}
