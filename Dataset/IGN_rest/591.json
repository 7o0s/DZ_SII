Firewatch, then  on the strength of its gripping story, brilliant branching script, wholly convincing voice-acting performances, and stunning art direction  is easily one of my favorite and most memorable game experiences of this decade. Firewatch quickly lets you know that its not going to pull any emotional punches over its four to fivehour runtime, opening with a series of text-based choices that call back to adventure genre forebears like Zork. I dare not spoil this potent sequence, but I will say that it masterfully bounces between being funny and heart-wrenching and plausibly establishes just why protagonist Henry ends up in the Wyoming woods as a solitary fire lookout. Morning Glory Above: Firewatch Day 1 gameplay video (SPOILER WARNING) The Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a real place. Once you arrive there, Firewatchs powerful ambiance takes hold. The story takes place over the course of an entire summer, with different days  which are treated as chapters of the story  playing out at different hours of the day and night. That allows bold reds, yellows, and oranges to color this fictional Wyoming forests beautifully painted scenery (a contribution by renowned illustrator Olly Moss)  all in a comfortable and immersive first-person perspective. It is a testament to both Moss and Firewatchs level designers that, even despite the stylized look, the Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a real place: the narrow passage through Thunder Canyon, the serene calm of Jonesy Lake, the comically small size of Pork Pond, and the unexplained mystery of the Medicine Wheel. In fact, only the strange absence of almost any wildlife whatsoever betrays the convincing setting. Firewatch sounds as good as it looks, thanks to a world-class script acted to perfection by its two leads. Rookie lookout Henry is given a playful vulnerability; you can choose to play him serious or funny, and the performance is up to the task either way. Henrys boss  and primary point of human contact for the entire summer  is Delilah. Her emotional armor is thick, and she shows the cracks in her personality were allowed to see as we play without resorting to being overdramatic. He Said, She Said Above: Firewatch Day 2 gameplay video (SPOILER WARNING) It's tense, scary, and funny  sometimes all within a few minutes of each other Right from the jump, their relationship feels real, despite the fact that theyre communicating entirely via radio, with no faces on screen to lend emotional cues. Henry  or Hank, as she sometimes defiantly calls him  comes across as a good man at heart, but a flawed one  a man not sure about whether or not to go back to the life he left behind in Boulder, Colorado. He is fully capable of matching wits with Delilah, who uses humor as a shield for the personal life she doesnt like discussing as they get to know each other over the course of the summer. Its a pair of firework-launching teenage girls that set Firewatchs story in motion, and you can choose to talk to Delilah at almost any time by bringing up your two-way radio. Shes got something to say about almost everything, whether you need advice on how to handle a given situation or youre just reporting your progress on a task shes given you, and shes so engaging that I found myself eager to call about every little thing I came across. Things get darker  in a figurative as well as a sometimes literal sense  when the teens go missing, and you and Delilah try to piece together the puzzle of their whereabouts while making your own critical (sometimes difficult) decisions. The writing here is simply head and shoulders above nearly every other game Ive ever played. In fact, Firewatchs script, unlike most video games, would also make a fantastic novella thats every bit as gripping as the game is. Its tense, scary, and funny  sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that. Woods You Kindly... Above: 17 minutes of Firewatch gameplay (SPOILER WARNING) There were points where I was afraid to turn around in the vast, lonely woods. Like other so-called walking simulators, the gameplay in Firewatch is the story, though at least theres more to actually do here than in most games within the genre. A substantial swath of Two Forks Woods is explorable, with supply caches, unique sights, and even a hidden turtle you can adopt (youre gonna live with me now, Shelly Duvall!). Youll rappel down cliffsides, climb up rock formations, explore the lookout tower that doubles as your home for the summer, and more. And yet, these same simple actions that are a delightful exploration of your new surroundings at the beginning of the game become almost terrifying as the plot progresses, leading to points where, playing in Henrys first-person perspective, I was afraid to turn around in the vast, lonely woods. Speaking of navigation: though Im thankful theres no giant arrow at the top of the screen pointing me exactly to where I need to go at any given moment, I did find getting around the Two Forks Woods a bit cumbersome at times, particularly near the end. While I was never hung up for too long, translating the map to the actual trail in front of you had me occasionally taking a wrong fork in the path. Henrys compass helps a lot, however, so I was never hung up for too long. As for the ending, its the only other part of Firewatch I wasnt crazy about. I want to be very careful not to spoil anything, so Ill just say that I didnt quite find the revelation I had hoped for when I reached the end of what the story had been building up to. At the same time, however, I didnt dislike the ending either. In fact, I find myself still thinking about it, trying to think of missed clues or other small cues that might yet give me the Ah-ha! moment Im after. Ill be very interested to hear other peoples take on the conclusion  this is the kind of game where the discussions that will arise afterwards are an important extension of the experience itself. Pros Amazing writingStellar voice actingGorgeous artImmersive world Cons Anticlimactic ending Firewatch is amazing for many reasons, but above all because its an adult game that deals with serious issues, with realistic adult dialogue to match. And it deals with those issues just like actual adults would: sometimes with humor, sometimes with anger, and sometimes with sadness. It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. Its a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters  just like a good book.", "date": "Feb. 8, 2016,"}
