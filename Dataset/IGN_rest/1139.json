This is no place to be caught in the dark, but I'm close to a breakthrough  I can feel it. I chip through layer after layer of dirt, hoping that the little bit of steam left in my drill will let me find something worthwhile before something mean and hungry finds me. Risk-reward is the name of the game here, and its what drives this 2D platformer to greatness. Just as my lamp gives off its last light, I catch a twinkle in the darkness and smash my drill into the hard ground, grinding the gears until the earth cracks open beneath my feet. I tumble down safely and watch with lust as a fat, juicy diamond plummets into the darkness below. Even though death is costly, greed gets the better of me. I leap down after it. Riskier and riskier. The rough landing nearly ends me, but Im alive, and I have my prize. Now, as I try to think of a way back out, I hear a guttural moan in the cavern ahead of me. I pull out a rusty pickaxe, rushing headlong at the creature. Just when I think I'm going to make it, I hear the familiar hiss of a short fuse on the end of a long, red stick, and I remember the creatures can use explosives. Then everything goes white, and I'm back up on the surface with fewer dollars to my name than I began with. I'm crushed. But now I've got to get that diamond back. My ego is at stake. SteamWorld Dig has been a constant ride of ups and downs for me: moments of thrilling elation, where small risks lead to rich rewards... and moments where I lost almost everything. But its premise is so incredibly simple  dig through an abandoned mine for buried treasures to sell on the surface, buy upgrades, then repeat  that it refuses to let go, no matter how many times I've failed. Many times now I've picked it up with the intention of playing for just a few minutes before bed, only to find sunlight creeping across the face of my 3DS as the battery starts to give out. That hook has remained across every platform Ive played it on since. The PlayStation 4 and PC versions, in addition to their crisper textures, improved animation, and newly added bloom lighting, sport a slightly wider field of view, making it easier to spot potential dangers in the mine below. The Vita port is more or less the same as the 3DS original, save for some minor interface adjustments and obvious increase in resolution. One unfortunate omission from the Cross-Buy enabled PSN release is Cross-Save functionality, but the PS4s built-in remote play functionality makes up for this a little. An additional benefit of remote play: it brings the PS4s wider field of view to the Vitas small screen. Though the core action lasts only a few minutes at a time before our character, a cutely animated robot prospector named Rusty, has to retreat to the surface hub to recharge his solar-powered light source, it's easy to get lost in an endless cycle of ~just one more run.~ Trading jewels and ore for cash to buy upgraded equipment, discovering new shortcuts through the mine, and inching your way closer to the bottom all comes together in a hypnotic sort of rhythm. Its further enhanced by some exceptionally clever audio design, with the steady clinking of your pickaxe and the deep thrumming of the western-influenced musical score rendering the progression of outside time meaningless. The surface hub is a bit of a letdown, with characters that are fun to look at but ultimately forgettable, but perhaps this is for the best: they serve their purpose and little more, ensuring you're free to focus on the mine. While SteamWorld Dig's randomly generated, fully destructible environments and subterranean setting draw natural comparisons to Spelunky and Terraria, it plays more like a cross between Dig Dug and Super Metroid. Youll carve your own path through the mine, though at certain predetermined points you'll discover special gear that allows you to overcome obstacles with an expansive, Samus Aran-esque skillset. For instance: you might chase some particularly valuable ore to the bottom of an unusually deep chasm with no apparent way to get back up, but if you survive long enough, you'll discover something like the double-jump boots, enabling your escape. It's a neat inversion of Metroid's most-imitated mechanic; where most games present you with new ways to move forward, SteamWorld Dig's upgrades often serve to get you safely back where you started... which, as you'll discover, is ultimately the only way to get to the end. What I find most appealing about SteamWorld Dig is that many of Rusty's additional abilities can actually be skipped if you choose to dig a more conservative path to the bottom of the mine. This provides an interesting challenge for speed-runners. Since each new playthrough generates a different dungeon layout, you'll have to figure out the most efficient upgrade path (and stay alive) rather than simply memorizing item locations and map layouts. I wrapped up my first playthrough in just under six hours, but I'd died so many times that I couldn't afford the final upgrade because I had no money left to spend and my mine was tapped dry of resources. My second run was down to four hours, but my third took considerably longer as I tried to destroy every possible rock and dirt clod while still leaving a path back to the surface. There are many ways to play, and you're free to approach it any way you like. Pros Intuitive mechanicsHypnotic rhythmExcellent replay valueClever upgrades Cons Shallow side characters SteamWorld Dig is easily the best eShop game of 2013, and just as good on PS4, Vita, and PC. With a core mechanic that's as simple to understand as it is fun to experiment with, an engrossing atmosphere, and exceptionally refined platforming action that lends itself to multiple play styles and playthroughs, this is an addictive cycle that makes the 3DS difficult to put down.", "date": "March 26, 2014"}
