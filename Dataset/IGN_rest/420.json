The software side of things has been slow to catch up to the potential of VR headsets, but the technology itself is mindblowing because of the way it lets us interact with virtual worlds like were actually there  something thatd only been dreamed of until the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive came out earlier this year. Its fantastic that Sonys PlayStation VR headset will allow many more people to have these groundbreaking experiences by lowering the financial barrier to entry, with only a few compromises. Though the PlayStation VR is advertised at only $399.99, that price is misleading because its mostly useless without the $59.99 PlayStation Camera, which is sold separately. Additionally, many of the launch games either require or make use of one or two motion-tracked PlayStation Move controllers, which must also be purchased separately for between $20 and $30 each. Bundles (like the one on which this review is based) are available with the full set for $499.99, which is still a major price advantage. The HTC Vive, which includes its two Lighthouse sensors and motion controllers, costs $799.99; the Oculus Rift is $599.99 and comes with one sensor and an Xbox One controller (and its wireless dongle), but Oculus will soon release its Touch controllers for an as-yet-unannounced price that is speculated to be in the range of $200. So, combined with the fact that it hooks up to a $299.99 PlayStation 4 instead of a gaming PC that would cost you $700 or more, the PlayStation VR is by far the cheapest option for good-quality VR with motion control. Cheaper almost always comes with a you get what you pay for caveat, and the PlayStation VR is no exception. But the impact of those differences is less than Id expected when it comes to what happens when you put the headset on. One of the most important parts of a VR headset is the screen, and having used the higher-resolution Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (which both use two screens for a combined resolution of 2160x1200), Im impressed at the quality of the PlayStation VRs 1920x1080 image, which is split down the middle to display a different point of view for each eye. While the resolution is noticeably lower, the screen door effect, caused by the faint lines that separate the pixels on a display when you view it up close, is minimal. In-game text is very readable (though it must be larger than on other headsets to be legible). Theres also little or none of the visible radial lens pattern or streaking light effects I observed on the other two headsets. I'm impressed at the quality of the PlayStation VR's image. No matter which headset you choose youll see virtual worlds through what looks like SCUBA goggles. The field of view on the PlayStation VR is slightly lower than its competitors (meaning the goggles look thicker) but in the same ballpark; the differences between the three are minor enough that unless youre directly comparing one after another youre unlikely to notice. One of the big questions going in was whether the PlayStation 4 had enough horsepower to run games at the 90-frames-per-second rate that VR demands in order to minimize nausea. So far it has kept up admirably, with no significant frame rate dips in any of the games Ive tried. Thats in both high-detail games like Batman: Arkham VR or EVE Valkyrie and low-detail ones like Tumble VR or Job Simulator. Again, it will never look as good as a Rift or a Vive on a gaming PC, which are capable of producing sharper and more detailed images, but the PlayStation VR does the job adequately. And with several people in the IGN office playing games on it over the past week, none has reported any unusual problems with nausea. Motion Tracking The other crucial part of a VR setup like this one is the motion tracking, and here is where I felt the pinch most. Relative to the Vive and its two sensors placed in opposite corners of your play area, the PlayStation VRs reliance on its single camera is a significant weakness. It does work reasonably well thanks to the depth-sensing capabilities of its two lenses, but its field of view is narrow enough that I frequently bumped up against its limits with the Move controllers. With the recommended six feet of distance between me and the camera, I find I have to frequently adjust the angle to cover me when switching between a standing experience like Batman: Arkham VR and a sitting one like SuperHyperCube. And even in the best-case scenario, it cant cover your whole body and the floor around you, so if you see something shiny on or near the ground you cant reach down to pick it up. All the games Ive played thus far (such as Job Simulator, Tumble VR, and Batman) have accounted for this by simply warping items back to the playable height if you drop them, but its jarring to have your hand stop two feet from your target. You can tell someone theyre not supposed to do that until youre blue in the face, but considering the whole point of VR is to fool peoples brains into thinking what theyre seeing is real, they will still make that mistake from time to time.Also, that inherent limitation means that even though were being immersed in a 360-degree virtual world where things can happen anywhere, well never be able to turn around 180 degrees and shoot a monster that pops up behind us. Any time your body is between your hands and the PlayStation Camera, it has no way of knowing where they are and completely loses the ability to track them. (Its difficult to directly compare the PlayStation Camera to the Rifts single sensor because the Touch controllers arent available yet, but from my experience with head tracking the Rifts field of view seems wider.) Tracking works well the majority of the time, but when it doesn't it's frustrating. In general, the motion tracking reliability ranges from adequate to flakey, especially on Move controllers  for no reason I could pinpoint, it would sometimes wig out and one of my in-game hands would vanish or start flying away uncontrollably. Yet the next session in the same environment would be fine. To be clear, it works well the majority of the time, but when it doesnt its frustrating. Controllers Its great that the DualShock 4s light is finally useful for something: if a game supports it, you can see your controller in the VR environment exactly where youre holding it, often with instructions on which button to push hovering over it. That can serve as a clumsy stand-in for Move controllers if you dont have them  and this is something the Rifts included Xbox One controller cant do due to lack of a tracking light. But in many games, youre required or strongly encouraged to use PlayStation Move controllers to interact with the virtual environments, which is a much more natural way of reaching out and touching things. Sony's use of the existing PlayStation Move controller thats been around since 2010 has the benefit of there already being a bunch of them out there (though theyre likely pretty dusty) and their buttons and triggers are well suited for the tasks of representing hands that grasp objects or guns. Its unfortunate theres no rumble in them, though, because thats the only tactile feedback thats possible when trying to touch something that doesnt exist or firing a gun that you expect to have a kick. 12", "date": "Oct. 5, 2016,"}
