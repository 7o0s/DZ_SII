Like all Kairosofttitles, Pocket League Story is a fantastic experience, but it lacks the depth of some of the company's best. You'll have to buy the green grass for your own stadium. It's up to you as general manager to turn a rec-league soccer team into World Champions within the game's eight-year time limit. Based on how well-trained your players are, how many sponsors you've accrued, and how many wins you've notched, at game's end you can set a new high score and adorn the title screen with a golden trophy. During a match, you hold very little control over the outcome. You can tap a player to unleash their ~Aura~ at special times, but generally you're left gripping your device, passively watching the tiny drama play out before your eyes. A game between closely matched teams contains all the highs and lows of a real match, and some nail biters play out until the last second. Like all Kairosoft titles, the fun comes not from directly controlling the action, but instead by successfully managing finances, research points, and other resources to create an efficient, goal-scoring machine. Goal! Well, maybe. Research points come in four flavors: strength, tactical, idea, and hearts. These can be divvied up amongst players training, recruiting sponsors, and holding fan events. The quirk is, no matter how terrible your team fares, if you have the cash you can attract any superstar player to your team and any sponsor to your cause. In reality, while some Premier League teams might throw cash around in this manner, a losing team with only a few hundred fans shouldn't be able to attract a World Class superstar. This unbalances the game, most noticeably the second time through. After your first playthrough, each character you've trained to higher levels keeps their stats  so you'll have the opportunity the second time around to nab cheap recruits who've retained their training. Thus, the second time around a lot of the challenge goes out the window -- think hat trick after hat trick for the duration of your team's career. It's fun to watch your team trounce their opponents 14-0 once or twice, but the overkill gets tiresome. While a few late-game matches provide a consistent challenge, Pocket League Story is too mindless after the first loop. Kairosoft distills the sport into workable management by removing a few key aspects of the game, for better or worse. Elements like penalties or injuries would have helped the simulation feel more complete. CLOSING COMMENTS If youre looking for a portable soccer sim, youre going to have a blast playing through Pocket League Story (at least the first time around). But dont expect the depth of some of Kairosofts titles  on my second playthrough I won every match in the game and unlocked every upgrade with ease.
