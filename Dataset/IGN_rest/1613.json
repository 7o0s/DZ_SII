The gameplay revolves around attacking and defending nodes to expand and diversify your army, in the same vein as something like Galcon. Because of restrictions on movement and unit control, decisions about what to move and when aren't especially difficult to make, and despite the simplicity it's still satisfying when you manage to steer your forces in the right direction to capture a key node and secure a victory. The game's random elements are a source of frustration, however, and the single-player mode is a bore. In Oil Rush's Waterworld-like fictional universe the earth is covered with water and everyone fights over oil. Every combat map is dotted with nodes that specialize in automatically pumping out Piranha jet skis or Stingray attack helicopters or battleships. The more nodes you have under your control, the larger your army will be and the more swiftly you can replenish losses. After a match begins, you race against your opponents for control of these nodes by sending out your accumulated army. Each unit type has specific advantages. Flying units can pass over exposed land to easily access any node on the map. The Piranha are produced quickly, though they can be blown up just as quickly. Scouting is important in this regard, as it means the difference between soaring in planes to snatch an empty node or flying them directly into heavily defended territory. Once captured, every production platform can be fortified with five turrets, some better suited to defend air assaults and some best at knocking out heavy armor. Establishing a defensive turret perimeter around your nodes is key, because then units you were using to defend can be used to attack. Building turrets consumes oil, harvested through capturable rigs dotted around maps. These rigs cannot be reinforced with turrets, meaning you need to carefully consider how many units to leave around to defend the rigs and how many you can send out to assault other nodes. If you lose the rigs you won't be able to build or upgrade turrets, which means your production nodes will be vulnerable, which means you need to pull back your attack forces to defend, which means you won't be able to expand, which means you'll probably lose. Preventing this kind of chain reaction of failure makes every match exciting, though in some instances can be frustrating. There's an element of chance programmed into Oil Rush's encounters that unnecessarily hinders the effectiveness of your decision-making. Unless you bring an overwhelming force to blast apart enemy fleets and turret defenses, you're at the mercy of units' automated targeting and movement. When not in transit, units move in circles around nodes. As enemies attack, it's often the case where your most powerful units are looping around the far side of the node, meaning the incoming army has a window of time to get a bunch of free shots off against your turrets and weaker units. Instantly and through no fault of your own, you're at a disadvantage. Units will loop around eventually and join the conflict, but it's irritating to have to watch as a percentage of your fleet needlessly dies, or if during an attack your fleet stubbornly avoids focusing fire on the most dangerous targets, instead spreading attacks out all over. The lack of direct unit control is an intentional design decision, which would have fit a lot better if Oil Rush didn't penalize you for its absence. The unreliable targeting and movement behavior of units adds the wrong kind of risk-reward tension to the gameplay. It's still easy to attack and defend if you've amassed a huge fleet, but in evenly matched conflicts, such random pitfalls can make a big difference. The upside of this style of play is that your attention can be directed to the broader game. You must quickly switch between minimap movement commands, your tech tree to buy better armor, weapons and unlock powerful units and abilities, and your nodes to replace or upgrade turrets. As units are killed nodes will automatically churn out more to meet the unit cap, and it's your job to ensure the units congregate at the proper nodes to help defend, ready an assault or reinforce an ongoing attack. This gives you enough room to outthink your opponent and come away with a satisfying victory. To learn how everything works, a story mode is available. If Oil Rush's tale is supposed to be campy, the intention is far from clear. It comes off as a self-serious snoozefest full of unintentional humor without any creativity to sustain interest. The characters are completely forgettable, and though plot twists and tragedies trail them in their adventures, all potential drama is destroyed by their lifeless dialogue. The mission variety is slightly better. A few require you to simply conquer an entire map node by node, but others play more like tower defense missions and offer multiple tiers of objectives. Most provide decent challenges, though several unfairly pin you into unwinnable scenarios, particularly an ill-conceived convoy escort mission where the ships you're supposed to protect park themselves directly in front of enemy attack lanes, which of course you can't reliably defend as your units can only swirl around nodes instead of stay still and encircle the convoy. Multiplayer is the preferred way to play, against AI or against humans. The maps offered present a nice variety of set ups, offering straightforward kill and capture objectives as well as more specialized challenges. The Oil Spill map for two players features only one oil rig, and the winner is the first to reach 1000 units of extracted oil. Other maps vary the layout of sea lanes and type of production rigs in the field of play, meaning different approaches are required for victory. Unfortunately there really aren't many people online right now through Steam, and connection issues are a hazard for games you do manage to get set up. Oil Rush does have the added bonus of great visuals and animations, though paying attention to them actually detracts from your ability to play well. All movement commands are given through the minimap, and aside from the moments where you click on nodes to build, sell or upgrade turrets, there's little reason to watch the battles. Despite how adamantly Oil Rush's tutorial directs you to use the cinematic camera, it's advice best ignored if you want to win. CLOSING COMMENTS Oil Rush offers a lighter style of strategy gameplay. It automates a large percentage of combat and production, challenging you to instead built turrets and manage fleet movement to capture and defend territory. The simple unit relationships and straightforward mechanics can be fun, though some of the gameplay elements beyond your control hinder the experience more than they should. The flawed story mode can be safely passed by, but if you're able to find an opponent online or skirmish against the AI it's easier to appreciate Oil Rush's strengths.
