{"name": "Nuclear Throne", "name_review": "Nuclear Throne Review", "ref": "https://me.ign.com/en/nuclear-throne/114060/review/nuclear-throne-review", "text": "Nuclear Throne is pure chaos: an explosive, gun-slinging romp through a post-apocalyptic wasteland that marries the frantic energy of bullet hells with the tactical risk assessment of a roguelike. Boasting a mean arsenal of weapons, from standard revolvers to plasma cannons, it packs a big enough punch to draw in fans of fast-paced run-and-guns, but also demands a patience and strategy that rewards slow and methodical players too. With a cast of colorful characters to choose from and a simple leveling system that grants fun new skills as you progress, theres no shortage of unique approaches to play which is good, because coupled with Nuclear Thrones unforgiving level of difficulty, youll probably be playing a lot. A game of Nuclear Throne can be over in an instant, but because it rewards you so often, with frequent weapon pick-ups and fancy skills, every failure feels like a fresh new beginning: an opportunity to learn and grow your character in interesting new ways. Ordered Chaos Part of that is owed to its excellent balance of randomness and familiarity. Like any action-roguelike hybrid (see: The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky), Nuclear Thrones levels, enemy spawns, and item pick-ups are all procedurally generated. Themed levels grant a degree of consistency, so while you may never get the same layout twice, youll still have a general idea of what to expect each time you enter a new zone. This is super valuable for planning ahead, which plays a major part in mastering Nuclear Thrones challenges. It may be a shoot-em-up, but rolling into battle with even the biggest guns blazing will only get you so far. The bulk of Nuclear Thrones strategy manifests in its engaging skill system. Downed enemies drop radioactive energy, or rads, which act like experience points. If youve cleared a level by annihilating all enemies and earned enough rads to level up, you get to choose one mutation out of four before moving on to the next area. Some skills are pretty basic, adding things like more HP and ammo drops, while others might build off of your characters existing ability, buff certain weapon types, or make enemies weaker. Its super satisfying to pile on your favorite mutations over the course of a playthrough until you have that perfect build, but part of overcoming Nuclear Thrones difficulty means experimenting with the constantly shifting tweaks that each new skill provides. With so many mutations to choose from, you might not always be given the options you want, which is part of Nuclear Thrones exciting unpredictability. It forces you to change up your playstyle, work with the tools youre given, and continue to adapt, ultimately making you a better player without holding your hand. Despite its difficulty, Nuclear Throne is extremely accessible. Uncomplicated controls, a simplified leveling system, and clear goals make it really easy for casual players to jump right in and know what theyre doing. For committed players, there are hidden areas and shortcuts to be unlocked, rare weapons to be found, and secrets to be discovered, and while the complexities of Nuclear Thrones action may not seem as immediately deep as similar games like Spelunky, it still has a lot to offer for those with the time to seek it out. Unfortunately, Nuclear Throne does suffer from occasional crashes, which is a huge pain in a game where progression cant be saved or reloaded. It didnt happen frequently enough to put a dent in my positive experience, but I was also lucky to never have it happen while I was going up against the last boss. Pros Good mix of action/strategySkills add varietyChallengingHugely replayable Cons Occasional crashes Nuclear Throne might not be a super complex game, but it is a compelling one. Its action is brutal, over-the-top, and rewarding; a hyperactive arcade-style shoot-em-up with enough dynamism to keep me captivated moment to moment, but a strong sense of strategy to give me something to invest in over longer playthroughs. Whether you want to sink your time methodically making it to that elusive throne or play in quick, punchy bursts, Nuclear Throne is an excellent choice either way.", "date": "Dec. 17, 2015,"}
