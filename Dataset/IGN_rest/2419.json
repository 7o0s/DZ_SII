This year we're trying something new: because Call of Duty: Black Ops 4's modes are so different, we're reviewing them separately, followed by our overall review and score. YThis part covers the entirety of Black Ops 4  be sure to check out the individual reviews next. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Zombies Review Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Blackout Review Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review Developer Treyarch touted that, for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, multiplayer as a strategic experience where teammates could work together to gain the advantage in the Fog of War and outplay their enemies. I say leave that to the paid professional players and to the hardcore teams. For the rest of us, Black Ops 4 multiplayer isnt so much of a strategic first-person shooter as it is a first-person shooter that encourages creativity in playstyles but doesnt demand it. It also sets a whole new tempo for Black Ops, one that successfully moves away from thrust-jumps and wall running to a slightly toned-down speed that makes for a more fitting pace. Black Ops 4s multiplayer certainly has its issues, including a disappointing new mode Control, and some lacking map designs. But with all of its Specialist changes and its new Heist mode, Black Ops 4 makes for a good entry in Call of Dutys long multiplayer history, though unexciting launch maps may leave it in the shadows of its exciting battle royale sibling, Blackout. That Bunny Has a Gun Black Ops 4s arsenal plays exactly as I expected it to as a longtime Call of Duty player: it rewards players with quick reaction times and those who are skilled enough to get headshots. Black Ops 4 maintains Black Ops 3s status quo of doing away with drop shots while maintaining the goofy, bunny-hopping effectiveness of the jump shot. With thrust-jumping gone, the jump shots arent as extreme with their height, but they are certainly still potent and can be annoying if youre not prepared for that level of erratic movement. Once you get used to it, though, shooting those players out of the air makes for a satisfying kill. SMGs and automatic assault rifles seem to be the unsurprising go-to weapons in Black Ops 4, as automatic weapons with a high rate of fire tend to be popular in Call of Duty. Many of the 14 maps feature tighter corridors that give those rapid-fire automatic weapons the edge, but Ive been able to make use of four of the five weapon classes rather easily. The fifth, sniper rifles, arent my forte, but Ive seen plenty of other skilled players use them for impressive kills. Its great that Black Ops 4s full arsenal is viable instead of just one or two weapon classes that everyone has to adhere to. The good news is no one weapon in my 100+ games seemed overpowered, and some of the best weapons are available right when you jump in. Stock classes include some weapons that are only unlocked at high levels, like the four-round burst Swordfish thats unlocked at level 55. Every now and then Id forgo using one of my custom classes and swap to that preset Swordfish class when I played maps like Firing Range. This meant I didnt gain any weapon levels and I had no control over the classs perks or equipment, but all that mattered to me was that I had the option to use the excellent Swordfish rifle to do better in the match, even if it meant sacrificing some weapon progression. Active healing is, by far, the most universal strategic element in Black Ops 4, and it's a welcome one. The massive change to the series standard automatic health regeneration system really makes Black Ops 4 multiplayer interesting. Unlike in previous games, players have to actively choose to heal themselves and press a button to do so. The healing syringe takes a short time to charge, and theres an equipment called the Stim Shot that makes that charge time even shorter. Having this option has noticeably changed one-on-one encounters, requiring each player to figure out just what the other is doing beyond their movements. Are they healing? Should you heal? Should you jump in? The addition of active healing is, by far, the most universal strategic element in Black Ops 4, and its a welcome one. Helpful Side Effects When I hopped into multiplayer with a friend, our first instinct wasnt to pick Specialists that work well together  we instead chose Specialists that we enjoyed playing. Unlike hero shooters where team composition is incredibly important because of the character kit design, Black Ops 4s Specialists are more like an extension of your loadout, not the definition of it. This flexible design is great and provides lone wolves like me the freedom to choose the Specialist that gives the biggest advantage on the map or mode. Thats not to say that Specialists cant be used by players who want to compose a team strategy. Some Specialists kits work together beautifully. I love that these multiplayer characters were designed with all kinds of players in mind. Black Ops 4's Specialists are more like an extension of your loadout, not the definition of it. Theres value to each of the Specialists special equipment, but playing certain Specialists almost guarantee a tactical advantage for your team. Vision is an important factor in any sort of tactical multiplayer game, and that feels even more true with Black Ops 4s added Fog of War that greatly limits minimap vision. Gaining a vision advantage is huge on any mode or map, which makes Specialist Recon incredibly valuable. His sensor dart grants a small circle of vision. Its a great piece of equipment, but its easily destroyed and doesnt last too long, two qualities that work in tandem to keep it balanced. As far as synergy goes, pairing Recons equipment with Torque's razor wire or barricade make for an effective defense of an area. Specialist equipment like Torques is generally more useful in objective-based modes like Domination and Hardpoint. The key to Specialists is knowing which situations to use them in, just like with your loadout. For instance, Nomads K9-Unit (its a little strange that a unit is only one dog, but its cute and its name is Juno) isn't all that useful in long, open maps where enemies can take it out before it reaches them, but it simply destroys enemies in enclosed areas. Then theres Specialists like Ajax, whose 9-Bang concussion grenade is available too frequently for how incredibly potent it is at disorienting enemies, who can be effective in just about any situation. Excluding Ajaxs 9-Bang, Ive found that the Specialists generally feel well balanced. I appreciate that each Specialist also demands varying levels of commitment from the player. For instance, if you dont care about learning how to best utilize the Specialist equipment, you can play someone like Crash who is honestly the best for checking out and focusing on shooting. His equipment is a simple assault pack that gives ammo and awards bonus points for kills, and his TAK-5 boost all living teammates health to 200. Using his equipment is hard to mess up, which is great for people who want to contribute to their team and earn points but arent confident with some of the more skill-based Specialists. Sure, there are times when the TAK-5 could be used to get a greater advantage, but ultimately youre not doing any major disservice to your team unless you use it when teammates are dead. For the most part, theres only a minimal cost to misusing Specialist equipment and weapons. There are ways to use enemy equipment to your advantage, too. The Engineer Perk allows players to see enemy equipment and Scorestreaks, even through walls. If the opposing team has a Seraph, seeing her Tac-Deploy equipment allows you to predict where some number of enemies will be spawning next. Often, instead of destroying an enemy Tac-Deploy, I hung around and picked off the players that used it. To be fair, there is a warning on the Tac-Deploy that says when there are enemies in the area, so they do have a fighting chance when they choose to use the Tac-Deploy. Seeing enemy fortifications can also help inform which points to target in Domination and Control. Uneven Playgrounds While the new battle royale mode, Blackout, probably stands as the most exciting multiplayer addition to Black Ops 4, the traditional multiplayer side does have a fun new mode itself. Heist  a mode similar to Battlefield Hardlines Heist or what youd see in Payday  serves as a palate cleanser between classic modes. In Heist, teams need to grab a bag of money thats usually set in a tempting, open area and get it to an extraction site. A team wins the round by successfully delivering the cash or eliminating the enemy team. At the end of each round, every player uses their hard-earned cash to buy weapons, perks, attachments, armor, and more. Heist seems to have a similar issue to Search and Destroy, where players go for kills over grabbing the cash, but its an enjoyable mode nonetheless that let me experiment with loadouts Id otherwise never use. I usually dont equip pistols, but since you start with one in Heist, I learned to appreciate them a little more. Heist also has all high-level weapons available for purchase, which is a nice touch that let me experiment with guns I had yet to unlock in an exciting environment. I was mostly disappointed with Control, the other multiplayer mode introduced in Black Ops 4. In Control, one team defends two points and the other team is tasked with capturing them in a rather short amount of time. So long as no attackers are on a point, the clock ticks down. The capture mode can offer intense matches on mid-sized maps like Jungle and Seaside, but Control also brought me the closest Ive ever been to rage quitting. While smaller maps like Slums seem like the best fit for Control, its rather easy to get pinned down in your spawn area if youre up against a hyper-aggressive bunch. Since teams are assigned to one side of the map as either the attacker or defender, the opposing team is able to position themselves in areas to effectively spawn camp. Their advantage over a spawn and the match snowballs from there. Even when I managed to break out of the spawn area, I was bitter that so many lives were wasted in the process. This happened even on a big map, like Militia. The spawn camping issue doesnt only take place in Control, though. While I generally like the new maps, many of the main spawn points are surrounded by open terrain with higher ground not too far off in the distance, making it easy for the opposing team to pick off newly spawned enemies over and over again. I experienced this on Morocco, Icebreaker, and others. While this mainly happened in modes featured in the Capture Moshpit, the fact that my teams were pinned like this multiple times in Black Ops 4s first week is very discouraging. Black Ops 4 sees the return of old Black Ops maps, like the great Firing Range map along with Summit. I wish Treyarch swapped Slums with another classic, though  its encounter points are too predictable, much like the disappointing Icebreaker and the mildly better but still lacking Morocco. A common issue Ive found with Black Ops 4s new, narrow, three-lane maps is that many of them feel stale after playing them a few times. Firefights happen in the same few places, and the spawn points are limited on each side of the maps, which further encourages select favored combat areas. Even though Firing Range is on the small side, its lack of a standard three-lane design makes it far more fun to hunt down enemies. And even though people flock to specific points, as engagements still take place just about anywhere as the match goes on, rather than just one central location. Black Ops 4's polished mechanics deserve a great playground. Black Ops 4s map selection does have some good new offerings. Militia is a standout with its slightly less obvious lanes and a more open design that gives the advantage to LMGs, Snipers, and Tactical Rifles. Then there are maps like Gridlock and Payload that offer a fun challenge for modes like Domination where their open courtyards and big rooms that have multiple entrances make for great battlegrounds. Contraband is rather neat too with its underwater paths that allow players to cross its lanes. Im glad that there are a few new maps that are genuinely fun to play, because Black Ops 4s polished mechanics deserve a great playground. Its just a shame that there are a few maps in the mix that I cant permanently opt out of. Aspiring to Something Greater Win or lose, the multiplayer progression system always gave me a pat on the back to encourage me to keep playing. New weapons, attachment unlocks, camos, and other rewards are frequent, and the impressive number of challenges ensure that Im always working toward some sort of XP bonus and neat calling card. Operator Mods are a great incentive to keep playing and to master weapons, too. These new attachments unlock after youve reached certain weapons max level and make them more powerful in some unique way. To keep things balanced, Operator Mods require three of your 10 item slots in your custom class. I unlocked the Titans Operator Mod, the Oppressor, which slightly increased the LMGs damage and can suppress enemies near your bullet stream. Realistically, this means that it provides some very mild distortion to enemies youre firing at, and its been useful enough. Other Operator Mods are a little more obvious with their buffs, like how the VAPR-XKGs Operator Mod adds a bayonet or the Auger DMRs turns it from a single fire rifle into a 2-round burst. The seemingly endless customization options have kept me excited to try new things Beyond Operator Mods, there's good potential for customization and experimenting with new loadouts in the late levels beyond unlocking some great new weapons. Classic tactical gear  like the frag grenade  is available after level 40, and I could see myself swapping out Firebreaks special equipment  the difficult to use reactor core  for a Molotov or concussion grenade. The seemingly endless customization options have kept me excited to try new things as I work toward prestiging. Bugs and Features Black Ops 4 includes a few more features, both good and bad, worth mentioning. Splitscreen co-op is in Black Ops 4 multiplayer, but it comes at the sacrifice of frame rate and resolution. While I'm grateful it's still a feature when it has been slowly phased out of other games, making that heavy graphics sacrifice is something for Treyarch to remedy in the next Call of Duty. Theater mode is back, too, and remains a great tool to bookmark your best games and clip out awesome kills  or to learn from other players who accomplished cool things. It can be a little buggy, though: It crashed my game once, and sometimes the controls to swap between player perspectives stopped working when I brought up the scoreboard. This wasnt the only bug I experienced in Black Ops 4 multiplayer. At one point, another players EKIA popped up in place of mine in an overlay, and my red dot sight randomly disappeared while I was in a match. Ive also seen player tags disappear and strange graphical bugs appear on fallen players. Overall, the bugs are infrequent and, aside from the red dot issue, mostly inconsequential. Another new feature related to multiplayer but not directly in the multiplayer suite is the Specialist HQ. These solo character missions effectively act as a tutorial for Black Ops 4s multiplayer and an introduction to the Specialists as characters. Its a helpful tool for learning how to use Specialists like Firebreak who have more situational equipment and provides a good (and graphic) story for the multiplayer characters. The mission narrator, an original Black Ops character called Frank Woods, is actually rather poetic too in these tutorial missions in spite of his vulgarity. Specialist missions arent a replacement for those wanting a complete campaign, but Im glad theyre a feature in Black Ops 4. Black Ops 4s multiplayer lets players be more tactical without sacrificing the excitement of engagements. The reworked health system and Specialists offer great, mostly balanced tools that allow for more creative playstyles and cater to strategic teams and lone wolves alike. Just about every weapon class in Black Ops 4's arsenal feels like a viable option, too, though automatic weapons are expectedly as popular as they have been in the past.<br><br> As good as these changes are, Black Ops 4 is held back by a few of its more narrow maps that feel stale after just a few run-throughs. Even worse are the unfortunate design choices around spawn areas that allow aggressive enemies to pick off players just as they're coming up. When these flaws dont all align at once, though, Black Ops 4 keeps me coming back to work toward unlocking the cool Operator Mods for my favorite weapons and experimenting with loadouts in the fun new Heist mode.", "date": "Oct. 20, 2018,"}
