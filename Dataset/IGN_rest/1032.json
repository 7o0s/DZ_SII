Like Super Meat Boy before it, Rage is all about micro-platforming challenges that test your skills, patience, and sanity. But while it delivers hours of hair-pulling moments, it never quite conjures that same feeling of satisfaction that kept me glued to its inspirations. What Fenix Rage asks of you is relatively simple: use a combination of infinite double-jumps and a quick-dash technique to reach the exit of bite-sized stages. If done correctly, most can be completed in roughly 10 seconds. But of course, correctly usually isnt in the cards. If you touch an enemy, projectile, or specifically marked object, you die - and trust me, youre going to die a lot. The levels quickly become cluttered with anything and everything that wants you dead. Thankfully, like Super Meat Boy, you respawn instantly after death in Fenix Rage, alleviating a bit of the stress from retrying a level dozens of times. While Fenix Rage gets progressively more complicated with the addition puzzle elements like portals to pop through and ice that needs to be melted, none of the levels ever really stuck with me. Even after spending upwards of a hundred lives trying to complete some of them, I couldnt describe the layout of any of them from memory. Challenges in Fenix Rage feel disposable, as opposed to iconic. The core problem with Fenix Rage is that I feel like my success more frequently came from luck than they did from skill. After 10 hours, I never felt like I actually got the precise timing down enough to dash through a narrow pass, or escape a pursuing enemy like I can in Meat Boy or Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. I always felt a little bit out of control, which made both successes and failures unfold without weight. Finishing a level after dozens of deaths didnt evoke pride, but a sort of annoyed relief. Whenever I die in Dark Souls or Meat Boy, I blame myself. A lot of times after I died in Fenix Rage, I blamed elements of the game. I never found that enigmatic moment of zen that comes in particular games like Super Meat Boy, Super Hexagon, and Flappy Bird. Thats because I never felt like I was 100% in control throughout Fenix Rage. The fact that it has a wider array of mechanics than Meat Boy creates a slew of additional variables. For example, take some of the later boss levels, which bombards you with angry monsters and a bullet-hell-level of projectiles, all within tight confines. Contrast that with the elegant simplicity of Super Meat Boy, and Fenix Rage just doesnt compare. Couple this with chaotic and random elements, such as ghost enemies that continually chase you through walls, but seem to arbitrarily give up pursuit at various moments, and what you have is a platformer with a bit too much chaos.  Aesthetically, Fenix Rage appeals in the same colorful way old Flash games would. The distinct color palette clearly identifies what is dangerous (everything) and what isnt (nothing). Sadly, its soundtrack it something else entirely. Its grating, looped chiptune-fueled butt-rock made me actually turn off the music for extended periods of time. Honestly, I dont think thats ever happened before. On the other hand, Fenix Rage is loaded with levels, modifiers, arcade challenges that brutally test you on specific gameplay elements like air-dashing, and unlockable real-life cookie recipes. The latter seems silly, but it added a dose of much-appreciated charm. Pros Instant respawnTons of content Cons Lack of satisfactionForgettable levelsAwful soundtrack Fenix Rage managed to appeal to my inner masochist. No doubt, it threw down some of the toughest gaming challenges Ive faced in 2014. Sadly, it didnt deliver that constant drip of challenging satisfaction that games like Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy managed to conjure on a minute-to-minute basis. Ultimately, I never felt like I got good at Fenix Rage, only occasionally lucky.", "date": "Sept. 24, 2014"}
