Heroes and three different Castle Conqueror games in the past three months they're at it again with 3 Heroes -- Crystal Soul. Like most of those other games, this one puts you in command of some more medieval warriors. But instead of being another tower defender or RTS, this one's more of a puzzler. 3 Heroes -- Crystal Soul drops you into the middle of a hexagonal grid, surrounded on all sides by hordes of colorful monsters. The visuals make it look like a kind of strategy design, and there's certainly some strategy to it. But it feels like more of a puzzle game to me thanks to its color-matching mechanic -- because when you defeat one monster on the grid, every adjacent creature of the same color is also destroyed. Unfortunately, though, even your best moves that eliminate five, ten or twenty foes in one shot ultimately don't feel like they amount to much -- because the game also includes a countdown clock that respawns enemies onto any emptied space after every few moves you make. The win condition in each stage, then, amounts to mindless farming to hit arbitrary totals instead of clearing out the entire grid. (Which would have felt more satisfying.) ~Destroy 50 green monsters, 20 red monsters and 30 purple monsters.~ Wow. Heroic stuff. The three heroes named in the game's title add some variety to the tedium, as you can choose to go into battle as a swordsman, a mage or a ranger -- each of them with their own unique abilities. The game ends up feeling like a chore no matter who you choose, though, so it's mostly a cosmetic option. CLOSING COMMENTS I've enjoyed some of the earlier DSiWares developed by this same studio, but this pseudo-puzzler isn't as exciting. Give it a pass and wait another week or two -- this same company will probably be back again with yet another different design.
