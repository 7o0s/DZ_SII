Nor, despite what its cute graphics may suggest, does The Escapists. Its hardly a realistic simulation of life behind bars  with the prisoners quoting everything from famous movies to Breaking Bad  but its a fiendish little mix of sandbox and puzzle game whose six prisons take no prisoners. Metaphorically speaking, anyway Its a game that looks like Prison Architects black-sheep brother, but plays about as a regimented sandbox to first be controlled by, and then to subvert. Morning roll-call is time for everyone to gather and be told the business of the day, including whose cells are about to be inspected for contraband. Soon I realized its also a great time to sneak into other prisoners cells and carefully pocket anything good from their stash. Social times like dinner, meanwhile, offer a chance to chat with other prisoners, recruit assistance, and collect mini-quests like retrieving someones stolen DVD or causing a scene during the next roll-call. How much you appreciate the result will primarily depend on two factors: whether you like being left alone to figure out what to do, because the basic tutorial covers very little of what you need to know to actually escape one of the real prisons, and how annoying this repetition is going to be over time. It takes a long series of days to gather and assemble the bits that you need for an escape, and its easy to lose all the important ones with just the slightest mistake. You can only save at the start of each in-game day, and while theres no death, being taken out by a random prisoner deciding they dont like your face, or a guard screwing up your plan at the last second, can make for an excruciating time-out and loss of hard-earned progress. Each of the nine prisons offers a different-feeling challenge though, not to mention new settings, from minimum security with a cell conveniently located right by a service corridor, to a high-security facility for those who have officially transcended mere scamphood. The first has cable TV in all the rooms, the last has security cameras. Between them are a Stalag, Shankton State Pen, a jungle jail, and San Pancho, south of the border in a cloud of heat and anger. There are also currently three additional ,ustom prisons, including Camp Epsilon, where all cells have mesh walls for an extra-special lack of privacy and most prison life is out in the open. Mechanically of course, the goals are the same: find a weakness, and exploit it. Much of this revolves around crafting, which in a continuation of a frankly irritating current trend just assumes that youll go to a wiki to find out that, say, papier mache is made by combining toilet paper and superglue. Its hard to plan when you dont know what a game has actually planned for, especially when the character needs to hit an intelligence threshold to make so much as a glob of sticky paper. Providing the standard useful recipes up front would have been handy. Its this combination of relatively simple systems that makes The Escapists work so well, with a slow build up to the actual escape attempt. Where it falls down is that in addition to its routines and focus quickly becoming repetitive, it doesnt have much in the way of character. No, thats too strong  it has plenty on the surface, with its adorable 16-bit style graphics, cheery prison brawls, random pop-culture quoting, and the ability to name all the characters after friends, family, co-workers, teachers, or whatever. A few minutes in though, youre left in a world where everything is a pure puzzle game piece rather than a person, with no real sense of danger, and no characters to feel anything for beyond guy who will give me $28 for punching that guy. Theres none of the tension of even, say, Prison Break (the pretty good first series, not the terrible, terrible others) even in the most brutal, locked down jail you encounter, and after a while thats missed. The Escapists does a great job of turning prison escape into a puzzle, but rarely does its emergent story become more than Well, that went to crap. It doesnt matter while the momentum carries it, but as said, theres a lot of downtime. Pros Complex sandboxFiendish challengeEndearingly cute Cons Routine grows dullFrustratingly vague As a mix of sandbox, puzzle and open-world action, The Escapists offers something fresh and entertaining. The nature of what its simulating leads to some annoyances and careful handwaves to keep things light, but with both enough space between those moments to feel like I was actually producing my own plan and enough tools that I didnt just feel like I was looking for a conveniently pre-packaged solution. Its a clever game thats not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you dont mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break.", "date": "Feb. 15, 2015,"}
