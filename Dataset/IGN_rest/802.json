Heres what we said then: Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. Its technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but its also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games ever made. Thats still where we stand on it today. And whether you agree that its a masterpiece or not, the PC version is definitely the best way to play GTA 5. Developer Rockstar has taken full advantage of the technical power of the platform, and made GTA feel right at home here. Its well optimized, and the frame rate and resolution will go as high as your hardware can handle  including 4K/UHD resolutions and multi-display setups. Maxed out, the enormous and incredibly detailed open-world region of San Andreas looks more amazing than ever, thanks to long draw distances and enhanced effects. This is the only place you can play GTA 5 at 60 frames per second (or higher), and with all the high-speed driving and shooting, it definitely benefits from that smoothness. Graphics options are plentiful and powerful, with everything from standard quality and view-distance adjustments to a field-of-view slider (though its more limited than discriminating FOV players might want - modders have already remedied that). Controls are customizable, and you can play your own music library on the in-game radio. Its hard to complain much about that. For the most part, the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. Thats best exemplified with the web browser, which feels like youd expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus; its a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation gun stores wares with the mouse than it is with a D-pad or arrow keys, but its still totally workable. Its simply a small reminder that this wasnt originally a PC game. Using a mouse to shoot, on the other hand, is good enough that it risks making combat feel a little too easy. I dont pretend to be a brilliant marksman, but if youre a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos, your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when Im using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto-aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass, I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head, especially when playing in first-person mode. That doesnt mean I felt invincible, though; because the authorities will never stop coming until you give up and run away or die, theyre always going to give you a challenging fight through the weight of sheer numbers. Nice PC-specific control touches, like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You dont get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first-person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions, either. One of my favorite things about the control setup, though, is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it, GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap - just push a button on one or the other, and all on-screen prompts change to reflect what youre using. Its a fantastic thing for a game like this, where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick. You can even use both at once, if you like. Then theres GTA Online, which has been very well behaved this week (Im as surprised as you!). Though Ive experienced the occasional disconnect or bout of lag, its nothing out of the ordinary for an online game that matches up groups of up to 30 players. What is out of the ordinary is how diverse and varied the available activities are: dozens of different types of deathmatches, co-op missions (including the all-new and very impressive multi-stage heists), races over land, sea, and air (some of which involving combat), and general open-world chaos like spontaneous drive-by shootings (or strafing runs) of other players. The online version of San Andreas is a place where anything can happen at any time, and its fantastic to watch people make use of that freedom, even if the majority of it is the inherent humor of crashing things into other things. The main PC-specific feature is the Rockstar Editor movie tool and its associated Director Mode, which gives you access to a wide spectrum of playable character models. Its a powerful creative tool that lets you easily capture gameplay clips and then edit and export them into what can end up as extremely elaborate movies. I did experience a crash that robbed me of about an hours work on a classy short film about a man in an alien costume who punches people on a beach without provocation. I love the flexibility of the camera and the simplicity of the editing controls  they make me wish I had a finer eye for filmmaking as I go for easy laughs with a montage of slow-motion close ups of fists hitting faces. Fortunately, there are far more creatively talented folks out there who will entertain us for years to come with GTA 5-made machinima. Pros Amazing open worldGood controlsHuge varietyGreat in SP and MPMovie editor Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game, and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open-world games aspire, and its incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both in single-player and multiplayer, plus great creative tools, its truly amazing on multiple levels.", "date": "April 15, 2015"}
