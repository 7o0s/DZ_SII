It also comes with a choice of black, blue, brown or red Cherry MX switches. It employs the highest-specification N-Key rollover (NKRO) technology over USB and has 13 dedicated easy-to-reach macro keys for fast and hassle-free command customizatin. Gamers even have the option to re-assign the F1-F8 as macro keys for a total of 21 one-touch command as well as use the on-the-fly macro recording key to create commands without interrupting gameplay. Sounds like a gamers paradise, but is it worth the GBP118 (AED660) price tag? Design The one thing that makes the Strix Tactic Pro stand out from other keyboards, before its even plugged in, is the keyboards shape. Its a bit wider partly because of the two columns of macro keys on the left side. The pointed corners with slightly rounded edges and an edge at the bottom almost make the keyboard look like an unfinished batarang of sorts. The matte-black finish over the keys doesnt leave much room for fingerprints, which is a good thing, unlike keyboards with a glossy finish where fingerprints are extremely visible even with minor use. The keyboard comes with four orange keys that you can use to replace your favourite key combo on the keyboard itself thanks to the handy key removal tool that comes in the box. The 13-dedicated and easy-to-reach macro keys allow for hassle-free and quick command customization. If you run out of macro keys to program, dont worry, the F1 to F8 keys can double up as macro keys so you have 21 one-touch command keys at your disposal, which should be enough for most gamers. The Strix also comes with an on-the-fly macro-recording key so you can record your macros without stopping your game play. The top right side of the keyboard is home to the media keys: play/pause, mute, forward, backward keys and a scroll wheel for volume control. The keyboards braided USB plug has a unique design of its own, which is handy if you ever need to identify it at the back of your PC amongst all the other cables. Once plugged in, the keyboard will glow orange - the colour cannot be changed, but you can play with the brightness a bit. One thing to note, the indicators for profiles as well as things like Caps Lock and such, can be a little hard to see if youre not sitting up straight or leaning a bit forward, otherwise the F-keys may hide the LEDs and you wont be able to tell whats enabled and what isnt. Performance Weve had about two weeks to test the keyboard in game mode as well as out of it. Cherry MX red switches are the fastest switches, so if you type really fast, this is the combo that can keep up with your fingers. However, since theyre very responsive, it can also lead to an increase in typos if you accidentally hit the wrong key even just slightly - theyre THAT sensitive. If you want something less sensitive, the brown switches should do the trick just fine. Either way, if your day job includes a lot of typing, the Strix Tactic Pro can do the job rather well. The keys dont sound as loud as the BlackWidow Chroma Ultimate, but its not all about the noise levels. The response level is on par with Razers keyboard, if not better, but it also depends on the Cherry MX switches you get. Our review piece had the red ones, but they also come in blue, brown and black. The Cherry MX switches have a lifecycle of 50-million keystrokes, and are tactile and quite responsive to the touch. The Strix definitely holds its own in the mechanical keyboard ring. The multimedia controls are quite useful, however the volume wheel can feel like youre letting your fingers run atop of a barrel whilst youre fiddling with the volume. A simple volume up/down button wouldve sufficed here. The Strix Tactic Pro also offers N-Key rollover, so no matter how many keys are pressed at the same time, the keyboard will recognise them all. The Strix Tactic Pro does offer an abundance of macro keys, capable of satisfying the most finicky gamers. The keys are all located strategically within easy reach once youre used to the keyboard. Whether youre a World of Warcraft fan, a DotA player, Guild Wars or League of Legends, you should find the macro keys more than enough for your needs. However, the location of M11-M13 keys seems a little off, just underneath the space bar which isnt quite convenient at times. In addition, if you have an arm rest that you prefer to use for more comfort, the three keys are essentially rendered unusable. Toggling the double row of M1-M10 keys on the far left side can also take some getting used to as well, but thats with practically any new keyboard anyway. Theres two modes you can use the keyboard in. The hardware mode allows the use of internal flash memory so you can store profiles and macros on the keyboard itself. This is very handy if youre on the move, so you dont have to install the Strix software on the computer you connect your keyboard to. The other mode is the Software mode, which requires the software, but it also allows you to configure an unlimited number of profiles and more on the computer that you have the keyboard connected to. The software end of the Strix Tactic Pro doesnt allow for lightning controls or much else. There are two main sections - the Keyboard and the Macro. The Keyboard section allows you to program keys, or a mouse function, a Windows shortcut, a macro or a multimedia command. The Macro mode allows you to define and fine tune the macros you can assign to individual keys.
