With an art style that's somewhere between Tim Burton and South Park, it's at once eerie and sweet, and one look at its protagonist is enough to set the tone. Baby is a cute little girl, all dark curls and big eyes  and upside-down face, voice like scratchy violin strings, and leering grin full of crooked teeth. But even if her mouth isn't in the right place, her heart is; all she wants is to find her missing mommy, and she's willing to cross miles of faintly unsettling hellscape to find her. Her search is achingly adorable, beautifully animated, and filled with memorably clever puzzles  but just like being around actual little kids, it can be more annoying than fun. That's partly because you don't control Baby directly; you lead her, taking her by the hand (by holding a finger on the touch screen) and pulling her forward. It's a cool idea, except that continually holding a finger on the screen gets tedious, and if you pull her along too far or too fast, she'll trip and fall. She's also not the only thing you have to worry about. Her heart-shaped balloon is what's really in peril; lose it or let it pop, and you'll be booted back to the last checkpoint. To keep it safe, you'll need to use another finger to maneuver it out of the way of thorns, swat down safety-pin-shaped bugs (by tapping them), and move objects like umbrellas to deflect falling dangers. Nearly all interaction happens through the Vita's touch surfaces (there doesn't even seem to be a way to pause, short of hitting the Home button), so just performing basic moves while holding the device can take some deft finger gymnastics. And that's if the balloon doesn't inexplicably slip out of your grasp at a crucial moment, or Baby doesn't suddenly start ignoring your input. At least the checkpoints are forgiving. Using the rear touchpad is more consistently enjoyable. As Baby makes her way through four themed level sets (which take around two or three hours to toddle through), she'll find other balloons that, when popped, give you the ability to change the level's background and theme by swiping across the back of the Vita. Each background has a cool special ability, activated with a tap; early on, you'll find one that bursts open several jack-in-the-boxes, scaring your enemies (and Baby, who then has to be quickly reunited with her balloon). Later, you'll be able to shrink Baby, temporarily turn her balloon to stone, summon a massive creature to cause path-clearing earthquakes, or flip the level upside-down, among other abilities.  Despite their seeming simplicity, these powers are fun to experiment with, and more versatile than they at first appear. It won't be long before you'll find yourself using multiple abilities in quick succession, flipping the screen to get Baby onto a platform that can only be moved with lightning, then flipping your Vita again to tug her quickly across a rapidly dissolving walkway. The puzzles are never particularly difficult or obtuse, but some of them can be pretty demanding, requiring quick thinking and snap decisions to pull Baby through alive. The backgrounds can also adversely affect Baby's mood, however; one reveals hidden platforms and walkways, for example, but its ominously stark black-and-white palette makes Baby afraid to move, meaning you'll have to put extra effort into nudging her forward. Even seemingly benign backgrounds can make Baby noticeably uneasy, so sometimes, the most useful backgrounds are the ones that don't do anything except put her at ease and make her more cooperative. In spite of the hazards, disturbing visuals, and generally creepy tone, Murasaki Baby isn't nearly as dark as it looks. Baby's rarely at risk of direct harm, and she'll usually stop and cower at danger until you clear it away, rather than charging haplessly into it. And while most of the obstacles in front of her are the work of other, similarly misshapen children  whose stories and behavior make them just as weirdly relatable as Baby  ~defeating~ them is really a matter of solving their problems and turning them into friends. This might involve a puzzle-centric boss fight, a few electric shocks, or a deep freeze, but everyone's alive and happy in the end, giving Murasaki Baby a much sunnier outlook than similar-but-deadlier fare like Limbo. Pros Clever puzzlesBeautiful animationUnique ideas Cons Temperamental controlsOver quickly Filled with interesting ideas, Murasaki Baby's dazzling animation and unique approach to platforming are enticing. Moving Baby around with the spotty touch controls can be frustrating, but this short confection is sweet enough while it lasts.", "date": "Sept. 17, 2014"}
