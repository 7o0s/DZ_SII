Its a fun way to spend an evening, although I noted its an experience largely built by repurposing wholesale slabs of Forza Horizon 2 content rather than doing much new or interesting with the movie license. Unlike last years Storm Island expansion, FH2 Presents Fast & Furious takes place on part of FH2s main map but is an entirely standalone game (although this means a confusingly hefty download, even if you already have FH2 installed on your Xbox One). Its basically a chunky, themed demo for FH2. It limits us to the French portion of the pre-existing map but it does cover quite a few event types in its brief two- to three-hour duration. There are tight street races around Nice, high-speed blasts through the countryside, a small clutch of stunt challenges, and a pair of the series trademark Top Gear-inspired Showcase Events (which, in this case, pit your car against a helicopter and a plane). As youd expect, the racing and driving here is just as blissfully brilliant as it is in FH2. Several driving aids can be toggled to hone the experience to your liking, and theres a huge amount of joy to be gleaned from tearing up France in the Fast & Furious series iconic black Charger, watching the butterfly valves on the blower work overtime as you poise nearly 4,000 pounds of Detroit metal in the perfect drift. The one notable new mechanic is a nitrous boost mechanic  an obvious inclusion for a Fast & Furious tie-in  and its been implemented well. When triggered, the screen shakes and theres a nice, powerful shift in the already excellent audio. The overall effect on your speed doesnt cross into Hollywood absurdity, its more subtle and realistic, but I think the latter is more fitting for Forza. Its only available during events, however; you cant activate nitrous in free-roam. Its an odd design choice and one thats slightly disappointing. But again, owners of Forza Horizon 2 will find little more than that by way of new content. The intro of FH2 Presents Fast & Furious, which drops you into a yellow Lamborghini Huracn, is largely a rehash of FH2s introduction. The two Showcase Events are actually just repeats of existing Showcase Events in FH2 (the chopper race in the Xbox 360 version and the cargo plane face-off from the Xbox One version). The cars, weather, and time of day are different here, but the routes are identical, which feels a bit cheap. With so much recycled, its somewhat strange that several regular Forza features have been plucked out. Theres no economy here; you simply earn the available cars by winning them over the course of a short series of 11 events (the action is narrated by Fast & Furious series actor Chris Ludacris Bridges, who provides the games credible but admittedly loose association with the films). There are also no visual customisation features either, nor is there any upgrading or tuning. Each car comes pre-tuned to the top of its class and you cant apply custom designs. Perhaps most disappointing, the new cars built for FH2 Presents Fast & Furious arent able to make the trip back across to FH2 (or, least, they arent for now) if you own both. Its a small shame because, once Id clocked the available events and reaped most of the Forza Rewards points on offer via the Forza Hub (where its listed as a separate game), Ive felt little reason to go back to this version. Pros Fantastic new carsGreat for new racersHeavenly handling remains intact Cons Recycled content from FH2Short, with fewer regular Forza features Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious is a lean tie-in that at least provides some great-looking new cars, a boost of nitrous, and a short but appropriately themed set of races. Its fun while it lasts, but its also proved to be disappointingly built around recycled maps and events. (It is, however, completely free until April 10, 2015, so by all means grab it while you can.) As an introduction to Forza Horizon 2s more substantial driving action its quite a good one, but for long-time Forza fans its only really worth the quickfire 500 points to your Forza Rewards Tier (which determines your monthly gift credits in Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One).", "date": "April 1, 2015,"}
