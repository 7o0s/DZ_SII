But while we certainly love to play all of these titles, we also appreciate the time and effort that goes into games from smaller studios, especially from developers in the region. Today we look at Curse of Mermos, a light-hearted hack and slash game from Team101, a small team of developers from the twofour54 Gaming Academy in the United Arab Emirates. The game puts you in the shoes of a young explorer name Abdu, who is scouring the ruins of Egypt to search for the lost tomb of Pharaoh Ebo. You eventually find the tomb, only to find the spirit of Ebo trapped within. Ebo asks for your help to break the curse that binds him and to rid his tomb of the many creatures that dwell within. Abdu is equipped with two weapons  the Hammer of Osiris which is good for close-combat melee action, and the Crossbow of Neith, which is good for taking out enemies from afar. Abu is also able to unlock charged attacks for both of these weapons by offering souls collected from fallen enemies. These souls can be used to buy health potion, or upgrade Abdus skills in one of four areas. Vitality will give you a larger health bar, Strength increases your melee attack damage, Dexterity increases your ranged attack, and Agility lets you move faster and avoid enemies. As the game progresses you also collect shards which appear in the level  these can be collected and spent at another shrine to create glyphs and further increase your abilities. The actual gameplay is very simple  wave after wave of various enemies spawn within the tomb, and clearing a number of waves in succession will unlock a new room in the tomb with a treasure that you have to retrieve for Ebo. Each wave increases the number of enemies you face, as well as their difficulty. So while you first start off battling annoying scarabs and skeletons, you soon have to avoid fireball-wielding mummies and large shield-bearing enemies that are the hardest to dispatch. While the gameplay may be simple to master, its by no means easy. Abdu can roll or strafe to avoid enemy attacks, but the sheer volume of enemies that spawn sometimes can be a bit overwhelming. While you can carry several health potions with you, there are some waves where even five potions doesnt seem to be enough. Zip your health bar to zero and youll forfeit all the souls youve collected from that wave and start again. Death wont be too often if youre always on the move  stay still for too long and its easy to get overwhelmed. But despite this rather straight-forward and simple gameplay mechanic, the game is still plenty of fun to play. The crucial lesson here is that while the game encourages you to collect as many souls as possible to upgrade Abdus abilities, in theory this isnt easy at all. The souls of fallen enemies only stay visible for a short while, so youre torn between trying to avoid enemy attacks or collecting as many souls as you can. On later levels even with Abdu at a fairly experienced level, I found it almost impossible to collect even half of the souls glimmering around the tomb, as I was too busy being pummeled with fireballs or other enemy attacks. Occasionally a golden scarab will appear which can yield a lot of souls, but these are a somewhat rare occurrence. Graphically, the game does surprisingly well. Ebos tomb is well detailed, and even the various enemies  though somewhat simple  offer a fair amount of detail. One particular enemy, the Aten, is a hovering red ball that glows brightly with decorated hieroglyphs, and even the detailing of Ebos tomb is impressive. Each additional area of the tomb that you unlock offers new enemies and more to explore, and all of it has been designed to look like an Egyptian tomb, lost to time itself. The background score is also great, with a mix of flutes, violins, and oud coming together in perfect harmony. My only two notes about the game is that theres no opportunity to save, so if you want to beat this game, youre going to have to do it in one sitting. The other thing to note is that you will need a gamepad to play this game properly  playing via the keyboard can be a bit buggy, not to mention incredibly frantic as you attempt to move around and attack enemies at the same time. Pros Addictive gameplayVaried enemiesGreat level design and sound Cons Needs a gamepad for proper playthrough Despite coming from a small team, Curse of Mermos is a fun and somewhat addictive game to play on your PC or Mac, and the best part is that its totally free. No in-game transactions, no ads  just plenty of button-mashing fun to be had. It certainly shows more promise than a mere student project, so do yourself a favor and download the game for free or check it out on Steam Greenlight. <br><br> <i>Editor's Note: IGN Middle East is part of tbreak media, which is owned and operated in part by twofour54.</i>", "date": "Feb. 3, 2015,"}
