All eight episodes are currently available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. After six months of enduring a pandemic, many of us have likely seen at least one conspiracy theory making the rounds on social media, suggesting that the virus has been engineered as part of a shadowy plan to control us. Amazons Utopia - the US remake of a stylish British thriller - asks the outlandish question: what if the conspiracies were true? The result is a satisfyingly twisty, well-paced labyrinth of mysteries that delivers on thrills, but cant quite live up to the high bar set by its source material. It should be made clear out of the gate that, despite its timing, Utopia is not a response to our current world situation, nor is it actually all that interested in exploring the effects of an epidemic. There are no masks or social distancing here, and the story largely follows in the footsteps established by the 2013 British original, back when nationwide quarantine seemed a sci-fi concept in itself. However, the current pandemic does add an uneasy layer of paranoia to the proceedings that Utopia doesnt provide itself. Penned entirely by Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, Utopia follows the gradually more desperate journey of a group of comic book nerds obsessed with Dystopia; a graphic novel that predicted a variety of deadly epidemics via messages hidden in its artwork. Within the first hour, the group discover that an unpublished sequel - Utopia - exists, and that it could hold the key to solving the mysteries behind a future epidemic conspiracy. But as the group travel further down this intriguing rabbit hole, they face violent opposition from those whod rather the secrets were kept in the dark. The best of these obstacles is Arby (Christopher Denham), a ruthless hitman offset by a childlike demeanor. His sloped shoulders and schoolboy haircut, combined with the occasional use of an inhaler and continual munching of chocolate raisins, contrast fantastically with his brutal efficiency. His methods seemingly have no bounds, resulting in the shows most alarming, impactful sequences. Hes the tool that keeps The Harvest - Utopias shadowy force - continually dangerous and unpredictable. The Harvest itself delightfully revels in all the best conspiracy tropes. Its methods slowly escalate over the season, from simple assassinations to the obsessive construction of false identities and online scapegoats. As more is revealed, the group becomes progressively more cult-like, which neatly encapsulates their genuine belief in their own monstrous actions. Flynns writing is at its best when scripting John Cusack and Rainn Wilsons characters, who admirably tackle their roles as major players within the pharmaceutical company attempting to battle the virus outbreak. Cusacks Dr. Kevin Christie has a remarkable calmness about him - hes a wise dad to staff and family alike - which makes his delivery particularly magnetic. Meanwhile, Wilsons virologist, Michael, is amusingly thrilled by the potential oncoming apocalypses link to his previous work. The puzzle box mystery format actually pays off audience dedication.Unfortunately, Utopias core cast of comic obsessives are less engaging. While part of the charm is that they are regular folk in over their heads, theyre all a little too regular. Bluntly, theyre forgettable (with the exception of Jessica Rothe, who brings to Sam the same delightful energy she displayed in the Happy Death Day movies.) This sadly also covers Jessica Hyde - the conspiracys lynchpin, played by Sasha Lane - who, despite her ragged appearance, simply doesnt feel odd or unpredictable enough. Id had high hopes for Lane, but despite a clear dislike for showers and a taste for grim violence, theres little about her thats unsettling. Shes just a bit flat, and thats a great disservice to a character thats not just fascinating conceptually, but also delightfully strange in her original British incarnation, played by Fiona O'Shaughnessy. Characterisation is not the only area where this US remake pales in comparison to the British original. 2013s Utopia, created by Dennis Kelly (who serves as executive producer on this remake), was shot using a CMYK color model, with prominent use of acidic yellows and eye-searing cyan skies. Its direction was mathematically precise, with static, perfectly framed scenes contrasting with both the chaos of the narrative and the brutality of its violence. It was scored by a soundtrack that layered wheezy breathing, strange beats, and unusual melodies. In short: its one of the most striking shows produced in the last decade, and stands as proof that style can become substance. Amazons Utopia has no style. Its shot like a regular TV show. A good TV show, yes, but it looks and feels like anything youd expect from a decent network or streaming service. Utopia should feel different. I can only imagine what kind of a show this would be if headed up by, say, Legions Noah Hawley, or even David Fincher, who was set to create it alongside Flynn when this was a HBO project several years back. Im not asking for a replica of that original style, but this is a show that absolutely needs its own stamp. But what if youve never seen the original? Well, youre still getting one of the most enjoyable TV conspiracy thrillers since The X-Files ruled the airwaves. In essence, its the same fantastic lyrics, just set to less interesting music. The puzzle box mystery format actually pays off audience dedication; youre kept in the dark until the very end, but major plot reveals are dropped at just the right moments, creating an energetic pace. And that mystery is delightfully dark; a twisted look at how people in power can twist the world around their little finger that is unashamedly fictitious rather than reflective of the real world. Sadly, its also a show so fascinated with its own puzzle and mythology that its characters barely get a look in. The people you meet in the pilot are left essentially unchanged by their experiences; still boring, still sometimes inexplicably able to find meaning in the art of a graphic novel, just now injured or wearing worse clothes. Again, its a shame Utopia stumbles here, because the perfect blueprint for these characters - a different version of the same series - has been sat there since 2013. Amazons Utopia is an enjoyably twisty, dark conspiracy thriller. It avoids many of the pitfalls of puzzle box mysteries, pulling the curtain back on enough major components while still keeping audiences enjoyably in the dark until the final moments. But it suffers from weak characterisation, and lacks the stylish presentation of its British predecessor. Should the original show be unavailable to you, though, Utopia stands alone as a fun slice of doomsday.", "date": "Sept. 27, 2020"}
