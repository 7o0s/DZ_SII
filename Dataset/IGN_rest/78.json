And why not? They take up a ton of space on your desktop, but the immersion youll feel while playing a supported first-person shooter on a big, curved screen is a wholly unique experience. Asus's 34-inch flagship model, the PG348Q (See it on Amazon) / (See it on Amazon UK) features G-Sync support, a refresh rate up to 100Hz, and 3440 x 1440 resolution. So theres a lot to love about the PG348Q. Let's get into it: Design and Features Much like the similarly sized Acer Predator Z35P, the Asus PG348Q is a huge monitor that eats up a ton of desk real estate. At 34 inches diagonally, the 21:9 display has a striking presence that may leave your friends and family wondering if youve started playing PC games on an HDTV as opposed to a normal monitor. But its that same size and a subtle curve to the screen that will draw you into games. The result is an experience that will fill your peripheral vision, and its actually difficult to explain just how much of a difference that makes until you try it for yourself. Asus has given the PG348Q an aesthetic that lies somewhere between spaceship and industrial chic. The large, grey plastic back panel is covered in markings that are reminiscent of a sci-fi ship's hull, while the sturdy base features copper-colored accents which look like the inside of a turbine or industrial drill. A feature called Light in Motion, when turned on via the on-screen display, projects a red ROG logo from the monitor's neck onto the desktop. It would have been nice if that color was customizable, but it still looks pretty neat. The bottom portion of the screen has a classy, textured silver finish. The PG348Q is anything but subtle and it looks awesome. The PG348Q offers a decent range of adjustments including height, tilt, and swivel. Behind the bottom edge of the screen are the I/O ports, and theyre aggravatingly hard to reach. Plugging anything in requires fumbling around blindly, since the screen tilt isnt quite extreme enough to let you actually see what youre doing. Regardless, once you figure out where things are youll find one DisplayPort, one HDMI port, four USB 3.0 downstream ports, one USB 3.0 upstream port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Youll need to utilize DisplayPort to take full advantage of both G-Sync and the PG348Q's max refresh rate of 100Hz. Conversely, HDMI caps out at only 50Hz, so it should only be used in an emergency, such as hooking up a gaming console. Asus has packed the PG348Q with a curved In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel with an anti-glare surface. Its important to note the 3800R curvature on this monitor is deceptively subtle. Its there for sure, but compared to the deep curves found on similar monitorsthe Acer Z35P has an 1800R curvature, for exampleits almost difficult to even tell its curved at all. This means the peripheral vision I mentioned earlier isnt quite on par with monitors sporting a more pronounced curve, but at 34 inches on a computer desk, it will still fill your field of view. Thankfully, as Ill talk about later in my testing, the inclusion of an IPS panel, as opposed to Vertical Alignment (VA), means viewing angles are also great on the PG348Q, so the 3800R curve really seems to work. Accessing the on-screen display on the PG348Q is accomplished with a series of buttons and a joystick on the back right side of the panel. Most OSD menu buttons are just short of an absolute nightmare, but accessing the menus on the PG348Q is wonderfully simple and easy. Beyond the power button, the other four buttons work as hot-keys for menu items including the turbo function that allows for quick switching between 60Hz and 100Hz. Again, I pretty much just left it on 100Hz, but you can downclock if it you want to or need to. Theres also access to Asus on-screen features like various crosshair overlays, an FPS counter, and an on-screen timer; though I have no idea why anyone would need such a thing. Like most IPS panel monitors, there is a decent range of color settings, as well as a number of game-specific presets and an sRGB mode. Personally, the Racing setting seemed to perform the best with some very minor tweaks to contrast. From within the OSD, theres also access to volume settings for what has to be the weakest feature on the PG348Q: its two comically bad 2w speakers. Seriously, these are not even worth turning onits like listening to audio from an intercom taped to a giant TV. Why? Testing As usual, I used the LCD testing pages to put the Asus PG348Q through its paces. These handy webpages allowed me to test elements like response time, contrast, gamma, color banding, and response time. In regards to gamma and contrast settings, the factory calibrated settings on the PG348Q were just a teeny bit off to my eyes. Still, fixing this required only a minor adjustment to contrast settings in the OSD, eventually leaving my gamma readings dead-on in the standard 2.2 range. Color shades were identifiable across the light and dark spectrum with nice precision. Despite its 1000:1 contrast rationot the greatest Ive seen, but standard for an IPS panelthe PG348Q showed very nice black levels and white saturation was minimal. The darkest tones on the screen were still identifiable from black backgrounds, and bright whites were identifiable across the spectrum. As expected then, there were no issues with color banding. As mentioned earlier, viewing angles were excellent from nearly all extreme views, with minimal color changes even when viewing the PG348Qs screen from the side. And with such a huge panel, well, theres probably very little reason to do so. Asus has listed the grey to grey response time on the PG348Q as 5ms, and astonishingly enough, this may have been a conservative estimate on our test unit. The Lagom test uses a series of flashing pixels to identify a range of response time as the monitor switches from dark to light tones. Many monitors will perform their best in the easiest (grey to grey) transition but falter elsewhere. The PG348Q performed extremely well across the spectrum, and to my eyes was holding sub-5ms times across the board. Lastly, I used Blur Busters Test UFO page to check for any dreaded ghosting or motion blur issues. Thankfully, I detected absolutely zero discernible ghosting with the PG348Q running at 100Hz with its overdrive functionality set to normal. Beyond some slight changes to contrast, this monitor tested extremely well. Gaming While ultra-wide gaming has benefitted from a growing list of compatible titles, its important to note there are still a few caveats. When a game is compatible with the monitor's 21:9 aspect ratio, the experience is seriously excellent. PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds comes to mind, with its big, sweeping environments. Colors on the PG348Q really pop, and when its rich colors are combined with a big game environmentparticularly in first-personthe immersion level is awesome. When you play a non-compatible title, though, you end up with ugly black bars on the side of the screen. For the meantime, the Asus PG348Q is easily one of the best ultra-wide gaming experiences available. My Nvidia GTX 1080-powered rig had no issues running games at the monitor's native 3440 x 1440 resolution, even at100Hz. Even titles with more scaled 21:9 resolutions, like Overwatch, looked phenomenal on this monitor. G-Sync functionality on the PG348Q works flawlessly, with no discernible screen tearing over our many hours of playing games. I will say, however, that I do wish the PG348Q had a bit more curvature. Again, its probably not very noticeable to most people, but I could tell the difference between this monitor and the peripheral view offered by other ultra-wide curved displays. When Im playing Battlefield 1 and riding a horse across the desert, I want more desert in my peripheral vision. Outside of that small complaint, playing games on the PG348Q is a fantastic experience. A slick design, high refresh rate, fantastic color reproduction, and G-Sync compatibility make the PG348Q the ultimate gaming monitor. The price is high, but this curved display delivers.", "date": "Jan. 25, 2018,"}
