The first two were available on Razer's website soon after the announcement, but weve gone from the shortest days of the year to the longest before the Pro version hit the shelves. The biggest and baddest Nommo have finally found their way into my test chamber, aka home office, so here's my full report. Razer Nommo Pro  Design and Features The Razer Nommo Pro are a 2.1-channel speaker system, meaning they're sporting separate left and right satellite speakers and a subwoofer. Both the satellites and the sub eschew the traditional box-shaped speaker design for a cylindrical tube. Unlike the standard Nommo speakers, the Pro feature a second cylindrical speaker enclosure on top of each satellite, making them look like a gun with a scope attached. The base of each satellite also offers RGB lighting effects, customizable via Razer's Synapse software. The separation of the woofer and tweeter allows the mid and high frequencies to be reproduced with more accuracy. In a single-driver setup the woofer needs to reproduce everything, and while it is possible, it isnt ideal. Tweeters, which are smaller than the woofers, are more adept at playing high frequency sounds and can play those frequencies with more clarity. The subwoofer is also cylindrical and has one down-firing seven-inch woofer on the bottom and a port on the top. In the same way tweeters are more adept at handling the high end, subwoofers are built to pump out the low frequencies. This allows the Nommo Pro to get down to 20Hz, the low end of human hearing. On the back of the subwoofer are connections for the two satellite speakers, the control pod, an optical-in, a USB port, a power button, and the power cable. The front of the sub has the Razer logo in an understated black-on-black decal. The control pod disc that attaches to the sub lays on your desk and has tactile controls. Theres a standby/power button centered on top that also acts as a mute button when pressed quickly. The outer ring rotates to control volume and there are lights around the top that illuminate as volume goes up and down. The front of the pod has an input select button to easily change between USB, optical, Bluetooth, and analog. Theres also the 3.5mm aux in (the analog input) and a headphone jack. When a headphone is plugged in, the volume and mute controls work for them. The cable that connects the control pod to the sub is over 8 feet long so you can position your sub farther away from your desk if necessary. A pad on the bottom of the pod keeps it from sliding around your desk, which is a handy feature. To get full functionality out of the Nommo Pro speakers, youll need to download the Razer Synapse 3 desktop software. This will be familiar to anyone that already has any Razer peripherals. It acts as a hub for all of your Razer gear and adds more functionality to the Nommo Pro than you can get with the control pod. Under the audio tab you can control volume of the input source, and theres also a bass boost control that ranges from 0 to 100 (50 is the default), and equalization options from THX and Dolby (Dolby Game, Dolby Movie, and Dolby Music) or an 8-band EQ with three presets. The lighting tab controls the brightness and lighting effects like breathing (where it pulses chosen or random colors), a wave of colors that circle the base, cycling through the color spectrum, or a static color. More elaborate lighting can be programmed with the Chroma Studio which works best when creating a color template to work across all of your Razer Chroma gear. This is where you can implement lighting that integrates with different games, such as FFXV, Fortnite, or Elder Scrolls Online. The majority of this integration is aimed towards keyboards and mice, though, with keys lighting up when an ability is refreshed or specific movement keys illuminated in a specific color like WASD. Some games, such as Doom, will light every device with the same color when an action is performed... Some games, such as Doom, will light every device with the same color when an action is performed, like an explosion of blue when you get a headshot. There are currently 100 official integrations that will automatically load with a game as long as Synapse 3 is running. Five third-party integrations require a separate application download and launch for each game. If you have an Android or iOS device, theres a mobile app available for download. In the app you can turn standby mode on and off, select the input, adjust volume and bass response, and select any EQ profile. If you disconnect the speakers from Synapse on your computer, the quick lighting effects (breathing, wave, spectrum, and static) can be adjusted within the app. Any deeper programming than that needs to be done with Synapse. Overall, the app is a neat idea but pretty useless. Overall, the app is a neat idea but pretty useless. If you're sitting at your desk there's no reason to use the app since you have all the controls literally at your fingertips, so its usefulness is limited to when you're not at your computer. This begs the question why you'd want to adjust your speaker settings when you're not at your computer? The only scenario I can envision is if you're using Bluetooth on your phone and walking around. I only used it to adjust the volume when listening to music from a few feet away since I had already decided on the bass response and EQ that I preferred. Razer Nommo Pro  Testing and Gaming To test the Nommo Pro I immediately opened up Battlefront II to ignite some lightsabers and take down some Imperials. I started with the ~THX~ EQ setting with the bass boost at its default 50 and found it to be too much for me. After toggling it a bit I settled on 30 as a good rumbling experience without the bass overpowering the midrange. The situational awareness I experienced with the Nommo Pro was excellent. I could easily aurally distinguish enemies to the left or right and turn to attack with Lukes saber. There was still some muddiness to the lower mids and it sounded like there was a dip in the frequency response at the crossover from the satellites woofer to the sub. Luckily that didnt affect the vocal range too much and chatter between characters was clear. I tried the other game EQ modes but I wasnt impressed. The Dolby Game setting added a significant amount of treble that sounded piercing and unnatural to my ears. The ~game~ setting under the EQ was similar, although it also added some bass that I didnt find necessary. For the rest of my gaming time I stuck with the THX profile. Battelfield 1 was a similar experience to Star Wars. The sound field in front of me had great size and depth to it and the placement of bullets whizzing through the air was very accurate. I brought the bass boost down a little bit more as it felt that it was mixed a bit higher than it was in Battlefront. The sub still provided great rumble as I drove around a tank and mortars exploded outside. It definitely got my heart pumping. The sound field in front of me had great size and depth to it and the placement of bullets whizzing through the air was very accurate. When I switched to listen to some music tracks I switched over to the Dolby Music setting and was disappointed. The vocals sounded distant and muffled, the bass was fuzzy, and the highs were coarse. Changing to the custom EQ option helped significantly. Chris Cornells vocals on Spoonman were now front and center. The bass was a bit unfocused and I could hear the frequency dip at the crossover point again (sounded to be around 120Hz), which I couldnt fix with the 8-band EQ. It isnt a huge flaw though, and it didn't detract much from the overall listening experience. There is some high end sizzle that was very apparent on Nuthin But A G Thang. I found that it limited the volume I could comfortably play the track. There wasnt any signal degradation when music was played over Bluetooth. Pairing with my phone was incredibly easy (just switch the speaker input to Bluetooth and select it from my discovered device list), and the control pod controlled the volume output of my iPhone. The Nommo Pro can really pump out the volume. The Nommo Pro can really pump out the volume. When gaming I rarely went above 50-60 and still felt fully immersed. For music I left it at 30-35 so there's plenty of volume on tap here. Since each satellite is imbued with Chroma lighting, I paid attention to it during gaming and found the lighting options on the Nommo Pro are a bit superfluous. The game integration is limited, but when it does react to actions in something like Doom its a nice addition. Beyond that, having a glow from the speaker base while playing in a dark room can add some cool ambiance, and if you are already a member of the Razer family having your peripherals linked by color is pretty cool. Finally, I also recently reviewed the $200 Logitech G560, so how do the two compare? The Nommo Pro definitely sound better than the Logitech. There's more bass extension (I think the Logitech had a significant drop off around 50Hz and the Pro drops closer to 20Hz), and there's better EQ adjustability. THX is a nice bonus, too. But are they ~more than twice as expensive as the Logitech~ better? Not at all, and if you don't have other Razer devices to sync the lighting with the speakers the price tag is even tougher to swallow. Overall the Nommo Pro's pricing is more inline with home theater bookshelf speakers. Overall the Razer Nommo Pro sound great. While there are a few issues  namely the somewhat mushy bass, and highs that can get a little harsh  those faults are minor in the grand scheme of things and the Nommos kept me fully engaged when I used them for gaming. The biggest issue is their $500 price tag. If you dont have other Razer products to integrate with the lighting the price tag is just plain high.", "date": "Aug. 15, 2018,"}
