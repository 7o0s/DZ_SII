It spreads its Diablo-esque hacking-and-slashing evenly across a party of crazed warriors instead of focusing on one lone explorer, and the many dank caves and hardscrabble towns you explore are nestled snugly into the foothills of a post-apocalyptic landscape reminiscent of Borderlands' Pandora or the irradiated wastes of the Fallout series. But while the first leg of this indie action-RPG trilogy picks up on elements from some excellent games, it fumbles them so badly at times that the grind rarely feels worth the effort you have to put into it. With the world all but wiped out by nuclear war, the last remaining pockets of civilization have erected makeshift settlements along the inside of the massive impact crater and taken to foraging for pre-apocalypse tech to survive. As a band of free-diggers, your initial trio of disposable adventurers sets out to scavenge the harsh realm and take on missions that ultimately bring you closer to the crater's mysterious central shaft. The rough and tumble populace brims with personality, and each scenic pit-stop along the way presents numerous opportunities for fetch quests, gear upgrades, and side missions galore. Krater's world is a fascinating, beautiful place to roam, if you have ample patience on tap. Stocking your three-man squad with any combination of four different character classes initially puts a fresh spin on the familiar cyclical flow of exploring, battling, and looting. Divided squarely between close-range brawlers and long-distance support units, each class wields a unique weapon set and two main abilities to use in battle. Bruisers, for example, lug around heavy clubs to smash skulls in with and their powers emphasize brute force. At the other end of the combat spectrum, Medicus deliver weaker long-range zaps and provide much-needed healing support. Plugging in permanent implants and boost power-ups into slots that unlock as your characters gain experience lets you further tweak their offensive and defensive prowess. Though it's easy to craft a well-balanced party, and having multiple characters to juggle is a nice change of pace, the bare-bones skill sets available feel inflexible and severely limited compared to similar action-RPGs. Plugging in new weapons and bolstering your powers with a range of secondary gadgets isn't enough when every new character you recruit comes with the exact same boiler plate abilities and you can't swap them out with new powers. I'd rather focus on fine-tuning a single character with a broader range of skills than managing a group of dull, locked-in-stone classes. Any remaining perceptions of depth quickly melt away when you hit the battlefield. Combat is brisk and fun until you grow tired of using the same handful of rote abilities over and over again without being able to swap them out. It doesn't take long. The fact that your human and monstrous foes lack variety and many of the caves settings you fight through feel too similar doesn't help much either. Between carving up mutated, pestilence-spewing wildlife and running fetch-quest errands to raise enough money to keep your group well-stocked with able bodies, there's plenty to keep busy with. The problem is much of it just isn't that enjoyable to begin with. Krater's most egregious shortcoming lies in the way its asinine party development cycle strips out any lasting sense of progression gained for your hard efforts. Each separate stretch of the adventure comes with its own level cap, which forces you to ditch the current party you've spent time upgrading and blow your cash on recruiting all-new level zero characters with slightly higher level caps. This throws a nasty speed bump into the mix right when you hit a nice cruising momentum. You'll completely swap out your group this way several times during your trek, losing any feelings of connection to your party as you replace it with new green recruits that are essentially no different than the previous batch. Starting a new party in mid-game is a pain, since you have to backtrack and re-level your troops until they're strong enough to hold their own in the newer territory you just ventured into. Frankly, the overlapping grind and regular backsliding sucks. It feels like you're being penalized for your hard work rather than rewarded, and this does little to inspire you to keep playing once you realize what's happening. It took me a while to notice when first group had stopped gaining experience after hitting level five, and all the extra battles beyond that point were a waste until I upgraded to a new party. Sadly, the game never really explains this system up-front, forcing you to figure it out through trial and error. Other areas feel half-baked as well. Krater's crafting system is almost an afterthought. It lets you collect a bunch of random junk and plug it into blueprints to make items but doesn't feel that useful when there are lots of weapons and power-ups kicking around on enemy corpses. This extra clutter dilutes the satisfaction of gathering loot, since most of the time you're picking up items that seem pretty worthless. Multiplayer co-op is currently non-existent, despite there being a dead menu option to login or play offline. An irritating map glitch that restores fog of war for areas you've already explored makes dungeon spelunking a pain at times, and a few other sporadic bugs pop-up here and there. CLOSING COMMENTS Krater promises you a juicy carrot and then clobbers you with the big stick. Without that addictive sense of another reward waiting around the next corner to keep you pushing along, the gameplay loses steam rather quickly. Punishing players for staying the course through lengthy grind sessions seems counterintuitive when the idea is to generally keep people playing. The issues with this first installment don't bode well for the planned trilogy, which is a shame, since the underlying concept and personality found in Krater are strong. But not strong enough to carry the dead weight of some seriously mind-boggling design choices. IGN RATINGS FOR KRATER (PC) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 6.0 Presentation Navigating the various menus and interfaces is smooth, but some gameplay elements aren't well-explained and the world map is clunky at best. 7.0 Graphics Some settings are beautiful and well-designed. Characters aren't as well-defined visually or distinct enough to stand out in the chaos of battle. 7.0 Sound Blasts of new age music are an odd but strangely pleasant fit. The intentionally garbled voice work is amusing. 5.0 Gameplay The repetitive combat is fun in bursts but severly limited in scope, and character development leaves much to be desired. 4.5 Lasting Appeal The fun grinds to a halt when you're forced to throw your party out the window and start anew several times mid-game. 5.0 OVERALL Mediocre (out of 10) Krater promises you a juicy carrot and then clobbers you with the big stick. Without that addictive sense of another reward waiting around the next corner to keep you pushing along, the gameplay loses steam rather quickly.
