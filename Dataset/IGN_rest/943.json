You can find it here.] Buying an Xbox One without Kinect saves money and delivers almost all of the same gaming experience, but it also sacrifices a measure of satisfaction when interacting with the console on a day-to-day basis. Though you can play nearly every game and run almost every app just as well, you'll be constantly aware of just how deeply Microsoft originally committed to Kinect when designing the interface. There's still work to be done before controller-only navigation feels completely natural. But underneath those UI design issues, you'll find a solid console. Besides a healthy selection of fantastic and largely gorgeous games, the array of entertainment options and OS features is impressive. If youre the kind of person who loves games, loves to gorge on media in many different forms, and enjoys getting at all of it in one place, this is the console for you. The Console Measuring 13.1~ x 10.8~ x 3.25, the Xbox One is beefy. It looks like a traditional media center set-top boxMicrosoft has more or less said it was purposely designed this waybut despite its hulking size, you wont notice it when its running, as its ultra quiet. (Though you may hear its disc drive during times youre installing games or watching TV shows/movies on low volume, depending on your system. Some are slightly noisier than others.) On its exterior, the Xbox One boasts glossy black panels, silver accents, and matte black vents, with a minimalist front panel that hosts just a power button behind the white-backlit Xbox logo and Blu-ray disc drive slot. In some ways, it tries too hard to be modern; the power buttons capacitive nature means that any light touch can unintentionally turn the box on or off. Thats tolerable when youve got the system set to instant-on mode, since you can resume a game exactly where you left off if you accidentally switch off power. But if youre in tight quarters and prone to bumping into that button, having the console set to energy-saving mode can have tragic consequences for your in-game progress. Its a similar situation with the left side panels single USB 3.0 input. Though positioned toward the front of the console, its placement adds to the systems footprint. Sticking a cable or USB thumb drive into that port means you need even more space to accommodate it. In this case, function over form (i.e., front-placed USB ports) would have been a better choice. Or, alternatively, Microsoft could have included a right-angle USB extension cable with the system. The situation at the back of the console is universally positive, where a gigabit ethernet port, an IR Out port, a proprietary port for Kinect, two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI In port, a SPDIF (optical audio) port, and HDMI Out reside. Of note are the IR Out jack, which lets you plug in an IR extension cable; the HDMI In port, which passes through video signals from any HDMI source; and the USB 3.0 ports. The latter two input types enable a particularly wide range of features. The passthrough port not only lets you run cable or satellite TV to your Xbox One, but also lets you run output from other sources, like a laptop or tablet, to the console as well. If you want to access a service you pay for but cant access through an Xbox One app, you can circumvent that. (There are caveats, though. While game consoles work, theres a notable amount of lag introduced by passing them through the Xbox One. Also, HDMI signals arent fed through to your TV when the system is off, even when set to instant-on mode; an HDMI splitter fixes the issue, but not having to spend money on a solution would be far better.) As for the USB 3.0 ports, they instantly recognize external hard drives, thumb drives, keyboards (wired and wireless), and USB hubs, giving you a lot of flexibility in how you can access media and control the console while still accommodating all of your USB accessories. When it comes to internal specs, the Xbox One holds relatively close to its main competitor, the PlayStation 4. Theres a 1.75GHz custom AMD APU, which combines the CPU and graphics processor in a single chip composed of two quad-core modules; a 5400RPM 500GB internal hard drive (on standard models); and 802.11a/b/g/n wi-fi. Where it differs from the PS4 is its support for Wi-Fi Direct, a lack of Bluetooth, no ability to replace the hard drive, and its combo of 8GB of DDR3 memory and 32MB of eSRAM (as compared to the PS4s 8GB of faster GDDR5 RAM). No support for Bluetooth isnt a problemthe Xbox Ones controller uses proprietary technology to communicate with the console, the SmartGlass app on phones and tablets can utilize Wi-Fi Direct to connect to a system, and you can set up a wireless USB keyboards. As for the non-user-upgradeable hard drive, you can supplement storage space with up to two external USB 3.0 drives. (Installation time is about the same to external drives as to the internal drive; its about an extra minute or two for games over 20GB, and less than a minute for those smaller than 20GB.) And since those drives are external, you can travel with your games a lot more easily, if you tend to hop between systems. The design that Microsoft chose for the Xbox Ones graphical processor, though, has been the focal point of criticism. The argument goes that despite virtually equal processing power on the CPU side of things, the Xbox Ones DDR3 memory lacks the bandwidth of the PlayStation 4s GDDR5 memory. The result is a more constrained ability to process game data as compared to the PS4, forcing developers to run their games with less graphical fidelity on Xbox One. How you feel about the numbers (whatever their actual cause may be) depends on what you value, of course. But while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally wont notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game (when there is one) unless they see both running side-by-side. And the Xbox Ones hardware still shows itself capable of gorgeous graphicsthough games like Sunset Overdrive and Ryse run at 900p/30fps, they hold their own against something like Forza Motorsport 5, which runs at 1080p/60fps and makes even non-car-aficionados lust after beautiful machinery. The change from last gen is that Xbox is no longer the obvious choice for playing multiplatform games. For most folks, a console is more than its sheer compute power. Its part of an entire ecosystem that includes its peripherals, interface, apps, and quality of its online multiplayer service. If gaming was purely about an obsession with graphics, all devotees would have long ago switched over to ultra-enthusiast gaming PCs. As it stands, when I consider just what this hardware lets me do, the Xbox One is still a hugely compelling choice. The Controller If you loved the Xbox 360s controller, youll very likely adore this one. Its similar to the beloved design of its predecessor, but boasts enough improvements that many people will eagerly embrace it. Even if you dont like every single change, the updates you do end up enjoying are so good that youll miss them when playing on other systems. The best of the tweaks, by far, are found in the d-pad. Its precise and offers satisfying, discrete feedback when you move it. Next on the list are the analog sticks, which are less stiff and have a deeper concave curve on top than those on the 360s controller; they also have textured edges along the tips for grip. Overall, I have an easier time getting fine movement out of them. The triggers also sport nice adjustmentstheyre a little looser than on 360, and you get more travel on them, which is particularly nice in shooters and racers. The deeper curve of their shape makes it easier to keep your grip on them, too. They also house the main major difference between the Xbox One controller and its predecessor: rumble triggers. While youll still feel the controller vibrate from its handles, each trigger also contains individual and developer-programmable response motors. Its not a very widely implemented feature though; moreover, only Forza Motorsport 5, Forza Horizon 2, and GTA V have really shown off how it can be used well, with a range of vibration that plies you with a pleasing sense of tactile feedback for whats happening onscreen. The shoulder buttons are more of a mixed experience. Theyre slightly stiffer than the 360s, with a more pronounced click when they bottom out. I like the more tangible response, but I also find its easier for my finger to roll off the point where a press registers. In games that require holding a bumper down for extended periods, I sometimes lose the button-press even when Ive been holding it the whole time, which is irritating. AA batteries make a return for the Xbox Ones controller. The performance of regular batteries in this controller is quite good; fresh sets often last me anywhere from 20-25 hours of use. (I even once got about 32 hours out of industrial-grade Energizers.) You can also buy a rechargeable battery pack or plug the controller into the console via a long micro-USB cable. As someone who favors replaceable batteries in just about everything, Im pretty happy I get to choose my power source. Listening to game and/or chat audio through the controller also offers options, but figuring it out is a bit more convoluted. For chat, the pack-in headset works quite wellthanks to the higher-quality audio codec used for Party chat and Skype calls, you dont need anything fancy to have clear, crisp conversations with gaming buddies. If youre looking for a way to get game audio too, though, thats when youll have to shell out extra cash for (at minimum) a $25 audio adapter that plugs into the controller. Itll let you use any headset with a single 3.5mm plug to listen to game audio, though with varying quality. Its not a perfect setup, though. Not all microphones work when their headsets are plugged in; if youve got a set of cans that worked perfectly on 360 and have the right wiring you need for Xbox One, youre still not guaranteed theyll make the leap to current-gen. Also, the audio adapter you have to buy supports only stereo sound, so even if your headset does work, you may be facing a downgrade of your audio experience. The Interface The best way of summarizing the Xbox Ones interface is that it feels much like hunting for treasure in a messy room. Many wonderful (and sometimes downright awesome) things exist in those piles, but sometimes you can have difficulty finding them. On systems with Kinect, the Xbox Ones Windows 8-influenced tile-based aesthetic is far less problematic; voice commands can zip you directly from one part of the UI to another with little fuss. But with a controller, extra digging is required to access basic elements, like Parties and Messages. And though snapping apps on the right hand of the screen is still helpful, doing so becomes more cumbersomethe equivalent of Xbox, go to  on a controller is an unintuitive double-tap on the Guide button, a press on the d-pad, and then some scrolling to find the app you want. You can mitigate some of this by connecting to your Xbox One with the SmartGlass companion app on a tablet or phone. Besides quicker navigation when using it as a remote (Windows 8s Modern interface was designed for touch-based devices), you can also load info like TV listings and Achievements on the second screen, and thus avoid having to switch between apps and games on your TV screen. But until Microsoft changes controller-only navigation to be as fast as when using Kinect, or even as simple as it is on the Xbox 360, this is one area that slightly drags down the overall experience. Hopefully, as part of Microsofts solution to this issue, theyll grant user control over where an app or game automatically loads; I'd love to be able to set which apps load as full-screen experiences and which appear as snapped windows or on my second screen. It would help streamline the interface in a way thatd benefit Xbox One owners regardless if they have Kinect plugged in; you wouldnt have to wait for an app to load, or deal with being switched out of a full-screen game to a separate app to access non-essential info. As for performance, the Xbox Ones OSs trifecta of componentsan Xbox OS that runs games, an OS based on the Windows 8 kernel that handles all the apps, and a hypervisor that manages the resources shared between the twoplays well together as a team, though I have encountered moments of hesitation and the occasional app crash. Startup does take awhile in energy-saving mode, thoughabout 42 seconds; instant-on is the better option if you dont mind the system drawing some power when in whats essentially a sleep mode. Its about 12 seconds for powering on, and downloads and updates happen automatically when the Xbox One is off. Gaming & Sharing Underneath the interface lies the heart of the Xbox Ones experience: the games and apps. When it comes to games, the Xbox Ones catalog offers a good mix of multiplatform releases and compelling exclusives at the year mark. The biggest one this season, of course, is Halo: The Master Chief Collection, even despite its launch woes. But Sunset Overdrive shouldnt be overlooked, nor should outstanding racing games like Forza 5 and its newer open-world cousin, Forza Horizon 2. And then, of course, 2015 will bring Halo 5: Guardians and other interesting projects like Quantum Break. (To get a fuller sense of all the platform offers, check out our list of the top 25 Xbox One games, as well as our highest-scoring Xbox One game reviews.) A key aspect to many of these games is the online multiplayer experience. Xbox Live Gold subscribers, for the most part, enjoy far more stability than on rival systems, with far less unscheduled downtime over the past year. And grouping up with friends is easy, as Xbox One Parties let you add up to 32 people at a time and offer fantastic sound quality for chat. (Only eight microphones can be active at once, though.) On the sharing front, the Xbox One makes it easy to publicize your accomplishments, as well as broadcast your exploits to a rapt audience. Grabbing clips of your gameplay through the GameDVR app is fairly easy, and uploading them to YouTube is as fast as going into the app and selecting the option to do so. The recording quality isnt as good as using a dedicated capture device, and its not as easy to edit clips as compared to doing so on a PC, but its quick and doesnt require any extra hardware. For livestreaming, the Twitch app makes broadcasting effortlesseven with the burden of having to go through an array of button presses to start the service. Setup is fast, and you can also rearrange the position of your picture-in-picture of window if its blocking the view of a menu or HUD. For people whove been curious to try livestreaming, this app lowers the barrier to entry by a huge amount, and makes it seem like an expected extension of what to do while gaming. The only thing youll lack is the ability to show your face to your audience, since you need Kinect for that. TV & Media Options The other half of the Xbox Ones core experience, the apps, shows a strong emphasis on media consumptionnot a surprise, given Microsofts goal of being the only box in your living room. And with the updates over the last year, committing to the Xbox One as your all-in-one entertainment center now feels like a real option. If youre a cable or satellite subscriber, the TV app lets you set up TV listings and control of your TV set quickly. (While you wont get the added benefit of Kinect commands to scroll through listings, fiddle with volume, and hop between channels, this is one of the areas where navigation feels simple with a controller.) You can do this with broadcast TV as well, but it requires extra equipment to route the signal into that HDMI In port. If youre in Europe, theres an official Xbox-branded digital tuner that makes this simple, but those in other territories have to figure out their own solution. Even if you dont have cable or satellite TV, in the U.S. you can consume TV shows and movies from a good variety of big-name service providers like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, and HBO Go, along with more specialized ones like Crunchyroll, SyFy Now, the WWE Network, and Comedy Central. Sports fans also get ESPN in addition to MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL games (if you have the necessary subscriptions), as well as eSports coverage. In a nice touch, some of these apps are integrated into the systems OneGuide TV listings, meaning you get a centralized look of whats on the air as well as highlights and recommendations for your video services all in one spot. You also can mix and match your media apps, meaning you watch Adventure Time on Netflix while getting NFL updates in a snapped window. The only missing element is integration with DVR recordings; youll still have to access those separately if you want to see what youve recorded. If streaming isnt your thing, you can instead play media off of thumb drives, external hard drives, and DNLA devices like a NAS unit or a computer on your home network. I love this feature, because while I still use the passthrough HDMI port to access streaming media services lacking dedicated Xbox One apps (like Spotify) on my laptop, the Media Player apps support for the MKV file format means I no longer need a separate HTPC to watch to all of my home movies and DVD/Blu-ray backups on my TV. (Theres also the option to use the Play To feature from within Windows Media Player on a Windows 7 or 8.x machine, too, if you still prefer that method or you have a visiting friend who wants to share some of their videos on their laptop.) The cherry on top is that if you have a Plex account, you can choose that as a prettier alternative method to get at your DNLA-streamed files, instead of Media Players plain, barebones interface. Pros Great controllerLots of media and peripheral optionsEasy gameplay sharing Cons Interface needs refinementNo DVR integration At the Xbox Ones launch, Microsoft took the position of wanting to be the console that offered everything in one place, but it didnt fully deliver on that. Now, a year later, the Xbox Ones major features have been strengthened enough so they clearly stand out, and the media-saturated environment they live in has also been nurtured and grown. Whether you come to your living room to watch video content or TV, listen to music, or play games, theres a lot to choose from in each category.<br><br> That said, there are still areas that need to be honed. The Xbox Ones interface needs refinement to make controller-only navigation feel simple; it cant rely on its alternative controls (SmartGlass, the optional Media Remote accessory) to shore up the gaps. And it wouldnt hurt if Microsoft worked with developers to eliminate lower resolutions and framerates in third-party games, as it currently makes the Xbox harder to choose for people who want to play the likes of Far Cry 4 or Dragon Age: Inquisition. But if Microsoft pushes out the same amount of substantial updates between now and next yearas it did between last year and nowthe Xbox Ones poised to become an amazing system by November 2015, no matter if it has Kinect or not.", "date": "Nov. 27, 2014,"}
