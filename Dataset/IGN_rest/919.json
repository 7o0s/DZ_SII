Some configurations actually stick around, like when it introduced an oversized, stylus-equipped phone over three years ago, and other updated designs have made their way to the company's existing product linesthe Galaxy Note 4's metal band was previously seen on the lesser-known Galaxy Alpha. Other projects haven't been quite as successful. The underwhelming Galaxy Round, for example, took advantage of flexible display technology to deliver a phone with a mostly-pointless curved screen. But while the Round itself likely won't live to see another day, the flexible display has once against been sent into battle in the form of the Galaxy Note Edge. The historically gimmicky Samsung is back with another live prototype, and this one might actually be a keeper. For the most part, the Galaxy Note Edge is identical to the stellar Galaxy Note 4. From the 2.7GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 420 graphics, to the S Pen stylus, 16-megapixel camera with OIS, and microSD card support, they are essentially the same devices. The Edge has a slightly smaller 3,000 mAh battery, but it's still removable and tucked away behind a fake-leather casing. As such, performance in just about every regard is equal between the two: the Edge incredibly quick (for the most partAndroid's recent app list still lags a bit), the camera is one of the best you can find on a smartphone, and the battery is more than enough to get you through a day or more of actual usage. Audio quality out of the single rear speaker was decent at best, and our AT&T review unit was loud and clear for both ends of the line when handling calls. Samsung's TouchWiz UI is...well, it's TouchWiz. One area where the two differ is outward design. With the far right side of the device reduced to a small, sharp-angled edge, the overall shape becomes asymmetrical. It took a few days to find out how to (somewhat) comfortably hold the device in one hand, and even then, it still didn't feel quite right. With my left hand securing the phone, my thumb was easily able to reach the volume rocker, but I was unable to tap the right edge of the screen with my fingertips. In my right handwhich I believe is the intended way to hold the deviceI had no problem accessing the edge and its shortcuts, but the volume rocker is placed so high that I couldn't get to it with my index finger. Adding to the awkwardness, the power button is located on the top of the phone, which is an odd place to put it, considering the size of the handset. The biggest feature separating the two phablets, however, is the display. While the Note 4 includes a flat 5.7-inch 2,560 by 1,440 panel, the Note Edge is equipped with a 5.6-inch 2,560 by 1,440 + 160 screen. The extra 160 columns of pixels accomodates the curved portion of the display, as to not take away from your usual viewing area. The curve has a seamless and incredibly smooth slope, and it's amazing to think about a Super AMOLED screen that has been adapted to work in this manner. It's visually crisp (the screen has a pixel density of 524 ppi), the well-constructed Gorilla Glass felt great to the touch, and the viewing angles were good enough to make sure that the extra content never looked washed out, regardless of vantage point. But just as important as the curve itself is what Samsung does with it. Primarily, the extra screen is used as a quick launcher. Utilizing it felt a lot like using a Windows Taskbar or the OS X dock. You can customize which apps and/or folders are found on the panelseven apps/folders can be seen at one time, but the list is scrollable. I tended to use this feature quite often, which more or less rendered the laggy recent app list obsolete. I even visited my home screen less, as I had my most-used apps pinned to the panel. In addition to the quick launcher, the side panel can show other types of information through a few services. Swiping left or right on the curve can bring up Yahoo news and ticker information, an S Health-connected pedometer, trending Twitter topics, favorited contacts, music controls, and the weather and missed notifications, to name a few. There is an also app store for additional panels (there are only a few options currently available), with some showing other types of phone-related data and one being a quirky burger-making game. At night, you can choose to have the panel dimly show the time, date, and current weather, while keeping the rest of the display unlit. Swiping down from the top of the panel will reveal quick access buttons to the functions like a voice recorder, a timer, and (humorously) a ruler. When inside an app, the panel defaults to a thin strip that doesn't contain any icons, avoiding unintentional taps in the process. Swiping left from the edge will slightly extend the panel, revealing whatever type of information you set the software to provide. Touch sensitivity on the curved portion was just as good as the rest of the phone and scrolling was smooth and responsive. I also don't recall ever opening an app on accident. I was surprised as to how often I utilized the panel, and more developer support could make it even better. For example, it would be nice to check into a location via Swarm without having to open the app, and even Google Navigation directions could be properly displayed. Samsung is granting access to the panel's API, so more functionality could certainly make its way to the unique hardware feature. Samsung customized its camera software to make use of the curved edge as well. Instead of overlaying the viewfinder with shooting options and a shutter button, these are located on the panel, making for an unobtrusive video and photo-taking experience. The remaining software is just as you would see it on the Galaxy Note 4. Android 4.4.4 Kit Kat is decked out with TouchWiz tweaks, including those that make good use of the larger display and S Pen. The ability to use split-screen apps, reduce the viewable area, and the stylus-enabled Quick Command shortcuts are all present. Other features, like the heart rate and oxygen saturation sensors, as well as the fingerprint scanner, have also made their way to the Note Edge. The fingerprint scanner worked better for me with the Note Edge than with the Galaxy Note 4, but consistency was still hit-or-miss. The Galaxy Note Edge can pretty much be summed up as a Galaxy Note 4 with a twist, but the price of the two are anything but equal. Through AT&T, the Note 4 can be picked up for $300 on contract or $825 unsubsidized. The 32GB Note Edge, on the other hand, costs a hefty $400 with a two-year commitment or a whopping $950 outright. The on-contract price matches that of the 64GB iPhone 6 Plus, and the unsubsidized price is equal to that of the 128GB version of Apple's new phablet. Being an early adopter and owning new technology can be expensive, and the Note Edge is proof of that. Pros Powerful specs and beautiful screen.Unique and useful curved display.Great camera. Cons Awkward to hold.Expensive. The Galaxy Note Edge's curved display is a gimmick, but at least it's a gimmick that works. When hopping back and forth from the Edge to a phone with a regular screen, I actually found myself wanting there to be extra screen space for a quick launcher. And with the same hardware found in the Galaxy Note 4, Samsung's new project is as powerful as it is unique.<br><br> Unfortunately, the gimmick also makes the already-big handset even more difficult and awkward to handle. The asymetrical design could be annoying for those who use their left hand to hold phones, the power button is in an annoyingly hard-to-reach place, and gripping the phone with my fingertips while taking calls felt downright odd.<br><br> The Galaxy Note Edge is also quite expensive, with the starting price of the device exceeding that of the already-premium-priced Galaxy Note 4 and iPhone 6 Plus. If you want to own an interesting phone with truly unique hardware, you certainly have that option, but it'll cost you.", "date": "Dec. 18, 2014,"}
