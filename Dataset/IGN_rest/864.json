It's a challenging space strategy game with a touch of action simulation, cut from old cloth, but unfortunately much of that challenge springs as much from handling the controls as it does from the actual gameplay. Its hard not to think about Relics 1999 space RTS Homeworld (and Gearboxs impending Homeworld Remastered Collection) as I play Void Destroyer, commanding a persistent fleet across several missions with swipes of the mouse. The difference is that with a tap of the spacebar, it also allows you to take direct manual control of any ship from your fleet and blast away at bogies yourself. Void Destroyer captures the havoc of large-scale space battles and pairs it with space combat vaguely reminiscent of Star Wars: TIE Fighter, and the basic concept works so well that Id love to see it used in an official Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica game. Fortunately, if you need it, the lightweight lore here stands well enough on its own. Void Destroyer is drenched in a comic-book aesthetic that inevitably recalls Borderlands, and its wisely carried over to lively comic-inspired panels that serve as cutscenes. It also doesn't take its tale of a bloody conflict with the dastardly Miner's Union too seriously, as the typo-riddled bits of dialogue that describe it are peppered with enough humor and snark to make up for the absence of any luxuries, such as voice work. Where it runs into trouble is that controlling a fleet and flying a ship at the same time is a difficult task, and unlike the in-game commander, I wasnt able to plug my brain directly into the computer. This game is old-school complex, and coming to grips with it is serious work. Void Destroyer knows it has a learning curve as steep as El Capitan, and to its credit, it provides hefty text-based tutorials and on-screen tips for each mode, as well as real-time missions that put the lessons from those tutorials into practice. All the same, I never entirely got used to the whiplashy camera controls; nor did I get over the feeling of intimidation from the array of controls and fleet formation options in both Tactical and Command mode (the latter of which lets you bark out orders while still in control of the turrets of an individual fighter). In time, I fell into my own rhythm and outright ignored what struck me as extraneous elements of the interface, but it was a hard slog that, at times, made me dread booting it up. This matters so much in Void Destroyer because the challenges of each mission leave so little room for error. This tendency reveals itself early on in a mission where you're directed to steer a weakened star cruiser to safety through Void Destroyer's version of Mass Effect's mass relays. Enemy ships pour out of the gate, pelting the cruiser with laser fire, and I failed the mission around three times even while taking advantage of the physics systems total absence of speed limits to propel myself. At last, I chickened out and took advantage of the difficulty settings, which merely adds some resistance to the hull or slightly decreases the health of enemies. Even so, I barely made it through. Hilariously enough, that's a rather benign scenario. Another features a massive ship with three drills that's determined to go straight through you  remember, we're fighting angry miners here  and others feature chaotic space battles that all but require constant use of tactical mode. This is an intense game, and the bothersome UI and labyrinthine commands add an extra layer of complication that shouldn't be there, particularly when the campaign relies on a persistent fleet that carries over from one mission to the next. (In other words, if you lose too many ships in one mission, the next is going to be way more difficult.) The home base alleviates some of the pain by letting you research new technologies and build and upgrade ships, but its menus suffer from unintuitive design as well. And to its great credit, Void Destroyer rewards those who manage to blast their way through its challenges and find themselves hungering for more, thanks to a lengthy series of ~Instant Action~ scenarios that alter the stakes of certain campaign mission. That weakened star cruiser, for instance? In the scenarios, you'll have to protect it while only having access to the fighters, which means folks like me can't chicken out and try to rush the gate. Arenas also let you to customize the challenge as you wish, even to the point of hopelessness. That's a tad masochistic for my tastes, but the option ensures that Void Destroyer could have a shelf life that lasts many, many hours past its campaign.
