Theyre getting another shot, however. First, New Super Mario Bros. U returned in a deluxe 2019 re-release, and now its Super Mario 3D Worlds turn. And better still, the already decent-sized Wii U adventure is bolstered by an entirely new outing: Bowsers Fury. Both parts of the package certainly have their moments  and Bowsers Fury in particular has a pretty interesting central hook  but by the time I was finished I still had an itch that Marios cat suit didnt quite scratch. The Spice of Life Back in 2013, IGNs reviewer praised Super Mario 3D World for being a joy to play, both in single player and with friends. Many of the points made in that review very much still stand, in particular the entertainment value from the fact that each level is typically built around a unique gameplay twist. Much like the Galaxy games, this has allowed Nintendos designers to flit nimbly from idea to idea. In one level platforms appear and disappear in time to music. In another, players use the gyro functionality to activate blocks themselves. There are levels with all sorts of fun concepts  playing in silhouette, walking on invisible tiles, steering through mazes of Futurama-style pipes, and navigating paths with panels that flip each time you jump. Theres even a level that pays homage to Super Mario Kart, complete with music straight from the SNES classic.Nintendo's designers flit nimbly from idea to idea... There's even a level that pays homage to Super Mario Kart, complete with music straight from the SNES classic. Power-ups add to the variety, giving Mario a cannon on his head, or allowing him to be cloned and tasking players with wrangling several of the portly plumber at once. Levels generally contain standalone micro-challenges too  short, single room set pieces that are one and done. And as is so often the way, Super Mario 3D Worlds true scope - its full set of Worlds - doesnt become apparent until well after youve beaten the game. The visual design is also still a highlight. The environments are wonderfully vibrant, from the way shrubs and flowers bop along to the jaunty melodies that are apparently piped into each area, through to the impressive amount of variety between worlds. The suite of cat suit animations are also just so lovingly composed. Mario doesnt need to wiggle his bum before he pounces, for instance, but the move is so much the better for that small detail, and that's just one of many. Schrdinger's Cat That said, playing Super Mario 3D World again now, the gameplay actually feels like a bit of an awkward fit for the presentation. Levels are viewed from fixed perspectives (that can often be shifted left or right) and generally have limited depth, giving you a path to follow but only so much room to move within it. This has a few unfortunate knock-on effects. Despite sharing some design principles with Super Mario Galaxy, for instance, 3D World feels a lot more staid. Of course, theres a pretty big difference between Mario running all the way around planetoids and the levels here, in which hes basically trapped in a set perspective diorama, but 3D Worlds presentation means that even transitions lack the dynamism and excitement that naturally come hand in hand with galaxy-hopping. To get from one playspace to another in the Galaxy games, for instance, you literally rocket off the surface of the world youre on and zoom through space, spinning and twirling and collecting Star Bits as you go. In 3D World you, erm, go into a box and then come out of a box in a different place. At best you fly slowly through a glass pipe. It just doesn't feel as effervescent as Mario's most freewheeling outings. Of course, the designers have tried to think outside the presentational box in a few different ways. The introduction of the cat suit is perhaps the most notable, as it lets players scale walls, reinventing the playspace and revealing secrets or unseen paths that were previously out of sight. Heck, you can even run right up the flagpole at the end of each course. Its a liberating inclusion, expanding your possibilities in ways that throwing fireballs and boomerangs or swiping enemies with your tanooki tail doesnt. Other power-ups also transform traversal, whether youre soaring up into the sky using a Propeller Box or stomping through the scenery after chomping down on a Mega Mushroom. Even so, I just dont enjoy Super Mario 3D Worlds gameplay as much as other entries in the series, and I think that has a lot to do with this games heritage. The foundation of this design was born in Super Mario 3D Land for 3DS, after all, and in that context it excelled. The constrained scope of levels suited handheld play and the limits of the hardware well, while the set perspective and movement restrictions gave Nintendos designers the perfect diorama-like design to showcase the systems 3D screen. It worked wonderfully. On console, its a rather different story. Without the depth perception enabled by a 3D screen, the forced viewpoint makes spatial awareness harder to judge than it would be in a purely 2D design or in a 3D game with full camera control. As such, 3D World doesnt feel as intuitively precise as other Mario games. Co-Op Catfight This feeling is compounded when you throw additional players into the mix. Yes, just like the New Super Mario Bros. games for Wii, Wii U, and Switch, up to four people can quest together  in this case choosing from Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad and eventually, Rosalina. The result is chaotic and fun, but also haphazard; some levels and challenges simply dont work that well with four people running around in them. Multiplayer is a mixed bag in other ways, too. The core of the experience is meant to be a push and pull between cooperation and competition. On one hand youre working together to get to the end of the stage but, on the other, youre also fighting to get the most points and win the crown that you then get to wear in the next level. This tension can be fantastic  one minute Id leave a power-up for a friend to help them out, the next Id pick them up and try to toss them off the map.Multiplayer is chaotic and fun, but also haphazard; some levels and challenges simply don't work that well with four people running around in them. One of the places where it fails, however, is when the shared pool of lives runs out and prematurely ends the fun. Why have lives at all? As long as one player remains on solid ground then why cant we keep trying to bumble our way through a level? That would suit the random, anarchic-feeling gameplay a whole lot more, and it would also mean that less experienced players arent punishing the whole team if they die over and over. The differences between playable characters is more of a negative than a positive, too. Its rare that youd want to use Toad, for instance, who is fast but can't jump very high. Luigi, too, can be tricky if theres a lot going on, as you need to judge both his larger jump and the fact that he skids to a stop. Rosalina, on the other hand, is just broadly better. Not only does she have a spin attack out of the gate, but she can basically double jump. Yes, shes the slowest and yes, shes the only character to lose her core abilities when shes wearing a suit, but still, shes always the first draft pick. The solution to this would be to simply let multiple people use the same character and then put them in different colours, but thats not an option. Of course, the deeper solution is to have levels designed specifically for multiplayer outside the main storyline. Thats perhaps too much to ask for a re-release like this, but its disappointing no improvements were made at all. Even the scoring system, in which whoever gets to the top of the flagpole basically insta-wins, is unchanged. Instead, the main change to multiplayer is the introduction of online play, which I wasnt able to test ahead of release. And to be honest, if I was going to play this again with other people, Id want to be in the same room, anyway. Nein, Lives Playing with friends is still fun for a change of pace, but 3D Worlds levels feel much more appropriate for one  or possibly two  players. I mostly played it solo and for the most part stuck with Ol Reliable, Mario, then Rosalina once Id unlocked her. There isnt a great deal of impetus to use the other characters beyond curiosity and obtaining the occasional character-specific stamp. Speaking of the stamp system, its been integrated with the games new Snapshot mode. This will be familiar to anyone whos played Super Mario Odyssey, and lets you pull up a camera-style interface, then zoom, pan, and switch filters to get your shot just right. The addition of stamps into the mix is a great concept, but works a lot better in Bowsers Fury, in which you can more easily frame a scene. In 3D World youll often not be able to move the camera at all. Its also a little disappointing that you can only rotate stamps, not flip them to face the other way or adjust their size. Theres quite a low limit on how many stamps you can have on screen at once, too. Snapshot mode is a good addition, but I would have liked to see Nintendo make some single player quality of life changes too. Player lives feel really anachronistic at this point, for instance, and only get in the way of actually enjoying the game. Structurally, their purpose is to force you to restart a level from the beginning if you run out of lives, as opposed to from the checkpoint, but the upshot of this system is that Id deliberately kill Mario to get back to five lives (not nine, curiously) instead of starting a new level with only one or two lives, just to avoid the possibility of losing checkpoint progress. That doesnt seem like the kind of player behaviour Nintendo would want. Theres no good reason not to have infinite restarts from the mid-level checkpoint, either, as getting to the end of a course generally isnt meant to be the biggest challenge  its finding all three Green Stars and the stamp. Then again, maybe Nintendos designers would make the argument that hitting the Game Over screen refreshes the slot machines (which essentially grant extra lives) and the Toad Houses (which let players stock up on power-ups) in the overworld. Sure, but all that shlepping around is just unnecessary busywork, and the Toad Houses in particular feel like a misstep in the first place. Not only is there a fear of wasting what you get from these houses given they wont reset very often, they highlight how much more fun  and challenging  3D World could have been with a deterministic loadout system. The way it currently works is youll go into a level in whatever state you finished the last level. If you happened to be mini-Mario, for instance, have fun, because youre starting the new level as mini-Mario (and for the record, theres no other instance in which this happens  in all other circumstances you start as regular-sized Mario). Alternatively, if you happened to finish the last level in the cat suit, with a tanooki suit in reserve, well, aside from having extra movement and combat options, you can also take a bunch more hits in the next course. I understand that the designers want you to roll with whatever youve got, and also that theyll provide appropriate power-ups within each level (although, if youre mini-Mario, enjoy the mushroom in place of something better), but rather than it being a fun test of skill, it instead feels punitive.It's a real shame Nintendo didn't take this re-release as its chance to address the elements that create friction throughout the game design. I cant help but imagine a (3D) world in which you can choose your loadout before every level. Each slice of gameplay would start on an even playing field, and experimenting with different suits could be part of the challenge, and even tie into getting specific collectables. In essence this is how Bowsers Fury works  you build up a stockpile of power-ups and can basically switch between them at will. Its much more fun. I also would have liked to see Nintendo take inspiration from Super Mario Odysseys assist functionality. With that option on, kids could find their platforming feet, secure in the knowledge that if they fall into the abyss the game will just pop them back up onto solid ground. 3D World has an Invincible Super Leaf pickup which appears once youve failed a level enough times, but this only protects players from enemies, not from falling to death which is the bigger hurdle on a lot of courses. A change to this would have been great for beginners and made a huge difference to multiplayer too. As it stands, Super Mario 3D World has some great levels and challenges, but I dont think it fully succeeds as either a single player or multiplayer game, and its a real shame Nintendo didnt take this re-release as its chance to address the elements that create friction throughout the game design. The Cats and the Furious So thats one half of the package. The other is Bowsers Fury, a whole new, much more contemporary-feeling adventure. Gone is the concept of lives, and the fixed perspective, replaced by an open world with full camera control. The other playable characters have also been jettisoned, but Mario is joined by Bowser Jr. and together theyre trying to save the new setting of Lake Lapcat from a malevolent black goop that has taken hold of the Koopa King. The most significant mechanic tied to this setup is that every few minutes Bowser explodes with fury, sending the world into an apocalyptic storm in which glowing blocks drop from the sky and his towering form breathes sweeping jets of fire, decimating anything in their path  occasionally including the frame rate. This rage state will subside in a few minutes, but can also be overcome by directly confronting Bowser or by reaching a Cat Shine  the games main collectable. Most of these are found at the lighthouses dotted about the world. After the Lake reverts to sunshine and blue skies, Bowser settles back down into the muck, but soon begins to slowly rise up, giving you a visual indication of how close he is to unleashing his fury once again. Its an interesting mechanic given that were accustomed to open worlds that largely let us set our own pace and agenda. Here, however, Bowsers Fury is unleashed so regularly that you have to be ready to deal with it at almost any time. Its not always welcome  occasionally ruining whatever you were doing  but can be used to your advantage. Blocks with Bowsers face on them can only be destroyed by his furious fire breath, for instance, while the blocks that drop from the sky can actually make platforming challenges easier in the midst of the maelstrom. Its quite cool seeing how the world is reinvented whenever Bowser blows his top. That said, I did get a little tired of the constant interruptions, and if youre not within easy reach of a Shine, it quickly becomes apparent that fighting Bowser is an extremely repetitive way to restore the world. This battle is heavy on Godzilla vibes but extremely light on excitement and gameplay. It doesnt evolve much over the course of Bowsers Fury, either, and is really just the icing on a pretty half-baked cake as far as bosses are concerned. In 3D World in particular theyre about as gripping as a book written entirely in Lorem Ipsum. Its-a Meme King Koopas role may be a mixed blessing in Bowsers Fury, but Bowser Jr. is absolutely a net positive. Younger players can set him to help them by taking out enemies and collecting coins, while purists can turn that off altogether, only using Bowser Jr. when they direct him using the gyro functionality. His main abilities are interacting with question mark walls and being Marios power-up caddy. Its this latter function that really elevates Bowsers Fury, as it lets you stockpile power-ups and call on him to deliver specific suits as you need them. It turns bonus abilities into tools you can experiment with and use as you see fit, and is much more player friendly than the system in 3D World. Each lighthouse on Lake Lapcat plays host to five Shines, and the layout around each location changes depending on the Shine youre gunning for. Its a familiar system, but a good way to pack more gameplay into a small area. The moment to moment action, however, doesnt contain too many surprises; youll be using the same power-ups and suits from 3D World, and a number of challenge types are repeated across the archipelago. That said, the world steadily opens up as you make progress, so there are always new locations or edges of the map to explore. Getting around is good fun, too, thanks to the ability to hitch a ride with the dinosaur Plessie any time youre near water. Which is all the time.The moment to moment action in Bowser's Fury doesn't contain too many surprises; you'll be using the same power-ups and suits from 3D World. I enjoyed my time with Bowsers Fury but it ultimately doesnt feel that essential. This is a Mario title driven more by gimmicks than gameplay. Theres no better example of this than the fact that almost every single creature, enemy, and object in Lake Lapcat is part cat. Goombas are furry, with cat ears and tails. Flowers are shaped like paws and shrubs have cat ears. Its all extremely silly, and Ill be the first to admit that it does give the game a fun flavour, but it doesnt add anything in terms of gameplay, and thats surprising. The best Mario games take their goofy ideas and tie them into core mechanics that directly impact puzzles and platforming. Here, its largely window dressing. Super Mario 3D World + Bowsers Fury packs a tonne of engaging gameplay, but neither component comes together as elegantly as it might have done. This is a solid option if youre craving more Super Mario for your Switch, but its not the moustachioed must-play I was hoping for.", "date": "Feb. 11, 2021,"}
