I cant see or hear the detective, but the woman answering the questions is right in front of me. Shes reserved and shy, but polite. I can tell she doesnt want to be there. Then I click on another video in the archive. Its the same woman. The tapes timecode tells me its a different day, but I dont need to be told. Shes energetic now. Her short-sleeved shirt reveals a snake tattoo on her arm. It bobs up and down as she strums a guitar. With a smile, she sings an unnerving folk song about a jealous woman who drowns her sister. This is the core experience of Her Story, a wonderful, brave video game unlike anything Ive played before. The woman above has a dead husband, and shes a suspect. As such, shes also an unreliable narrator by default, so her story can change from video to video. My job is to wade through dozens of old, archived clips and decide what she may or may not have done. Her alibis, her body language, her reactions  they all contribute to a great, dense story that stayed in my mind days after Id seen the end. In Her Story, what you dont know is as important as what you do. Youre not even told exactly who you are; youre logged into a 90s-looking police computer as AUTH_GUEST. For reasons I dont want to spoil, its clear youre looking through these videos long after the murder investigation has finished so whats the purpose of it all? From the start, theres an unshakeable air of mystery that permeates and enriches the entire experience. Her Storys main game mechanic is essentially a search engine, which let me chase down leads, investigate old claims, or validate my theories. You type in a word or phrase, and any video containing that word or phrase pops up. Its a simple, gratifying tool, and it gives Her Story a different pace when compared to other adventure games. Everything you could want to know is available from the start, but you wont know which words are important to focus on until you spend some time with the suspect. From there, the only barrier between you and what you need to know is what you type into the search bar. Its refreshing to make progress based on what you learn or feel, and not on what you collect. The issue with this system is that when I was occasionally stumped, Id search for common words like she, to, and went, and sometimes the results brought up new videos without me deducing anything. It wasnt a movie-perfect EUREKA! moment. I literally just guessed, and those guesses led to legitimate leads when the trail Id earned went cold. If Her Story hadnt let me do that, I would have missed out on at least 15 important videos, but the effectiveness of simple guessing undermined the sense that I was working my own way through a mystery. The interviews are recorded in full-motion video. A real actress, Viva Seifert, plays the woman, and her performance is appropriately both grounded and absurd. Her Story respectfully deals with mature themes such as mental illness, identity, loss, and infidelity. We dont quite know who she is or what shes going through, but were there to hear her well-told story, warts and all. Across dozens of videos, Seifert nails her performance as a troubled widow. I ended the game with over 10 pages of story notes that would seem crazy to anyone who found them. I had one page dedicated to people, locations, and times. Another for inconsistencies. Several more were paraphrased transcriptions. Most, however, were nonsense bits like these: Cant get the bloodstains out. Reflection? How would the party hat work? He has a thing for blondes. If the DOLLS have passports I later compared notes with a coworker, who had equally terrifying scribbles. I wont ruin your experience by going into details. This is all to say, Her Story had the complete attention of two people  both of whom took copious notes  and each person came away with different yet totally viable theories. Video game stories often dont hold up to that kind of scrutiny, or dont leave much room for interpretation, which makes Her Storys success all the more impressive. Pros Great storySmart FMV useFew ~true~ answersBelievable acting Cons Guessing is too effective Despite it being born from originality, I hope other developers copy Her Storys blueprint. Not the exact story, of course, but the idea that people who play games are smart, and can take on tough, intellectual work if you give them a story worth working for. With a strong script, great use of FMV, and a simple yet empowering core game mechanic, Her Story is the most unique game Ive played in years.", "date": "June 30, 2015,"}
