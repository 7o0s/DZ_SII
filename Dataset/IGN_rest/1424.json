Where it feels a bit like it did the first time you ever played one, even though youre so intimately familiar with it? New Super Mario Bros 2 gives you 80-odd levels of perfectly-pitched side-scrolling platforming with a smattering of new features, but it doesnt give you that feeling. Its a surprisingly conservative entry in this continually inventive franchise, and though its a masterclass in level design and eternally satisfying to play, it doesnt move the series forward. When its as good as it was to begin with, though, its hard to find much else to complain about. New Super Mario Bros 2 stars the Koopalings (Bowsers long-neglected junior minions) as villains, who crop up in predictable but nonetheless entertaining boss fights at the end of each of the games worlds. Coin-collecting is the ancient video game principle at the heart of the game. Those shiny little discs of gold metal are everywhere, erupting in shimmering cascades from pipes and trailing in the wake of Cheep Cheeps underwater. The new power-ups mostly revolve around turning everything into gold; a golden Flower transforms Mario into a tubby little Midas, transmuting everything around him into coins, and coin blocks can be worn on Marios head, leaving a trail of twinkling currency as he runs and jumps. Golden rings, meanwhile, temporarily gild every enemy in the level, giving you greater rewards for bopping them on the head and causing Koopa shells to spew coins in their spinning path. The game keeps track of your cumulative coin total, displaying it right in your face on the world map and popping up with little congratulatory messages when you reach a new milestone. Something happens when you reach one million, were told, but itll be a while before anyone finds out what. There are plenty of old power-ups too, of course, like the Fire Flower, Starman and the Super Leaf, which turns Mario into Raccoon Mario (though the resultant powers of flight are tragically under-used for the majority of the game). The Mega and Mini Mushrooms from the original New Super Mario Bros turn up as well, but only once or twice over the course of the entire game, making them feel a lot less gimmicky than they did before. New Super Mario Bros 2s primary-coloured, whimsical graphical style is as endearing as ever  the Koopas even do a little dance when theres a trill in the music. Weirdly, though, the 3D effect doesnt work well at all. Turn the slider up and the detailed 2D backgrounds get blurrier and blurrier, which creates a depth of field effect but also smears all the lovely artwork. Unlike Super Mario 3D Land, it doesnt feel built for the console  there are no levels with nifty 3D effects, and its difficult to find a reason to turn the slider up. Mario is such a joy to control that he sometimes feels like an extension of your thoughts. He has a perfect sense of weight to him, and the levels are exquisitely designed to take advantage of his acrobatic abilities. Each world has two castles to break up the normal flow, and some worlds have ghost houses that give Mario platforming a puzzley twist, with disappearing doors and mirrored rooms. There are a lot of secrets, too  some of the levels have second exits that lead you to a new place on the map (or a new world entirely), and youll constantly be scanning their perfect geometry for the inviting gaps in the scenery or slight anomalies that could point towards something hidden. Difficulty-wise, New Super Mario Bros 2 is still a long way from the invigorating cruelty of the old 2D Marios, but you wont be able to skip through the game without ever dying. If you fail a level more than a few times, the white Tanooki Suit  or the You Suck Tanooki Suit, as its more colloquially known  lets you run through the levels as an invincible white raccoon Mario, but that still wont save you from death by deadly purple goop or falling into lava. The difficulty is offset by the sheer proliferation of coins, though  if youre any good, youll have about 100 lives saved up by the time youre halfway into the game. The co-op multiplayer is fun, but inessential  on a small screen, the camera often has trouble keeping both of you in focus at once, and it doesnt let you run off and explore separately. It feels like another missed opportunity, with no bespoke levels made for co-operative play. Where New Super Mario Bros Wii only really came alive when played with friends, the multiplayer here feels like an optional add-on. Coin Rush Mode has a more competitive aspect, letting you challenge people via Streetpass to amass as many coins as you can without dying over three randomly selected levels  and under a time limit, too, as if that wasnt enough pressure. This gives New Super Mario Bros 2 a little longevity, which is desperately needs; the single-player game barely lasts five hours on a first playthrough, though secret-searching and collecting star coins takes much longer. CLOSING COMMENTS It is impossible not to be drawn in by the simple perfection of New Super Mario Bros 2s mechanics and level design  this is as pleasurable and effortless as 2D platforming gets. But its also impossible not to be disappointed that its over so quickly, and doesnt offer anything really new. The best Mario games reinvent themselves at the same time as paying loving homage to what went before; they take something you know and love and make it feel new all over again. New Super Mario Bros doesnt do that - but its a delightful game while it lasts, and still the best 2D platformer on the 3DS. IGN RATINGS FOR NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. 2 (3DS) Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 9.0 Presentation It's hard to fault Nintendo on presentation - the animation and colourful visual style are as endearing as ever. 8.0 Graphics The 3D doesn't work at all well, but other than that NSMB2 is good-looking. 8.0 Sound You'll hear that coin chime a lot. Interestingly, theres surprisingly little new music in New Super Mario Bros 2  most of it is variations on the six-year-old NSMB theme. 9.5 Gameplay Only the lack of novelty detracts from the perfection of this formula. 7.0 Lasting Appeal A 5-6 hour single-player quest is extended significantly by Star Coins, secret-hunting and (to an extent) Coin Rush, but its still on the short side. 8.5 OVERALL Great (out of 10) It is impossible not to be drawn in by the simple perfection of New Super Mario Bros 2s mechanics and level design  this is as pleasurable and effortless as 2D platforming gets. But its also impossible not to be disappointed that its over so quickly, and doesnt offer anything really new. The best Mario games reinvent themselves at the same time as paying loving homage to what went before; they take something you know and love and make it feel new all over again. New Super Mario Bros doesnt do that - but its a delightful game while it lasts, and still the best 2D platformer on the 3DS.", "date": "Aug. 5, 2012,"}
