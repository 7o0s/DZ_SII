This is my third trip through Diablo 3 since its original release on PC in 2012 and expansion pack-fueled debut on Xbox One in 2014, and I have to say: it still plays wonderfully. Thats not a huge surprise. What is an unexpected delight is how good Diablo 3 looks on Nintendos portable console. The Diablo 3 Eternal Collection doesnt really offer anything new apart from a Ganondorf armor set, but it does offer everything: the Reaper of Souls expansion that makes you forget about the weak fourth Act, a seventh playable character in the form of the sadistic Necromancer, and every single update and tweak thats helped Diablo 3 realize its full, enormous potential. It is Diablo 3 in its final form, and its simply a blast. Often literally, thanks to the explosive deaths that monsters suffer at your mighty hands. And it looks better than I expected it to, with image quality that suits the Switchs built-in 720p screen perfectly. When youre on a 65-inch 4K TV (running in Diablos maximum 960p resolution), only the character detail suffers a bit. The environments still look great! Connecting to other players for multiplayer  both in the same room with local play and online  was a breeze. And though we tried like hell to bring Diablo 3s 60fps framerate to its knees on the Switch, it not only didnt break, it didnt even flinch. With four players setting off crazy special attacks amidst dozens of monsters onscreen, Diablo 3 on Switch stayed buttery smooth. Even the couple of networking hiccups we encountered couldnt stop us. The action recovered a few seconds later and we got right back to having fun. Battery life in handheld mode, meanwhile, falls right in line with a typical big-budget Switch release, with roughly two-and-a-half to three hours of playtime. If youve never played Blizzards legendary loot-grinder, the Eternal Collection on Switch lives up to its name; youll find no shortage of content and characters to fill dozens of hours. And, by the way, youre in for a treat. But even if youre like me and the Switch is your third Diablo 3 platform, I still heartily endorse it because, quite simply, this is a complete and polished Diablo package that you can play anywhere from Heaven to Hell and everywhere in-between.", "date": "Oct. 31, 2018,"}
