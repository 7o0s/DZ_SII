But through po-faced monologues, intense eye-acting and gung-ho theatrics, Hunter Killer remains resolutely serious, and misses the opportunity to have a little fun in among the action. Based on the 2012 novel Firing Point by Don Keith and George Wallace, Hunter Killer centres on a mission commandeered by US submarine Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to rescue the Russian president, held hostage by his own Defence Minister Dmitri Durov (Mikhail Gorevoy) on Russian soil. Aiding the central mission are a group of Navy Seals on the ground led by Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens), and National Security Agency senior analyst Jayne Norquist (Linda Cardellini), Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common), and Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) at the Department of Defence back in the USA. Hunter Killer spends most of its time flitting between the three American groups, giving only a cursory glance toward the Russians, who are mostly shorthanded as evil thanks to Gorevoys scarred, reddened face. That is, however, until Commander of a Russian submarine Captain Sergei Andropov (the late Michael Nyqvist) inadvertently joins the mission, and the Americans and Russians have to learn to work together in a sort of uneasy truce primarily dictated by intense eye contact between Nyqvist and Butler and vague hand gestures that serve as expert submarine navigation. Its unintentionally funny in its sincerity. Its not all a tonal misfire. Despite the fact his character gets a ridiculously on-the-nose Save The Cat moment early on in proceedings, Butler makes the wearied, gruff sub captain who has Seen Some Stuff his own, and carries much of the silliness on his shoulders by committing wholeheartedly to it. He leads some great moments of genuine tension in the sub itself, too, especially during a sequence where he and Byqvists Andropov must navigate through Russian waters peppered with naval mines and devices tripped by sound. The underwater stuff, in general, is great. Theres a real sense of thundering impact whenever torpedoes make contact, and the interiors of the subs look real and lived in, full of knockabout rituals that will inevitably be destroyed. This is where Hunter Killer shines; in a PlayStation game being interrupted by a collision, in the powerful spurt of a broken pipe, in a wrench that almost hits the floor before being caught at the last second. Stephens and his Navy Seals team are also very endearing and add a rough, knockabout charm to the otherwise sincere proceedings. Cardellini is far too good for the material but does a lot with a role that could have been sleepwalked through, and though Im not sure what Oldman is doing in this movie, he brings the requisite authoritarian angry guy vibe to heighten the stakes. Despite the good stuff, though, Hunter Killer doesnt ever really justify its existence. Conceived in 2011, viewing it through any other lens than todays political climate is impossible. Is it a gung-ho patriotic action movie in the vein of that other Butler vehicle, Olympus has Fallen? Is it a morality tale? Or does it simply reflect the quip spouted by Beamon: I dont know sh*t about politics? Without that sense of fun, it falls through the gaps of all of these.", "date": "Oct. 25, 2018,"}
