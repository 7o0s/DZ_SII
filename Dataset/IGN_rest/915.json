These often bulky and expensive accessories arent for everyone, and only truly diehard racing fans will get any proper use out of them. With the new generation of gaming consoles now out in the market, manufacturers are scrambling to release new racing wheels that work properly with these powerful new machines. The first to make their mark on the PS4 are Thrustmaster, whove released the hefty T300 RS racing wheel, which is the first racing wheel that is compatible with the PS4 and officially licensed by Sony. Build quality & Design When I said racing wheels are bulky, I wasnt kidding  the Thrustmaster T300 RS is certainly no exception, and youre going to have a bit of fun when you unbox this beast. Theres a little bit of assembly required, but its easy enough to get through without much hassle. The steering wheel clamps down and screws onto the base in a few seconds, while a desk mount attaches to the bottom so that you can secure the Thrustmaster T300 RS to a table or desk. Id dare anyone to try and use this on their lap  the Thrustmaster T300 RS is meant to be secure to a table or desk, and trying to use it any other way will probably lead to some serious injury once its turned on. Its here that you sort of hit your first snag  the Thrustmaster T300 RS is something that sort of needs its own permanent home, rather than being constantly mounted and removed from a desk or table. You also have to take into account the height of the surface youre installing the Thrustmaster T300 RS on  a coffee table may be too low, while an office desk may be the right height, but not be near your console. Also in the box is a pedal board with two adjustable pedals. Diehard racing fans (and really only diehard fans) will want to have a third pedal for a clutch, but theyll have to make do without. In theory however, theres such a tiny library of PS4 compatible games at the moment that this isnt a deal breaker just yet. Out of the box the pedals were too cramped for my size 13 feet, so I had to unscrew and readjust them to a more accessible position. The pedals have a good feel to them, and can be registered with slight yet firm pressure from your feet. While the pedals themselves are metal and are quite durable, the actual pedal board is a disappointing plastic affair. The so-called ,arpet grips at the bottom of the unit performed miserably on the offices hardwood floors, causing the pedals to slip and slide around during gameplay. I finally had to prop the pedal board up against a wall in order to use it comfortably. Apart from the pedal board, the actual design and feel of the Thrustmaster T300 RS is quite sturdy. The rubberized steering wheel provides plenty of grip, and the metal paddle gear shifters are clicky and respond well during frantic racing moments. What makes the Thrustmaster T300 RS such a great gem is that is contains pretty much all the buttons youd see on a standard DualShock controller, so you can navigate through your PS4 interface using the wheel itself, and avoid flipping between a controller and the wheel. Setup Setting up the Thrustmaster T300 RS is as easy as it gets  screw in the steering wheel and base clamp, plug in the power and pedals, and power it up along with your PS4. As mentioned before, youre going to want to keep in mind where exactly youre setting up the Thrustmaster T300 RS, just so that you have a comfortable height to operate it without straining your arms. Once powered up, the wheel will rotate a few times to calibrate itself, and then return to a normal position. A major advantage of the Thrustmaster T300 RS is its backwards compatibility with the PS3  simply toggle the small switch on the lower left to PS3, and you can use the Thrustmaster T300 RS with Sonys previous console generation. You can also plug the Thrustmaster T300 RS into a PC if you prefer, which is an added bonus. Performance So how does the Thrustmaster T300 RS actually perform? Well given the limited library of games available on the PS4 that are currently compatible, I tested out the wheel on both PS4 and PS3 games to see how it would work. On the PS4 I checked out DriveClub, which worked only when I applied a new patch to the game. The force feedback on the Thrustmaster T300 RS is phenomenal, and really comes into play when you try and drive across different surfaces in the game. A similar (if slightly unwieldy) experience was had when playing Gran Turismo on the PS3  veering sharply around corners or across varied terrain caused the wheel to almost wrestle out of my hands. The difference in playing a racing game with a controller and with a steering wheel is like night and day, and I found that I gradually got better at each race once I had grown used to the way the Thrustmaster T300 RS felt in my hands and responded to my driving skills. Simply put, if you feel like youre constantly fighting against the Thrustmaster T300 RS in your game, then youre just not driving properly. Thrustmaster have also utilized brushless motors in the Thrustmaster T300 RS  these make for quieter operation and also result in less wear and tear over the years. Having said that, the Thrustmaster T300 RS can get a bit louder than a gentle hum, especially if youre having a marathon racing session for more than 30 minutes. The interior fans will kick in to keep the force feedback motors cool, and while this wont be an issue if youre playing with headphones or have your game volume turned up slightly high, its still something to keep in mind. Pros Excellent and realistic force feedbackSturdy build qualityCompatible with PS3 and PC Cons Inferior pedal board construction The Thrustmaster T300 RS is actually a fantastic racing wheel, and being one of the first wheels that is compatible with the PS4 makes it a must-have for any racing fans who want to burn some rubber on Sonys next-gen console. But there are a few things to keep in mind that might deter potential buyers from snatching this up just yet, including the somewhat inferior pedal board. If you really must get a racing wheel for your PS4 (and have a suitable library of racing games on your PS3), then the Thrustmaster T300 RS is the wheel of your dreams.", "date": "Dec. 22, 2014,"}
