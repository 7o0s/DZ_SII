While it leaves a hint of ambiguity to keep some mystery in the world of Fabletown, Cry Wolf ties a ribbon around the entire series in expert fashion. It pays special attention to rewarding those of us whove kept note of minor details, characters, and events since Episode 1 last year. It embraces the series many storytelling genres, and left me going over specific scenes and actions in my head long into the night. This episode begins with a bang, with Bigby surrounded by the Crooked Man and his nightmarish posse. Cry Wolf is drenched in action, but instead of just titillating, the violence is there to allow us and Bigby to come to terms with our decisions from throughout the whole season. As I picked who to attack first in that initial brawl, or to focus on during an exhilarating car chase, I could feel the weight of every tense character relationship and tough decision I'd made since Episode 1 behind me. It all built smoothly up to this. The combination of frantic Quick Time Events and branching dialogue trees with legitimate consequences make the actual act of playing Wolf Among Us a more active experience than a simple choose-your-own adventure story. Cry Wolf also does an excellent job of letting us paint Bigby Wolf in whatever shade of gray we choose. Whether hes the righteous sheriff, fairytale monster, or something in between, Telltale empowers us to make this Bigby our Bigby, and by extension, this story is our story in a way that most adventure games can't manage. Most of the side characters, good, bad, and glamoured, get just enough time in Cry Wolf for a satisfying conclusion. Georgie, the Cooked Man, and Nerissa specifically get a welcome dose of added dimension. The only disappointment on this front comes from Snow White, or the lack thereof. Seeing as how shes been a major character and plot point since the beginning, having her relegated to a single, albeit meaty scene left me feeling a bit disappointed. Episode 5 manages to cram many different storytelling genres into its 90-minute duration, but each of them gets enough breathing room to feel like Telltale had an important reason to include it. The horror of finally facing off against Bloody Mary, the magic of watching Bigby fall back on his fairytale roots, the drama of having your choices judged by the citizens of Fabletown, and the overall air of noir thats hovered over the series since its opening credits all jive together wonderfully. This final episode, especially the final scene, leaves a much-appreciated ambiguity over the entire series. Its tough to talk about while remaining vague, but lets just say that many of Wolfs noir influences have never been more apparent. Unlike the Season 1 finale of The Walking Dead, Wolf leaves a lot of smart, intriguing questions on the table, and its up to perceptive players to fill in the gap. And unlike the wheel-spinning of Episode 4, every scene in the finale feels necessary, personal, and ultimately rewarding. When I finally made one of the series most agonizing decisions, seeing the reactions of my fellow Fables brought me back to those powerful waning moments at the end of The Walking Dead. Your actions can lead to a handful of very different endings, in both what's on the screen, as well as how you interpret those events. The central events remain unchanged, but characters can live or die, and mysteries can remain opened or closed depending on what kind of a character you want to be. Going back and seeing just how different things can play out made me appreciate Telltale's storytelling all the more. Pros Fantastic final sceneFulfilling payoffBrutal actionHigh-stakes choices Cons Snow White's underused The Wolf Among Us Episode 5: Cry Wolf is a wonderful cap to Telltales season. It made me not only want to replay the episode to see various outcomes, but the entire series to see if I had missed any clues planted early on. The writing is great, the action is satisfying, and living with the consequences of my decisions is fantastically powerful. Simply put, The Wolf Among Us finale provides some of the finest storytelling Ive played in a long time.", "date": "July 8, 2014,"}
