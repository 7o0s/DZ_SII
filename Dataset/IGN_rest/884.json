Nothing about it screams cut-rate productionquite the opposite in some respects. It has distinctive style, sleek leather straps, and some nice face options. Asus' debut wearable has the same issues other Android Wear devices have with the UI and battery life, but it delivers a quality experience for less without huge sacrifices. Square-screened Android watches have tended towards plastic and modern designs, making little effort to disguise their smart nature. The ZenWatch, by comparison, is significantly more stylish, with something of a retro, classic allure. It's not as ultra-minimal as the Moto 360, but the rounded rectangular shape makes a strong yet subtle effort to look attractive and fit inconspicuously with nearly any kind of attire. The 1.63-inch AMOLED touch display has its corners smoothed out, and is housed near-center within the larger body face. At a glance, it's a lot of bezel for a screen of this size, with large pockets of space above and below the screen. If you look ever so closely, you can make out a tiny pattern there, with hundreds of grey sunray-like lines protruding from the screen out to the borders. And the recessed rose gold middle area on the body provides a nice accent against the rest of the stainless steel. Like the Moto 360, the ZenWatch has a leather strap, but this one tapers in slightly from the lug and looks thinner on the wrist. And whereas Motorola's leather feels a bit less slaved over, for better or for worse, the ZenWatch strap is polished and has stitching running down both sides. The watch ships with a tan strap; the attractive dark brown one seen below is offered separately. It connects with a clasp emblazoned with the Asus logo, rather than a typical bucklethat makes for easy-on, easy-off wear, but it also adds a small bit of bulk and can get snagged on your clothes. The metal also scratches easily. However, you can easily swap in a standard 22mm watchstrap from any maker, and the Asus strap has tiny release levers that let you pull it off in a heartbeat. My only recurring issue with the clasp is that with the screen off, it's difficult to tell which way is up on the watch, so I'd have to tap the screen or look at the back to figure out positioning. On my large wrist, the ZenWatch is a perfect fitbut the body is very tall, especially with the lugs included, and I can see it being cumbersome or even uncomfortable for someone with smaller forearms. That's the biggest issue the ZenWatch presents: there's so much bezel around the screen itself that the body is larger than expected for the size of the display, and it could well be too much for some. Luckily, the display itself looks sharp, although at 320x320 and 278ppi, this smartwatch doesn't deliver as crisp of an image as you'd find on any current flagship phone that it might be paired with. While the OS is largely stock Android Wear, you'll find a handful of slick custom watch faces provided by Asus. Many contrast with the classic styling to deliver a more contemporary, modern feel, but some of the pairings are quite nicelike the bold, split orange and grey face above. And I found the watch solidly responsive at triggering the screen when I lifted my arm, even more so than the Moto 360. Performance here is solid and mostly snappy, as on other Android Wear device. That's largely because they're all running very similar internal hardware: a Snapdragon 400 processor with 512MB RAM (also 4GB internal storage for saving local media, if desired). Although the operating system on the whole is familiar, Asus has made a couple of software and hardware tweaks. My favorite is the way the always-on screen option dims the image to a minimal black-and-white version of the face when you're not actively using it. That way, you can always catch the time without raising your wrist or tapping the screen, and it doesn't eat up as much battery. You can also cover the ZenWatch with your hand to mute a call or alarm, or have the watch alert you when the phone is no longer paired. Elsewhere, Asus shakes up typical smartwatch design by putting the heart rate sensor within the front bezel, so you'll have to place your fingers beneath the screen to take a reading. That's odd, and it's probably the reason why the ZenWatch has such a large body, which doesn't seem like the best trade-off. It works solidly, however, and the body is IP55-certified waterproofalthough with a leather band and stainless steel, this isn't exactly the device I'd wear for serious workouts, even with built-in step tracking. With a 360mAh battery within, the ZenWatch's battery life is about the same as its contemporaries: most users will need to recharge it overnight. Most nights, it'd have 30-40% juice left by the time I went to sleep. However, I was able to stretch it to two waking days by turning off the always-on screen; it ran from 9am one day to midnight the next, at which point it had 5% life remaining and entered a battery-saver mode. But I wouldn't chance it being so close to drained if I were out and aboutand besides, I'd rather have the always-on screen and charge it nightly. Ultimately, what we have with the ZenWatch is a largely well-made device that still feels like it has limited purpose thanks to Android Wear. Getting notifications from a paired phone on your wrist is very handy, and having swappable watch faces is a huge perk, especially with third-party options now available. But getting around the interface is still a clumsy, cumbersome experience filled with loads of swipes and some awkward fumbling around to find apps and commands. While I can speak into the watch to search or pull up commands with Google Now, it still feels like more of a fun party trick than a really beneficial addition to my life. I'd almost always rather pull out the phone for such needs: I'll get a fuller, more attractive view of whatever I'm looking for, and be able to do a lot more with it. In many cases, you'll be sending a command to your phone anyway to complete a task. Android Wear is adequate in its relative youth, but still has plenty of room to grow to make its devices feel like more than very basicalbeit attractivecompanions. Pros Attractive stylingDiverse facesLower price Cons Large bodyAndroid Wear is limited There's a lot to like about the Asus ZenWatch. The classic styling makes it a classy, discreet wearable, the watch faces are diverse and eye-catching, and it's comparable in performance and functionality to most of its pricier counterparts. Size might be an issue for anyone with skinny wrists, though, since the extended bezel makes the body quite tall; also, Android Wear is still a simple and unrefined OS experience. Still, the ZenWatch remains a very good option in the current smartwatch market.", "date": "Feb. 5, 2015,"}
