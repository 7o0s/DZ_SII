Heres what we said about that game in 2014: Surprisingly, Hyrule Warriors does a good job of tying together the combat of Dynasty Warriors and the revered characters and lore of the Legend of Zelda series in a way that makes me feel powerful in a world I love. Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. Its just a shame you cant share the action with a friend without significant slowdown. Read the original Hyrule Warriors review here. Most of this still holds true for Hyrule Warriors Legends, but the shoddy performance of this port makes it a lot less desireable, especially if you dont have a New 3DS. If you own a 3DS or a 2DS, read our Hyrule Warriors Legends review here. Simply put, this isnt a good-looking New 3DS game. The action runs smoothly on the stronger New 3DS hardware, which is nice, but it has lots of dull, muddy textures, very few effects, and noticeable pop-in. Turning on 3D degrades performance considerably - character animations become incredibly choppy as the system struggles to to keep up. Its impact was noticeable enough that I never wanted to try it again. Technical failings like these suck the wind out of a game that, otherwise, is brimming with fanservice for Zelda fans. Take the epic scale of the first boss fight with Dodongo. Rather than charge through the wall with an effective explosion, the barricade simply vanishes on contact, resulting in a cheap-looking setup for a big moment that feels incomplete. Its a brief but jarring example of how slipshod this port can feel at times, and even ignoring that, Dodongo and the rest of the bosses look equally lame thanks to hideously low-resolution textures. Rather than make use of the 3DSs graphics capability to make textures that look good at lower resolution, this port simply scales down the Wii U textures until theyre a blurry mess. Even a lot of the menus look bad because of horribly smudged or blurry art. The sad thing is that these issues spoil a few smart changes that make this mindless action game a much better experience on a handheld. A quick-swap feature lets you instantly switch characters mid-battle, and you can even direct fellow soldiers like Zelda and Impa on the map using the touch screen. This change has a major impact on how you control the flow of battle: it goes from a frantic dash from place to place to a much more strategic flow. You can now spread out your units and switch your attention to skirmishes that need immediate action when appropriate. Legends also introduces Owl Statues that can be activated with a handy Ocarina item, which helps you teleport quickly around the map. I felt more well-equipped to handle waves of foes that had given me trouble in the Wii U version. Also on the bright side, it was the many layers of Zelda fanservice that managed to keep my attention for Hyrule Warriors 10-hour campaign the first time around, and Legends adds to that with five new characters on top of the already-packed roster, for a total of 24 warriors, including the ones previously released as DLC. New characters Toon Link, Tetra, and King Daphnes each introduce fresh and distinct movesets while bringing the criminally under-represented cast of Wind Waker into the fold. Skull Kids playful fighting style and Ocarina sound effects make lots of nods to his debut in Majoras Mask, while Linkle (a female version of Link) wields a pair of crossbows and juggles opponents with acrobatic flair. As a bonus, if you own the Wii U version, buying the 3DS version gets you a code to unlock all of these five new characters there, too. Pros Fun charactersMap management Cons Choppy framerate in 3DMediocre artLame effects On the whole, Hyrule Warriors Legends is an ok experience for New 3DS owners. Despite adding five awesome characters and some smart control-swapping and fast-travel options, the performance problems and shabby-looking graphics make it difficult to appreciate all the fanservice thats packed in here. The poorly downgraded textures, hideous menus, and pop-in are all real eyesores. And stay away from 3D if you prefer a stable framerate.", "date": "March 23, 2016"}
