Its also the first in which Bruce Wayne (mine still sporting a missing chunk of ear suffered in the Season 1 finale) leaves Batmans cape and cowl at home the entire time. It serves the story just fine, however, because the quickened pace helps make the episode feel like the bottom of a ramping, two-episode drive towards whatever episode 5s climax ends up being. In other words, things start to pay off. On that note, I appreciated that What Ails You avoids the obvious cliffhanger ending that The Enemy Within has previously been guilty of. Instead, the finale puts another twist on the backstory of The Joker (still known here as John Doe), leaving me tantalized and compelled to see what happens next without feeling like I was being hoodwinked to return for the upcoming finale. It will be interesting to see if the series's writers can upend my expectations yet again. That said, some of the dumb things about this seasons setup  in which Bruce has had to infiltrate the multi-supervillain circle known as The Pact in order to destroy it from within, sans cape and cowl  have only gotten dumber by this, the fourth episode. Namely, how on Earth has the entire rogues gallery that Bruce is working with not figured out that hes Batman? He only fights exactly like the Caped Crusader, right in front of their eyes, pulling off moves that no normal person could ever hope to execute. It made me question their basic competency, which is never good for villains who should be presented as threatening. What Ails You is far from The Enemy Withins deepest episode, what with no Batsuit, no Jim Gordon, and no Catwoman. But what is focused on is interesting; Wallers motives become clear, resolving any conflict I had about whether or not to stay on her good side. Alfreds plot thread is also picked up again, and it will be interesting to see if the direction Telltale seems to be going with Tiffany Fox, Luciuss daughter, goes the way I think it will, or if the seriess writers can upend my expectations yet again. Meanwhile, certain problems are ongoing: Harley Quinns voice actor has not changed my negative opinion of her performance, and Im not sure how many more people can learn Bruces secret in this version of Batman without the suspension of disbelief being strained beyond repair. But I was quite satisfied as some of The Enemy Withins character arcs began to resolve toward their conclusions. Provided the finale of Telltales second Batman season can finish reasonably strong, the underwhelming second episode may prove to be a forgettable aberration, and Telltale will have once again managed to delight longtime Batman fans who have become accustomed to certain rules being unbreakable. What Ails You takes The Enemy Withins biggest and boldest step yet toward redefining the Jokers role in the Batman universe  should you choose to push him in that direction (which I did). Its the other characters whose final impacts on Bruce Wayne/Batmans life have yet to be determined.", "date": "Jan. 22, 2018,"}
