Gathering loot and upgrades through missions and activities with my Fireteam and then finally running the climactic Raid together was a blast. And every time I thought my friends and I were scraping the bottom of the content barrel, Destiny 2 teased us with more that was just a few Light levels away. From the opening moments, Destiny 2 delivers Dominus Ghaul, an excellent antagonist whose cruelty earns our fury by taking away everything that had been built up in Destiny and its expansions, including our Guardians Light. The campaign that follows is filled with brilliant cutscenes that give the cast an opportunity to show great emotional range, and you can hear the sadness and determination in their voices. Zavala (played by Lance Reddick) is unwavering in his plan to assault Ghaul, while Ikora (Gina Torres) seems distraught and near the point of giving up. That context gives both new and returning players a sensible reason to climb the Light-level based power ladder, whether for the first time or all over again. It kept me moving forward through fun missions set in eye-catching environments, including the exhilarating penultimate mission. Meanwhile, a soaring soundtrack backs pulse-pounding missions before shifting gears to evoke a tinge of sadness. The sound design is impeccable overall, with rewarding splashes of glimmer each time you open a chest or a silencing of the ambient noise when you aim down sights. Every adjustment is important, giving you the audio information you need instead of overwhelming you with everything at once. Bungie's laid out a wide range of activities.To challenge us on the way back to the top, Bungies laid out a wide range of avenues that include Public Events, PvP (player vs. player) in the Crucible, roaming world bosses, treasure chests, Lost Sectors, Adventure side-quests, patrols, planet-specific challenges, Flashpoints, Vanguard missions, Exotic Quests, Strikes (Destinys dungeons, basically), the Nightfall (a more elaborate take on Strikes), the lengthy campaign, and of course the Leviathan Raid (the biggest, most complex dungeon). Especially early on, theres so much to do its almost overwhelming. I found myself frequently getting distracted from the activity I embarked upon by something enticing, like a roaming boss or public event that promised some quick loot. Its a good problem to have, in that I never felt bored, but keep in mind these all seem targeted toward early Light level Guardians. While all of these battles will help get you to level 265, climbing to the max of 350 (the cap indicated in menu tips) is going to require tackling much tougher challenges like Leviathan, Nightfall, and Trials of the Nine  the endgame, in other words. The final encounter fizzled out a bit.The campaign was my first priority, since the story had hooked me so well. But, after around 10 hours of buildup, the final encounter fizzled out a bit. Due to some awkward super ability restrictions, I had to resort to finding a safe spot and shooting the ultimate enemy in the foot until he died. It seems as though the encounter was meant for projectile supers, but without any way of knowing that going in, I hadnt yet earned one that could do effective damage. It was an especially odd problem to have because Bungie has in the past shown that its Destiny 2 designers know how to make Strikes and Raid bosses interesting from a mechanical perspective, making the boss portion of the ending a surprising disappointment in what was an otherwise fantastic run. Thankfully, the excellent quests and more elaborate Strikes that followed the campaign come with much-improved boss encounters and an extra dose of quality lore. After the campaign ends you can still experience some new story events via additional Quests on each of the four planetoid locations in Destiny 2. These not only flesh out the intriguing new characters weve met there, but also do a good job of guiding you into new spots you may have missed and fun encounters built to be played with a three-person Fireteam. They also end with big rewards, like Exotic Quests and coveted Legendary items, making them a great way to continue your climb to max Light. Im hoping that Bungie doubles down on these with even more quests, either daily or weekly, as some left me wanting more. The four world maps do a fantastic job of setting the tone, too. Whether its the milky waterfalls of Nessus or the overgrown European Dead Zone, each offers a colorful and unique palette to explore as you acquire their plentiful loot. Adding to that, there are also items scattered throughout each destination offering snippets of lore about the location, and gear sets you can acquire by turning in tokens earned from the above activities in exchange for reputation at that destinations vendor. Bungie understandably wants to encourage everyone to take all this in, but goes a little too far by withholding the fast-moving Sparrow bikes for too long in order to force you to walk through it the first time (unless you get lucky and get one in a drop or pay for one via Bright Engrams). ~Stay Alert Out There~ - Cayde-6 The first Destiny is a strong first-person shooter built using expertise from Bungies days developing the Halo series, but subtle touches have made a big difference in Destiny 2 when it comes to making moment-to-moment combat more explosive and exciting. For example, popping an enemys shield with the right damage type causes it to hit its nearby allies with area-of-effect damage, and scoring a headshot on a Fallen treats you to a light show as its soul escapes its body; both are welcome bursts of validation, and Destiny 2 dishes out these types of visual and gameplay rewards left and right. Destiny 2 is full of game-changing items.While there arent a ton of different weapon types (as youd see in something like Borderlands 2), the constant gear drops and game-changing Exotic weapons and upgrades propel your power level higher, creating that feeling of growing strength and readiness to take on all challengers. When I equipped my Titan with the Actium War Rig Exotic chestpiece that automatically reloads a portion of the ammo in your assault rifle over time, it increased my damage output dramatically in a way that was more interesting than simply boosting the damage value on each bullet. Alternatively, The Rat King hand cannon grants you invisibility if you reload immediately after a kill. Destiny 2 is full of items like these, and earning them feels like an achievement because of how much they change your play. The gear chase has some rocky parts, though, because Destiny 2 doesnt take the time to explain how its upgrade and infusion systems work. Mods can be a bit confusing at first because you have to absorb a lot of obscure rules. For instance, if the mods are Legendary theyll add 5 attack power to your gear; however, if they dont have a mod attached you can still infuse a Rare weapon into a Legendary weapon and see a Light level increase. Sound confusing? Thats because it is! But once you get acquainted with the math its a little more comprehensible. If you dont want to have the same frustration at wasted progress that I did, I recommend checking our Destiny 2 wiki guide for tips on how to do it efficiently. Destiny 2s approach to the Shader system, which allows you to customize the colors of your various pieces of gear and weaponry, is also confusing and awkward because it encourages you to wait before applying any customization to your gear. Instead of a Shader color being something reusable which you unlock and then apply to whatever you like, theyre now consumables that must be individually earned as loot or purchased via the Eververse Trading Company. This feels at odds with Destiny 2s focus on striving to evolve your weapons and armor, and I found myself simply holding onto my shaders until I had enough to not worry about coloring a piece of gear only to replace it when a better item comes along minutes later. Also purchasable from the Eververse are The Bright Engrams, Destiny 2s version of a premium loot box. They can include items like cosmetically different ships, Sparrows (some of which have different stats), mods, weapon skins, exotic emotes, and more. It seems like a place where Bungie couldve gone wrong by prodding you to spend real money to get more, but so far that doesnt appear to be the case. You are given free Bright Engrams each time you fill up your experience bar after hitting character level 20, so you should still feel like theyre in plentiful supply even if you opt not to spend money. You can also break down Eververse items for dust that will allow you to purchase from a rotating inventory of similar items. Destiny 2s three character classes  Titan, Warlock, and Hunter  have all been simplified relative to Destiny. Each of their subclass trees now only include an upper or lower power path with a few grenade, jumping, and power options, but thats enough so that each still has distinct abilities and playstyles that work well together in traditional tank, support, and damage-dealer roles. Figuring out how to use subtle customizations and weapon pairings to make the most of your chosen build is still a rewarding puzzle to solve. For example, as a Titan you can build into an Arc damage type subclass which could then receive a boost from a Warlock thats using Arc projectiles, if you planned properly. The Hunters dodge seems underpowered in the early stages, though, since the other classes abilities have a clearer immediate benefit to the team. While the Titan starts with a shield that protects everyone and the Warlock has a healing or damage-buff ability, the Hunter is left with a relatively weak dodge move that reloads or recharges their melee but does nothing for the team. It isnt until they unlock a certain pair of Exotic boots that reload everyones ammo can fully contribute to the team in a way other than direct damage. 12", "date": "Sept. 17, 2017"}
