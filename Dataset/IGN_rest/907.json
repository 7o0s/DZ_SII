The whole time I was playing it, I couldnt help but think how much my 10-year-old self wouldve killed for a game like this. Its simple to pick up and play, its extremely fun in small doses, and yet it has a surprising amount of depth if you stick around. But you dont have to be an 80s kid or even a huge baseball fan in order to have fun playing Super Mega Baseball. The first thing I noticed is the humor. Without an MLB license to worry about, developer Metalhead Software had the freedom to make creative caricatures out of team mascots, players, umpires, and stadiums. I couldnt help but chuckle when Chugg Burbony was pitching to Harry Backman, while the umpire called balls and strikes with a silly Christian Bale era Batman voice. The controls are as intuitive and easy to understand as any baseball game Ive ever played. To swing the bat, you can simply press X, but I found it much easier to get the timing right when I pulled the right analog stick down to first draw the bat back, and then pushed it up to execute the swing. Playing defense is almost completely automatic, except for jumping, diving, and throwing. This drastically streamlines the entire flow of the game and keeps the frustration to a minimum. Once you get the hang of it all, its easy to adjust your Ego  essentially the difficulty level  from 0 (easy) all the way up to 99 (impossible), which made me feel like I was constantly pushing myself to improve my skills. Furthermore, when playing local multiplayer, each player can adjust their Ego independently, basically acting as a handicap that allows you to play with anybody, regardless of skill level. Character models, however, look like they came from a Wii Sports game, and their limited customization options mean you can expect to see slight variations of the same faces over and over. In fact, the presentation in general is a bit lackluster. The menus are generic, the cut scene animations are repetitive, and the music is grating, which makes it more suitable for short game sessions. Pros Good sense of humorLeveling systemStat tracking Cons No online modeLackluster presentation Super Mega Baseball is a blast to play in short bursts. The controls are simple and intuitive, and the difficulty can be adjusted to any skill level. There are no online game modes, but the season mode is surprisingly deep, with a leveling system and complete stat tracking that keep me coming back for more. The lackluster presentation, however, hinders the overall experience, making it difficult to play more than a few games per sitting.", "date": "Jan. 8, 2015,"}
