If youve seen anything from Pixelopus second game, youll have seen that idea in action: lead character Ash pausing his semi-open world platforming to daub living drawings across the sides of run-down buildings. Trees sprout and grow, 2D waterfalls pour from rooftops onto bobbing ponds, and stars sprinkle themselves across brick-backed skies like dropped glitter. Thing is, if you wanted to, you could cynically cover almost every wall in paintings of a few boring blades of grass and still be able to continue. But you wont. More likely, youll spend far longer than is technically required in each area, creating shimmering landscapes across the length of this shuttered city, and for no reason other than your own satisfaction. This is Concrete Genies crowning achievement. In a story sense, youre doing that because Ash  a budding, bullied artist  has somehow brought one of his cutesy monster drawings to life, received a magical paintbrush the size of a tennis racquet, and now must drive back the darkness creeping across his abandoned hometown, Denska. Its a charming (if slightly hackneyed) magical realist tale  Ashs travels have him cross paths with his bullies, a group seemingly proportioned by Tim Burton, each with their own personal problems, who shred his sketchbook and throw the pages to the wind. Collectible newspapers tell the story of Denska itself, a seaside town lost to urban decay, a big, explorable metaphor for Broken Window Theory. Watch the beginning of Concrete Genie in this video: But the real reason I kept scrawling across Denskas blackened walls was down to something far more positive: its so extremely satisfying to do so. Ashs magic-imbued paintings are made up of a collection of pre-existing sketches, earned by collecting those bully-scattered pages. These range from the obvious (trees, plants, water), to the more abstract (turquoise gusts of wind, the stuttering appearance of lightning), to the odd (gigantic fantasy mushrooms, genie-covered totem poles). Almost any blank wall can become your canvas, and painting is as simple as picking the sketch you want, then holding R2 while tilting the controller (marking this one of the only uses of Sixaxis motion control Ive ever actually enjoyed)  its something like willing pastel-hued neon signs into existence. In a lovely extra touch, every sketch comes with an associated musical effect as you paint it, as if youre adding layers to the soundtrack by bringing your latest masterpiece to life. It's remarkably easy to make something that looks genuinely good, no matter your real-life artistic ability. The whole process is immediately intuitive and, thanks to smart decisions about how those sketches layer onto and behind one another, its also remarkably easy to make something that looks genuinely good, no matter your real-life artistic ability. In a way, this is something like a little brother to Media Molecules Dreams  less complicated and less truly free, but just as able to leave you feeling legitimately proud at what youve created with just a few sweeps of the controller. The developers at pains to make clear that everything you create is there for good  numerous cutscenes, even late into the story, show your earliest creations still shimmering in the night air. Its a little thing, but the feeling that youre making indelible marks on the town is remarkably effective, only strengthening how much youll want to do a good job with every wall you choose to spruce up. Art for Arts Sake But, as Ive mentioned, Concrete Genie is built so that you dont have to do a good job. Your progress across Denska is measured by whether or not youve filled a few set walls you have to paint. For the most part, youll be required to slap your shifting artwork onto areas marked with hanging lights. Paint enough, and those lights begin shining. Make all the lights on a section of wall shine and its marked as completed. Complete all the walls in an area, and the next area will open. Mechanically, its simple and transparent. Paintings are never judged on their content  they just need to cover enough space. Im torn on how to feel about this. On the one hand, it lets those invested in the story skip through at their own pace without telling them they have to do something creative first. On the other, Id welcome the opportunity to turn painting into a true mechanic  perhaps using sketches like items in an inventory (a campfire sketch used to burn an obstacle, a rainstorm to put out the remains). But Concrete Genie never goes that far. As it is, the only real wrinkles are some colour-coded gates, which is where the genies come in. Genies are another act of creation  some of Ashs sketches are of furry monster bodies, or the tails, horns, and ears that attach to them. Put these together in specific locations and your creation springs to life as a genie wholl follow you from wall to wall, offering one of three given powers. Red genies can set fire to certain items, yellow genies can power electrical systems, and blue genies can blow certain objects across rooms. The puzzles are never more complicated than oh I need another new genie but, again, I found myself invested in making interesting designs, simply because they were such a pleasure to watch when animated  cowering from rain, huddling around a campfire for warmth, or begging me for another cartoon apple. Pleasing genies also earns you Super Paint, which essentially acts as a gorgeous firehose for the creeping purple darkness thats infested certain walls and needs to be cleaned away before any new artworks get started. All of this creativity is coupled with some extremely light stealth, as Ashs gang of bullies roam around town in search of him. Again, the challenge is meagre to non-existent  if theyre in your way, just scamper to a rooftop and use the D-pad to shout and draw them to a different area. Even the punishment for being caught is minimal  they just throw you in a dumpster and leave. Story concerns aside, the idea here seems to be to offer a change of pace in the open world rather than a true stumbling block for less-skilled players. Virtual Surreality Concrete Genie comes bundled with a VR Experience mode, which, just like the main campaign, comes with something of a twist. It begins exactly as youd expect  transferring painting control to two Move controllers and having you do the same thing youve most likely done for hours already (but now from a first-person perspective). But, quite suddenly, youre dumped into a new 3D environment, with some very new tools. The sketch that used to draw trees now grows trees, you can paint an aurora onto the skyline itself, and an adorable sprite companion, Splotch, giggles and messes with all your creations. Its over all too soon, but its another touch of magic. Oils and Water This seesaw between painting and stealth  Tactical Expressionist Action, if you will  makes up the bulk of Concrete Genie but, at a certain point, it sees fit to become an action game on top of all that (Pixelopus has been open about this since it began previewing Concrete Genie, but I wont spoil the story reasons for why it happens). Whatever the reasons, after that shift Ashs brush becomes a tool of destruction as much as creation. Its a bold move. Not many games see fit to become, well, a completely different kind of game a number of hours into their campaign. Sadly, its a move I admire for its courageousness more than I actively enjoy the resulting gameplay. Concrete Genies action ideas look good  repurposing your genies elemental powers into flashy attacks with different effects  but every fight feels like a slog because you have to chase enemies around town, chipping away at long health bars using one of three buttons. Amidst an experience built on artistic freedom, it feels distinctly limited by comparison. 'Paint skating' is the clearest connection to Pixelopus' main inspiration, Jet Set Radio. Thankfully, this combat section is a relatively small piece of Concrete Genie as a whole, and its best addition actually adds to the elements I really enjoy. Combat comes with the ability to hold L2 and paint skate around town  the clearest connection to Pixelopus main inspiration, Jet Set Radio. It feels fantastic (any open-world game without some kind of added skating mechanic will, from here on, be unsatisfactory to me), and instantly makes post-game free-roaming less of a traipse. And its a post-game Im looking forward to continuing with. Yes, there are gaps in my sketchbook  pages featuring genie parts arent marked on the map, making them a genuine treasure hunt  but Im more interested in the gaps on Denskas walls. The freedom to paint almost anywhere makes me want to fully cover the town in my own designs, then jump into the well-appointed photo mode to admire the sheer extent of my handiwork. Perhaps more than anything else, that urge is testament to just how satisfying the painting system is. Success in Concrete Genie comes easily  probably too easily for some  but that ease lets its best moments breathe. Its less about challenging you to get through traditional video game obstacles than it is about letting you challenge yourself to keep coming up with new and creative ideas, new designs, and new places to put them around this dilapidated city. At heart, its an exercise in the pleasure of the artistic process  just like Concrete Genies core idea, you never really have to paint, but I absolutely wanted to.", "date": "Oct. 8, 2019,"}
