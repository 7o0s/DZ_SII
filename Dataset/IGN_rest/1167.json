Just like in its first atmospheric puzzler, The Room, developer Fireproof Games shows off how to craft a singularly tactile experience that is only possible on a touchscreen tablet. But rather than merely coast on the first games successes, The Room Two expands, refines, and improves upon nearly everything that made the first so special. The most notable difference between the two Rooms comes in the rooms themselves. In the original, theyre little more than a creepy backdrop for its mostly self-contained puzzle boxes, where you search the nooks and crannies for solutions. The Room Two expands into more fully formed environments, and the stages serve as tableaus with their own personalities. Each has a well-defined theme, like the interior of an old ship. By moving pieces to complete a model vessel, you might unlock a chamber with a key that relates to a treasure chest on the other side of the room  which would then lead to another piece of the model ship. Like the first game, a lot of the puzzles rely on pattern recognition and fiddling with latches and switches to see how they can be manipulated. But by granting multiple interaction points scattered around the themed rooms, the task becomes much more satisfying and complex. I found that I could no longer simply toy with a box until I found some moving part I had missed. Instead, being stymied meant I probably had to check somewhere else. The puzzle boxes themselves are each a little less elaborate than the multi-layered ones in the original, but the shift to a larger space is a welcome one. The expanded scope can get overwhelming, as the later stages have so many parts and pieces that it was easy to forget where I saw a symbol or how the latest clue might fit. Sometimes I was paralyzed by choice, not even sure just which piece of the room to tackle first. A Hint system, which unlocks different tiers as time ticks by, helps this immensely by pointing in the right direction with increasing clarity. The first layer of hints were often just barely enough to put my thinking on the right track, letting me progress without compromising the satisfying sense of discovery. If only the story were so well thought-out. As far as I can tell, Fireproof has some detailed lore in mind for this series, but it was frustrating to only see it presented in such a disjointed fashion. Stages are littered with documents that outline pieces of the backstory, and the sheer number of red herrings made it difficult to find the connective tissue. I would have appreciated some kind of log to keep track of the notes Id found, so I could reference them to find connections. As it is, all the notes serve more as set dressing, creating an evocative mood but doing little to explain the central mysteries driving the ongoing plot. However, that evocative mood is also one of The Room Twos strongest points. Though I wished the creepy notes would give more context, they did certainly help build the world as an unnerving place to inhabit. I never felt manipulated, and it smartly avoided cheap tricks and jump scares. Still, there were certainly times when pulling back a latch or peering through an old eyepiece would put me on edge. Being able to see a hidden spiritual side of everyday objects, using a special lens, makes for some spooky moments. One macabre surprise in a room set in the aftermath of a seance, for instance, shifted the mood very severely in an instant. All of those improvements are wrapped around a core experience thats extremely tactile. The way the objects respond to your touch are subtle, but it feels like reaching into a window and manipulating real objects. The audio design reinforces this feeling beautifully, with small touches like the sounds of wood clacking, metal latches springing, and the clockwork mechanisms shifting inside as puzzles shift to form and reveal new ones. That gives the various rooms a nice ebb and flow of pacing, constantly rewarding a job well done with yet another piece that will need its own deciphering. Moving from puzzle to puzzle as new keys and artifacts present themselves gives exploring the rooms a dynamic feeling, building larger rewards until the conclusion of each stage. I was unfortunately a little disappointed that all of them end with roughly the same puzzle as their climax, even if it does ratchet up the difficulty. Pros Expansive puzzlesGreat pacingMoody atmosphereExemplary use of touchscreen Cons Vague story The Room Two is more ambitious than its acclaimed predecessor in almost every way, boasting more thoughtful environments and some truly creative puzzle solutions. If for no other reason than to experience how expertly it takes advantage of the platform, its well worth a visit.", "date": "Dec. 22, 2013,"}
