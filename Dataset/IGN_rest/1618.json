Kingdom Rush from Armor Games takes the increasingly stale tower defense genre and infuses it with some much-needed wit and good old-fashioned polish. The core experience is familiar  waves of enemies follow a pre-set path, and must be taken out by towers players purchase and place. The twist is that players can place ~Barracks~ towers that send footmen onto the field that will battle and slow down enemy creeps. By placing enemy-blocking barracks next to high-powered towers, players can turn the tide in their favor. Although Kingdom Rush only contains four base tower types, each can be upgraded down two separate paths, and can then be customized even further with special abilities. This gives players a surprising amount of versatility, and pays off for those that plan ahead. For example, the mage tower upgrades into the armor-weakening Sorcerer or the enemy-teleporting Arcane. The former is useful at the beginning of the enemy's path, the latter at the very end. Did we like it? Kingdom Rush is one of the best tower defense experiences I've had on a mobile device. Each stage is perfectly balanced to present a very stiff challenge while never feeling unfair. Packs of smaller enemies slip by you? Use more artillery. Flying enemies trip you up? Next time try more archers. It's a game that teaches you how to win, one level at a time It certainly helps that the entire thing looks and sounds fantastic. The detailed and stylish cartoony visuals set a distinct ~fantasy-comedy~ tone, reinforced by the game's sparse but spot-on voice acting. Every tower spouts one-liners when upgraded, leading to plenty of opportunities for sly pop-culture references. Should you buy it? Kingdom Rush is a criminally great package for just $2.99. After clearing the 12-mission campaign, players can return to each stage to complete special challenges, adding hours of replay. More importantly, Kingdom Rush is a game unafraid to ask ~why not?~ Proper boss battles? Secrets and Easter Eggs? 50+ achievements? A robust upgrades system? Kingdom Rush manages to have it all, while still maintaining a high-quality core of polished and well-balanced tower defense action.
