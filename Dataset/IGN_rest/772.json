Sunset is a meditative and unnerving experience, and one I wont forget quickly. As Angela, a university graduate from Baltimore, Sunset tasks you with completing dull chores in a single penthouse over a series of days. I found these repetitive - the intricacies of the chores are boiled down to the click of a button - but as I quickly learned, thats the point. The less I cared about folding clothes, the more I cared about the world around me. Sunset is set in a fictional South American city at the beginning of the 1970s. Theres a loud revolution going on outside its floor-to-ceiling windows, yet Angela is cocooned in her wealthy trappings, and sirens and gunfire are only ever heard from a distance. Being so removed from the action encourages a sense of isolation and helplessness, echoed in Angelas own inner monologues. Angela is a fascinating character to control. Intelligent and beautifully eloquent, shes an African American housekeeper living in a foreign country in the 70s, which essentially makes her (in her own words) invisible. Yet shes also passionately liberal, and as the uprising escalates into violence she finds these passions torn in two. Its wonderful to be able to inhabit a character with such complexity, and its to Tale of Tales credit that I felt as morally torn as she did. Her mysterious employer, a man known as Ortega, becomes a further obsession. As Angela cleans his expansive and sparsely decorated house - weve not quite reached the heights of 70s kitsch - she slowly develops a relationship with Ortega. Although I never met him during my 4 hour playthrough, notes exchanged and the subtle shift of items - a half-drunk bottle of whiskey next to a single glass, a rumpled bedsheet - cleverly encouraged a sense of intimacy. But as Angela discovers during her frequent visits to Ortegas world, he has a murky involvement with the military regime, and its here that Sunset offers you some important choices to make. Do you report his apparent wrongdoings to the rebellion? Or do you leave well enough alone? While these decisions may not alter the conclusion in an obvious way - you are told of repercussions, but you do not see them - I found them weighing on my conscience, which is testament to Tale for Tales storytelling technique. Sunsets structure doesnt always gel with this sense of escalating urgency, and I did eventually find constantly having to leave after Id finished my chores, only to immediately re-enter Ortegas house, tedious. It also distracted from the ebb and flow of the story; I had to do it so many times that I found myself rushing through the process, and occasionally confused the chronology in my head while doing so. But otherwise, I appreciated Sunsets glacial pace. Without the usual distractions of the interactive environment, I was left to muse on the world around me, which gave Sunset a great sense of place. And in such a quiet setting, when stuff did happen - a phone call, for example, or a window breaking - it came as a shock, and more importantly, an intrusion into the oasis. Once again, theres that feeling of helplessness.

Though its rigid mechanics occasionally disrupts the flow of the story, this is a rewarding game to be slowly savoured.", "date": "May 22, 2015,"}
