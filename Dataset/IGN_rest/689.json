But if you draw a foul just outside the 18-yard box youll be treated to a short cutscene where the referee will march the defensive wall back the regulation 10 yards, before putting down a line of vanishing spray. Its true to life, and the first couple of times its amusing to watch. Youll probably notice the marks remain for a short while after the kick is taken before fading away. And yet I couldnt help but wonder if the time taken to render all that might have been better spent elsewhere. With Konami hitting a series peak with PES 2016, its not a good year to be obsessing over minutiae like this, especially since it seems to come at the expense of EA Sports stepping back and considering the bigger picture. If last year was a closely fought contest in this long-running rivalry, this time theres clear daylight between the two. Its ironic that this should happen in a year when FIFA introduces the single most progressive feature of the two games. This years World Cup saw womens football reach a much wider audience than it ever has before, and its heartening to see 12 international womens teams represented here for the first time. And EA Sports hasnt simply reskinned the mens game; youll notice tangible differences when playing as women, while female players have been fully motion-captured and look authentic. Im not convinced its a particularly accurate simulation of the womens game  the quality of the football is akin to a Championship club between two teams with unusually high passing stats  but I probably enjoyed playing as the women more than the men because of these mechanical differences. Though it seems to take longer for strikers to get their shots away, and the best female players dont quite have the close control of the superstars of the mens game, these matches are often more dynamic, unpredictable, and exciting. The main caveat is that womens games seem far more prone to random glitches: I got a bug that rendered one pre-match tackling exercise uncompletable, while on three separate occasions my defensive line stayed rooted to the edge of the 18-yard box, leaving me with little support going forward. Part of the reason the womens game showcases FIFA at its best is because the player skill level isnt quite so high, and thus the occasional heavy touch or mistake means its easier to regain possession. In the mens game, you can go several in-game minutes without coming close to touching the ball. When youre in control, FIFA is a little snappier than it has been of late  it doesnt take as long to release a pass, and youre more likely to get a shot away before a defender steps in with a last-ditch challenge. And yet when you dont have the ball, it feels more than ever like a non-contact sport. If sliding tackles are a little overpowered in PES, theyre barely usable here; instead, youre best kiting attackers towards other defenders or the touchline, and hoping they either misplace a pass or take a heavy touch so you can step in with a standing tackle. Even Martin Tyler - whose commentary is more seamless and varied than ever this year - was moved to sympathise after one particularly lengthy period out of possession: It must be so frustrating - they just cant get the ball back. Touch, Mr. Tyler. Referees will blow up for the mildest of collisions, but thats understandable: otherwise youd never get a free-kick. Other changes are rather more superficial. Im sure the cameramen that patrol the sidelines are a new addition, or theyre certainly more prominent than I recall. This year, you can run towards them after scoring to prompt a new celebration.Andtheres a bizarre new feature that sees Tyler pass over to a hopelessly wooden Alan McInally, wholl report goals coming in from other matches. Its unclear whether these goals are drawn from online games being played simultaneously, or are simply invented as part of the illusion that youre taking part in a kind of interactive Sky Sports broadcast, but either way theyre an unnecessary distraction. And its a pity no one saw fit to take out Alan Smiths immersion-shattering reminders of his ability to recognise exactly where the ball entered the net. Meanwhile, the on-pitch irritations pile up. Its almost impossible to whip in a cross unless you drill it along the ground; any airborne balls invariably float into the box, sucked towards the heads of defenders like a tractor beam (unless youre the defending team, of course). Automated player selection seems more capricious than ever: I stared in disbelief as my winger ran to nod in a rare successful cross, only to leave it as control inexplicably switched to my striker five yards further back. If the new drilled pass seems to be a smart addition to your attacking arsenal, its a double-edged sword, since a regular pass will now trundle towards its intended target. Only the new no-touch dribble, which can be modified into a larger feint, is a total success, allowing you to commit rash defenders to a challenge before accelerating away. Shots are more dynamic and unpredictable, but its inordinately frustrating to patiently work an opening only for your striker to miss a presentable opportunity through random happenstance. Goalkeepers are excellent, though regular shots seem magnetically drawn to their gloves, and parries fall suspiciously often to the nearest defender. The finesse shot feels slightly overpowered to me, but its undoubtedly satisfying to work the space to feather a strike into the far corner. All these adjustments to animation, dribbling, and shooting lead to what EA is calling Moments of Magic, which feels like a misguided attempt to define something thatsbeen part of FIFA for years. is still capable of lifting me out of my chair in surprise, delight, and raw, unrestrained joy. I wouldnt say these moments are more frequent this time, but theyre still there, and heightened as ever by an intoxicating atmosphere. Besides the inclusion of women, if theres one area FIFA has PES licked its here. Its more than just glitz when you thunder in a strike from 25 yards off the underside of the bar and the crowd roars its approval. And when the supporters start bellowing their clubs anthem at the top of their lungs to celebrate a late, late equaliser, I defy any fan not to join in. It would be wrong, too, to underestimate the allure of FIFA Ultimate Team. Konamis MyClub has made giant strides this season, but FUT triumphs on polish and immediacy. The new FUT Draft feature condenses it beautifully: its a way to get into it without having to invest hours building your team. Here, youre given a random selection of players for each position, from which you should be able to assemble a world-beating squad. Youre then asked to play four increasingly challenging games, earning coin rewards and multipliers contingent on how well you performed and the difficulty level you chose. Win them all and youll earn gold and premium gold packs for your regular FUT squad. It might take a while to amass the 15,000 FIFA coins for the entry fee, though you can spend real money on FIFA Points to pay your way in. Microtransactions are rarely welcome in full-price retail games, though the cost of FIFA Points is reasonable, and the value of the reward is equivalent to what many would happily have spent on new FUT packs. Pros Womens footballFUT Draft modeThrilling no-touch dribbling Cons Defensive game is boringA few glitches and inconsistencies The complete package is as substantial as ever, and those whove acclimatised to FIFAs play style in recent years will likely consider it good enough. But in the face of much stronger competition, good enough might not actually be good enough. With its biggest rival matching its dynamism and beating it for fluidity and responsiveness, EA Sports has work to do if FIFA is to regain its title as king of the digital sport.", "date": "Sept. 22, 2015"}
