The huge variety of options for pulling off stealthy kills makes playing and replaying them a majorly satisfying draw. Beyond that, though, Agent 47 barely gets any new toys to play with and the story around it is just embarrassing on multiple levels. Unlike most games, which love to send you to outlandish and exotic places, the Hitman series works best when youre taking down targets in the most relatable, everyday environments possible. Everyone remembers Hitman: Blood Moneys classic clown-at-the-birthday-party mission, for example. Similarly, Hitman 2s mundane suburban Vermont and dense Mumbai slums missions are the standouts in this new set. The former has you doing a bit of home invasion in between wandering the quiet neighborhood, while the latters three objectives are so spread out that it really feels like youre wandering a packed city with a wealth of ways to accomplish your mission. By contrast, the finale takes place on a ludicrous Bond-meets-Eyes-Wide-Shut island of cultists, which borders on the comical. Its still a challenging and complex mission but isnt quite as memorable. Where Does He Get Those Wonderful Toys? Loud Hitman is not my personal brand of Hitman. It's there if explosions are your thing, though. Hitman 2s sandboxes are as full of gadgets and disguises as ever. And I mean exactly as full  there are only a handful of new weapons, and none of them are game-changers. Theres a dart gun that can be used to knock out targets at mid-range, which does make things a little more convenient, but my favorite are coins that can be used to distract or (more often in my case) lure a bad guy to where you want them to go so that you can take them out quietly, away from prying eyes. I preferred to use the good old-fashioned fiber wire for that, because doing so automatically transitions you straight to dragging the body, saving you a step and precious time as you look to hide the corpse. As far as Agent 47s other new tools go, I never felt the desire to use the fragmentation grenades or mines, probably because loud Hitman is not my personal brand of Hitman. Its there if explosions are your thing, though. And thats part of the point. Theres always a ton of room for experimentation because it is genuinely impossible to see and do everything a mission offers in one playthrough. Side stories tell little tales within the framework of the larger story...if you overhear their details. I really enjoyed these playable novellas, and some of them are even time-limited: if you dont trigger them quickly enough, the moment of opportunity passes and they expire. A highlight was when I impersonated the corpse in a cults funeral ritual and then sat up and stabbed my target in the neck as she paid her last respects. But it took a hell of a lot to get myself in that position to gloriously, violently succeed: I had to steal a ceremonial dagger, which required infiltration, which required multiple disguises, which required studying peoples routes and behaviors, and on and on. For better and for worse, playing Hitman 2 is like building a house of cards: glorious when its finished, but one wrong move or breath sends the whole thing tumbling down. Some other great moments from my adventures with 47: I stacked a good eight or nine bodies in a suburban backyard bush, poisoned a fumigation machine, sadistically triggered a killswitch connected to a nano-bomb in someones neck, yanked a guy off of a cliffs edge while hanging from said ledge a la Sam Fisher, strangled a slumlord with a measuring tape while posing as a tailor fitting her for a dress, stabbed an octogenarian Russian spy in the neck as he reached for his pack of cigarettes after meticulously dispatching of over a dozen of his guards to finally get to him, and...well, I could go on, but you get the point. Youll come away from Hitman 2 with plenty of memorable gameplay moments. I was quite fond of poisoning people in general, which is another classic 47 move. Ruthless drug lord expecting a world-famous tattoo artist to come to his home to fix an old bit of ink? Why not intercept him at the bar, poison his beer when he isnt looking, and then follow him into the bathroom to knock him out cold while he vomits? Helping to add to those moments are the new item drops, starting points, and other sandbox-altering perks you can unlock when you play the missions a certain way so that the next time you go back in, the replayability is both built-in and actively encouraged. Even the difficulty levels change the gameplay parameters by removing UI hints, upping NPC intelligence, etc. Patience Is a Virtue As smart as Hitman 2 usually is, it can sometimes be really stupid when the AI goes wonky. Like any good stealth game, Hitman 2 doesnt just ask for your patience  it demands it. The slightest failure can completely ruin your entire mission (or turn it into a big, loud shootout, which isnt really the point of this game) but smartly deployed autosaves and the ability to do a manual save anywhere mean you never lose too much progress unless youre on the highest difficulty, which limits you to one save per mission. It can still get frustrating to fail over and over, but you have to remember that there are so many choices in any given level that you can completely change your approach if something isnt working. When I wanted to pick off one specific guy in a room first but had no luck luring him over with a tossed coin without someone else noticing the kill, I simply went into an adjacent room, found a radio, and turned it on in order to distract the guy who was noticing my illicit shenanigans. Problem solved! There is always another way in this game. That said, Hitman 2, as smart as it usually is, can sometimes be really stupid when the AI goes wonky. In Vermont, I hid in the bathroom of a heavily guarded house, overflowed the sink, and then cleaned out a dozen or so dimwitted goons who just kept coming to investigate the distraction, one at a time. It was funny, but its hard to feel good about winning that way. What good is being a master assassin when your targets literally line up to be murdered? Then again, the opposite sensation arises when a murder youve been working up to for hours finally pays off: it feels fantastic. The final escapade took me three hours to pull off and it was totally worth it. I had to figure out how to clear entire rooms  watched over by cameras  in order to get an item I needed. I used a good half dozen disguises, maybe more. It took a lot of meticulous planning and some trial and error, but when it finally came together and I took down my target the sense of achievement was powerful. The capper is that last bit of tension added by the fact that you have to make it to one of several escape points after the final kill, which leads to some of my favorite moments. Some of those will be locked if you dont have the right key or disguise, making it an even more frantic escape when you havent planned ahead. If you have to get all the way back across the map to get to a way out that is open to you, getting out alive can be as tough as getting in. When a murder you've been working up to for hours finally pays off, it feels fantastic. Annoyingly, the storyline that ties Diana and Agent 47 into these missions is absurdly dumb. Case in point: an actual line of dialogue from the opening cinematic is, and I quote, Neither know that the man they hunt is 47s childhood friend... and unlike 47, he remembers everything! Its also poorly presented. Cutscenes are just narrated storyboards, and not especially good ones at that. This low-budget attempt to explore 47s backstory is as bad as the 2007 Hitman movie starring Timothy Olyphant, and all I wanted during these overly long, poorly written interludes was to get back to garroting some goons. Meanwhile, the Sniper Assassin mode returns with tons of customizable scenarios to further increase replayability, and Ghost multiplayer is brand new. Its a 1v1 competitve mode, but you and your rival exist in parallel realities, so you mostly cant interact with them unless you get the Ghost Coin, which you can throw into their reality to really throw a wrench into their plans. And while it is novel, its fast pace feels out of sync with the rest of Hitman 2s plodding, deliberate hunts. It just doesnt quite jell when youre running all over the map trying to beat your buddy to the target location (because once one of you takes down the marked target, the other person has just a few seconds to match the feat before a point is awarded to the instigator). Developer Io says well also see more of Hitmans excellent Elusive Target missions  time-limited scenarios where you have one chance (and one chance only) to take down your target  including one where well get to join countless TV and film characters by killing Sean Bean. Hitman 2 doesnt add much of note to the structure of its predecessor and thus feels more like Hitman 1.5 than a full-blown sequel. But thats not a bad thing. By offering more of the deepest, fullest stealth sandboxes in gaming in one single package rather than six episodic ones, it earns its keep. The inclusion of Hitman (2016) is a bonus for those that didnt catch the reboot initially. Heres hoping they put more effort into the plot next time.", "date": "Nov. 9, 2018,"}
