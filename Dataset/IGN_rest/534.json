The whole trilogy is a little uneven, but for the most part theyre all pretty good, especially since no other developer scratches this particular asymmetrical co-op puzzle itch quite like the We Were Here series. The latest, We Were Here Forever, is  to put it quite simply  an absolute glow-up. Its gorgeous, with fantastic art direction that takes you from the familiar castle interiors to surreal dreamscapes, a spooky abandoned village, and much, much more. There are significant barriers to overcome to get the most out of We Were Here Forever, not the least of which are having to buy two $18 copies so you can play with a like-minded friend (unfortunately its not as generous as Hazelight was with its co-op hits A Way Out and It Takes Two, which include a free friend pass.) But if youre able to hook in someone who loves escape rooms and asymmetrical puzzles as much as you do, youre both in for a co-op adventure the likes of which Ive rarely seen.We Were Here Forever places you and your buddy into the boots of two nameless explorers who, for untold reasons, find themselves locked inside series mainstay Castle Rock. There is an ongoing story connecting the We Were Here games together, but its not required knowledge to enjoy the self-contained plot of Forever, which itself is serviceable, but certainly not the reason anybody is here.We Were Here Forever, is  to put it quite simply  an absolute glow-up.Its the puzzles that are the star of the show, and the ways that they manage to test the teamwork, observational skills, and communication of you and your partner are in a league of their own. Id hate to even go into too much detail of individual examples or show too much of them out of fear of spoiling their solutions, but theres a wonderful mix of navigational puzzles, where one person has to guide the other through a section using information only they have; symbol-recognition puzzles that force both of you to describe obscure symbols to each other in order to fulfill some sort of shared goal; asymmetrical races against the clock; tricky logic puzzles; and more. The list just goes on and on, with enough content that it took me and my partner around 12 hours to complete them all. More often than not, youre split up from your partner and have no frame of reference for what it is theyre seeing. This process of not only figuring out the useful information in your area, but then also piecing together how it interacts with what theyre seeing is just so uniquely satisfying. Every small breakthrough was something we celebrated, and when we finally got through a whole puzzle and were reunited there was genuine elation every time. The puzzles are tough, but there's always a logic to them.Its worth mentioning too that having a good partner is a necessity, and your mileage with We Were Here Forever may vary immensely based upon who you play it with. There is random matchmaking available, but thats absolutely not the way to go here  Id highly recommend playing through it with a good friend. Teamwork like this requires patience, persistence, and keen observation skills. There are also a bunch of fun opportunities to horse around, playfully troll your partner, and sometimes even do some good ol fashioned sabotage for a quick laugh, and those moments help add some much needed levity to a story that takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously. Thats great with a friend, but getting stuck with a bad actor partner by luck of the draw would give them a lot of opportunities to be obnoxious.The puzzles are tough  theres no getting around that  but theres always a logic to them, and if you really hit a wall each person can call upon three hints per puzzle that each do a decent job of pushing you in the right direction. Even with those lifelines, though, expect to spend a good chunk of time bashing your head against the wall trying to figure out a solution. In a good way, I swear. Even the puzzles that we spent the longest amount of time trying to figure out had that eureka moment that made it all worth it. The world needs more games like We Were Here Forever. The cooperative-only puzzle landscape is largely untapped and full of potential, and We Were Here Forever is one of the best examples of why. Its puzzles rank up there with some of the cleverest and most satisfying Ive seen in a video game, and its decently lengthy 10 to 12-hour campaign ensures that by the time it reaches its memorable conclusion the requirement that each person buy their own copy doesnt feel like too much to ask. The way it requires clear communication between partners at all times means it doesnt lend itself well to online matchmaking, so I highly recommend bringing a puzzle-loving friend along for the ride. On that note, it wouldve been an even more irresistible deal if it came with a friend pass, but all things considered, We Were Here Forever is a monumental leap forward for a series that has been quietly but consistently creating some of the best co-op experiences around.", "date": "May 12, 2022,"}
