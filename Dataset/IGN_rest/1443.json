They go on for pages and pages, starting with some basic combos and eventually getting into some moves that require dozens of button presses and expert timing to pull off. Each has its place, and its entirely up to the player to figure out when the heck to use any of them. And yet, for all this fluidity and depth, Virtua Fighter 5 somehow only uses a mere three buttons (punch, kick, and block). Characters have multiple stances, hundreds of combo possibilities, counters, and throw breaks that, particularly in a multiplayer setting, combine into an incredibly compelling 3D fighting experience. With complexity, though, comes inaccessibility. Virtua Fighter 5 isnt one to hold the hand of its players, preferring to let them beat their heads against the brick wall of hyper-technical gameplay. At first, its intricacies are baffling and seemingly impenetrable, even after a fairly robust and lengthy training mode. But once youve begun to understand the systems in place, its depth begins to make itself known, allowing for one of the most complex and balanced fighters out there. Based more in reality than, say, Street Fighter IV and its fireball-obsessed brethren, Virtua Fighter 5s characters utilize very real fighting styles, from Brad Burns Muay Thai to Lei-Feis Shaolin Kung Fu. As such, the fighting is relatively based in reality. Theres no ridiculous air juggles or super moves here; its nothing but straight up fistfights. Dont expect flashiness -- bouts are decided by skill and technique. Of course, Virtua Fighter 5 first appeared in 2006, but Final Showdown has polished it to a shiny gem. Theres a brand new character in karate warrior Jean, a slew of balance tweaks, and pristine netcode for smooth online play. You wont have a better Virtua Fighter 5 experience outside of the arcade, making Final Showdown the definitive version of the fighter for the living room. CLOSING COMMENTS Virtua Fighter 5 is the fighting game fans fighter. There are no frills or a fancy art style to mask lesser gameplay. Its a brawler, pure and simple. However, the more you put into it, the more you practice, the more it gives back, giving it an immensely rewarding quality that can only be found in truly great competitive online games.
