One of the most important aspects of a good game is consistency, or consistent rules. If an object on screen hurts your character one moment and then heals your character in the next, this causes confusion -- and confusion rarely works to a game's advantage. Enter Zack Zero, a platformer with more than just inconsistency infesting its many jumps and mid-stage battles. With a horrid art style and even more repulsive voice acting, it's difficult to appreciate Zack Zero's rare clever moments. In one of the worst told stories to use the comic book style approach we meet Zack, a background-less hero in some future age. The evil Zulrog abducts Zack's lady and Zack needs to travel across an alien world to save her. The premise works well enough but the narration itself sounds like a script torn from the pages of a middle school English assignment. The voice actor performing the narration invokes winces with every line. Opening Level Luckily you only see these cutscenes once in a while. Platforming dominates Zack Zero's core components. Run from one end of the stage to the other, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies that prevent Zack's progress. The action plays out on a 2D plane, though Zack will often run into the foreground or background automatically, giving the stages an enjoyable sense of depth. Although the developers employ a few interesting tricks, like swiveling platforms and sinking steps, most of the raw ~game~ in Zack Zero offers little surprise. The catch (if you can call it that) with Zack Zero is Zack's suit, which can shift to three different elemental alignments outside of its regular mode. With the press of a button Zack can assume fire, ice, and rock powers that drain a power gauge. Each power has both platforming and combat functions though the majority of Zack's adventure only requires his regular form. The powers grow as you collect orbs littered throughout each stage, adding to the otherwise straightforward play. Rock mode, for example, allows Zack to move heavy objects and gives him a powerful area attack. Ice mode, alternatively, enables Zack to slow down environmental hazards, making difficult jumps easier. This elemental system does provide a few moments of fun in the midst of Zack Zero's hurricane of issues. Otherwise, you should expect little entertainment out of it thanks to the rampant inconsistency that confuses and frustrates. At the beginning, it's difficult to tell which platforms can support Zack and which serve as a backdrop. Later, some spaces that appear to offer a possible path block Zack with an invisible wall. These problems grow more obvious with time. Certain on-screen effects, including a gust of wind that pushes Zack, disappear altogether. The final boss has a shockwave attack that sends a blue ripple along the ground. At one point this ripple never emerged but still damaged Zack from some unseen realm. Lizards! Other inconsistences will cause Zack's outright death, including certain platform edges that can't be grabbed and others that can. Nothing cues an eye roll like leaping through the air for an edge and having Zack bump into it and fall into the nothingness below (which plays a death cinematic every time). At certain points those of you with a dark sense of humor might get a good laugh out of Zack Zero. During battles (i.e. slaughters) enemies will pour in from both sides and the foreground and background, annihilating our hero in seconds. You can survive with a bit of luck and some frantic jumping, but it fails to engage in an exciting yet fair way. Now on to the entirely broken side of things. About halfway through the adventure Zack Zero began to freeze in the same spot. This issue also appeared when fellow IGN Editor Colin Moriarty played Zack Zero last week. You can fix this repeated freeze by disconnecting from the PlayStation Network -- hardly ideal. Although, Zack Zero berates you with leaderboard information while you play, so maybe disconnecting from the PlayStation Network alleviates a small sliver of annoyance. CLOSING COMMENTS Zack Zero's elemental platforming and bright colors might grab your attention, but its inconsistent gameplay and embarrassing glitches will waste your time and money. Little redeeming value lies here, especially when you suffer through the poorly-written story and awful narration. Zack Zero deserves a slightly better score than its namesake -- but not by much. IGN RATINGS FOR ZACK ZERO Rating Description out of 10 Click here for ratings guide 2.5 Presentation Abysmal story and an ample supply of glitches. 5.5 Graphics Colorful. The actual stages look fine and the developers use some fun tricks to give Zack Zero the illusion of depth, but the comic book art looks terrible. 5.5 Sound Fitting, albeit repetitious, music. The narration here should embarrass any competent voice actor. 4.0 Gameplay A traditional run, jump, and attack setup. Zack Zero rarely does anything noteworthy. More often than not the inconsistent rules of play will prevent any fun from being had. 2.0 Lasting Appeal So, so little. Seriously: avoid purchasing this game. 4.0 OVERALL Bad (out of 10)", "date": "Feb. 3, 2012,"}
