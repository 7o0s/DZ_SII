First thought to be GameCube's first traditional RPG, the project has instead turned out a real-time action/RPG based on the concept of card battling. This is certainly not a bad thing, however. Lost Kingdoms is a refreshing change of pace in the current lineup of GCN software, delivering up an average RPG experience with only a few major flaws. Equally, though, it falls short in too many areas to really impress. In the end, its ho-hum gameplay, competent visuals, and notable two-player mode are worth a look for action/RPG fans, but not a long-term commitment by the all-encompassing GameCube player.   Features  Non-traditional action/RPG based on card battling Dramatic storyline drives single-player experience Use only your wits and a deck of cards to battle evil monsters Collect, arrange, and manage your card deck Draw upon the power of fire, water, wood, and earth Fight by summoning, sending a beast to fight independently of you, or temporarily morphing Travel through an expansive 3D world to visit diverse locations Gain experience for each of your cards and upgrade them Trade, buy, and sell cards at a shop Dark, realistic style and theme One and two-player Dolby Surround sound support    Gameplay Lost Kingdoms takes off around the premise that a mysterious black mist has returned and is sweeping the lands, killing men and women and destroying towns in its path as it once did many years before. The only thing that stopped it before was the power of a magical card. In one of the kingdoms, Princess Katia races through the castle in search of an answer to this terrible news. She discovers she has the power to wield these same magical cards that stopped the evil mist long ago. Knowing many people's lives depend on her, she sets out immediately to fight back against the evil.   The storyline, however, is hardly something to write home about. It's rather generic, and only real purpose it serves is to send Katia to new areas on the map. She chases after her father the king who is also searching for answers -- a convenient excuse to fight battles in new areas. With no real character development and a lack of any true drama, the core gameplay is solely left to create a compelling single-player experience.   The way the game works is actually relatively simple to grasp, and certainly inspired by real-life card games Magic: The Gathering and Spellfire. As Katia, you must use magical cards alone to battle -- weapons or hand-to-hand combat simply don't exist. So, as you progress through the game you will collect new cards to add to your deck. At its maximum, your deck can only be composed of 30 cards. This is one area where the strategy of Lost Kingdoms is apparent. If you fail to create a competent deck, you're going to get tromped on in later levels. How does the player know what makes a good deck? A lot of this is up to experience, but there are a few rules to play by.   Battles take place in real-time with the deck constantly shuffling cards onto your four face buttons as you use them. You can't control how your deck is shuffled, so there's some unpredictability, but with four cards to choose from you'll usually be okay if your deck is respectable. The catch is, every time you use a card it will cost you some magic points. Your supply is very limited and can be refilled by picking up these rune stones that fall from your enemies as you strike at them. This adds another layer of strategy, as you may have to dive into the middle of three evil baddies just to pick up a rune stone so you can continue to fight.   You can zoom the camera far out to get a look at the world.  The way you fight is fairly diverse, too. There are over 100 different creatures to call upon, each with their own battle style. A summon creature will only appear once and deal damage at that time, and then the card is used up. This is in contrast to the independent type, which lets Katia send orcs and other creatures out to fight on their own as you use her for more attacks. You can never strike another enemy with Katia directly. The closest thing to it is when you use a card that has Katia quickly morph into a creature and strike with them. It wears off immediately, though, so you don't take on any new speed abilities or any other abilities since your form returns to normal. The power and effectiveness of each attack varies widely, and since it costs you magic points this is yet another element of strategy you'll need to consider. Finally, it's important to note that each card has an element type: fire, water, wood, earth, or neutral. This parallels creature types, so countering a fire enemy with water produces a much more devastating effect. With neutral enemies, you'll have to simply rely on experience.      For the most part, this is the bulk of the gameplay experience. As Katia traverses the land, visiting completely new environments, you are forced to take part in many random battles. In some levels you'll experience brief puzzle elements, such as tossing switches, and boss battles, but for the most part it feels very shallow. It's a formula that the design follows. The player gets to a new level, explores, and battles randomly spawn along the way with a few puzzle elements and major events to carve out a path. Even worse, you can only use your deck once per mission. You have thirty cards at your disposal, and chances are you're going to run out the first time you play the level. This forces players into trial and error gameplay. You might have to backtrack to do something earlier in the level, and this forces you to waste cards. You can escape battles, but again, it costs you a card each time. The only leeway you have is that you can refresh your deck (and health) at a save point with any cards you found along the way. There are also fairies floating around the levels, which can heal and refresh a used card at a time, but even these can turn into a random battle as you chase them. In the end, these efforts to balance using up cards permanently on each mission, just don't work out. Your only hope is often to restart the mission where you deck will be fully useable and map out a better plan.   All this said, Lost Kingdoms really isn't much of an RPG in the sense of something like Final Fantasy. The core gameplay and the center of available entertainment lie in forming and managing your deck of cards. All of the cards have their own profiles and concept art, making it really feel like you're collecting. You can create multiple decks and even give them names. This comes into play later when you want to indulge in Lost Kingdom's multiplayer mode, which, incidentally, is quite enjoyable. In this two-player mode, you can face off against a friend in up to five unique arenas. If you've both created your decks, you can load them up for battle. There are a decent amount of options, and there's even a fair game rule that you can switch, which will exclude any cards from your deck the other player doesn't have. It's an entertaining mode, and one that we would have certainly missed had From Software not included it, but it's doesn't drastically boost Lost Kingdom's play value.   After taking Katia through the motions for 8-10 hours you will end up at the final destination, which, for as difficult as it is, will probably boost your playtime with Lost Kingdoms. Experienced players will be able to run through the game in as little as five hours if they can avoid too much error. Some may argue this is far too short a time for an RPG, but let us remind you that it's not in the traditional sense. The storyline is only remotely present, and with a game design focused on random battles, you'll be happy to complete the game. Sure, more cards to collect and more levels wouldn't have hurt gameplay necessarily, but these elements certainly wouldn't have drastically improved it. Lost Kingdom's basic design, lack of depth and inventiveness sets the stage for a very average experience. It's not a bad or terrible game by any means. It's just ~okay.~  Graphics Lost Kingdoms is visually pretty clean and definitely superior to some GameCube titles we've seen in the past. The art style is dark and fits well within the fantasy realm. The large 3D environments are moderately textured and have a clean look to them. Users can control the camera, varying the level of zoom, so the crispness of the world will vary slightly according to that. Character models are relatively blocky and unimpressive as a whole. Get too many of them on the screen at once, and the framerate will stutter. Fortunately, it's pretty rare and won't interrupt gameplay.   Lost Kingdoms is all about managing your deck.  Overall, though, there's not much going on visually that will grab your attention. Like the gameplay, it's very average.   Sound There is no voiceover work in Lost Kingdoms. What the player experiences aurally is all sound effects and music. Battle music is nearly always the same, so the tune gets old very quickly. You may even grow to dislike it if you begin to dread so many random battles. There's some decent overworld music, but there's very little that's memorable enough to hum. Equally, sound effects are very standard and none too impressive. Lost Kingdoms supports Dolby Surround, but the effect is hardly noticeable. It's nice to see From Software at least used the available tools, though. I was relatively excited by the basic ideas surrounding Lost Kingdoms when I first heard about the project. I thought, finally an RPG is on its way to GameCube. When I first played it at Space World 2001, I was slightly less impressed. Tossing cards around in real-time was a novel idea, but I suspected it would get old quick. Sure enough, now that I've played the game thoroughly, this is the case.Lost Kingdoms has some concepts you can respect, and it's not sloppily pieced together. From Software has all the ideas in place. The problem is that in its execution there are some balance issues. The lack of a deep storyline and inventive gameplay only hurts more.Lost Kingdoms is definitely worth the rental for RPG starved GameCube fans. There's enough to explore to keep you entertained for a few hours, at least. As a buy, however, you'd have to really love the idea of creating decks and replaying the game to really make it worth the purchase.", "date": "Jun 4, 2002"}
