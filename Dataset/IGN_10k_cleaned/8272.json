AU Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/23/stalker-au-review", "text": "We've heard S.T.A.L.K.E.R. being likened to Deus Ex and System Shock 2 (hell, we even said as much in its early days), but after finally playing the game we have to say that's a clumsy comparison. Where those classic titles focused on multiple approaches to a relatively linear storyline, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is almost the polar opposite. The storyline is anything but linear, with dozens of side quests and a main narrative that branches out into seven different endings. For every situation found on these quests, there's really only one solution - blasting away anything that stands between you and your goal. As a result, at its glowing radioactive heart S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is still far more of a shooter than a role player. Walk into the decrepit ghost town of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. knowing this, and you won't be disappointed.   We're sure you already know about the story, but for those who've been hiding in fallout shelters since April 1986, waiting for Chernobyl's deadly clouds to hit, here's the main thrust. Set in the near future, you play as the Marked One, a modern day Indiana Jones packing a radiation suit and AK rather than a Fedora and bullwhip.     See what our US friends thought of the game.   After being flung from a truck full of decomposing corpses, you awaken in an underground bunker-come-shop within the Zone. This Zone is a twisted version of the Chernobyl region, damaged even further by a chain of strange events that occurred twenty years after the original disaster.   You awaken with a nasty case of amnesia and a mysterious message on your PDA: ~Kill Strelok~. These words serve as the motivation for the next fifteen hours of your gaming life. Who the hell is Strelok, and why your PDA isn't his biggest fan, is unknown.    Armed with a pea-shooter, a flimsy flak jacket and a single clue about where to find a guy who knew a guy who used to work for the cousin of your target, you're on your way. As you emerge from the bunker, it's immediately apparent that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. feels unlike any shooter you've played before.    The very first thing you'll notice is that S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s world is big. Scratch that. It's f%!*&ing huge. RPG players, who earned their stripes playing Oblivion or Morrowind, are used to this scale. For those of us who've cut our teeth on Half-Life and Doom, the feeling of no longer being shoehorned down corridors (no matter how wide or pretty those corridors are) is a little overwhelming. Not to mention liberating.   The real Chernobyl isn't a ghost town; it's a ghost city. The developer has gone to great pains to replicate this eerie, abandoned place, visiting the real world location multiple times and taking thousands of photos. Every DNA-mutating photo shoot has paid off, resulting in the creepiest, yet at the same time realistic, game world we've ever seen.    We get the feeling this guy isn't here to welcome you to the Zone.  For such a big world, it's amazing how hand-crafted everything is. Never does it feel like the developers let an automatic level design tool plant a tree here, or construct a building there. Everything is considered and planned, with the result that this is a land that is always rewarding to explore. Considering there are no vehicles, you'll be spending a huge amount of time covering its ground. And you won't mind a bit.    The unsettling architecture results from a unique combination of the utilitarian, drab designs of the Communist regime, blended with twenty years of disuse and disrepair. Everything is falling to pieces, rusted, covered in weeds. It's also all open for exploration - if you can see an abandoned high-rise in the distance, you can get inside it to see what's lurking within.     Considering the graphics engine has been in development since the age of the phonograph, it holds up pretty well. Given that it pumps out so much detail, and is relatively demanding on PC hardware, the delay of the game is probably a good thing. If the game had arrived on schedule a few years ago, only NASA would have had the processing power to play it.    The engine shines in a couple of key areas, both crucial in shaping the game's atmosphere. It's got a huge draw distance, which leads to the palpable feeling that this is a big world. Lighting and shadowing are its other big strength. Everything in the game, from creatures to window frames to trees, casts a correct shadow across the landscape.    It's adept at handling outdoor areas, but the engine also excels at corridor-based Doomy environments. The scariest sections tend to take place in these claustrophobic areas, where there's no escape, and the lack of any natural light leads to dark, creature-friendly environs. And when we say scary, we mean it. This game makes F.E.A.R. as terrifying as The Wizard of Oz.    Unlike most games, the binoculars are actually very useful rather than a gimmick.  The game ran almost flawlessly with all settings maxed on our Core 2 Duo PC (overclocked to 3.3GHz), which is also equipped with a GeForce 8800GTX and 2GB of DDR2 800 memory. Others haven't been quite so lucky, with many people complaining of performance issues. It's interesting to note that even though it's quite an old engine, its one of the only ones around to support dual cores.    We've spent a long time harping on about the game's environment for one very good reason - it's the biggest feature of the game. Even if the world wasn't filled with several hundred quests, a complex AI system and a very disturbing storyline, we'd still have happily spent a few hours virtual sightseeing.    You'll have plenty of things to do though, as there's a huge array of quests to keep you busy. It could be retrieving a backpack, freeing a fellow Stalker or assassinating a random stranger, but missions generally involve killing something. To keep this interesting, there's a healthy range of rifles and pistols, most of which can be modified with scopes and bullet types. The bullet modelling is very accurate - crouching leads to less spread, and aiming down the iron sights is highly recommended. Even bullet drop is included. So even though you might be fighting a zombified Spetsnaz trooper or a mutant wolf, these weapon mechanics keep the game's feet grounded in a feeling of realism.    Novice Stalkers will find the combat brutal to begin with. You'll be taking on guys with shotguns and armour, armed only with a peashooter and knitted sweater. Staying back, using cover, and aiming for the head helps, but the game remains quite difficult throughout. It's a nice change from the increasing ease we're seeing with most shooters these days.    Wanted - gardeners with industrial strength whipper snippers.  It does get a little easier though, as you gain access to better kit. Picking up additional equipment is where S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is most like a traditional RPG. Food, med-packs, ammo, weapons, and armour make up the major categories of equipment that you'll be scavenging for. Various artefacts, created by weird anomalies that inhabit the Zone, are also waiting to be discovered. Most of these have beneficial properties if equipped; some make you more bullet-resistant, while others crank up your endurance.   Even when you're packing serious heat, the enemy AI does a great job of keeping itself alive - flanking, covering and being unpredictable are all in its bag of tricks. The AI even works on a team level. If a pack of dogs decides you'll make a nice dinner, shoot a few of them and watch the rest flee with their tails between their legs. And it's nice to see an AI system that can't see through bushes and trees.    The individual AI fits into the much vaunted A-Life system, which controls the distribution of AI entities across the entire world. These entities are broken down into certain packs and groups, keeping the world alive and active, even if you're not around to notice. Wipe out one group and another will move in to claim the region. Fighting clans will take each other on, even if you're nowhere near them. A-Life is a cool slogan to use in adverts, but does it actually work?    For the most part, yes. We frequently encountered fire-fights between rival groups, or the bloody corpses left after a particularly fierce off-screen battle. And the sight of a lone Stalker getting taken down by a pack of mutant dogs was almost as common as the daily sunsets. We even followed one group of experienced Stalkers as they patrolled an area, and watched them efficiently despatch every mutant in sight. In over ten hours of play, we saw the AI get confused just once - and then only for a few seconds.   Sadly, the touted ability of siding with various clans didn't really work. We found that even if we'd killed members of a clan, other members of the same clan wouldn't treat us any differently. And when helping other clans out, there was no obvious benefit.  Thankfully this hobbled clan system doesn't detract from the game, but it could have made a very big, very cool, difference if it had worked properly.   Welcome to the world of Chernobyl.  Despite what you might have heard elsewhere, the storyline in Stalker is great. It's definitely original (if you can forget the explosive amnesia bit), and it's spooky enough to fit in with the game's chilling environment. It's told mostly via your PDA, with a handful of clinical, cold characters adding to things. Blaze through the main quest and you'll reach one of the game's many endings in about twelve hours or so - not quite the thirty we were promised. However, take your time, as we have been, and the game can be much longer. The developers are claiming eighty hours to complete all quests, but we'd take that claim with a pinch of salt.    S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is first and foremost a single player epic, but that hasn't stopped the developer from throwing in a decent multiplayer game as well. It's not the most original offering, with the two main modes being deathmatch and team deathmatch, but the cluttered, dark environments make for some tense cat and mouse gameplay, as do the realistic weapons. A cash system, similar to CounterStrike's, encourages strategic players. It's not the kind of online game that will set the Net alight, but it's a decent distraction when the single player game gets too oppressive.    So far, and so very, very good. Now it's time for the ~But~ paragraph. You know the one - it's all been rosy in review-land so far, now it's time to say that this could have been a classic if only for the   And here it is: for all of its many, many years in development, there's still a feeling that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is unpolished, unfinished. The fundamentals are all there, but the icing on the cake is a little thin. There are bugs here and there, like missing trigger points and side quests that are impossible to solve. The PDA, which serves as your map to the world, appears to be as reliable as most sophisticated Ukrainian electronics. A little more variety in the side missions wouldn't have gone astray either. Surround sound is broken. The list goes on.    Thanks to a day night cycle, half your play time will be during the dark. Note to self - pick up night vision goggles next time we're at the Trader's store.  There's no single, huge, show-stopper of a problem, but this myriad of smaller glitches separate this game from the Half-Life's of the world. Not by much, mind you.    We still believe that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a true classic, regardless of its issues. It's so good that it's piqued our interest in the subject of Chernobyl. How many games have you played that inspired you to go out and watch documentaries about the game's subject matter? S.T.A.L.K.E.R. truly shakes up the shooter genre, making everything else feel like a treadmill in a shoebox. The open-ended nature of the game will do for the genre what GTA did for action games. If you approach this title with the right mindset - as a shooter with a healthy dose of exploration, and not an RPG with guns - you will be rewarded with one of the most immersive, free-form and downright creepy shooters ever made. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has prompted lots of discussion amongst the IGN team - let us know what you think of the game.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
