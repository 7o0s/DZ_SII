Though the game has really exploded with realism and in-your-face action recently with the super systems on the market, Electronic Arts hasn't forgotten the game's classic roots, as the company has produced a version of the series that fits the architecture of the Game Boy Advance hardware. The portable version developed by Budcat Creations is a reproduction of the design that hit the consoles during the Genesis and Super NES days. The result is a decent playing game of football, but lacks the advancements the series has made on the consoles. And the real kick in the spandex is its lack of link cable support for two players. In its current form it's the best football title available on a handheld even with its flaws...but it's also a great foundation for Madden NFL 2003. Features 32 NFL Teams All-Madden Team Exhibition and Season Modes Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  Anyone looking for a conversion of the game design on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube...step away from this game.  This isn't the football game you're looking for. The Game Boy Advance version of the Madden series is essentially a port of the last solid Super NES version of the series, tweaked a bit to mirror the current elements of the series on the gaming consoles. And even though the button layout is a little odd compared to the other console versions, the game looks and plays pretty darn nicely. The developers took the character assets and built the familiar slanted-camera game engine that uses the Game Boy Advance's background scaling abilities. With 22 players moving on the field at one time, the action stays acceptably smooth...though it's obvious that the processor's taking a hit since the action speeds up when fewer members are on-screen. Players are redrawn at different sizes so the game can accurately show a 3D perspective, but there's not a whole lot of tweening going on here -- players will ~pop~ from a small size to a big size with awkward animation, giving the game a general clunkiness in its motions. Which is a bit disappointing on a technical aspect, since the GBA offers larger cartridges than what was available during the 16-bit era...the developers could have used this to their advantage with more frames of animation. But then, this is a port we're talking about.  The GBA version's passing is very simple to learn, as the quarterback can pull up the receiver's button command with a simple tap of the A button. Hitting the appropriate button will send the ball flying into the direction of the receiver -- holding the button down is a bullet pass, a quick tap is a lob, just as past Madden games have done it...and it still works extremely well, even in handheld form. The running game isn't nearly as graceful, since it's difficult to portray all the smooth dodging motions in the sprite engine -- running the ball is a lot more forgiving on the console. Here, it's like trying to crash through a solid brick wall. If there isn't an opening, you can't really force your way through.  The game's real grace is its AI, keeping track of where everyone needs to go during each play in the game. It's not perfect by any means, but for a first-generation football game on the Game Boy Advance the developers kept the action pretty realistic. But there are similar oddities that plagued the Genesis and SNES games because of the sprite engines. The bobbling ball strangeness, for example...throw a pass to a covered receiver, and the ball may bounce around between each of the characters in the grouping; since there's very few animations drawn, the developers can't represent a ball bouncing uncontrollably from one person's hand to another, so it clumsily bobbles around until the AI says, ~Yep, you caught it~ or ~Nope, it's incomplete.~  EA didn't skimp on the cartridge, so head's up: we get a Season Mode that keeps track of the team standings throughout the 16 games. Stats are tracked per player during a game, but they're not saved to the cartridge...unfortunate as it is. Maybe next year we can get the programming team to compress the data so that more details can be recorded...but at least we get a battery.  But while the developers tried to give the game the same overall presentation of the console versions of Madden NFL 2002, the Game Boy Advance version just seems a bit left out in terms of energetic fluff. There's barely any speech during the action...Madden's off getting a hot dog somewhere, only coming back to comment, ~Man, I could hear their helmets collide from up here!~ Pat Summerall has more microphone time as usual, but he's only here to provide folks with the standard, ~First and 10~ call.  The developers brought over the same play selection engine from the console, but it doesn't make sense on the handheld since you're not trying to hide your plays from anyone...this is a single player cartridge, so it would have been a bit more convenient to highlight the specific play, instead of the ~press A, B, or R button~ style play selection.  And yeah, you read correctly...single player. The development team didn't get link cable support into this version, and it's definitely missed. A shame, too, since Madden 2001 and 2002 on the Game Boy Color managed to squeeze this function in. Sports games are always better against a human opponent, so let's see link cable support in the next iteration, shall we?    It would have been a darn shame if EA Sports skipped over the Game Boy Advance when bringing Madden NFL 2002, as it would have been a definite snub to the portable owners. But the company quietly released this version out the door with very little fanfare...this is usually a ploy from publishers who aren't really proud about the final product. But the game for GBA ended up a decent one. There's definite room for improvement, but it's a good starting point for next year's version. Start tweaking it now, boys...you've got ten months until next season.", "date": "Nov 29, 2001"}
