While it wasn't a huge seller, Spellbound's last effort, last year's Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive, was a critically acclaimed hit in the puzzle strategy genre. Now the German-based developer strikes again with a brain-teasing action/strategy game set against yet another great backdrop: the legend of Robin Hood.  Just in case you're not familiar with the legend of Robin Hood, Robin returns to jolly ol' England after slaughtering countless Saracens during the Crusades. Only problem is, when he returns to his manor, he finds that he has no home left. Nasty old Prince John has taken his family's land and displaced kind King Richard the Lion-Hearted, who is now languishing in an Austrian prison. Yes, I said Austria *shudder*. Seeing as how he now has no home and no king, Robin does what any kind-hearted rogue would -- he dons a pair of green tights, gathers a bunch of desperate and dirty men and robs Prince John's minions in order to raise enough cash to free Richard.  Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood features a storyline that stays true to the legend, and plays out quite nicely as well.  The game follows in the footsteps of games like Commandos and the earlier Spellbound developed Desperados, but adds a few neat twists to the squad-based puzzle strategy genre. Each of the characters in the game has their unique specialties that come in handy to complete each mission, whether it be the ability to block incoming arrow fire, throw an apple to distract the guards, or heal other members of your party with herbs. Other unique characters from the myth add to the atmosphere of the game as well as to the gameplay. For example, Robin can make guards fight amongst themselves by tossing a coin purse into a group of sentries, Will Scarlet can operate siege weapons and Friar Tuck is quite good at bonking guards on the head with his staff and knocking them unconscious without spilling blood.  Unlike Commandos and Desperados, Robin Hood features a much more open-ended mission system. You're not locked into a linear mission path, as most of the time you're given a choice of several missions of varying difficulty. This is one aspect of the game I really enjoyed. While it does get somewhat more difficult as you progress through the game, throughout the game you're presented with choices like going up against a well-trained army or a group of rookies guarding a caravan of gold. The rewards may be higher if you choose the more difficult mission, but the easier missions will give your band of Merry Men some much needed rest.  This brings up another unique and nifty part of Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood. One of the coolest additions that the game introduces to the genre is a bit of resource management. Between missions you'll spend your downtime in Sherwood, and you have to leave some of your men behind to play in the trees while you're out robbing the rich. Not only can your men rest to regain health, but they can train in melee or bow attacks, as well as produce items such as arrows, coin purses, nets and medicinal herbs. As you don't have unlimited items, this is a particularly important aspect of the game as you have to be sure to allocate people to the task of creating items that will be useful in future missions.      In addition to having an open-ended structure, the missions features a lot of different objectives, and it's usually not a matter of just killing all the bad guys to get the gold prize. Although unlike the Commandos series or Desperado where you were pretty much toast if you went head-on with your foes, you can go sword-to-sword with the enemy much easier in Robin Hood, and you don't have to go around tip-toeing everywhere. However, as a gentleman among thieves, Robin has a reputation to uphold, and if you take the direct approach too much, your reputation will fall and the people won't support your cause as much, translating into less Merry Men for Robin. This is where your brains come in handy as you figure out the best way to get through each level. Like Desperados, a convenient macro function lets you set up quick actions for your characters that will play out with a push of a button. This is especially handy when you're trying to control several characters at once to set up an elaborate trap for your enemies. One slight annoyance with trying to control multiple characters is that the main view windows seems to be on rollers, and it doesn't stop immediately when you take your mouse cursor off the edge of the screen, so you may move away from the area you wanted to stop on when you're trying to pull off an intricate plan. I also was disappointed that you could only see one enemy's line of sight at a time. A ~see all~ feature like in Commandos would have been particularly handy to see exactly where you could stand at any given time without being harassed by the guards, but my guess is that this was a design decision to add to the difficulty of the game -- not that it really needs to be more difficult.  The levels themselves range from small ambush maps in the woods to the huge cities of Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, York and Lincoln. The backgrounds are generally very pretty and well detailed, but due to the fact that the backdrops are 2D depictions, when you zoom in to the maximum level, the graphics become very pixilated and blocky. Like the backdrops, the characters are 2D sprites, and they get pixely as well when you zoom in on the action.  The action is accompanied by a nice period-appropriate soundtrack. The voice acting is exactly what you'd expect from a game featuring Robin Hood -- over the top. I don't mind cheesy voice acting though as it adds a comical aspect to the game, and Robin Hood was always kind of fanciful and whimsical anyway. Unfortunately, I had sound problems on both of the machines that I played on. On one the gameplay paused every time a voice sample was played, and on another I got horrible stuttering and wavering speech. Odd since both of the systems were using Sound Blaster Audigy cards, which are pretty much the industry standard.   What did you think of Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood Forest?  While the box recommends a minimum spec of a PII 233MHz machine, I would say you'd want at least a 800MHz machine to run the game in 1024x768. It's not a particularly graphic intensive game, but it does chug a bit when you're scrolling on slower systems in higher resolutions, and 1024x768 is indispensable since it gives you a wider view of the particular scene. Overall, I was happily surprised with Robin Hood. Well, maybe not surprised so much since I enjoyed Spellbound's Desperados, but the new features such as resource management and the non-linear mission path is a great addition to the genre. These new hooks will be sorely missed if they're not included in future games of this type, and Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood is responsible for starting them.", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
