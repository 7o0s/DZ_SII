When they do come around they can be great, as in the case of something like ICO or even The Sands of Time. Exit stands to make a case amongst these classics, combining puzzle solving with side-scrolling platforming. But while the game can provide a fun puzzle-solving experience in both theory and practice, it has enough quirks to keep from ranking it amongst the greats.   The basic premise of the game is that you're to help trapped victims escape buildings that are burning down, frying with electricity and are otherwise very nasty environments. As Mr. ESC, an escapologist (that's a real word, by the way), you need to navigate a two-dimensional building, find all of the various persons trapped within and have them help you find others and escape.    There are some rather simple puzzle and platforming elements at play here, like pushing boxes, jumping over ledges and such, but the most interesting stuff has to do with the abilities, and inabilities, of the people you need to save. Children, teenagers, adults and patients are all scattered about, each with their own shortcomings and skills that you'll have to take advantage of to finish each area. Children, for example, can't jump over gaps and need your help getting up and down platforms, but they're able to crawl through very short tunnels and walk over weight-restricted blocks. Adults aren't very agile and can't climb boxes and such without help, but they can push the larger boxes on their own. Patients are the biggest problem of course as you'll need to either carry them or cart them via a gurney. So again, managing and utilizing the strengths of each victim is key to the gameplay, and it generally works very well.    Now, while using each person's strengths is cool, there are a few problems with their AI. The computer folks sometimes have a problem figuring out how to correctly follow you. For example, if you head down a ladder and they're closer to another one, they might take that ladder instead just to stay on the same level as you. The problem here is when there's a wall, large gap or otherwise in-between the two of you, which is very often the case. And though you can issue commands to people, they sometimes get confused if they need to do more than one thing to complete the task. Telling an adult to jump over a gap and then push a box might work, but telling them to move down a ladder and then push a box might not. You first need to tell them to climb to the bottom of the ladder, and then push the box. It's not an experience killer, but it can be a little annoying.    One of the biggest mixed experiences in Exit has to do with the platforming elements, or specifically, the related character control. The game very heavily borrows the original Prince of Persia control scheme where you move from invisible block to invisible block, jumps must be planned and most every movement requires stopping and then executing. You can't just walk up stairs, you have to stop walking in front of them, press to climb and then watch Mr. ESC ascend. And if you change your mind, you have to wait for him to get all the way to the top before you turn him around.   While this sort of control scheme worked well in 1989, it feels quite awkward in 2006. It feels as if you're constantly giving over control to the animation routines, and as good as they are, it can be frustrating. Luckily the game's focus is on the puzzle elements and platforming-heavy levels are few and far between, but even the most puzzle-centric levels feature a fair amount of platforming and navigation, requiring you to sit through numerous stair climbs, ladder ascends, stop-and-jump routines and more. And if you happen to mis-time a jump at the wrong point in Mr. ESC's animation routine, you'll have to start all over again.    Aside from the awkward controls, another thing we had problems with was the amount of trial-and-error levels towards the later sections of the game. While you have access to an overview map, it's very rudimentary and only gives you an idea of how things are laid out. And since you can only scroll a certain distance from your character, you'll have a hard time planning out your attack for the level as you can't see everything at once. There are many times where you'll push a box, only to find out that you need to wait until you've gotten past where it's headed before you have someone else push it. Once things like this are done, there's no going back, so you have to restart the level over again and start from scratch. Unfortunately, these trial-and-error tasks really build on each other later in the game, so if you think you've solved one thing correctly, you might realize you still haven't done it right and need to start over yet again because, as mentioned, there's rarely ever any going back.   Visually-speaking, Exit is a fascinating game. The levels and objects are somewhat cell-shaded and rather cartoony in nature, but the characters are a very odd, yet extremely cool, mix of flat black with white highlights to point out their limbs. The character design is something we honestly think we've never seen before, and it's awesome. Matching that, the animation in the game is simply fantastic. Though Mr. ESC has the most robust animation set, every character moves with liquid fluidity and looks about as natural yet stylish as possible. Cool animations like when Mr. ESC changes direction mid-run and skids out and crouches while turning is perfect. We wish we had more control over Mr. ESC during these animation routines, but if we're forced to watch him do something for a second on his own, we're glad everything looks this good.    One last very notable thing is that even though the game ships with 10 levels that each contain 10 stages (for 100 puzzles total), you have the ability to download new levels online. An in-game Network option allows you to snag new content that Taito has put online and take on new challenges. As of this writing, only the first level (with 10 stages) was available. After a quick play through, it seemed that some of the stages weren't quite finished yet as the required finishing times seemed way too short to actually complete the areas, but hopefully this'll be fixed. Regardless, there's more content coming in the future, evident by the ~coming soon~ levels listed on the download page.Exit is a rather mixed bag. In theory, and even in practice, the person-centric puzzles are laid out nicely and can really challenge your noggin towards the late stages of the game. But at the same time, there's a whole lot of trial-and-error going on here. Add in the awkward old-school controls and things can be quite frustrating. As a bonus though, the look and animation quality is stellar and downloadable content should keep you going for some time.", "date": "Feb 16, 2006"}
