WipeOut, Destruction Derby, Discworld - these are all great. But Novastorm? Come on, guys! What were you thinking?  Novastorm is a track-based shooter of the worst kind. You fly (or rather the screen moves - nothing you do can really affect the trajectory of your craft) through trenches and over mountains and shoot at oncoming targets. Your only means of accomplishing this is an unresponsive ship that refuses to move fast enough to even get close to shooting anything.  The terrain you're being flown over interacts with you, which is pretty cool. However, it can also destroy you. And since you never know which way the track is going, you usually end up running into the very thing you were trying to avoid. This game is just one frustratingly annoying sequence after another.
