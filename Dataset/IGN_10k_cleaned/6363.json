With its eighth PlayStation 2 release, the series brings back its hack-and-slash, slaughter-filled battles in Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends. Just as with the like-named Xtreme Legends versions of Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4, DW5XL is something of a standalone expansion pack, adding in some new modes of play, new maps, new weapons and items and more.   But even with all of this new content, the series continues to feel more and more stale, something that Koei seems reluctant to bother and fix, almost as if its goal is to see how long it can stretch out the exact same gameplay and AI engine. Regardless of how many new weapons and maps are added, which on a grand scale are quite similar to other weapons which doesn't exactly make them unique in any fashion, the game is still knee-deep in entirely repetitive and shallow gameplay and abysmal AI. In short, it's yet another Dynasty Warriors game.    Fans of the series will probably like the game though, since they keep sticking with it, and it throws cooperative play and the new Destiny mode into the mix. Both of these sound like nice additions on paper, something that could potentially raise the series out of complete mediocrity. But in practice, the gameplay is still the title's crippling factor, and any modes or whatever else that gets thrown on top of this is just icing on a stale cake; it ends up tasting the same.   Like I said, the new Destiny mode sounds pretty cool on paper. In it, you create a character within the game's reasonable character editor and then begin your career as a foot soldier under a general and one of his officers. Through the course of the mode, you'll gain rank, eventually allowing you to command your own troops, and possibly even be given the ability to defect and head to the opposition's army. During each battle, you're able to set your own personal objects, like killing 50 soldiers within a given time limit. For winning the battle and completing objectives, you earn points that you can use to upgrade your soldier.    Sounds good, but there's a problem here: the fleshed-out gameplay experience, where you have access to your entire move set and powers is already very limited and extremely repetitive, so when you're only able to perform a single attack string for the few battles in the mode, it becomes more boring than you could possibly imagine. You literally only have one attack string you can use, and since you don't have any charged or Musou attacks, your only options are to shoot arrows, jump in the air or perform your single three or four move attack. There is zero variability here and no strategy whatsoever since you only have one thing you'll ever do in battle: press Square. Once you've played through half-a-dozen battles or so and are able to buy these other attacks, the game opens up slightly to allow you to perform these other (still limited) attacks, but that's it.    One curious thing about the Destiny mode is that you're essentially part of an ongoing story, which plays part in how your army is doing and whether or not you'd choose to defect if given the chance. Most of the dialog here is completely pointless however, and does basically nothing to move forward any sort of narrative. Before a battle, you'll be likely to hear something like:   General: ~Now it's time to attack the next city. If we're vigilant, we can win.~  Officer: ~If we stand by our swords, we'll be victorious.~  General: ~Our might will help our armies through this battle. We have the willpower to stand up to our foes and the might to defeat them.~   What the hell? This sort of dialog does absolutely nothing to advance any sort of storyline, which is extremely odd given the game's underlying adherence to some sort of historical accuracy. The game's encyclopedia proves that Koei has intertwined some accurate moments from Asia's history, or was in some way at least interested in it, but through the course of the game you'll do nothing more than attack enemies whose names you quickly forget, listen to completely pointless conversations and press the Square button to hack at enemies until the battle is over. Where's the fun or any semblance of historical simulation that they're hinting at?    One thing that has plagued the series since the start has been its absolutely abysmal AI. The computer soldiers, on your side and the opposition's, run around like chickens with their heads cut off at times, take extremely odd and overly long routes to some areas at others and are generally god-awful in battle. At one point today, I wanted to quit a fight and head back to the main menu. Since there isn't an option to quit the game in the middle of a fight, I decided to see how long it would take for the enemy to kill me. With my health at 50%, after I ran into a group of enemy soldiers alone, it took them five minutes to kill me. The only time I ever moved was to get myself a way from a wall they pushed me into so that they could attack me from all sides. The enemy is so reluctant to attack that they'll just stand around, wait for their ~turn~ and then strike. It's incredibly funny to watch and I recommend doing so if you wind up with a copy of this game.   Regardless of how much some people, including myself, are completely bored by the game, there will be fans who love it. As they've stuck with the series' fighting system until now, they'll probably like the Destiny mode a fair bit since it does do a fair job of rewarding you with upgrades and such as you go, even if the end result is still a very limited and shallow gameplay experience. The cooperative Xtreme mode challenges should also do well for some multiplayer action, if you can find someone who likes to press Square a lot.The Dynasty Warriors series has overstayed its welcome. The AI is very poor, the gameplay incredibly repetitive and really, any new modes in Dynasty Warriors 5 Xtreme Legends can't save its oh-so-very dated gameplay.For $30 though, hardcore fans of the series will be all over the new maps, weapons and such, and they'll probably love the new Destiny mode. It is fairly cool in theory, but the gameplay kills any sort of possible enjoyment the mode ever had.If you didn't like Dynasty Warriors before, you'll still hate this one. If you love the series, you'll probably love this one. Nothing's changed, and that's the problem.", "date": "Nov 16, 2005"}
