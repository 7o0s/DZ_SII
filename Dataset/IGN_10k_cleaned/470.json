With the exception of Acclaim's Shadowman, the last major game with a lead African American character was Bebe's Kids. Yeah, it's been a while, folks. While affirmative action is certainly no great reason to endorse a game, the 'urban flavor' of this game is just one of the reasons why I'm recommending this tight beat-em-up. Sure, it's not going to put Street Fighter out of mind. However, if you do the Wu, and you have both a multi-tap and a couple roughneck homies hanging around the pad, this game is a party tap.  Gameplay First things first, know that Wu-Tang is based on (and improved from) the Thrill Kill engine by Paradox Development. This is something that matters to a lot of gamers, as Thrill Kill was an apparent casualty of the death of Virgin Games. There was an uproar when that game was smote, as many gamers imagined that Thrill Kill was a great fighter that got stamped out by the oppressive censorship that is creeping its way into the industry. Well relax -- we have a pre-production burn of Thrill Kill, and believe us, when we say that Thrill Kill's death was a mercy killing -- it was choppy, blurry, slow, and loose in the control.  All things which Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style is not. Also developed by Paradox, and published by Activision, this game does everything Thrill Kill promised, only Wu-Tang delivers. It's got a rollicking four-player mode, a fast engine that still shows off plenty of animation and graphic effects, a complicated set of moves for each character, a distinctive graphic style you won't see anywhere else, and (of course) violence by the bucket-load. Forget Thrill Kill evermore -- it's Wu-Tang forever.  So what makes Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style pop? For one, Wu-Tang is the first four-player fighter on the PlayStation, and that makes the game almost invaluable. Fighting one-on-one is OK for the technical kung-fu master, but balls-out brawls of four-on-the-floor make for some thunderous chaos. The more friends you play with, the more the fun increases exponentially (much like a wrestling game, only Wu-Tang is fast and more precise). You can attack anyone at any time, so once your best friend has finished snapping your girlfriend in half, you can drive a katana up his spine and get the best of both of them. (There are handicaps and a Team mode to mix the party up and level the play field.) And the game's story mode keeps the pandemonium up by dropping you in with up to three other challengers, all out for your blood. The story mode even puts you into certain circumstances in which you must test your might -- sometimes you'll face three ninjas all by yourself, other times the game will pit you and two others of the Wu-Tang clan against one master (and even then, expect to get broken badly).   Paradox has based the move set of Wu-Tang on the Mortal Kombat philosophy -- every character has a general set of similar moves, and many of the special moves are done by the same control pad sequence. (For instance, just about everybody has a rising uppercut-type move that will lead to juggles, and the key sequence for that is generally back-circle, tap weapon.) This enables you to explore the game with greater ease, knowing that if you've mastered one character, those skills will translate well into another chosen fighter.   However, that doesn't mean that all the fighters are the same. Quite the opposite, as each of the nine Wu-Tang rappers (and two unlockable bosses) has his own unique style. Both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah are fist fighters, but they play very differently -- Raekwon is a ring boxer, dancing like a butterfly and stinging like a swarm; Ghostface Killah, on the other hand, is a pounder like Tyson, so what he lacks in finesse he makes up in might. One boss fights with his hands behind his back at all times. And yes, ODB flops around on the floor like a drunken monkey (though his Drunken Fist style is underplayed compared to VF's Shun Di). Even the texture-swap secondary characters (which you unlock by play) have subtle differences in reach and moves, though the fact that all the main villains are also model-swaps is a bit of a disappointment (for instance, Method Man carries a warhammer, while the standard baddie Chang Dao Fu carries a Naginata sword -- each plays generally the same, with the same speed, animation, and moves).  There is a training mode to learn all of the moves for each character, which is a must because this game is a test of timing, and you will want to know every counter and mega-swing possible to counterattack any given move and stay on the offensive. The game has similarities (in play) to Tekken or some of the other 3D fighters on the system, as you should always be looking for openings to get back on the attack. You also can circle your opponent and draw in on them, which becomes key to survival in four-player modes. Collision detection doesn't falter as many other 3D fighters do when circling -- when you deliver a blow to the side of the head, it connects just as well as a front-on attack.  Not that everything is perfect, of course. The control is a little too tight for its own good, so moves that require you to hit three buttons together often fail because the game recognizes one button press before the other. That means that some of the big tricks won't be seen much in four-player contests, and you will never be able to use them in combos (which, by the way, are sometimes quite difficult in that you need to alternate button presses with superhuman speed). Arenas are all square or hexagonal, and are very small (but this also keeps the action tense). And while the 36 Chambers system is a great padlock system to get to the game's secrets (you need to meet mission parameters, such as performing a nine-hit combo, to unlock secret fatalities, costumes, and other goodies), you don't unlock new moves, so there really isn't much reason to build up a character.   The worst flaws are, of course, the ones that impact the multi-player mode. The game doesn't track stats, so while the huge fatality that finishes off a match makes it known who the winner is, all you get at the end of a round is a game-over screen. That makes four-player rumbles weak in that if you're the one doing all the work in putting the damage on, and everybody else turtles and gangs up on you, you'd expect to at least get props for fighting the hardest or for getting the most kills. Super Smash Bros. and Turok: Rage Wars on N64 give you a whole detailed screen of stats, almost as a play-by-play, but apparently Paradox couldn't afford the simple variables on the PlayStation hardware to get this done. Another unfortunate aspect that stinks is that if even one player has a memory card that has the parental lock on, the whole game defaults to the censored mode. That makes sense, but the parental lock cannot be toggled once the code is set to off, so the only way to turn the parental lock off after you've defaulted to it is to destroy your memory card game save and enter the code. Very frustration after you've unlocked a number of hidden fatalities, then fight a friend who has a little brother and strict parents.  Last, one of the reasons that four player fighting hasn't been done more often, besides the technicalities, is that it's a difficult game. Players attack from any angle and often times ganging up and random encounters lead up to frustration maximilius. There is a certain amount of chaos that can't be helped, and while it may be fun for a few games, playing this game for sheer finesse is more than tiring. Additionally, a handful of characters are much stronger than others, and once you find them, it's like cherry picking in basketball. Easy points at little cost.  Graphics Styling and profiling, Wu-Tang is no graphic slouch. Graphics are clean and crisp, with four fully 3D-animated fighters onscreen and a small assortment of background effects (burning fire, lamps). Granted, Double Dragon pulled off the same feat in the '80s, but never with this much character animation or spirit. The game even has a turbo mode, which moves the game at a quick but crisp pace. There are also several fatalities for each character (which are precluded by one of the sickest graphic effects I have ever seen, in a stop-motion effect that swirls around the victor and his laid-out foe). The only issue here is that the parental lock doesn't introduce replacement finisher moves for the fatalities, making winning a battle much less eventful.   Probably the best thing about the game is the style and the simplicity of the graphics. The king-fu element is well-played, and the elegance of design is very classy. While the arenas are small and flat (and the outworld hub is dreadful), there aren't lens flares or gimmicky effects to ruin the fresh design. Women fighters are bigger in the pectorals than they are in the bra, which is absolutely welcome (especially considering that rap stars are constantly getting flak for being derogatory toward women). Even the Wu-Tang clansmen, some of whom are drawn with certain politically incorrect features, are stylized for their kung-fu makeover. The whole thing captures the refined flavor of Enter the Dragon and other Kung Fu classics better than any other videogame yet. The full motion video movies (albeit computer rendered) are dead ringers for the classic '70s kung-fu flicks, complete with humor and Asian atmosphere. One female enemy even has an afro to die for, complete with picks in her hair. Sweet, baby! Sound This is where the Wu-Tang should shine best, but ironically, the sound department is the one area where one could take issue with the game. Not that the sound is bad, it's just that it's not stellar. The game features Wu-Tang tracks, including three songs exclusive to the game (and yes-yes, you can play the extra tracks on your home disc player -- just be sure to skip the first track, which has the data and can put a hurting on your stereo system), but the soundtrack won't be replacing Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) any time soon. It's just not that hyped, and the songs are generally throw-aways -- they're not that clever, and they won't stand up for long. (One track, Killah, is even recorded badly, with bad ambience on the vocal that doesn't mesh well with the backing beat.) The game uses instrumental versions of the tracks (with chorus sections) in gameplay, so you'll be getting the beats but not the rhymes while you're playing. Sure, there's no way to concentrate on lyrics when you're getting a beat-down from three friends, but the lyrics are at least half of what makes the Wu-Tang so important. The Activision-specific tracks (not done by the Wu) fare a little better in gameplay. They are darker and thicker beats, and while the tracks wouldn't be found anywhere near a Wu-Tang record, they back the brutality well.   Character voices (except baddies and bosses) are all done by the real Wu-Tang members, but there's just not a lot of variety here. They say ~Ha~ or ~Ah~, but that's about it (some are more vocal than others). At least the energy level is mostly high (some voices sound like Paradox just picked a random black man off the street and had him do a voice; others, like Method Man and RZA, are distinct and immediately recognizable). Again, Activision-specific characters are a little better done. Bosses scream ~Rough!~ when they are thoroughly trashing you. Overall, however, it seems the voice was compromised to get all four characters on-screen and moving fluidly. Not a bad trade-off, but the game does lose some speed from that.It's the novel four-player gameplay that just sews you're a-hole shut and keeps feeding you, and feeding you, and feeding you... until you pop. There will be a bunch of Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style clones in the near future, and some of them may end up being better (especially if they track stats). But right now, you've got the source, and that puts this game in an entire other must-have category for party gamers. It's not a perfect fighter, but it's fun and vicious. And with the parent lock on, it suddenly becomes a game that's moderately appropriate for children -- no cursing, no overt violence other than fighting, and an ethnic cast that stands apart from all the other charmless white-bread heroes in gaming. This is the Mortal Kombat that MK will never be again. Between this and Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Activision is proving that a good license can become a great game.", "date": "Dec 1, 1999"}
