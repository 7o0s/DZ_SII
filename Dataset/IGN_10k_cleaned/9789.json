Comprised of 2-discs, each clocking in with over 70-minutes of music on each disc, this collection is one of the more massive videogame soundtrack offerings of the year. Suffice it to say that it's pretty much tailored for the gaming hardcore; especially those who love to sit back and relax away from their consoles and PC's by donning headphones and reliving the gaming experience via the soundtrack.   CD 1  Packed with 18 tracks the first disc of the collection is all Di Prisco, who shoots for a sometimes over-the-top mish-mash of varying electronic genres. To wit this disc commences with ~Unreal Tournament Theme (UT3 Remix)~, which sets the tone as pulsing horns and drums churn out a militaristic cadence that is quickly juiced up with undulating electronic thrusts and later augmented by haunting male and female vocal passages. The whole thing has a kind of '80s Euro-Symphonic-Rock vibe to it. ~Unreal Tournament Title (UT3 Remix)~ is a little more down to Earth; less bombastic in tone and energy. It's like a subtly jacked up ambient track complete with shifting rhythms and swirling mists of texture.     ~Tactical Agenda~ is rife with thundering rhythms and piercing shards of strings while ~ONS01 (UT3 Remix)~ introduces woodwinds to create a strange, slightly exotic slant that rolls underneath the ominous chug and grind. ~Mekalopolis~ starts out with wavering synth variations and floating rhythms that flutter from channel to channel to create a dream like aural tapestry. Elsewhere ~Skyward Fire (UT3 Remix)~ goes for a mock Jungle-meets-House vibe with energetic beats that pound over compliant ambiance. ~Afterburn~ maintains a similar stance, albeit dropping more into low-end theory terrain thus crafting a menacing vibe that rumbles and clanks sporadically; Think vintage Crystal Method and you're right on point.    Ghosts of Kraftwerk on speed are delivered with ~Go Down (UT3 Remix)~, while a futuro funk ripple burns through ~Quantum Velocity~ and down-tempo machinations to create one of the more chill inclusions on the album. ~Foregone Destruction (UT3 Remix)~ follows suit, although the scattered rhythms and rubberband jungle bass theatrics create an ebb and flow between down-tempo and frenzy.      The remaining seven tracks pretty much keep in line with the established modus operandi, delivering quick-flash rhythm escapades (~Skylab 9000~), schizophrenic blippage (~Deploy and Assault~),  down-tempo aggression (~Defector~), shifting synthetic overdrive (~Firestorm~), mild grindhouse booty shaking (~Mechanism Eight (UT3 Remix)~), and elasto-blast menace (~Frozen Babylon~),  all of which draw heavily upon the various periods of electronic musical history (Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, William Orbit, Orbital, Roni Size, etc).   If there's any single downfall to CD 1 it's that with 18 tracks--the majority of which clock in between the 3 and 5 minute range with the entire side being 1-hour, 15-minutes, and 36-seconds in total length--it all becomes a little blurry after the first 30 minutes or so, the pulsating beats, rapid fire rhythms, and synthetic synergy blending together into an often indiscernible mash-up of varying electronic stylistics.   CD 2  The second disc in the set trims the total number of tracks by 3 (there's 15 versus CD 1's 18), but the vibe remains the same: delving deeply into the bottomless bag of electronic ambiance. The core difference, however, is that Kyd dominates this section, moving slightly away from Di Prisco's more bombastic electronic sensibilities to embrace a more world music oriented approach.   Things kick off with ~Unreal Tournament Title (UT3 Reconstruction)~, which is much darker in tone than the remix on CD 1. The track is injected with wonderfully quirky faux orchestral flourishes that lend a quaint air to the proceedings. ~LockDown~ quickly demolishes any mellowness that might have been achieved by the previous track thanks to surging walls of garbled synth and skirling blasts of electronic fuzz.  ~To The Death~ is filled with echo snippets, detached noize, and an overall sense of isolation. At least at the onset. The track gradually picks up energy as it moves along, although all the while maintaining a sense of urgency and driving malevolence.      ~Robo Mall~ sounds exactly like the title, filled with strange bleeps, blonks, and robotic quips that gradually blend together to create a chaotically eclectic rhythm drift. ~Necris Attacks~ is easily the darkest, most Stygian track within the entire collection, reeling from black void vocals that float in a mire of electronic dread before the track bursts into a rolling club rhythm. If Hell were to have a house party, this might be the track that drove the partygoers into a frenzy.  The dark, menacing vibe spills over into ~Outpost,~ which is driven by some strange mock didgeridoo textures and kaleidoscopic rhythms bursts.   ~Tactical Agenda (Nanoblack Remix)~ continues to keep things drenched in menace and doom, thanks to subdued and steady rhythms that move slowly between the synthesized horns and strings that pulse with authority. The return of ominous voices only adds to the eerie trappings of ~Necrimanci,~ while ~Sanktuary~ is all turgid pulse and guttural movement. The continued use of detached vocals on tracks like ~Necris Attacks (Extended Version}~ keeps the overall feeling of these songs dwelling in bleak nether regions.     ~Outpost (Extended Version)~ follows suit, tossing in stuttering machinations that only add to the overall mysterious feeling. Again the core emotional element here is dread and foreboding. This fatalistic sensibility is lifted momentarily on ~Tacktical Agenda (Jade Dragon Remix)~ which sounds a little more hopeful in tone thanks to wavering wooden flute accentuations. And ~Bushido~ continues the Eastern thematics with rolling Taiko rhythms that are carried over into ~Temple of Shambhala,~ as well.  This portion of the album concludes with ~World of Liandri,~ which calls to mind Peter Gabriel's ~San Jacinto,~ albeit if filtered through the musical heritage of feudal Japan.    Of the two halves CD 2 is definitely the more concise and challenging. While still clocking in well over 70-minutes in length, it doesn't drag on like CD 1 does. Instead it maintains a fresh, diverse approach, delivering a much more compelling and ever-shifting sensibility that moves from ominous quells of doom and futility into rhythmically uplifting bouts of emotional bliss and elated mysticism. If forced to choose one disc from the collection for repeated listens, then CD 2 would be the clear winner. On a slightly different note the entire collection would have succeeded with a little more editing, perhaps combining elements of CD 1 and CD 2 to create a single disc collection that captured the best of both worlds.
