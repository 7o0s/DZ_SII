Who is Wario? Is he a bad guy, a good guy, or just a fat oaf in plumber overalls? Wario Land 3 is this guy's first Game Boy Color-exclusive adventure (Wario Land 2 DX was backward compatible), but not much has changed in the gameplay from the last version. Don't think that's a bad thing  it isn't. In a world of generic platformer titles featuring misplaced licensed characters, it's a real refreshing change to play something as originally designed as the Wario Land series.Features25 stages11 bossesGolf mini-gameBattery back-upOnly for Game Boy ColorWhen the system is turned on for the first time, the story unfolds  Wario's out for a joyride in his biplane, and suddenly blows his engine and crashlands in the woods. After a bit of investigation, the large lad stumbles upon a secluded cave housing a music box. Seems the music box has a taste for huge plumbers, for it magically zaps Wario inside it. Before the plump plumber could figure out what happened, a dark figure strikes a deal with him  find all the hidden music boxes, and he can leave with any treasure he scarfs along the way. Not a bad deal...and so the game begins.There is a distinct difference between Wario Land and other action platformers  namely, Wario Land doesn't rely on generic  clichs for its gameplay. First off, Wario cannot die. He can be mashed, maimed, poked, burned, mummified, zombified, flattened, sliced...but he'll never be killed and sent back to the beginning of a level. This is one malleable plumber  and since he cannot bite the big one, the game's levels have been laid out less in a linear fashion, and more like a puzzle. And it's this that gives Wario Land its uniqueness and fun factor.At the beginning of the game, Wario can't do squat  other than jump, roll, and charge weakened blocks. You'll have to use the resources in the levels to acquire keys that'll open treasure chests within each of the game's areas.  You'll have to learn all the little nuances to the enemies that are out to harm Wario (which I remind you, cannot kill him). For example, there are enemies that will set Wario ablaze if he touches them wrong  a flaming butt will cause Wario to run like a maniac until it finally lights him up in a spectacular fireball for a few seconds. It's up to you to learn how to control Wario when he's bolting from the hotseat, as well as realize what you can do with him when he's nothing but a walking yulelog. In this case, Wario can destroy certain blocks marked with a ~fire~ icon when he's on fire. Taking out these blocks will allow him access to what's beyond. When Wario takes a hit from a silkworm, he'll turn into a ball of yarn and roll uncontrollably through a level  this allows him to take out ~yarn~ blocks as well as enemy sprites. A zombie touch will turn Wario into a member of the undead, which will allow Wario to squash through thin floors. There are more than a dozen ways to twist Wario into other things, and you'll have to realize that every downside has reason for being, and half the fun is trying out new things to figure out the puzzles within the levels.And as you go through each of the game's worlds, you'll earn other standard abilities. Wario can't stomp blocks until you get through at least five levels, and later on he'll learn how to swim. When you earn these new abilities, you'll have to go back to previously completed levels to uncover other treasure chests that couldn't be accessed before. Thanks to the auto-save function and battery back-up, everything you do is recorded to cartridge.Wario Land 3 is definitely not the typical platformer game  you'll never plummet into a bottomless pit or pierce yourself on spikes. Figure Wario Land 3 as a one-man Lost Vikings  puzzle and action in one complete package. Two great tastes that taste great together  that's Wario Land 3. And in some levels, you get to play a very, well, odd game of golf where you kick a little creature into a hole in a side-scrolling interface. It's very Wario, and quite a bit of fun.If you've played through Wario Land 2, you'll recognize the art-style  it's most likely using a modified Wario Land 2 engine, with enhancements that make it specific to the Game Boy Color hardware. Even so, the animations are very smooth, and actually very humorous  Wario's big ol' butt always gives me a laugh when he climbs a ladder and shakes his booty.Wario Land 3 is a prime example that there's definitely a lot of great ideas to inject into the 2D platform genre on the Game Boy Color. While third-party companies are sticking Buzz Lightyear, Kermit the Frog, and the Rugrats babies in generic been-there-done-that game design, Nintendo's making the effort to give us what we want in our handheld gaming -- originality.", "date": "May 31, 2000"}
