One of the hottest development houses of tomorrow is the same one responsible for Dark Reign, Battlezone, Clone Wars, Destroy All Humans, Battlegrounds, Mercenaries and a few more. Even though we like those titles just fine, right now we're talking about the work Pandemic did for the United States military, which has been lovingly redesigned to make for one engaging consumer friendly experience.  Full Spectrum Warrior is probably Pandemic's most innovative title (even though Battlezone combined real-time strategy with frantic first-person shooting and vehicular combat). The original squad-based action/strategy that is Full Spectrum has already seen release on Xbox and PC, but it's now finally found a home on PS2 thanks to Mass Media's solid port work. While the conversion lacks some essential technical polish that helped make its cousins so refreshing, the underlying gameplay mechanics remain largely intact.  Ex-Taliban and Iraqi loyalists have fled their homelands seeking respite and refugee in nearby Zekistan before the advanced, disciplined Allied military storms over their borders and teaches them exactly how dire the consequences for cowardly terrorist actions are. Unfortunately for us, the Zeki peoples are led by one Mohammad Jabbour Al Afad, a Western educated madman who'd very much like to use his newfound pool of human resources to create a perilous network of jerks. And so in goes the Allied front, ready to kick ass and not really bother with taking the names of the dead since they're not about to fight back.  Specifically, Full Spectrum Warrior details the actions of eight United States Army troopers grouped into two fire teams, Alpha and Bravo. While each of the primary characters is outfitted with a genuine name, home, past and personality (at least in the instruction manual), little attempt has been made to weave them into an evolving, cohesive storyline.   Usually, Full Spectrum feels like a standalone mission that happens to occur directly after the last standalone mission. While the traits of each team member occasionally show through the title's thick veil of dust and bullet casings (particularly during the moments before combat), any causal player would be pressed to recognize them or identify the way in which they develop, because they really don't. Still, most war games of our time have completely forsaken narrative, so the inclusion of distinct voices that happen to be attached to eight unidentifiable faces is still a plus.  This Dude is Heavy  Even without an intriguing plot of any kind, Full Spectrum boasts some fairly substantial gameplay. It unfortunately begins with roughly 45 minutes of agonizing tutorial that covers everything you'd like to know about urban warfare and a few extras you really wouldn't like to know at all. While this introduction can be bypassed, it should be seen in order to really appreciate the complexity of the game. Therein lies the dilemma. Your options are: A) Sit through a plodding tutorial that may compel you to quit playing immediately. B) Skip it all and go in blind. If you don't learn, coming to grips with the more advanced maneuvers could be a bit difficult. Now make your choice, soldier.  Like any good squad-based strategy title, Full Spectrum focuses on more advanced tactical gameplay devices to carry it along a path of increasingly dangerous encounters. What it also does is allow a player to access these military moves through a pretty intuitive streamlined interface. But if you don't know the commands or effectiveness of an action, what good is the action? Thank the lords we have that freaking hour of interactive learning!  Let's assume you've passed boot camp and are still playing. Note that Full Spectrum Warrior is a strategy game, not a shooter. Don't think you'll be going in and mercilessly gunning down the uncivilized Terminator style. FSW is about command and situational awareness.   Players control two fire teams and position them strategically around hostile environment in real-time with the aid of compass markers and designated waypoints. At any time a player can only be bound to one fire team. Gamers must dynamically switch between fire teams and the specific infantry types within each to subdue enemies and emerge victorious.      By tying the camera to the shoulder of a specific fire team member, Full Spectrum creates a very tight, suspenseful, Black Hawk Down-like feel. This simple decision helps escalate the action and simultaneously focuses the player's attention on critical areas and events. The view will bob and puff during a run or bound and will gently settle down when the team is suppressed. Because of this, we're forbidden from utilizing the ultimate god-like bird's eye view of the environment, and are thus forced to deal only with what we can see and hear. That's good and bad.  So, each of the game's fire teams can be directed around the world with the left analog stick, right? If you want to move, you push the stick around and a formation marker drops and floats wherever you point it to. If you opt to flatten your team against an obstruction, the layout will hug the wall and change in shape, allowing your boys to bunch or lineup at a corner evenly. Remember that the camera is always propped on a swivel that happens to be attached to one of your team members. The nature of the formation markers works off this and can make it a little tough to navigate the formation pattern around obstacles. When the game's encounters grow in intensity and quantity, simply moving can be a real pain in the ass.   ~Why can't I get on top of those buildings?~  Crap! I'm getting shot.  ~Why can't I get around that garbage can?~  Crap! I'm getting shot.  ~Why can't I use that piece of equipment?~  Crap! I'm getting shot.  ~Why can't I order Alpha to run to a place Bravo can see?~  Crap! I'm getting shot.  ~Why can't I snipe more?~   Crap! I'm getting shot.  ~Why can't I position my men on the other side of the car right in front of me without having to devote forty seconds of my stupid life to the attempt?~  Crap! I'm getting shot.  I already told you, shoot everyone!  Yup. Expect a good amount of trial and error. There's also a delay between telling your men to do something and them actually doing the bloody thing. This pause often means the difference between life and death when you're trying to reorganize, too. While Pandemic has provided a series of move while covering, disperse and cover, engage, grenade and snipe commands, the delays + camera + transforming layout marker create some aggravating situations. But then I suppose if you're familiar with the Xbox version, you'll have been familiar with all that already. On PS2, FSW is basically the same. It features the same mechanics, ideas and style. In general, that's still a pretty good thing.  In terms of visuals, it's clear that this was an Xbox game first and foremost, but FSW still manages to transfer over well enough thanks to the sparsely populated environments and abundance of bloom lighting. Don't expect the clarity and precision of the PC or Xbox versions, though. On PS2 we get fuzzier graphics, a stuttering framerate, poorly detailed models, stark environments and a ~fog brick of war.~ We would have preferred a minimalist's approach to texturing to allow for some more polygonal detail, better particle effects and a smooth framerate, but it is what it is.  Then there's multiplayer, which is still a cooperative mode that focuses on two people playing through the campaign while in direct control of their own single fire team. We're up for coop play as much as the next guy, but we need more modes and this port is still lacking always essential competitive gameplay. As a port, Full Spectrum has been weighed, measured, and found wanting. As an original title, Full Spectrum excels, but not without a few problems.Respect the idea. Respect the delivery. Respect the difference between this and every other action title around. But whatever you do, don't buy into FSW expecting the most polished game on PS2. It's different, and certainly worthy of a look, but Full Spectrum will not appeal to everyone. Because of its presentational issues, it may not even appeal to all fans of squad-based strategies.", "date": "Mar 23, 2005"}
