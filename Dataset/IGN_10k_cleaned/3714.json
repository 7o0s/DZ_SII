The title is straightforward, with a simple focus on action elements that have helped make the Mega Man brand so popular, and this alone should appeal the title to purists. The big question is, though, will anybody else find the graphically stale throwback enjoyable? Keep reading for our thoughts.  The Facts  Famous character Mega Man's first appearance on GameCube Features a storyline tie-in with the Mega Man Battle Network series Mix of action and RPG-like elements Collect 'battle chips' to gain new weapon abilities Advance Mega Man's strengths throughout the game Solve simple puzzles Fight multiple bosses Game utilizes a ~2 -D~ graphic style for side-scrolling action   Gameplay Mega Man Network Transmission's story isn't much. The game's main draw is its action elements, of course. Still, for those curious, the title picks up somewhere between the Mega Man Battle Network games for Nintendo's handheld, as once again Lan and his cyber-universe guide Mega Man travel to the WWW in search of viruses. The presentation, which intentionally attempts to re-create a futuristic version of the Web, is fun, and for once it makes sense (within the context) that it's possible to jack into the WWW and, as Mega Man, sweep it clean of enemies, or viruses.

Get The Guide  Mega Man's producer once said that Transmission is every bit as simple as it looks. He couldn't have been more right. This is a very straightforward, very ~old-school~ 2 1/2-D action-platformer. The primary objective in the game is to get from one side of a level to the other. This is done, simply, but running from side to side and shooting anything that stands in Mega Man's way. There are boss fights, yes, and sure enough there are even collection and RPG elements to be found, but make no mistake, the play style is ultimately unchanged from some of the classic titles that started it all. Anybody who grew up with the older Mega Man titles will probably have an appreciation for Transmission, but newcomers to the series -- no nostalgic feelings to haze their judgment -- may find the gameplay style downright dated when compared to some of today's more cutting-edge, technology-driven software.   That's not to suggest that Mega Man is all guns and no brains. Transmission adds enough bells and whistles to keep things intriguing. The cyber-hero is tightly controlled with either the analog stick or D-pad, and though he's depressingly slow-moving at times, he does at least have access to an arsenal of impressive upgrades The B button pressed for a standard gun blast at any point, but Mega Man may also use a variety of 'battle chips' -- selectable weapons and upgrades -- for limited periods, and these prove very satisfying. He can, for instance, acquire 'battle chips' that enable him to throw bombs, or to shoot missiles, hurl fire, or even solidify himself temporarily so that he can take no harm. The trick is learning which weapon works best against specific opponents, and there's some measure of entertainment to be found in figuring out each enemy's weakness and then capitalizing on it. Mega Man can carry five 'battle chips' at a time and it's possible to cycle through them with the L and R buttons. It works well enough and when the action becomes too intense it's even possible to temporarily pause with the X button and change weapons, a welcomed addition.  Some gamers will call Mega Man Network Transmission too difficult. That is, in our judgment, only half true. The game is unbalanced at points, cheesy at others, and simply -- we hate to use it again, but it's true -- ~old-school.~ The puzzles are minimal. The in-level enemy interactions are usually bested without much effort or brainpower. However, exploring the 2D-like worlds is still compelling enough to keep playing, and we'd be liars if we said we didn't have fun with some of the weaponry at the hero's disposal. Only some of the boss fights, especially early on when Mega Man is still relatively weak, are tediously challenging, but as the game progresses and the hero gains more abilities and strength (through his RPG-like upgrades), it becomes slightly easier to defeat major foes. Or perhaps one just begins to play better. Either way, the end result is a game that delivers a helping of good old-fashioned fun, but one that is also marred by sometimes-difficult mechanics. What's more, this is a game that brings nothing new to the table, and for a growing audience of gamers that could be Transmission's biggest shortcoming. The other is that Mega Man's latest adventure could be -- at barely over 10 hours -- on the 'short' side.  Graphics Transmission isn't going to win any awards as far as visuals are concerned. This, because the graphics are so simple in design and execution. It's a brand new product, but it looks like it could have been released on PlayStation 1, or perhaps even on Super Nintendo. On the bright side, the game runs at a rock-solid framerate, and the style -- admittedly dated -- is well done, colorful, and realized through a variety of multi-layer scrolling backgrounds and a wealth of foreground enemies, which disintegrate into particles after being killed off by Mega Man.   Mega Man Network Transmission on GameCube  On the downside, the environments are barren, old-styled 2D, void of detailed character models, crisp textures, or any advanced lighting or shadow effects, to say the least.  Sound An extremely standard music soundtrack mixes with an overwhelmingly standard supply of sound effects. Everything from gun blasts to enemy hollers sounds right on par with the normal, but nothing particularly stands out as exceptional. Don't expect to love or hate the audio portion of the game.Mega Man Network Transmission is a fun, but flawed 2D action-platformer. The control is tight (though I wish Mega Man could run a little faster), and the whole idea of the 'battle chip' system for weapon upgrades and abilities intrigued me. But I found some of the levels, particularly during boss fights, to be difficult to the point of becoming tedious, and that's never a good thing. Meanwhile, I was entirely unmoved by the graphic and audio portions of the game, both of which are dated when compared to just about anything else out on the market.In the end, this is a Mega Man title that purists will undoubtedly get a great deal of enjoyment out of. But anybody not familiar with the workings of the franchise, and with no nostalgic appreciation for old-style platforming, will probably be turned off by the title immediately.Give it a rent and see which category you fall in.", "date": "Jun 16, 2003"}
