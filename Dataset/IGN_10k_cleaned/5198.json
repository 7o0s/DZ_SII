The Vintage package includes three classic Namco titles: Dig Dug, Pole Position, and Galaga. Keep in mind that Live Arcade comes with a free copy of Ms. Pac-Man, meaning that this is basically 4/5 of the $20 Namco Museum Vol. 1 (minus the original Pac-Man). While Namco Vintage, allows you to upload your high scores online, Namco Museum Vol. 1 offers three bonus ~Arrangement~ games, which are upgrades to a few classics, plus some other variants.   There's no online multiplayer, but you can play your standard two-player hot potato games. The emulations are good, though the free Ms. Pac-Man seems a bit slow. This is, quite honestly, a little bit insulting to expect people to pay $15 for three old school games with no extra frills. If the thought of playing Galaga or Dig Dug at all sounds interesting to you, Namco Museum Vol. 1 is a much better choice. For $5 more, you get extra games and a better overall presentation. If you can live without uploading your scores, that's the way to go.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
