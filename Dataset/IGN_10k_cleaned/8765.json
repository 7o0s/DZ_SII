Natsume's Harvest Moon for Game Boy places you in the role of a novice farmer who has inherited an abandoned farm from a mysterious 'Spirit'. You are given one year to turn the farm around and make it profitable. During the course of this simulation, you will learn to grow crops, raise animals, and manage the financial aspects of running a successful farm. Only those who develop the finest farming skills will obtain the elusive goal of being promoted to the status of Harvest Master.   Features  Single-player or Two-player with the Game Boy Game Link (sold separately). Two players can barter and buy items from each other for use in their separate farms. One automatic game save. Excellent to Good game control. Difficulty level: Medium to Hard.   The Game Harvest Moon begins with the 'Spirit' bestowing you with the year-long mission of working the land. Before gameplay begins, you get to choose your gender (male or female) and your pet (feline or canine). You also must enter in your name and the name you've selected for your animal companion. Once you've done this, you can begin clearing the land on your farm in order to start the planting process. Be aware that starting a ranch from scratch takes time; be patient, and after a while you will begin to reap the rewards of sticking to your farming tasks.   The Harvest Moon environment consists of three main areas: the farm, the town, and the Harvest Sprite tunnels located under the farm's tool shed. You are free to roam in any of these places. Being a farmer, you will spend most of your time on your land, either raising crops or tending to your animals. Of course, there will be times where you'll need to run in to town to pick up necessities, purchase supplies, and interact with the townspeople. The items you find there are indispensable, so make sure you make the trip to town often. When exploring the boundaries of the farm, you will stumble upon the entrance to the Harvest Sprite tunnels. In these catacombs, you will encounter diminutive elfin creatures who can aid you if you'll do the same for them. Even though this underground location is hidden out of sight, you should keep it in mind and visit frequently.   The game's timeframe takes place over the course of four seasons, with each season lasting thirty days. The crops you can grow in one season will be different from those you can grow in other seasons. You can keep track of time by pressing the Select button to activate the memo option, which will inform you of the hours and days as they pass, or by consulting the calendar on the wall in your house. In the house you will also find a book that logs your possessions and their current statuses. For example, you can find out just how much food you have, the amount of money in your account, and even if your animals are healthy or unhappy.   Your farmer girl or boy can carry up to two different tools or items at any given time, in addition to using his or her hands. Getting used to toggling between tools takes a little time and seems awkward and slow at first. To switch between using tools and hands, press the Start button. In order to swap items, simply return to the tool shed. In addition to using tools, the farmer can also run, ride the horse, and pick up various objects and animals. One function that happens automatically is the collection of your crops from the different loading areas and from your horse's saddlebags. Townspeople will also spontaneously visit you at various times during the game. Know too that when the farmer gets hungry, he or she will automatically eat; just make sure there is always enough food. Your pet and horse do not need to be fed, though the same does not hold true for the other farm animals. All animals on the farm need some sort of attention, and through the course of the game you will discover their needs and how to meet them.    The Harvest Moon environment is presented from an overhead perspective. Graphics are rich and detailed. Each crop has a unique look, so you can tell the tomatoes from the corn quite easily. The animals are adorably animated and fun to observe. Your farmer's facial expressions and body language, though nondescript most of the time, become more entertaining as he or she starts showing the fatigue of working long hours in the fields and stables. One small exception to the graphic excellence is how tricky it is to determine at a glance whether your grass is ready to sickle down. Overall, however, the game's detailed depictions are effective and reflect the Harvest Moon's innocent charm.    The music is pleasant and simple and follows the game's rhythms. Each new season brings a new song that sets the tone for that time of year. Though at times you might wish you could control the music, the game doesn't provide that option. For the most part, the songs grow on you as you play, and serve as a nice reminder of passing time.   Sound effects in this game are rather eclectic; some make sense and faithfully replicate genuine sounds, while others seem odd and out of place. For instance, the dog's yipping bark and the horse's clopping gallop sound authentic, but the axe's weird plunking in no way resembles the hack of a striking blade. It would have also been more entertaining to have the cows moo and the chickens cluck, but this is sadly not the case. A true farm's energy comes from its wide range of sounds, but this farm lacks many of the noises that would bring it to life fully.    One of Harvest Moon's most endearing qualities is that its gameplay is not rigidly structured. This means that the game can be played repeatedly without becoming repetitive. Embedded in the game are different secrets and tricks that add to the game's depth. Mistakes made during the course of a game can not be conveniently erased, so the player is realistically forced to learn from the errors or start over from the beginning. Once you've played a while, you develop more efficient farming techniques that can be put to use more quickly in future games and aid you in your quest to become a Harvest Master.  Harvest Moon is a refreshing addition to the Game Boy role-playing game library. Gameplay is addictive, as you begin to see your farm take shape through your efforts. While you brush your cow, or haggle with the townspeople, you can't help but feel as if all your struggles and triumphs in building this imaginary farm are somehow real. Harvest Moon's farming premise is unusual but appealing, and players of all ages will be able to find challenge in creating a smoothly operating farm.
