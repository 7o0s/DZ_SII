First, you have to love a RPG with barely a story. And second, you have to love searching areas that go on and on, seemingly forever.  Towers is a mindless game where you'll roam the twists and turns of a pointless dungeon, but there's not much fun to find here. But repetition? Plenty. The game is akin to dungeon-exploring RPGs from computer past like Bard's Tale, Lands of Lore, and but the game lacks so much in comparison to those classics that it's just not an inviting adventure. Features Four characters Battery back-up Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  At the start of the game you'll choose your character from a selection of four -- after that, there's some cool and clever full-motion video. A few seconds of pretty, rendered graphics does not make a game good, and it just seems thrown in to give this impression. The real problem is the monotonous gameplay --  this is where the power switch becomes quite inviting.  The dungeons are made up of numerous passageways, which are often hidden behind locked doors.  This is where the ~puzzle~ element enters play  these doors will require you to press buttons, use keys, or even weirder, just pass through illusionary walls. There will be traps scattered about, which can and will spell instant doom for you if you stumble into them.   There are plenty of baddies throughout the miles of dungeons, that's for sure.  This means you have to be alert and ready to tap your A button to attack  there's really no strategy element here, it's just a matter of fast fingers and powerful weapons in-hand.  When you end up killing the foe, he, she, or it will likely drop an item -- like an apple for health, or a weapon for increased attacking power.  Enemies can and will attack in groups and surround you, and some can even throw rocks from far away. But all in all it's just a matter of pacing around the hallways and being quick on the trigger. It's definitely not Doom.  The control scheme, when paired up with the game's visual layout, is an ordeal.  Movement is simple enough, since the only ways you can move are forward, backward, right, or left. But in order to collect an item, you have to press the select button to bring up a cursor, and  move it  towards whatever you wish to take. and then add it to your inventory by pressing A and dragging it to your items list.  This is much less convenient than it should be, especially on the Game Boy D-pad. This game is more suited for a system with a mouse. To be able to walk or fight again, you have to press the select button once more.  It's not hard to forget that the cursor is up when an enemy sneaks up and attacks.  Since the fights are not turn-based, you can easily get walloped until you remember to press the select button and whack your enemy back.  What could have been a cool item becomes an mild aggravation -- casting spells. In order to cast one, you have to enter a combination of three words -- obtained in the quest  -- by a command list at the bottom of your window.  ~Ke Lal Ki~, or ~Ke Me Kin~, for example. Not really an easy thing to memorize.  If the combination works, you will be able to cast the associated spell, but only if you have enough Mana.  For a game that wants you to wander through all the dungeons, everything looks the same.  In fact, the dungeons only vary in the slightest of ways, like different wall textures and different-looking enemies.  Although the placement of hallways and turns are different, it's easy to get lost -- good thing there's a map. The types of enemies you encounter change now and then, but you'll face the same kinds from one section to another often.  Things you'll see on the wall are keyholes, switches, and generic writings. There's very little in the way of diversity, and not much incentive for you to continue on the long quest.  One plus, though, is that you can save your game anywhere.   Towers does offer a rather decent two-player cooperative mode where you and a buddy can enter the dungeon and fight side-by-side. This element does add to the game and raises Towers out of the pit of mediocrity. There's nothing much here in Towers to keep you interested, and that's a necessity in a game that requires hours of play to succeed.  Unless you're gung-ho over repetition and poorly-done gameplay, you're bound to fall asleep the second you begin your adventure.  The only thing I was semi-impressed by was the video during the beginning. After that, it was all downhill.", "date": "Jun 17, 2000"}
