For reference, see Stewie Griffin, the toddler version of Kermit the Frog or the Baby Mario Bros. in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. Superheroes can also be cool, if a little overdone these days  there's no denying the lasting excellence of characters like Superman, Batman and The Flash. But when you make babies into superheroes, and then those babies are also shorter, diapered versions of the shallow and lifeless Bratz doll characters, you're mixing one too many conflicting elements together. The result, Bratz: Super Babyz, is a bit of a mess.   And it's a bit of a mess that gets even worse the further you go into it, as additionally thrown into the mix is a plot about alien invasion, a quest through a haunted house and the recovery of the Bratz girls' lost pets. It's a convoluted concept that supposedly follows along with the events of the Bratz: Super Babyz DVD movie, but I'd be impressed to see the narrative structure that makes all those divergent pieces come together into a cohesive whole.   The gameplay in Super Babyz is similarly separated into a few disconnected elements, including exploration, mini-games and the requisite dress-up mode. The primary focus is exploration, which takes place in full 3D and actually looks pretty fair  the girls walk around their neighborhood or the local shopping mall in the style of Super Mario 64, you can rotate the camera around, and a map on the touch screen helps you keep your bearings. There's little to do but explore, though. You can't jump or interact with the environment beyond walking around, so each exploring ~mission~ is mostly a chain of Point A to Point B treks on foot to talk with different non-player characters.   The gameplay in Bratz: Super Babyz is separated into two pieces. There's 3D exploration (left) and touch screen mini-games (right).  As an example, one early mission has one of the Bratz girls looking for her lost rabbit. She finds a trail of food crumbs, follows it to the bunny, backtracks to pick up a carrot, then completes the level by enticing the animal with the vegetable. All very simple ~walk here, walk there~ gameplay that is likely well suited for the youngest DS players, but would be unengaging and dull for anyone older than that.   More complicated missions employ the second piece of Super Babyz's gameplay, the mini-games. You'll be tasked to earn a high score at catching water balloons, or a Whack-a-Mole clone, or a version of that carnival game where you knock down little clowns by throwing baseballs. These mini-games  and there's are only a handful  are also the only place where you'll find the touch screen functionality used in this package.   One totally random and pleasantly surprising addition to Bratz: Super Babyz is the haunted house quest, which interestingly plays out like a simplified clone of the original Legend of Zelda. Seriously, it's the same overhead view, with the same room-to-room dungeon crawling focus. You have to find switches to activate bridges, avoid contact with ghosts and bats. All very interesting. It's as if one of the members of the Super Babyz programming team was trying to reverse-engineer Zelda for the fun of it, and they decided to toss it into the final game for a laugh. The real joke may be that this Zelda-esque sequence is the most enjoyable part of the whole product, though, and outclasses the rest of the ~real~ adventure.   Finally, girls who enjoy the Bratz brand of dolls will of course be happy to find that Super Babyz has a dress-up feature, along with unlockable clips, screenshots and songs from the direct-to-DVD film that this game is based on. But it's very limited this time around  past Bratz games have done dress-up better, as this design only offers a limited amount of baby-sized wardrobe options.Bratz: Super Babyz is a limited game with a confusing concept and shallow gameplay. Its premise of transforming the Bratz girl character into babies and then giving them all superpowers is just plain odd, and made worse by the fact that the basic walk-about gameplay doesn't seem to support anything ~super~ at all. The game has a few redeeming qualities, as the technical execution of the 3D exploration sequences holds merit and the random inclusion of a Legend of Zelda-inspired dungeon sequence are noteworthy and positive. But as a whole, only the youngest gamers or those girls who are die-hard fans of the Bratz: Super Babyz DVD need to pay attention to this one.", "date": "Mar 14, 2008"}
