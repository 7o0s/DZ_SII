The SNES/Super Famicom days were rich with roleplaying games from both Nintendo and third party companies like Square, Enix, Namco, Capcom, Bandai, Taito, Atlus, Koei, ASCII, and others. But something happened after the SNES faded into gaming history -- well, actually, we all know what that something was: PlayStation. Sony was so aggressive about signing on third parties and the CD format so perfect for the RPG genre, Nintendo's new platform was left out to dry. Sadly, the RPG drought carried over to GameCube as well. The number of RPGs released in the North American market is fleetingly small: two ports, three enhanced Dreamcast legacy titles, and only one single roleplaying game targeted exclusively at the GameCube audience -- Lost Kingdoms (known as Rune in Japan). Released May 2002, the FromSoftware-developed title managed to fill the void with enjoyable, but decidedly average card battling gameplay. While not a raging success, the game sold a respectable number of copies, enough for Activision to honor GameCube fans' pleas for more RPGs and bring FromSoftware's sequel to the US as well.  So how does Lost Kingdoms II fare when compared to GameCube's meager lineup of RPGs? Did FromSoftware take feedback to heart and fix the problems inherent in the original game? Read on.  Features  Card battle and collection RPG, set 200 years after its predecessor Features over 200 Guardian Creature Cards (100 new ones) Draw upon elemental powers, like fire, water, wood, and earth, as well as neutral and mech abilities Fight by summoning, sending a beast to fight independently of you, or temporarily morphing  New card transformational ability lets the main character transform into creatures and use their abilities Gain experience points and upgrade the cards Trade, buy, and sell cards Bet and win cards in two-player versus matches Dolby Surround sound support    Gameplay Lost Kingdoms II is set 200 years after the events in the first game. The inhabitants of the kingdom of Argwyll have been enjoying peace and benevolent rulership ever since Queen Katia unified the land with the help of the magical Runestone. But trouble is brewing in the region of Kendarie, known for its skilled craftsmen. The new threat comes in the form of artificial Runestones. Though not as powerful as the Queen's the Kendarie Runestones enable adventurers to take control of lesser monsters and use them for their own purposes. Those purposes, as it soon turns out, are war and conquest.   As in the predecessor, the storyline is hardly something new. While there are some twists along the way, everything is standard RPG fare and the characters remain shallow genre stereotypes and never really stand out. Players slip into the role of the attractive female thief and warrior Tara Grimface, a member of the Band of Scorpion guild that strike terror into the hearts of greedy landowners.   Forget the early creatures. The game picks up greatly when you get your hands on more powerful cards.  Like Katia in the first game, Tara travels the land by selecting areas from an overworld map and then explores towns or monster-infested landscapes in real time. No randomly appearing monsters that pop up out of nowhere this time around. As you explore, you can see the monsters roam the stages and take action in advance or avoid them. Instead of switching to a smaller, enclosed arena to fight the enemies, all combat is done right where you stand. Just like in the first game, players battle foes by using cards drawn from a customized deck of 30. These cards are found in treasure chests, won by clearing stages or beating opponents, bought in stores, or traded for fairies you collect during the main quest. There is also a Capture Card that can be used to take out a weakened monster and seal it inside the card for later use.   Tara has access to four cards at the time. To use a card and summon the monster depicted on its front, you simply press one of the four face buttons. Using a card requires magic energy, which in turn is replenished by collecting magic stones that appear after defeating enemies. Holding the R button while pressing a button will move that card to the bottom of your deck and replace it with the next one on top. Strategy comes into play depending on what card you pit against what monster. First, you want to have a diverse and well-put-together deck. Like in most RPGs, every enemy and friendly monster has its own set of stats and adheres to a specific element (based on the traditional Chinese element table, plus ~neutral~). Thus it's important to select, for example, a fire element card when attacking a wood element monster. Since elements are displayed next to the monsters' HP gauges, there's no experimentation or ~probing~ of monsters. And while players can customize multiple decks, there really is no need to in the single player game. FromSoftware again created levels that feature a wide variety of enemies, so you'll have to have a diverse deck at all times. It would have added another level of strategy if there actually were the need for a water/mech/neutral deck, for example, to combat an army of fire-based monsters inside a volcano. As it stands, players will just find one combination that works and stick with it throughout the game.       Combat in Lost Kingdoms II is a mixture of action and passive gameplay. There are five different types of cards. The ~Weapon~ type requires Tara to run up close to the enemy and deliver a single hit from the monster sealed in the card, ~Summons~ has the monster become one with Tara, ~Independent~ unleashes an active NPC monster that attacks by itself, and ~Helper~ releases a passive helper creature that refills your health, alters your status, or lays traps. A new ~Transform~ ability now also lets the main character transform into and take control of a monster, which unlocks new abilities required to solve certain puzzles or access new areas.   The game's control works out just as well as in the first game and the camera system is as basic as ever (you have to manually swing it left and right all the time). The emphasis is once again on exploration, upgrading, and battling, not on action, story, or puzzles. There are a few simple challenges, like adjusting the time displayed on a clock or getting the right card to open up a new area, but they are secondary to strategy elements like monster selection, strengthening cards in battle (pressing the Z button will increase the power of the card, but also consume twice the magic power), or gaining experience points to become more powerful and upgrade the deck.   Though not all that much as changed from the original in terms of gameplay and strategy, Lost Kingdoms II is far less linear. No longer do you have to beat the game to revisit places you've been to. You're actually encouraged to go back in and uncover new areas and find new cards. Sadly, this is less of a welcome bonus than an absolute necessity. With a little more than a dozen unique environments, Lost Kingdoms II remains one of the shortest RPGs on the market. It's easily possible to beat the game in 12 hours, but even with exploration of the seven or so hidden zones most gamers will most likely clock in less than 15 from start to finish. There are two different endings, depending on what happens to one of the characters during the quest, but it's the collection aspect of the game that mostly extends the replay value. Trying to track down all the cards or battling through the 20 floors of the ~Proving Grounds~ (which open up after you complete the main story extends gameplay) will keep you entertained for a while, as will the enjoyable two-player mode that has you go head-to-head against a friend. As a matter of fact, it's wagering your hard-earned cards against your buddy that requires the most strategy and delivers a high level of excitement in Lost Kingdoms II. The only catch is that you need to have a friend who's already amassed a comparable deck, otherwise you'll just be playing off your own save and there's no sense of risk or danger.  Graphics Lost Kingdoms received some much-needed graphics improvements over its predecessor. The game looks much sharper and the textures and characters are more detailed as well. The overall appearance is still on the flat side, mostly due to the dull lighting and the lack of distinct shadows in the environment. It's obvious that a lot of work went into the beautiful monster cards. The hand-drawn creatures look great, even if their polygon counterparts aren't as detailed as the monsters in most other console RPGs. The forced perspective (you can't look around in first-person mode) and the lack of cinematic camera angles make it hard to be truly immersed into the locales, but the graphics are certainly nothing to scoff at. The framerate is also largely improved over the first game and is smooth for the most part. Kudos to FromSoftware for taking the time to render some rarely seen (on GameCube) sharp intro and cutscenes. The artifact-free clips add some much needed story and sense of adventure to the otherwise strategy-focused title. The game does not support widescreen or 480p modes, for all you high-def gamers out there.   Sound Though mostly text-based, Lost Kingdoms II features some decent voice over work during the non-playable segments. The quality of the sound effects is up to par with the first one and though the game sports a surround sound setting, the channels aren't really used to give you a sense of space. So don't expect to hear monsters roaring behind you. It's all decidedly average. The music is a mixed bag as well. There are actually some nice melodies -- sort of anachronistic mixtures of pop and medieval tunes -- but for every tune you actually don't mind listening to, there is a song better at home in department store elevators. Then there are the repetitive pieces that had us reach for the volume knob because the same keys were repeated over and over and over.Overall, Lost Kingdoms II is a definite improvement over the first game. You get twice as many monster cards, a quest that's two or three hours longer, some voiceover work, improved graphics, a better two-player mode, a less linear quest, and a few battle upgrades, but the core gameplay remains the same. The whole experience is more balanced and the changes are definitely welcome, but Lost Kingdoms once again is hampered by a cookie-cutter storyline and an overall feeling of blandness. The entire quest just feels uneventful -- and if it weren't for the added draw of collecting all the cards, it would be over so quickly you'd swear it was an action game, not an RPG. I can't deny that Lost Kingdoms shows a lot of potential to some day blossom into an appealing RPG series, but it's not quite there yet. The basic battle mechanics are solid but need more depth, and the character development, quest, and story elements need a big shot in the arm. Given the dearth of RPGs on GameCube, Lost Kingdoms II is worth a rental and makes a decent purchase for fans of the card RPG sub genre. We're thankful that Activision hasn't forgotten about US RPG fans and has brought the second game stateside as well, but it really should have been value priced. Sure, the inclusion of a free Memory Card 59 helps to somewhat justify paying $50 bucks for what would pass as a budget title on PS2, but a game save only takes up 3 blocks, so a lower price point would have been a much more commendable strategy for such a short game.", "date": "May 23, 2003"}
