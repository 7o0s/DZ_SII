As a download for the short-lived SEGA Channel, it never had an actual release on a Genesis cartridge. And that's okay, really. Legend has it that SEGA thought the quality of the product was so low, that it would be worthless or, worse, damaging to even publish the game in the States. And whether or not that's actually true, that quality assessment is on target -- because Golden Axe III is certainly the worst of the trilogy.   It's more of the same. Which is a complaint first leveled against Golden Axe II, but it's worse here. By the third game in a series, you'd think at least some progress in design would have been made; some evolution in gameplay or fun. But no, Golden Axe III plays out in exactly the same way as its predecessors, placing you in the role of a medieval warrior who walks endlessly to the right side of the screen, hacking and slashing through repetitive bad guys over and over and over again.   More swords, more skeletons. Golden Axe III is more of the same. But what's worse, is that III actually removes some of the small enhancements that were made in II -- like the chargeable magic attacks. A problem with the very first Golden Axe was that when you used your screen-clearing magic attack, it automatically drained away all of the potions you had picked up along the way. Golden Axe II fixed that by allowing you to select how many of the potions you wanted to use each time. You could use them for a powerful assault if you wanted, or you could spend just one at a time for more frequent use. Though again, Golden Axe III is back to the archaic, no-choice system of the original and you'll likely be frustrated by watching all of your collected vials disappear with even one touch of the magic button. This is supposed to be a sequel, a progression. Not a regression.   It may cause some additional depression when you realize that other areas of the game have also stepped backwards. The graphical presentation is another area, for instance. This game looks gritty and ugly. Which would be fine if it were an earlier release, but it makes no sense here; this was one of the later games developed for the Genesis, and yet it made no advancements in animation or environment design over its prequels. Characters are still stiff, their movements choppy. Plus, the enemy designs begin to repeat themselves with re-colored palettes in only the first stage. It's a sad state of affairs.   There are a handful of positives at least. As Golden Axe III introduced branching level advancement, meaning that you didn't have to play through the same sequences of stages with every run-through. And it made a bit more modern the health bar, which became an actual bar that drained and filled instead of a set of health ~blocks~ as in previous installments. There are two new playable characters as well, in the form of a humanoid panther mutant man and a gigantic, shackled brute that looks like he stepped out of the WWE.   It's just too bad that SEGA kicked out the most unique and entertaining past character to make room for the new guys. It seems like, for every positive feature Golden Axe III has, another negative was introduced to counterbalance it. That truth is solidified by the fact that Gilius Thunderhead, the dwarf who wielded the golden axe in the series' original, isn't even playable. He's pushed aside and made into window dressing, appearing on the character select screen. Whoopee.It's not surprising at all that the Golden Axe series faded out and died when it did. The first title was memorable and fun in the arcades, and then it was made less so by the watered down home console port. Then the first sequel offered a little innovation, but played pretty much the same as before, which brings us to this -- where the ball was dropped even further. SEGA was right in its decision not to release this as a cartridge back in the '90s, as it's not worth your time or effort.", "date": "Nov 19, 2007"}
