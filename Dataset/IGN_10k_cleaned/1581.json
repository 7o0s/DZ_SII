This is the dumping ground of licenses, and the breeding field of amateur game designers. It's the primordial ooze.  But don't pity these people. They get their ransom whether or not their project lives or dies. The unfortunate are the children, who are studied and focus-grouped to figure out their tastes, then, carefully herded and directed towards mediocre yet licensed material all while corners are cut around their limited capabilities. Babies don't need fancy graphics or quality sound, nor intuitive gameplay and smooth controls. They just need dull shiny objects to roughly respond when they pound on a control pad.  Hopefully this review can be a clinic for creators of children's games, because Tonka Space Station gets it all wrong. Myself, I've watched carefully when little kids (my cousins, two boys and one girl ages 5 to 12, as well as many other young game players in stores and even in our own office) play videogames. I've seen the mistakes that programmers and producers make in overestimating and underestimating their audience. Most times, children's games fail because they are too tough and rely on instructions that kids instinctively ignore, or too simple to be fun. In either case, kids games tend to control badly. That shouldn't be the way, and children (who have gaggles of grandmothers and uncles and friends dying to buy games for them) shouldn't be given inferior games on their birthdays.   Gameplay Tonka Space Station is a prime model for what's wrong with kid's games, because it makes every possible mistake. From the confusing structure to the heavy control, the game is rough on little players who just want to have fun.   The initial design is very complex, with a whole Sim City-type building strategy game structured around it. Nothing but the manual explains how this section is supposed to work, and for youngsters just getting the hang of See Spot Run, a 30-page mini book full of technical jargon is pretty daunting. The designers were smart enough to provide simple graphic interfaces instead of a lot of text, but none of the icons make sense, and in terms of gameplay, you have to wade through menus to see things happen -- there's no big exciting event that happens with the statistics. Instead of seeing people flocking to live on the space station you build, you instead find out indirectly by scouring through menus for the population meter.  With the gameplay, you want stick to the Nintendo philosophy that one button can do just about anything. Here in this game, sometimes the X button is the key control, sometimes the square is more important, sometimes just pressing up on the pad is the key control, and sometimes you have to press one of the shoulder pads. That's too much for a kid. Another mistake is made with this game in that when the designers do simplify the controls correctly, the other buttons are left to do nothing. I've watched children play the PlayStation 2, the most sophisticated and stunning videogame system ever crafted, and noticed that they weren't wowed by the dazzling graphics or sensational physics -- they were amused simply because they could beep the horn on the car. Every button should do something in a child's game -- they count gameplay by the little things.  Designers also have to be very, very cautious of the difficulty of the game. Too easy may be no fun, but too frustrating quickly turns them away. At least constantly reward them. They don't want to feel like failures. Tonka's team do the reward aspect well with a full roster of awards to win after each mission, but with the difficulty widely varying and the missions so confusing, it sometimes works against itself  -- the game demotes failing scores.  Tonka Space Station's missions are typical for children's titles -- dozens mini games with changing levels of control. All of them are visually unimpressive, but at least a few are good starts for kid gaming. A racing game and a crawing spider loader mission are smart and have potential to make kids smile. However, each stage has its big problems in control. The Tempest-like shooter has a very strange sense of depth, so kids never know when they're about to get hit by something from the background. The racing game puts boosts at turns, so racers who go for the specials will get boosted off the edge of the track and have to start again. The explorer driving game had very, very, very slow control, and rumbles enough to make your hands numb. The flying shooter (generally the best of the pack) makes players hit every target or else fail. A forward driving car doesn't give you full control of turning around, so it's tough to collect every thing on the screen (and if there's one thing kids feel the need to do, it's collect every little floating trinket there is). And the Spider mission, which is also sort of fun, has bad polygon collision, so the craft gets hung up all the time and can't move. These are all common mistakes in kids games -- as is the plodding, unresponsive control that dominates the gameplay in most of these missions, and together they add up to a fully joyless game.   Graphics First generation polygons are the norm, unfortunately, in children's games. Simple triangles and ugly textures cover every inch of gameplay. It's a very yucky looking game, and even though the engine is handling nothing (and doing it very slowly), the visuals still break up and make odd mistakes.   Generally, kids aren't so concerned with beautiful graphics... well, that's not exactly true, but when they're playing a game, they're at least more prone to stick with it even when it looks bad. It's kind of attention span addition, and it's usually solved by prettier games. What is bad about the bad graphics engine in this game is that it's break-up of polygons often makes impossible gameplay. The warp-zone shooter (very reminiscent of the homebrew Project: Wormhole for PlayStation Underground) has no sense of depth, so you can't see what's happening. Huge rocks tumble towards the tiny ship, and there's no indication which way to move to avoid it. In the driving game, the visuals draw so close that gamers fall off the sides before they even see a turn. Also, in the roving mission, the visuals are so bad that it looks like there is always a   Hasbro Interactive at least knew that kids enjoy special effects, and they've put a glowing shine around everything in space. Rocks glow, crystals grow, spaceship exhaust glows. That's sort of nice. Also, some of the ships have interesting design, and are based on toy versions, so at least there, kids would get something to get excited about.  Sound For some reason, the sound is where children's game designers seem to shine. Maybe it's the diminished expectations, but it seems to be more than that -- the sound designers always come up with something creative. Here again, the music is rather unique, a jazzy collection with bubbly bass and percussion. Some of it sounds like 1980's wrestler themes, others sound like game show jingles. In either case, the quality isn't spectacular, but the design is something very different from the Xtreme rock garbage we normally see in big kids' games. Also, the sound effects are simple but effective, with a perky announcer's voice narrating the game.  Tonka Space Station is another to look down on kids for turn-around. It's got all the characteristic mistakes of the genre. Made by a committee, this game simply misunderstands what children like to do and how they play videogames. At the same time overly simple and absurdly complex, with missions that are arduous, confusing, and sometimes difficult even though nothing is happening in the gameplay to make it so, this may be what's left of the PlayStation after all its years of service. We all knew that with its retirement and the arrival of the PS2, the PS One would become Little Timmy's game system, but we at least thought he'd have some fun games to play with.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
