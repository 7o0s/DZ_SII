{"name": "Mystic Heroes", "name_review": "Mystic Heroes", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/10/mystic-heroes-2", "text": "Where Koei has released the historically rooted, mass-fighting style Dynasty Warriors on other consoles, it has decided to create Mystic Heroes for GameCube. Mystic Heroes takes after Dynasty Warriors in concept, but it is clearly aimed at a younger audience. It may be loosely based on Houshin Engi, an ancient novel written during the Ming Dynasty of China, but for the most part it's a button-mashing, beat-em-up battle game that pays little attention to history, which is in stark contrast to Dynasty Warriors. It combines pure fantasy fiction with wide-open battles, huge boss figures, and four-player co-op support. It's completely mindless action that's simple to jump into, but just as easy to fall away from.   Features  Loosely based on the age-old novel Houshin Engi Choose from four main characters: Shiga, Lani, Naja, and Tai Adventure through eight action-packed stages  Large-scale fighting sequences lets you take on dense armies Use special combo attacks and magic Discover over 70 magical runes that result in unique spells Face inconceivably large boss figures  One to four player action, including seven different co-op and versus modes   Gameplay Mystic Heroes is focused on the concept of large-scale battles, and the strategy that is involved in working with a team. The main single-player Story Mode lets you choose from four different fighters; Shiga, Lani, Naja, and Tai are all balanced differently and capable of different magical attacks. No matter which one you choose, though, the object is still the same: head out into fierce battle with hundreds of foes. Every wondered what it would be like to possess unfathomable martial art talents, the power to cast magical spells, and take on an entire army alone? Mystic Heroes intends to give you just that opportunity. You have a small army of your own that supports you on the sidelines, but they're nothing compared to you in skill. In fact, they provide only meager support. Of course, that just leaves more foes for you to teach a lesson.  The combat mechanics are totally frantic and certainly best described as button-mashing. Just lay into the GameCube's A-button and you'll soon be knocking your opponents to the ground. Meanwhile the X-button is reserved for sword spells and the Y-button for direct spells. The way they factor into the fighting mechanics is simple and, also, combo-based. If you tap X one, you'll unleash a fierce, magically powered sword slash. However, by hitting A+A+X+?(repeating to hit X) you'll unleash a well-choreographed dance of sword and magic.  It's the same for using spells directly with the Y-button. However, you can also hold down Y to briefly switch into first-person mode and target numerous enemies. On the defense side of things you can guard or dodge with the R-trigger and jump with B. So, there is definitely some depth to explore, but when you lay it all out on the battlefield it's pretty mindless. You have to monitor your magic and health meters, but you can pick up power-up items frequently, and magic replenishes as you defeat foes.   Everything takes place in huge, wide-open environments that stretch for great distances in almost every direction. This sense of wide-openness is welcome, as it perfectly compliments the idea that you're taking on what seems like an endless group of foes that pours out from everywhere around you. Eventually, if you and your party are successful, you'll move on to a mini-boss or final boss for that level. These beings are usually pretty huge, and require slightly different strategies. However, it's nothing that requires too much thinking, and is more or less just a matter of keeping yourself alive.   Overall, the gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's not meant to be complicated or small-scale like Capcom's Onimusha is, for example. The fighting engine is centered on the ability to deal damage to dozens of foes at a time, and there's even ways to juggle them for extra points. If you're looking for something that's very easy to pick up and play, and offers up some intense combat, Mystic Heroes is recommended. Unfortunately, we feel its longevity is hindered by the gameplay style. It's very much an arcade game, and without a compelling story to back it, there's little to keep you interested in the single-player mode outside of the fact that you can collect up to 70 different runes, which allow you to cast different spells.     To offer padding once you fall out of interest with the Story Mode, Koei has included a multiplayer mode that supports up to four players. You can play alone with three CPUs, or you can have some friends over and kick it split-screen style. Sadly, you can't actually play the Story Mode cooperatively. Instead, there are several different unique environments packed with all kinds of different enemies. Like the single-player mode, though, this will only hold you and your friends' attention for a short time unless you are fond of the hack-and-slash fighting mechanics.   Graphics Mystic Heroes graphics engine must take on the difficult task of displaying dozens and dozens of characters on screen at once. Each of them possess simple and varying AI, but the massive amount of them is certainly impressive. Unfortunately, the draw distance suffers because of this. Koei has kept the framerate up to 60 and mostly solid with all the magic-casting particle effects, but the whole tone of the game is foggy.   It's not the most impressive engine in the world, save for the number of characters on screen. It serves its purpose well enough with smooth animation and moderately complex player models, but it's nothing that will catch your eye. Textures are often blurry and seaming is a frequent problem.   No progressive scan support for HDTV users.  Sound There is nothing exceptional going on here. The music is certainly the best aural component of Mystic Heroes. It's kind of epic sounding and does get you in the mood for battle. On the downside, the voices are very unfitting for the characters, and the usual sound effects heard in battle will become redundant very quickly. There's no surround sound support either, which makes for an all around minimal audio experience.Mystic Heroes is simple and to-the-point arcade action. I like it for the immediate satisfaction. You can jump into the game and start testing out buttons and attacks without too much consequence. It also has a very old school flavor that I enjoy. Battling through hordes of enemies and then taking out a huge boss is pretty enjoyable. The catch, however, is that all this becomes pretty dull after a short time. It's too much of doing the same thing over and over. Multiplayer helps amend that a bit, but even then, chances are you and your friends will want to turn to something that has more depth. I think Mystic Heroes is ultimately a title aimed at a younger demographic. If you're 8-14, you may find it quite captivating. I would liken it to a good action movie. There's no frills, just raw action. To other semi-interested players, I definitely recommend a rent if you want to invite some friends over to accompany you.", "date": "Oct 10, 2002"}
