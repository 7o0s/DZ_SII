Crypto Does Vegas Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/01/destroy-all-humans-crypto-does-vegas-review", "text": "Mars Attacks! was a fun movie. For some reason, we human beings like to see our own destruction. Whether it's by aliens, snow storms or the regression of our intelligence with human beings like Paris Hilton running around dumbing down the planet, we like it when we're dead. So is this mobile game where you kill humans carry on this great tradition in entertainment? Sadly, no.   Playing as the alien Crypto, your assignment is to destroy all the humans in Vegas and figure out the reason for missing DNA. Destroy is a top down view game with really simple controls. Left and right to rotate the crosshairs of your weapon and the center button or 5 to fire. That's it. Problem is, you don't really control Crypto. He just kind of seems to go wherever he feels like going.   Your basic weapon is the Zap-O-Matic that zaps the humans and kills them on the spot. The Plasma Blaster kills humans and also destroys any objects in your way. Disintegrator Grenades are lobbed at your enemy and can take out multiple humans with just one well placed throw. The Gloom Gun stuns the humans, leaving them in a depressed state. While playing this game, I suspected the weapon had somehow been turned on me.) You don't get to choose between weapons. Each level is different and you'll use different weapons throughout the game.   Some missions are simply you killing humans. Others have you making sure humans are stunned in certain areas so they can be picked up. Or some levels require you try and avoid the humans. If any human touches you, you will lose a life. If a cop shoots you, you lose a life. You get three lives per level but the ability to throw your cell phone at your cat because the crappy controls keep causing you death are unlimited.   The graphics are sharp and colorful. The humans all look really good, but there isn't a whole lot of variety in them. Most are dressed like Elvis impersonators or police officers, and you'll also run into bigger enemies later on. The police officers are the ones you need to zap first because they're the ones who can shoot you.   After each level, your score is tallied and an award is given if you complete a level without losing a life. Get this award for all of the levels and you receive a bonus level but I have no idea how that's possible when the controls, not the humans, are your biggest enemy. You can replay any level after you've completed it to try and pass it without dying. Good luck with that.   Since all you do is press left or right to spin the crosshairs around, Crypto moves to assigned paths indicated by arrows on the screen. Press left or right and it should move Crypto to a different spot. But for some reason, on certain levels he will go to assigned arrows no matter what you do. In level 11, you're inside a casino and have to avoid the humans until a weapon can be dropped to you. No matter how many times I played the level, Crypto seemed to be on an assigned path that would lead to me losing a life every single time I played it before I got my weapon. No matter how many different ways I tried to move him, he followed the same path and died in the same spot every time. It's frustrating and it killed what little enjoyment I was getting out of the game to begin with.   While the explosions and graphics are nice, they can also get in the way. Sometimes you can't see bullets coming at you because there are too many things exploding around you. Bad enough the controls are trying to get me killed, now the graphics are trying to as well.  Destroy All Humans may look nice, the controls and pacing just kill what could have been an enjoyable experience. Now if youll excuse me, I have to go find my phone. My cat picked it up and ran off with it.", "date": "Apr 1, 2008"}
