Mappy. Galaga. And, of course, Dig Dug. This is a game that likely requires no review. It's fans are legion -- all they will need to know is if the cellphone port even remotely approximates the classic arcade dirt farming experience.It does. And quite well, too.We downloaded Dig Dug on a shiny new LG VX8000 and it looked crisp and clean, a remarkable facsimilie of the arcade game. The Pookas and Fygars were spot-on, even the titular hero mirrored his classic look to the pixel. It's so nice to finally start getting arcade ports that really look like their quarter-munching counterparts.The game controls just fine with the thumbpad. All you need to worry about is moving in the four essential directions. And the air pump, mapped to the ~OK~ button, is quick on the draw. We have absolutely no complaints about the control. When we died, it was our own damn fault for either getting greedy with falling rock bonuses or trying to cleverly juggle several enemies with the air pump.If you are a fan of the classic (and you better be), there is no reason why you shouldn't download the game as soon as it appears on your deck. It will provide a good hour of two of nostalgic pleasure -- as well as remind you of a time when it was a killer concept, not killer visuals, that got us hooked on the hobby.", "date": "Mar 17, 2005"}
