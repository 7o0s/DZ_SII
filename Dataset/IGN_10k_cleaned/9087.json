The result, White House Rumble, is just as playable as its genesis material, but the political goofing falls surprisingly flat. Timed to capitalize on the momentum of the upcoming primary season, White House Rumble unfortunately leaves out a number of headliners and lopsided heaps barbs on the right side of the aisle.   The game offers absolutely nothing new to fans that have already played Super KO Boxing. White House Rumble is designed squarely to attract mobile gamers attached to brands and/or recognizable names. The boxing mechanics are exactly the same, the flow of the game doesn't alter a step, and most of the strategies you mastered from Super KO are ported to the new game without any loss.   That being said, White House Rumble is still a great boxing game. Super KO Boxing's brilliance has not diminished in the months since its successful launch. It is still the best boxing game you can find on mobile and I seriously doubt anything but a real-deal Super KO 2 could dethrone it.   As mentioned, the politics of White House Rumble just feel off. The game swipes at some low-hanging fruit, such as a loose caricature of George W. Bush in Apollo Creed shorts and Dick Cheney brandishing a shotgun. Al Gore makes an appearance, giving him an enormous apron of fat and a monkey on his back. Anybody that's watched the refreshed Gore take the world by storm (no pun intended) know the man has seemingly left the events of 2000 in the past. And since he's pretty much ruled out a run, the joke feels stale here.   These guys are evergreen, so in a way, I understand why they are in the game -- but the selection of White House hopefuls is uneven. Hilary Clinton comes off fairly well in her pantsuit, but turns ogre-ish when she's mad. Barack Obama is presented as a saint, which is a light poke at his good guy image. Rudy Giuliani, on the other hand, is a zombie with a creepy head tilt and eyeballs that hang from his sockets. Why? I checked out Teh Webs for some hint at inspiration but found none -- and I doubt Glu is ballsy enough to link the zombie riff with criticisms that Guiliani traffics on the dead of 9/11. Why not goof on that cross-dressing video that thrives on YouTube? The amount of scorn the GOP gets in White House Rumble grossly outweighs the jabs at the Dems to the point it's seriously noticeable -- and thusly, distracting.   By the way, where are the other candidates? Why not trade out Al Gore for John Edwards or Dennis Kucinich? Where's Mitt Romney? There are plenty of fun things Glu could have done with their characters, such as tweaking Romney's ~whatever I need to say~ image. Kucinich's height or vegan diet are fair game. Joe Biden's bellicose nature is another missed opportunity. And so is the unhinged fury of Mike Gravel.   The cartoon work in White House Rumble is solid and the animation is still tops. The artists did a great job with little details like turning the ring bell into the Liberty Bell, crack and all. The audio is also still ace, with good themes and digitized voice work.White House Rumble is a good boxing game with a promising theme, but there are just so many missed opportunities here. The easy targets, missing names, and lopsided ridicule distracts from the overall package. If you've played Super KO Boxing, take a pass on this -- you're just buying the same game twice. And if you haven't played Super KO Boxing but are intrigued by the potential of political satire, just go for the original game. It's still one of the best games on the decks.", "date": "Sep 24, 2007"}
