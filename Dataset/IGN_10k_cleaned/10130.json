The Sony crowd has The Show, 2K weighs in with the MLB 2K series, and arcade spin-offs like The Bigs and MLB Power Pros keep things interesting for the non-sim crowd.  America's favorite pastime may be dropping in television ratings, but it's certainly found its niche in gaming amazingly well.   With PS2, it's the same story each year.  You've got Major League Baseball 2K on one hand, and the Sonly-exclusive MLB: The Show on the other.  Each year we pit them against each other, and each year swarms of baseball fans take their sides.  With PS2 on the way out as the leading platform, however, more time is being put into the 360 and PS3 builds of the game, as PS2 is lumped in with the Wii for the current-gen crowd.   Sharing a development cycle with Wii can be a bit of a scary situation, as you never know how much time is put into which version, and whether or not modes and depth will stick.  2K8 sits right up there with Nintendo's version, but that doesn't mean it's a gimped experience, as 2K8 for PS2 actually one-ups the Wii version in the online department.  You'll still need to know how to work the count, be strategic with your bullpen, work your lineup, bring players up from the minors, and read the Inside Edge scouting reports if you want to succeed.  It's intelligent, realistic baseball.  The Wii/PS2 version in action.  Looks decent, but nothing to write home about.  Where things turn sour though, is in the lack of depth to the core MLB package.  Gone are the minor league teams (you work with the minors, but don't actually have the ability to play games using them), but the trading card system and online remain.  2K commented on the lack of online for the Wii version, mentioning that it was about working with the control this year, and leaving online for later MLB games, but on PS2 it was a matter of bringing in the already tried and true online experience, and letting gamers take this one on the road once again.  It's a shame to miss out on those other features though, and it could mean substantially lower sales for this version of MLB 2K8.  Serious gamers are going to go with the 360 and PS3 builds if they own the systems.  In addition, there are some obvious corners being cut with PS2, as numerous gameplay glitches still occur, the schedules are oddly borrowed from 2K7.  The next-gen love isn't here, and it can be felt.   Put all that aside, however, and you've still got a pretty comprehensive game of baseball, and one of the most reliable sports designs out there thus far.  Pitching is handled with the classic three-stage timing mini-game, moving your cursor around the strike zone (and beyond for forced balls) to match up with a very well designed catcher AI system that actually places its glove in the batter's colder hit zones.  We were worried that sharing development time with the Wii could have made for a lesser PS2 experience  out with the old, and in with the new  but that isn't the case.  Control is still great, but it lacks the new analog pitching system that the next-gen versions got, and that's a shame.  It's still a classically created game of ball, but it isn't anything innovative.   Fielding is a pretty simple affair, but the important point to make is that it works.  Aside from a few motion controls added for Wii, the experience is nearly identical in both Sony and Nintendo's systems, and acts like any other game of ball out there.  Sure, we'd have loved to see the new control system for PS2 owners, as they've been loyal for years now, but you'll have to follow the series onto PS3 for that honor.  Still, the experience is stronger than ever, and we can't fault it for a little added polish here or there.  Like pitching, battling has remained traditional as well, so while you won't get anything too amazing in the gameplay department, it works, and it's still fun   The only other major gripe we have is that batting is a bit too simplified.  You can pull the ball in specific directions just like on Wii, but aside from that it's all timing based, and power hitters aren't exactly the most balanced of batters.  We had a season opener where Justin Morneau of the Twins hit four home runs in a single game.  He followed that home game up with another two in the next two games, and ended up with a total of eight home runs after 11 at-bats.  He's good, but he isn't a 72% home run hitter; that's superhuman.   Even despite some of the rougher specifics in gameplay, 2K8 is an extremely fun baseball game, and on a system that has serious competition with The Show, 2K has stepped up and made sure current-gen gamers still feel loved.  Franchise mode is a blast, complete with create-a-player (no stat cap), the Inside Edge system where you actually purchase scouting reports pre-game to add to your ability to play opposite of specific players on the opposing team, and some of the best commentary out there  easily the top offering in any baseball game on PS2. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan put together an impressive commentary on the game, complete with specific facts and info about every player in the game, history on the game of baseball (which launches after you put the controller down or let the game idle), and satisfying play-by-play calls.  There's also an on-field tutorial that can be accessed at any time mid-game, and extremely deep stat tracking for calculated pitching scenarios and strategy.  There's certainly room to grow, but this is a pretty strong effort considering PS2 is now the little brother of the big bad next-gen consoles.  On a system thats had plenty of baseball games already, and houses one of the best series in a long time with The Show, 2K8 might be a tough sell.  The PS3 is starting to gain speed, the primary consoles are switching from the PS2 (and already dead Xbox) over to the next generation, and because of that you wont find too many incredible options or serious PS2-specific devotion in 2K8.  At the same time, you still get a pretty impressive piece of software with 2Ks latest offering on PS2, complete with most of the bells and whistles youd expect, an online mode that still rocks, and some of the best commentary in the game today.  For our cash wed still stick with The Show as the primary choice on any Sony platform, as its really making some strides in both gameplay and visual offering, but if youre a fan of 2K specifically, 2008 brings yet another solid year of ball.  With that being said thoug h, the amount of glitches and quick corner-cutting shows exactly where 2K's devotion went this year. It's still a fun game of ball, but the PS2's days are numbered, and this is a token sign of that truth in motion.", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
