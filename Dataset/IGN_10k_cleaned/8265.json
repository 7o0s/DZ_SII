It has good graphics, smooth control, intuitive special moves, and fluid animation.Unfortunately, the characters are all robots. While this may not seem so much of a problem at first, after awhile you realise you just don't care about these guys - they're robots after all. You can't identify with them.   That's too bad, because the action is fast and furious. It's not as smooth as, say, Battle Arena Toshinden, but it isn't distracting. They've even added a few new touches to the genre, like being to prevent ring-outs by hanging on to the edge of the ring before pulling yourself back up. It's just that damn robot factor. Android fighters may appeal to some, but unless it's C3-PO fighting IG-88, I just can't get that in to it.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
