But Ubisoft, which paid Konami for the rights to publish the 1989 coin-op version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the upcoming movie-based game, has lit a little fire of joy in many gaming hearts this week.    Ubisoft's Xbox Live Arcade remake of the 1989 TMNT arcade version, not to be confused with the sequel Turtles in Time, is an unblemished port of the original that includes four-player simultaneous support -- and four-player Xbox Live support. It's the perfect package of old-school arcade gaming, popular licensed material, and online leverage. Not to mention a smart way to create hype for the upcoming movie.    Playing the game will revive great memories for many folks, but looking back at old games is not the same as playing old games, as XBLA has taught us. Gaming is not only different now because of the way games have changed and grown, but game-playing difficulty has been eased up for today's game public. The core nature of today's games is different from the basic nature of arcade games. TMNT was designed to steal, erm, I mean ~prompt~ you to put just one more quarter into the coin-op slot. As such, the value of your game was tied into beating that ~Insert Quarter~ sign that flashed at you after a cheap death. It was a challenge, and that challenge meant you had an incentive to learn all the skills possible to outsmart the quarter-munching mentality of the game. The fewer the quarters, the more time spent playing while other were waiting, the better you were.    Now, in this XBLA version of TMNT, players pay an inexpensive $5 (400 MS points) to download the whole XBLA game. This is a great bargain, and it's really what all XBLA games should cost. We thank Ubisoft for charging the right price for it. But, once you get into it, because quarters aren't an issue, TMNT's inherent design loses some of its tension, verve and immediacy. There is no burning desire to beat that ~insert coin~ sign. The game gives you 20 lives to beat the five stages, which is way more than enough to finish the game. For example, I downloaded TMNT this morning at 10:30 am and beat it before 11 am with Erik Brudvig. I beat it again in the afternoon by myself. I died a whole lot of times, but apparently not 20 times. Was it short? Yes. Easy? Yes. Was it the same experience as playing it in 1989? Well, it wasn't quite as rosy, let's put it that way.    The issue requires some retrospective thinking. Back in 1989 when we were kids, quarters had more value and TMNT was an example of a good looking game. Eighteen years later that same game is neither expensive nor good-looking. Furthermore, the burning issue back then, with all arcade games, was that they ~stole~ your money. We all wished then that we could just pay a set price and then play through them for as long as we wanted. Now it's 2007 and we have been granted our wish: The game now costs $5, or 20 quarters, which is generally cheaper than it cost to beat it back then, and the game now is not only relatively easy, the lack of quarters is a problem because it lessons the game's value.   What a quandary. The solution? Be careful what you wish for, and once you get your old-school arcade classic, the one you ranted on the message boards for eons about, you had better not complain about beating it in 20 minutes. Or, pretend you don't have that many lives and strive for pure competitive glory (and even a few achievements). Me? I was impartial to the game in 1989. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it. TMNT was fun basically fun to play with friends, but not a good game to play by yourself.   Still, in recent months I grew strangely excited to play it just because the idea sounded like fun. After all, you say ~cowabunga!~ enough times and you get excited. Bringing TMNT back is a great idea so long as you loved the game back then. But if you didn't? Ubisoft/Konami's game ends up being a pure sentimental favorite with little modern-day value except the basic technical fact that it's online for up to four players. And even that is essentially giving you the same thing you had before, only now it's across Xbox Live instead of playing three other pimply, sweaty dudes you didn't know.    There are two modes: Single-player, which offers the ability to play with three others offline -- others can instantly jump in and play at any time -- and Xbox Live mode, which enables two to four others to play the same exact four-level game online. The modes are split: You can't play online and have another local player jump in, and vice versa. The game offers leaderboards, some smartly designed Achievements (don't get blasted by a boss's flame thrower; knock down all signs, don't get turned into a baby turtle by Shredder and so forth), voice-support, and some basic options.    The actual game mechanics are so simple it's startling. There is an attack and a jump button. Press two buttons together for a special move, and press jump and attack afterward in conjunction with the analog stick, to pull off a jump kick. You can pick any one of the turtles as long as they aren't already taken by another person. There are five stages that scroll from left to right in a 2D plane, with a few fun ones mixed in like the skateboard stage and the elevator stage or the vertically-scrolling stage. Oh, nelly!   Visually, TMNT is packed with colorful 2D sprites and a dark yet comical, apocalyptic vision of New York's streets. The Turtle animations are pretty good considering the time they were created, and the music is super cheesy, but the whole notion of ninja turtles that love pizza, turtle power and all that, well, there is still some strange, wonderfully horrible attraction that gives the turtles never-ending resonance. There are a handful of bosses with patterns to learn, and together with one, two or three other people, you can pummel, punch, throw, and jump your way to a win in an easy 20 minutes.   Honestly though, there are a few basic strategies for TMNT, like crowding enemies into corners, or jump-kicking the pole-bearing enemies. Each turtle has slightly different moves -- some are quicker or have longer reaches -- but let's face it, it's not a brain-powered activity. And the game is designed to kill you. It forces you to die multiple times and spend more money (except now you just die and restart for free). Since the tension of quarter-munching has been removed, there is so little skill required, and the things you actually do are so minimal, the game, despite its color and energy, ends up being rather flat, tension-less, and for lack of a better word, forgettable. Once you beat this one or two times over an hour, you'll want to do something else.   I realize this is probably not the popular opinion, especially among IGN's own readers, but I can only write from my own experience. After having beaten it a few times both offline and online, and realizing it's more simplistic and offers less replay value than, say, Ms. Pac-Man or Dig-Dug, I admit to being disappointed. TMNT is no doubt fun for sentimental reasons, and it's far better to play with friends -- it's sure to make you laugh (at it) -- but it's so short one hardly gets the chance to feel nostolgic before it's over.", "date": "Mar 15, 2007"}
