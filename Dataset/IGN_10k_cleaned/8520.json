But one genre that has so far stayed steadfastly in Japan is dating simulators.   Konami and Backbone Entertainment hoped to break the genre to US gamers with Brooktown High, a game where your entire goal is to pick up on the opposite sex while maintaining your grades (if you care to). It's certainly unique on this side of the world, but unfortunately we now have a clue as to why it hasn't caught on over here before.   Another day, another rejection. The game starts with your character's creation. Your personality is determined by answering a few simple questions before you get to pick your name and how you'll look. Clothing is limited to start, but your allowance and possibly a job will net you enough cash to pick up some new threads as time goes on.   Each week is pretty simple. On Monday morning, you have 30 minutes (which is about a minute of actual gameplay time, give or take) to get to class, but before then you can chat it up with any of Brooktown's students. Once you go to one of the four classes, you're fast-forwarded to Friday where you'll automatically partake in any job or club you've signed up for. All of a sudden it's Saturday where you can spend your morning studying or practicing a mini-game, and then if you have one set up, you'll go out on a date. As soon as the date's over, it's Monday morning again.   The game seems rushed when you first start, but you'll come to realize that the pacing is pretty spot-on in that you have enough time to talk to a couple people and perhaps set up a date before class, and then the rest of the week flies by fast enough that you're not waiting for long. So the pacing and general idea works fine, but the actual execution is lacking in a number of areas.   The local goth chick is into, well, everyone it seems. For starters, you'll find yourself in the midst of the same conversations time and time again, and though they'll sometimes change on dates depending on where you are, when talking on the phone or at school you'll wind up hearing the same things over and over and over again. We had Elektra, the local goth chick, tell us her ~new~ haiku more than a couple times, which is as follows:   Empty plastic bag  Suffocation, strangulate  Gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp   There is voice work in the game, but it's of a limited nature. You may (or may not) hear someone say the first line of a conversation, but you're left to read the rest on your own. It's good that there are voices present in some form, but it's a little disappointing that there aren't full conversations here. Given the amount of dialog and music that have appeared in numerous other PSP titles, like the Grand Theft Auto series especially, we don't imagine the developers ran out of disc space (or if they did, they needed better compression).    But that isn't the only problem with the conversations. Many times you'll only find two answers, one positive and one negative, not allowing you to deviate the chit chat from its destined course. Some do, but certainly not all. Also, you don't always know what your options mean. To make things work a little more naturally, rather than have to read through each of your entire responses you'll find little phrases like ~Compliment her~, ~Dis her~ or ~Let's go somewhere else~. This is a nice idea, but when your two responses are ~Too sexy~ and ~Too busy~, it can be difficult to determine which one is positive and which is negative. It's not always clear, and having to guess at your dialog doesn't help when you need to guess at their response to you in the first place.   What all of this talking eventually leads to is some sort of make out session, though some of you may be disappointed to know that you don't actually ever see any sort of physical interaction between characters. These scenes of intimacy are instead replaced by real footage of things like flowers blooming, oil rigs pumping away and a guy jumping in the middle of the street. No, that last one doesn't make much sense even when you see it in the context of these videos. Even the dancing mini-game has each person standing off by themselves and jiving in their own ways.    These hippies aren't dirty. While you won't ever actually see any of the juicy bits that go down, Brooktown High's mini-games are an interesting way to let you play some of them. The kissing mini-game has you control a pair of lips as you dodge some objects while collecting hearts and spraying back bad breath, but we only had to play this once during one school year even though we were constantly hooking up with a number of different girls. The dancing mini-game is only of use during the high school's three big dances, and we never actually came across the blackjack game in the course of normal play.   Perhaps most disappointing is that Brooktown High features a couple of presentation issues. For one thing, even though none of the load times are all that long, the game will need to load each and every section of the game. So if you change clothes, it loads. When you head out to school, it loads. When you talk to someone, they load. When you bring up your PDA to check your schedule or call someone, it has to load. And so on and so forth. As you can probably guess, this slows down the actual play experience quite a bit even though the actual pacing aside from this is quite good.   The computer lab is where the action's at. But perhaps the biggest problem for some people is that the game simply would not work with our 4GB Memory Stick. This is the same official Sony stick that we've been using for months with every other PSP game that's come into the office, and we've never had a problem before. The game told us that there wasn't enough free space for the save file, which is less than one megabyte, even though we had more than two gigs of free space available. So those of you who bought the basic pack without an included Memory Stick and then ponyed up for a 4GB stick, you'll have to run out and pick up a second, smaller card.Brooktown High is certainly a unique game outside of Japan, but it's also not a good one. Conversations are too repetitive, and given that they're the core element of the game it doesn't help to see the same thing over and over again. Some of the mini-games are interesting, but you rarely ever get to play them. And though it may sound perverted, a dating game where you never even see anyone hold hands is missing the boat entirely.", "date": "May 23, 2007"}
