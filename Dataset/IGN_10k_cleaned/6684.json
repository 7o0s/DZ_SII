World Poker Tour, Midnight, Downtown, Celebrity, etc. -- each with their own hook or angle to lure the fickle consumer out of their five bucks. Gameloft's Sexy Poker 2006 knows that sometimes the easiest way to a man's wallet is through his zipper, and has released an updated edition of its strip-tease card game. You could dismiss the game as base and gimmicky if it wasn't for the fact that it offers a solid game of poker.   Actually, Sexy Poker offers three variations on poker -- and mercifully, none of them are Texas Hold 'Em. You can play traditional 5-Card Draw and video poker, or indulge in a little blackjack. Each game is boosted by good presentation (and I'm not talking about the ladies... yet), such as easy interface and crisp visuals that make reading the card, bet amounts, and whatnot effortless.   Now, about those ladies -- here's the rub: None of them get completely naked. In fact, none of them really get anything beyond PG-13 because carriers don't quite cotton to nudity just yet. (Across the Atlantic, it's a completely different story.) However, they all certainly look alluring and seductive, graced with come-hither eyes and tempting poses. It's just fun eye-candy -- a little titillation and nothing more. (Should you find yourself turned on by a mobile game, your five bucks are better applied to therapy.) However, it is likely best to keep Sexy Poker out of the hands of younger players.   Clothes act as currency in Sexy Poker if you manage to take all of their filthy lucre. A dress is worth a few hundred bucks, which lets them keep playing. You, however, have no such back-up, so once you bust out, you lose. The ladies play smart, trying to bluff from time to time, but never really go nuts on stupid hands. You're gonna have to work for that cleavage, pal. At least once you manage to sneak a peek, you can access that image from a gallery option.   As with all Gameloft productions, Sexy Poker 2006 looks great. The ladies are all drawn exceptionally well by talented artists. They wear expressions that reveal their motives, and you need to always keep an eye on that while playing. Gameloft's new tradition of using licensed music at the start-up screen continues with Donna Summer's ~Hot Stuff.~ That's just cool.  Gameloft's Sexy Poker 2006 would be just another poker game if it wasn't for the half-naked women -- there's just no way around that. It features solid game play with multiple modes, but if you already have a poker and/or blackjack game on your phone, Sexy Poker isn't going to bring anything new except the bra and panties. And for a lot of people, that's gonna be enough to push the download key. And, trust me, I'm not here to judge anybody on that.", "date": "Mar 3, 2006"}
