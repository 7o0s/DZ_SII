It's a big deal. You may be part of the vocal minority who disagree, and you're entitled to do so, but the numbers just don't lie. We're talking more than 47 million units sold over the past decade. We're talking about a series that has moved PlayStation consoles off shelves like no other. We're talking about a videogame whose creator, Kazunori Yamauchi, made Motor Trend's 2007 Power List of those who make a significant impact on the automotive world  ahead of the CEOs of Honda and Ferrari. We're talking about games that have directly influenced many a car customer's purchasing decisions across the globe. The original Gran Turismo, still the best-reviewed racing game since 1995, was the bestselling game for the PlayStation, bar none. GT2 was third. The only titles that outsold GT3 on PS2 were Rockstar's all-conquering GTA games, with GT4 close behind. It's the business. It's the boss. It's the big wheel down at the cracker factory. And it's finally back.   Kinda.   What's perhaps most important we express early on is that Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is, admittedly, a far less cynical exercise than Gran Turismo 4 Prologue ever was. The latter was little more than a series of increasingly more frustrating license tests to introduce you to GT4's refined handling model. To its credit, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is somewhat more than that. There really is more of a game here than we were expecting and, while it's only a thin slice of what we anticipate the final product will offer, at AU$59.95 we can't really begrudge it. Think of it like GT Lite. We've paid more for less.      GT5 Prologue ships with a fraction over 70 cars, six tracks (plus some alternate variations) and a smattering of modes. The single-player experience is by far-and-away the most robust part of the package, where the usual GT career progression is condensed down into 30 events over three classes (plus a further 10 upon completion). As in the past, you'll be rewarded for your performance with cash, and you'll be required to use it to fill your personal garage full of suitable rides. The events are generally races, although they're broken up by the occasional time trial (with a full field of AI opponents in a wide range of vehicles doing the same thing) and overtaking challenges (where you'll be required to move from last to first in the space of one lap). We found the time trials, no longer solo exercises, quite tough. You can, of course, utilise faster cars than your own to draft behind down straights (should they present themselves at the precise time) but you'll also find passing slower traffic can hamper your efforts. Still, it's a satisfying challenge. There are also one-make manufacturer races to be found at most of the dealers, as well as a standalone arcade mode which includes the drift trials introduced in GTHD.   The rides themselves, naturally, are the stars  and the Australian release of GT5 Prologue is buoyed by around 30 addition vehicles not seen in the Japanese release. The range is quite vast although, to be expected, it lacks the breadth of full titles like Forza Motorsports 2 at this point. Fans of the prancing horse ought to be stoked; expect to see quite a few Ferraris for the first time in the series. The 599 from GTHD is joined by the F430, the F40, the '76 512BB and even Formula One champion Kimi Rikknen's official Ferrari F2007. There's plenty of other automotive goodness to be had, and most tastes are catered for. Euro thoroughbreds like the Aston Martin DB9, Audi R8 and Jaguar XK Coupe line up against contemporary US grunt like the Dodge Viper SRT10 and '07 Ford Mustang GT. Rice rockets like the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, Subaru Impreza WRX STI and the all conquering brand-new Nissan GT-R take on hot hatches like the Renault Clio, '05 Volkswagen Golf V GTI and the Ford Focus ST.    While we still have a while to wait until the full game arrives, GT5 Prologue is a beautiful and nicely featured distraction.  There's a noticeable lack of much classic US muscle to speak of, save for the 1960 Art Morrison-tuned Corvette. Some of the 60s/70s hulks that were well represented in GT4 would have added a little more spice to the otherwise varied roster. It's also a fraction disappointing a little thunder from down under didn't make the cut for this GT5 entre either. Local fans will no doubt recall GT4 was bolstered by some homegrown muscle from Holden and Ford Australia and, particularly with Codemasters giving Aussie V8s the flick for Race Driver: GRID, it would've been nice to have been assured they'll make a reappearance in GT5.   Criticism aside, though, the cars look absolutely remarkable. We have it on good authority the average car in Gran Turismo contained around 4,000 polygons. The figure for GT5 Prologue apparently exceeds 200,000  and, in some cases, there are over twice as many cars on track as in the past. We always felt a little lonely on track in past GT games  six cars doesn't really cut it. Forza Motorsports 2's eight was a bit paltry too, but GT5 Prologue can accommodate double that (although not on all tracks). All at a silky smooth 60 frames per second and a blisteringly sharp 1080p, mind you. The amount of detail in the cars themselves is mind-boggling, and the attention to detail unparalleled. We started our GT5 Prologue campaign in the latest in a long line of fast Fords, an electric orange Focus ST  which most canny Australian readers may recognise as the XR5 Turbo, albeit in two-door form. Activate the all-new cabin view and you're treated to a meticulously modelled and eerily authentic recreation of the Focus' cockpit  from the additional gauges mounted on the dash down to the orange and graphite Reccaro seats. The exhaust note is spot on too, the distinctive rumble of the Volvo-sourced five-pot under the hood turns into a spirited growl as you push it through the rev range (that reminds us  turn off the music). Listen closely and you can hear the subtle whine of the turbo winding up, and back off the throttle and the hearty roar pops into a subdued hum as you downshift.     We chose to describe the ST specifically because this writer has thrashed the hell out of a real one and can honestly attest to the accuracy. It looks perfect, it sounds perfect, and there are another 70 cars in GT5 Prologue that we don't doubt are just as steeped in real-world detail. Unfortunately, but not entirely unexpectedly, real-time damage does not feature and the cars remain as invulnerable as ever. As a result, shunting opponents to 'supplement' your braking is still a tactic the unscrupulous can employ  although there are penalties to prevent this as you reach the business end of the game. This is one of the two areas where the almighty GT has been left wanting by the likes of Forza Motorsports 2 (the other is visual customisation). The damage in Microsoft's premier racing sim was a tad superficial compared to the brutal and unforgiving terminal damage system in the likes of, say, V8 Supercars 3  but it was welcome. The trade off, of course, is visuals that completely bury Turn 10's admirable effort, and magnificent interiors that, in our experience, car nuts go positively stiff in the pants for.   Immersion? Check.  The tracks themselves don't disappoint either, although we do have our favourites. Daytona is surprisingly cool when the exceedingly narrow and twisted infield segment is added to the more familiar oval, and London is a triumph. It's not only incredibly fun (and hard to master) it looks unreal. You'll probably be going too fast to appreciate how each building is lovingly pieced together, although you'll be hard pressed not to gawk at the fantastic lighting effects as you whip through the shadows cast by trackside architecture and the sunlight piercing the gaps quickly slides across the dash. GTHD's Eiger Nordwand gets another run, as does the High Speed Ring  a series stalwart. Real-world circuits Fuji and Suzuka round out the six.   Of course, GT5 Prologue's ace-in-the-hole, so to speak, is its online mode. Unfortunately, it was also the area in which we were least impressed. Head online and the already slick interface is augmented with a nifty calendar world map, complete with rotating weather details around the world (so, you know, you can be in the loop when it's a bit chilly at Le Mans). You're also able to access one of (at this stage) 33 online events, most of which are races, and you'll earn credits from these races that can be used offline. Unfortunately, with no real matchmaking options to speak of it's all a little arbitrary and impersonal  you just pick one of the pre-set tasks and wait for the game to link you up with other players.   Hands-down one of the best looking games on the PS3, and certainly the prettiest racer out there.  We can't speak definitively until we get a chance to go up against local competitors, but our time with the game online was a tad patchy. The experience was silky smooth for us, but opponent cars always seemed to be a bit jerky around bends and occasionally flittered disorientatingly about. Pile into the hairpin at the end of Fuji's main straight at the same time as five other cars and things disintegrate quickly, although the game generally makes a good show of temporarily disabling the collision judgement for sudden, erratic attacks on other cars to prevent unfair play. You'll get a nudge here and there, but hurtling around Daytona one opponent tried to sideswipe us off the track as we attempted to slingshot past him (or her) only to be rendered transparent, pass through us and spin out on the infield. It's not realistic but it keeps things civil. We also liked the online time trial functionality  hop in your favourite car and hit the track and you'll be updated every lap how you stack up against the rest of the world. It's neat, and keeps you coming back. Still, next to the far more robust online offering of a racer like Forza Motorsports 2, GT5 Prologue's is quite rudimentary.  We do imagine, however, Polyphony will learn a lot for the real deal when Gran Turismo 5 releases in 2009. In the meantime, we feel we might get more mileage out of the two-player split-screen mode, new to the local version of GT5 Prologue.   Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, really, is the biggest demo you'll ever play. There honestly is more to do here than in many full-price titles, despite the fact it's merely a teaser. It's barn-stormingly beautiful and feels sublime, and even though the online racing seems like a bit of a dud, we're sure Polyphony can update and improve it. Honestly, GT die-hards (and there are millions of them) should lap this up.", "date": "Mar 27, 2008"}
