I assume not many are raising your hands, as everybody and their dog has played this game at least once. Having been around since the Genesis, Road Rash has enjoyed a long, full life. Isn't it time it had a well deserved rest?  There's no denying the basic premise is a promising one. Race your motorcycle against a bunch of other bikers through cities and across countrysides, beating the crap out of them as you go. Let's not forget getting to beat the cop, too (heh, heh). And there's no denying this latest version looks the best ever, better even than the 3DO version, which set the stage with FMV and a soundtrack by Soundgarden. But snazzy cut-scenes aside, there really isn't anything here we haven't seen before. I've never thought much of the Road Rash series on the Genesis, and the design on the Game Boy Color doesn't do anything to up my opinion on the game. The programming's great; the engine is one of the better behind-the-vehicle engines on the system. The game itself fails to excite with any intense gameplay...a game that has the potential of being a modern day, Ben-Hur Chariot Race ends up as exciting as riding a tricycle on the driveway.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
