However, just releasing a vanilla version of Five Card Stud or Texas Hold 'Em would have given the mobile maker zero traction. So, Best Direction turned to classical inspiration for their take on the card game of kings and scoundrels -- the American West. There have been other card games with oater overtures, but Best Direction combines their theme with an intriguing set of mechanics that make this unlike other poker games.   At the start of a hand, you're given five cards and asked to choice two keepers. Once you've picked the best pair, you go into a shooting gallery. To finish your hand, you blast cards from scrolling rows with a six-shooter. Power-up cards are mingled with the regular cards. These power-ups include extra time or slowing down the cards to make shooting your preferred hand easier. You have a time limit -- artfully rendered as a stick of dynamite with a fast-burning fuse -- for choosing the remainder of your hand. If you don't pick three cards in time, the game will randomly assign them on your behalf... and you can be assured that the results are rarely pretty.   Even though the method of selecting cards in slightly unorthodox, the game adheres to the universal rules. You bet between choosing cards, you have an option to fold if things don't quite go your way (or you don't have the stones to bluff), and in the end, the highest hand walks away with the pot. It's a pleasing combination of tradition and a stab at innovation, even though I must confess my occasional frustration at the shooting gallery mechanic and the sheer difficulty of pulling off an amazing hand. Yes, getting to the top row, where it seems the best cards mostly reside, should be a challenge. But being denied a great hand time after time by only a few pixels can inspire the kind of language used in HBO's ~Deadwood.~   Shoot'em Poker employs great production values -- from the sound effects to the art style. The game is populated with real Wild West heroes, such as Will Bill and Calamity Jane. Their portraits appear as old-timey photographs, complete with weathered sepia tones. It's a nice touch that should please Western fans. The gunfight scenes sandwiched between the choosing which cards to throw away and the shooting gallery are also well done.  The poker genre is oversaturated -- so it will take a certain degree of cleverness to poke through the noise. Best Direction's Western-theme has been done before, but the art style and atmosphere in Shoot'em Poker is currently without parallel. The mechanic of blasting cards from a shooting gallery is a neat idea that may turn off purists (by all means, download WPT or WSOP then), but should appeal to casual players that dig on things like Poker Pop which apply -- and I know this is a clich -- a new spin on an old idea. Definitely worth a look.", "date": "Jun 12, 2007"}
