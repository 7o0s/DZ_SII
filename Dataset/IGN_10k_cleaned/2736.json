You either make a very realistic sim, a silly romp, or a mixture of both.  Hypnotix' Outlaw Golf tries to be a mix of both, succeeding to an extent, but falling short of golf greatness.  Featuring a cast of outrageously lewd characters, Outlaw Golf has humor in bunches, but doesn't manage enough solid golf gameplay to make it a true winner.   FeaturesTen outlaw golfers to choose from  Three unique courses  Innovative composure meter measures your nerves  Plenty o' costumes and unlockables  Narration by The Daily Show's Steve Carell    Gameplay  The backbone of Outlaw Golf is the humor.  From the deadpan commentary of the announcer, voiced by The Daily Show's Steve Carell, to the crude golfer celebrations, to the beat downs you can put on your caddy, OG will definitely get you smiling.     At first, only four golfers are available, but there are six more that can be unlocked through superior play.  Malfeasant doctors, gyrating strippers, domineering dominatrixes, and other hooligans are all part of the OG crew.  Each comes with their own interesting caddy along with a slew of brash phrases to keep the chuckles going.   Controls are relatively straightforward.  You can zoom in to the location where a ball will land, change clubs easily, and see a gridline of the grass to judge putts.  Prior to swinging the club, you can choose how the ball will be hit.  Move the aiming cursor to draw the ball or lob a shot with spin.  Club swing doesn't require any timing as far as button pressing goes.  Instead, you pull back on the right thumbstick for power and then push forward to let the club fly.  Shanking occurs when you don't push the thumbstick straight up.  A little to one side or the other will keep you from getting good club on the ball.   Overall the mechanics of Outlaw Golf are pretty solid.  The game can be a little too forgiving, so that if you aren't perfect at pushing the thumbstick straight, you won't always end up with terrible shanks.  Putting is handled in an interesting way as well.  When you've lined up a putt to your satisfaction, press the X button to see the path of the ball.  Then adjust your shot as necessary.  You can press the X button three times for a putt, allowing you several chances to best align your putt.  You still have to get the power right and not miss-hit the ball, so it's not an automatic assurance you'll make a shot that's lined up properly.   Unlike other golf games where you can shank shots with impunity, Outlaw Golf gives some meaning to poor shots.  A composure meter measures a golfer's nerves.  Hit a good shot and the meter begins to fill.  Pooch a shot and it goes down.  When you're rattled, shots are more likely to go wrong and when you're on fire, you'll really sense it with some powerful, accurate shots.     To help climb out of the pit of low-nerves, golfers can cash in a ~beating token~ and smack the crap out of their caddy.  A cut-scene begins and the player must perform a very simple form of Parappa to properly execute strikes on their caddy and fill up their composure meter.  Though each golfer has a few different things to say as they beat their caddy, the animation remains the same each time, which is, well, boring after about the third time through.      Outlaw Golf offers a variety of games, including an exhibition mode, mini-games, and a career mode.  Some of the games can be a blast to play.  For example, one has a version of speed golf, where you have to try and clear holes as quickly as possible.  While the overall games are good, the variety in the mini-games is a little lacking.  Basically you get to either drive the ball long or make putts for points.  Making three separate games for the putting contest is a bit misleading.  The course stays the same, only the number of points required to pass changes.  So if you consider this to really be one mini-game with three difficulty settings, the depth of Outlaw Golf's ocean becomes a little shallow.   Outlaw Golf comes with three playable courses, which in the end hurts the game considerably.  It would have been okay to have only three courses had they been well designed.  But while the players are extreme caricatures, the courses lack any of that fire and flare.  Worse still is that the course aren't much of a challenge.  The gameplay itself is challenging, but most holes are set-up so that you only need hit the ball straight to get on the green.  That kills part of the challenge of golf.  Drawing when you hit the ball is only necessary if you happen to shank one.  But as long as you hit it straight, you won't have to use much of your golf brain to succeed.   Outlaw Golf excels in attitude.  There's so much humor packed into the game, it's a great set-up for a golf title.  With multiple costumes, plenty of characters, and some really raunchy demeanor, this could have been a must-have.  But Outlaw Golf stumbles when it comes to actually being a game about golf.  For a while the presentation and humor will keep you going.  But eventually the humor gets old and all that's left is the golf.  And that's not a good thing here, because the golf is a bit uninspired.   The composure meter is a good idea, but seems to not really provide all that much to your overall play.  But the real hurt here is in the course designs.  Go back and check out some other golf games and it's pretty easy to see that the OG courses are too simple, with few hazards and no real challenge.    Graphics  There's some nice character designs in OG and each character has plenty of costumes to choose from.  At first glance, the game looks nice, but once it starts playing, there are a lot of ugly things to be found.  The trees and grass textures look good and the courses have some nice touches like passing trains and animated spectators.   But those courses could have been much more over the top.  They hardly manage to match the crazy golfers in terms of zaniness.  In fact, the courses aren't zany at all.   Jaggies abound here and just about everything looks like it needs more touch-up.  There's a lot of in-game loading, especially when the game switches from one golfer to the next.  This is something that really shouldn't be an issue in an Xbox game, and certainly not in a golf game where there aren't many variables for the system to worry about.     At times the animations look good, especially the celebrations (who can deny the appeal of two women thumping against each other?), but then there are places where the animation is very stilted.  The biggest offender is in the caddy beat-downs, where the animations are rarely smooth.  The final punches jump a bit and then the game pauses when it looks like the character is about to throw another fist.   Sound  The humor comes mostly from the player comments and announcer commentary.  Steve Carell is a riot as the announcer, offering some truly hilarious barbs at the player's expense.  Things like: ~He's shooting for the win... no, just kidding, he's only shooting for par!~  The characters have a variety of different sayings, most of them chuckle-worthy.  The characters are very distinct and the voice acting is superb.   There's not a lot to the 5.1 here, but there are a few nice touches.  Claps and cheers from the gallery are pretty standard, but hearing the train pass overhead and continuing to hear it in the distance as you advance on a hole is a great touch.  Nothing too stunning as far as ambient sound goes.  The music is a shade towards 70's porn and a perfect fit.  Some will absolutely hate the tracks, so it's a good thing they aren't too dominant in the sound field.     Outlaw Golf is a pretty good game.  The presentation and humor take it a long way and there is some longevity in completing the many tasks.  But you can't have a golf game that doesn't offer quality golf.  And the course designs just don't work here.  For a game that's supposed to be extreme, the courses are incredibly tame.  This isn't a bad pick-up if you want a game with humor and girls with undulating bodies, but if you're looking for a great golf game to last you a few months, this is one to walk away from.", "date": "Jun 13, 2002"}
