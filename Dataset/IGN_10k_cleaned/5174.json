System. Believe me, this game wasn't meant for the arcades, so I snagged a copy immediately after I played a quarter's worth. It was a great game then, and it's a great game now. The action and game design is as timeless as Super Mario Bros. is; the concept may have been improved in future sequels, but you can really see the series off to a great start in its original outing on the NES.Of the four games released in the second volume of Classic NES Series titles, the one that's the most significant and most recommended of the four games is easily Castlevania from Konami. Though the Game Boy Advance already has three games in the series, it's great to return to the franchise's roots for Simon Belmont's very first trek into Dracula's castle.Castlevania is a perfect emulation of the original NES game released in the mid-80s, introducing Simon as a vampire slayer on a trek through a castle with whip in-hand. By slashing at lamps and wall structures, players can upgrade Simon's abilities with a longer whip, or enhanced undead-slaying weapons such as daggers, cross boomerangs, time-freezing clocks, or high-arch axes. It's a platformer by design, requiring players to skillfully leap from ledge to ledge while avoiding (or killing) enemies that get in the way.The original NES game did not have any cartridge save back in 1986/1987, but what it did have was a Level Continue on the title screen after you died. The highest level would be kept in system memory until the power was cut, so most people simply left their system on so they could get through the game without starting from scratch. This element was fixed for the Famicom Disk System in Japan, which allowed for save slots to the actual game disk. But since the Classic NES Series game is based entirely on the US release, Castlevania has the Level Continue save, enhanced by the GBA cartridge's SRAM save that keeps this data in memory as if you've never turned the device off.Even with the limited save feature, Castlevania on the GBA is still a great retro throwback. It would have better fit as an unlockable in an original Castlevania, but as it stands it's the only official way you can have the original game in portable form. It's the best game of the second batch, by far.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
