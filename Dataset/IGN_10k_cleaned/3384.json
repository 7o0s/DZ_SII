In fact, DOAX itself is a lot like finding out your favorite Playmates are into model ship building or stamp-collecting as much as you are: the quality of volleyball is good enough that you have another, more legitimate reason, beyond the two most obvious ones, to spend some quality time staring and drooling at their physiques.   The burden of proof was on this Team Ninja developed game to convince Xbox owners that this was going to be more than an excuse to simply ogle at computer generated semi-nudity. The excellent beach volleyball system prevents DOAX from being an over-priced technical demo with bikinis. That perception, though, will be hard to change in the minds of the general public who can't or won't get past what they can see with their own two eyes in screenshots. But anybody who takes the bold step of actually playing this M-rated title will be in for an enjoyable experience that takes a gambling game, a relationship management system and a sports simulation and jams them all together into one friendly package.  Gameplay  The main focus of DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball is the single player ~vacation~ where gamers choose a character to control through a two week stay on Zack Island. You see Zack has taken his gambling winnings seen a the end of DOA3, purchased an island in the middle of nowhere and tricked all of the female fighters from the DOA universe to show up there by promising a fourth DOA tournament. When they get there, the seven ladies, plus one newcomer realize they've been duped but decide two weeks of volleyball on an island paradise might be fun as well.    You're there to play volleyball and you're given full control over the character you've selected, but it's also on you to develop and maintain relationships with your volleyball partner and any potential partners during your stay. The game has a natural separation between playing the volleyball matches themselves and performing all of the activities related to volleyball partnerships.  The volleyball itself is not only deeper than we expected it to be, but it's deeper than it seems at first glance. Your partner is controlled by the CPU according to the strengths and weaknesses of that particular character and you're only going to be using two buttons to control the actions of your character. Like any good sports sim, DOAX asks you to balance doing everything yourself using your character with getting the most out of your teammate. Bumping and setting using the ~receive~ button and spiking and blocking using the ~attack~ button make for simple controls because all of the moves in the game are situational and merely require you to use the right timing. That is, you'll only be able to deliver a crushing spike when your partner or the opponent has set you up with an easy ball near the net. Your character's leap will be automatic --this is how you'll know it's time to attempt a spike-- but it's up to you to time your attack, the intensity of the spike and the location all in the blink of an eye by reading the position of the ball, your player and the defense. And that's just the mechanic of the spike. Every other move in the game like the jump serve and the block has its own timing that you will be compelled to learn. Furthemore, it's imperative that you pay attention to your partner's tendencies and level of aggressiveness at all times, because different girls play different ways depending on the strength of the team. A successful volleyball team in DOAX is one where each player facilitates the other's play style consistently, but the challenge is you're only in direct control of your character.  The game makes you learn the volleyball fundamentals in a very subtle yet unforgiving way. Even the greenest player will be able to easily get the ball over the net consistently during a match because the controls are that simple and the collision detection is that forgiving as far as positioning your players on the court to make a play on the ball. However, over the course of a two week stay on Zack Island, you'll notice early on that the simply getting the ball over the net against some of the better teams is simply inviting them to punish you with spike after spike. You can always tap your ~attack~ button to make sure your team gets the ball over on the first, second or third hit, but volleyball is a game of pressure and opportunities. Playing fundamental v-ball means delivering a kill or going for a black whenever you get the chance with the understanding that putting this pressure on the opponent will eventually lead to a break in your favor. DOAX captures this element of the sport beautifully.       You can rely on your CPU teammate to do most of the dirty work or deliver the glamorous kills, but either way you're going to have to do your part to support them. If you want to play near the net receiving and delivering spikes or if you want to play the backline, keeping everything in front of you, you'll have that option and your partner should know what to do in reaction to your moves. The game allows you to move your partner into different positions using the right analog stick while the ball is on the opponent's side but they'll make the plays automatically. It's up to you to facilitate their play one way or another. But this only scratches the surface of your relationship with your partner.  The girls of DOA are touchy, fickle and rude as often as they're happy, kind and accomodating. You'll have to deal with all of it as you push your way through the game. Lisa, the new American characters, is the default partner when you begin a stay on Zack Island, but every girl has their pre-disposed attitudes towards one another that has to be accounted for. Tina and Lisa are natural partners, for example, so it will be easy for the two of them to remain partners, but you'll need to give gifts to maintain and establish relationships with every combination of characters in the game. Gifts are simply items that you've purchased at the Accessory Shop, the Sports Shop or the Zack of All Trades general store and gift wrapped.   The key to a girl's heart is to give them gifts that they'll like so they can grow to like you, cleverly indicated by musical notes (something tells us they used to be hearts) floating above their pictures during dialogue scenes. But the time system of DOAX is such that you only have three chances to a)play volleyball b)interact with other characters and c)relax with a pool hopping minigame or other ~relaxation~ method in a day. You have to budget your time and your money wisely because you have to build up enough scratch to first buy the items you want to give and then anticipate the time you'll have to spend delivering it. The whole thing makes for an extremely interesting relationship management system because you want to make sure you have enough time to do everything you want. If you find yourself without a partner and you're in a hurry to give gifts so you can woo another partner, the time you spend asking the target to be your new partner adds another time pressure to the equation. And these relationships are not just sideshows either.    The relationship between characters can be felt on the volleyball court. Teammates that have been together a long time will be noticeably tougher and cohesive than a pair of newbies. Your CPU partner will get your back when you go for blocks or she'll always set you up for a good spike when you're near the net when your team is firing on all cylinders. Bad pairs will miss easy lobs and come up on the short end of any tight play at the net. Good teams stick together by winning and giving plenty of gifts and the two go hand in hand since a blowout victory (7-0 or 7-1) can yield over 100 thousand Zack dollars, the island's currency. With money like that, dropping 45K for a yellow swimsuit that LeiFang can wear or a white volleyball that Helena will really dig for 5K is no problem. If LeiFang is your partner, but you're trying to keep Helena on the side just in case things sour, you're ahead of the game. The variety of gifts you can give is exhaustive. Hundreds of swimsuits and items that range from the sensible (sunglasses and sunblock) to the bizarre (a submachine gun or the prototype silver 'X' Xbox?) will keep you shopping in DOAX for weeks. You can buy those sensible items in your girl's favorite color (yellow for LeiFang) or pickup special items that only certain girls will really dig. A cheap yellow seashell will appeal to both LeiFang and Helena since one will like the color and the other loves aquatic items. Knowing which girls like what is perhaps the most critical knowledge a DOAX player can have because it will make your shopping and gift giving that much simpler. Wasting time and money buying the wrong gifts will drive you absolutely nuts especially when one of them throws and expensive gift, like a diamond, in the trash because they don't like it.   With eight girls, hundreds of items and a limited amount of time, DOAX exerts a unique kind of pressure on the player that's separate yet still intertwined with the volleyball. When your partner gives you a swimsuit that you don't have your character wear, your partner will notice. Likewise, you'll know your partner is a sought after volleyball player if you see her wearing items and outfits that you didn't give her. When your volleyball play starts to suffer, you can check those musical notes and you'll see why. The pimp in you can take pride in the fact that accessories and swimsuits you give to other players will show up on the volleyball court when you face them as opponents and can even cause friction between those teammates. But at the same time you'd be smart to keep your partner laced with plenty of new stuff. The relationship management mechanism wouldn't be nearly as fun if it didn't affect the volleyball game or if you could simply overcome those negative effects with your superior skill.       It's easy to overlook the gambling in DOAX since it's a basic simulator featuring blackjack, roulette, slot machines and a poker game. It's a good way to boost up your dollars if the volleyball matches aren't going so well for you, but like any gambling videogame, you never know how fair that gambling program is going to be. The slot machines can be especially unnerving since some of the higher payout machines also have ~losing combinations~ where three or maybe even two of the same icon on the payline will actually deduct credits from your account. Nothing will send you through the roof quicker than losing 30K on one pull of a slot machine. But the wise DOAX player will hit the casino and pay attention because clues to the likes and dislikes of the DOA girls are all over the gambling games. Why is Tina always on the clubs while Ayane is always spades? LeiFang always seems to bet a huge pile of yellow chips on one particular number in roulette doesn't she? How come there are so many animals on the reels for Hitomi's slot machine? There are more clues throughout the game, some of which we still haven't' figured out, to be honest with you, but we really like the clever way Team Ninja handled this part of the game.  You can play consecutive vacations by continuing with the same character after your two week run is over. Your money and items will all remain in tact but relationships are reset to default. It's here that the game's item system gets a little cumbersome because you'll often reach a point where money is no object and it's simply a matter of new items becoming available in the stores before you can buy them. Collecting had better be your passion if you're going to keep smashing through multiple vacations on Zack Island. Otherwise, you're going to be feeling somewhat unfulfilled once you've acquired some of the more elusive swimsuits like the leopard suit (complete with tail and ears) or the million dollar, barely-there Venus swimsuit.  The multiplayer game is engaging despite the fact that it's limited to two players, a side effect of the dynamic swinging camera system. When going head to head against a buddy it more or less becomes a game of ~attack the other guy's CPU partner~ but this strategy can be countered as well. We haven't paid nearly enough attention to it as videogame observers, but the head to head multiplayer aspect of DOAX is what will end up carrying this game down the road, just like we saw with Dead or Alive 3. And this game, just like the fighting title, has the legs to do it, if you'll pardon the pun.  Graphics  With DOAX we could be looking at the best character models and animation ever seen in a videogame. We knew the ladies themselves would look stunning coming into the game, that's the kind of confidence you can have with Xbox screenshots and Team Ninja's ability to get the most out of the system. But we were blown away by the fluidity and intricacies of the volleyball related animation sequences. The lighting is also impressive with unique effects for bright midday sunshine and brilliant sunsets. All of this beauty is easy to enjoy thanks to surprisingly deep camera control players will have during movie/replay sequences    During a volleyball match, every player on the court tracks the location of the ball and their bodies turn and adjust so that you never get any unnatural head turns like in The Exorcist. This goes for human and CPU controlled players. The headtracking is sophisticated to the point that you'll see players look the ball into their hands as they set up for a bump or diving dig. All plays on the ball look realistic to the point that you'll even recognize mistakes and mistimed plays. If you get a late jump on a ball and barely miss digging it out, the character will still follow through on the motion to show you that you had the right idea, but were too late in executing. A spiked ball that comes zooming in on your character will cause her to be ~handcuffed~ as she tries to receive it on a bump with her shoulders and arms hunched up and she'll likely be off balance. On the other hand, if you get her in position with her feet under her, the same spike will be handled with ease as she gets full extension of her arms to bump the ball into play.   The accuracy of the animation is critical since so much of the volleyball system depends on timing. There are no on-screen indicators telling you when to do what, so you'll have to pay attention to what's happening on the court, the location of the ball and other players to know when to attempt high risk moves like spikes and blocks. Once gamers get used to this fact and the active camera that slides left and right to show the action on each side of the net, it's easy to see just how much emphasis Team Ninja wanted to put on the volleyball elements of the game.   The camera can be moved and panned using the left and right analog sticks during the mini-movies, replays and other idle scenes in the game. Using the left trigger to toggle between two alternate camera angles, the squeezing and holding the right trigger to zoom in and the white button to pause and freeze whatever is on screen means you're supposed to enjoy all of the gorgeous scenery. You can even advance the picture frame by frame using the black button if you want to, ah, prolong the scene. All in all, this depth of camera control almost makes up for the fact that there's no full replay control of any kind. It's the game's own fault, really. The depth of the volleyball in DOAX is such that you'd expect it to have a full-featured replay system like any other sports game worth its weight.      The finely sculpted DOA girls truly set a standard for how good characters can look in videogames. They're stylized to be sure, but their exaggerated features aren't so extreme that you get the feeling Team Ninja is cutting corners. There are women in the real world who look like the DOA girls, believe it or not, you just won't find them all hanging out in one place like that playing volleyball unless you're talking about the Playboy Mansion. In fact when you consider how close and personal you can get with the camera in DOAX, it's amazing that there aren't a ton of flaws waiting to be detected. The appropriateness of the girls' proportions, and we're not just talking about their upper bodies either, should be a matter of taste then, because we're impressed with how well and how consistently they've been rendered. The game's few clipping issues are limited to clothing items that get mixed up with other static parts of the environment, but aren't bad enough to take too much away from the visual effects.  Sound  The built-in soundtrack fits the fantasy-beach theme well, but the other sound elements of the game are below the standard set by the game's graphics and gameplay. All of the characters speak Japanese or broken English with heavy Japanese accents. This wouldn't be so bad if the voice samples weren't repeated so often during volleyball matches and neglected everywhere else.   Tunes by the Baha Men and even a well hidden jam by Bob Marley highlight some of the other rock/pop/reggae tunes by other lesser-known acts. However, because you can use custom soundtracks, this certainly shouldn't be a problem. The radio station on Zack Island allows you to pull whatever tracks you want from your Xbox hard drive and program as many as you want to each day section in the game. If you know you want your entire Sir Mix-a-Lot collection to play during evenings and you want that Melissa Etheridge set for those early morning matches, you have the freedom and the tools to make it happen.    The girls will say the name of their partner during volleyball matches to let you know who's supposed to make the next play on the ball. You'll learn every character's name this way and even each girl's accent since there are separate voice actors for each. Other sound samples include ~nice spike/block/serve~ but they're done in heavy Japanese accents so that ~spike,~ for example, is a two syllable word, ~spike-uh.~ But all of the voice samples are so excessively cute and giggly that they stop being enjoyable early on in DOAX's lifecycle. Also, Dennis Rodman's bringing his alter ego to life, Zack, ends up being limited to a couple of movies at the beginning and end of the game and even then, The Worm only does certain parts. This couldn't have been the comeback he was looking for.  When you're not in the sand digging and spiking, you'll hear your character making a comment here and there during stays at the hotel or whilst frolicking and relaxing on the island. During shopping, inventory management and Casino play, there's no talking of any kind, just music. The game outside of the volleyball segments ends up feeling more hollow than you'd expect.  DOAX is particularly difficult to review because it delivers on its promise of controllable, near-naked models even though controllable near-naked models isn't what the game should be about. The volleyball part of DOAX begins as an afterthought to the girls, but really ends up being the greatest strength of the game. The fact that every character in the game is showing off plenty of flesh never became irrelevant even when I was locked in a close match where every bump, set and spike was crucial. Beautifully rendered women and solid volleyball is what was required for this game to be taken seriously, so in this regard, the game was very satisfying. However the item system that's intriguing initially and ends up scattered combined with some missing presentation elements end up being bigger negatives because the rest of DOAX is so well done. Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball wasn't attempting to do too much more than put the voluptuous DOA girls on a beach playing volleyball. That's what we were given, nothing more, nothing less.", "date": "Jan 22, 2003"}
