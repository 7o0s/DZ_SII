The game at the company's booth was a slick arcade racer with an ambitiously advanced graphics engine, and at the time all it really needed at the time was a bit of tweaking in the gameplay department. Game developer Adeline didn't disappoint in its final product, as Moto Racer Advance is one of the slickest arcade racers on the Game Boy Advance.  This game is loosely based upon the Delphine motorcycle series established on the PlayStation systems a half-decade ago. The Game Boy Advance game is not a port; it's a ground-up racing development that takes serious advantage of the Game Boy Advance hardware strengths. The game isn't realistic by any means; the designers set out to create an amazingly fast, smooth, and satisfying racing experience on the handheld, and the team definitely succeeded in the task. Features Three styles of racing Cartridge save (one slot) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Moto Racer Advance features three different styles of motorcycle racing: Motocross, GP and Traffic. Motocross puts players in wildly-varying off-road terrain, with tons of jumps, bumps, and slippery surfaces to deal with; players must learn the art of ~powersliding~ on the Motocross tracks in order to take turns without losing forward momentum. GP is more tailored for open-road, pavement biking where a healthy control over the break is required.  Traffic is a combination of Motocross and GP racing, with tracks that feature off-road and pavement designs with on-track obstacles for the racers to deal with; racers can use either types of bikes in Traffic that's more suited for their style of riding. Both types of bikes have a turbo boost that can be activated by holding down the shoulder button, but it's limited by a power bar that needs to be refilled after every use. And using this option also puts you at risk; hitting an obstacle or opposing rider will send your biker skidding to the ground.  These three modes of play can be accessed in single race or championship, but the mode where Moto Racer Advance really shines is Progression. In progression, players work their way through a progress tree of several different races in each of the three different racing styles. As players win the races, they'll unlock additional bikes, tracks, and racing abilities. The familiar ~quick start~ feature is in this game, but racers not only have to earn the ability by advancing through the progression mode, but they also have to ~type~ it in at the proper moment using the D-pad and action button. And developers cleverly ensure that gamers actively leap between each of the three different styles of races by having better motocross cycles unlock in GP races, and GP cycles unlock in Motocross races. And with several dozen different races and championships to complete, progression takes a good amount of time to complete; this isn't a simple weekend excursion. Adeline even shows players what they can earn by ~graying out~ all the unlockable stuff in the game...if that's not encouragement to keep playing, I don't know what is.  While it's honestly gameplay that ultimately matters (and Moto Racer Advance does excel in this department), it's hard not to gush about this game's incredible graphics engine. The game doesn't feature any trendy texture-mapped 3D models; the developers worked with the GBA's strength of manipulating sprites and backgrounds to create one of the fastest and smoothest 2D-style, behind-the-racer engines ever seen on a game system. Detailed roadways rise, fall, and curve with incredible fluidity, with tons of roadside obstacles that zip by with amazing speed. The draw distance is also very impressive, as the road flows off into the distance to show the rider where the track's heading. The lack of polygons does mean that players don't have quite the freedom of stopping, turning around and going in the opposite direction, but that limitation doesn't hurt the game at all because the design is tailored like an arcade racer and not a racing simulation.  Moto Racer Advance doesn't set out for the ~realism~ aspect of racing; it's more along the lines of Hang On, Pole Position, or the umpteen different racing games that hit the arcades and game systems during the 8 and 16-bit days. The designers not only worked an amazing engine that features 3D-style effects using 2D graphic tricks, they also made sure the game played as tightly and as fun as possible. Moto Racer Advance features a huge amount of stuff to uncover in its different modes of play, and even after several hours of play you still won't have seen it all. This one's highly recommended, folks...it's definitely one of the top racing games released in 2002.", "date": "Jan 13, 2003"}
