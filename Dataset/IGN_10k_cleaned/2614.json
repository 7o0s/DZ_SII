It won plenty of accolades from the strategy gaming community for its well-balanced armies and thoughtful use of history to make some incredible campaigns and addictive multiplayer battles. But with the good came the frustrating. Masses of troops that could reach into the thousands if you wanted were incredibly hard to handle on what could quickly turn into a truly messy battlefield where half of your troops could be annihilated without you ever realizing it until it was too late. While there were a couple of minor improvements to take some of the stress of managing so many troops away, The Art of War is pretty close to the pure definition of expansion. It pushes the amount of content forward without making many incredible updates to the gameplay itself.   The Art of War comes with a bunch of new stuff fitting into the ~expansion~ theme nicely. First off, you'll get two new nations, Bavaria and Denmark, with their new building art and one unique unit along with the basic plusses and minuses that each nation gets tacked onto it. There are also several new units for some of the other nations including a bunch of new naval vessels for all of the nations. Along with the new units and nations there are several additions to the Cossacks experience in the way of 30 new levels total including 5 new campaigns and 5 stand alone missions. It'll probably take you quite a while to make it through all of these, not necessarily because of the difficulty, but because of the strategies you have to adopt to beat them tend towards the drawn out sieging type of conflict.   But that kind of fits with the series. I don't think I'd really ever consider Cossacks as a game for the casual RTS fan. It can be extremely complex and frustrating for a bunch of reasons. First off, the resource model of the game, while automated for the most part, takes a while to get up and running and take care of. Making sure none of your peasant workers get captured and enslaved by the enemy can be a tough problem if your attention has been diverted elsewhere. Many of the single player missions will be pretty linear with a group of units at your disposal without the opportunity to get reinforcements like commanders might have faced in real campaigns. This alleviates the micromanagement crunch and allows you to focus on the battles. At the same time, you'll get a lot of very straightforward linear levels where you'll move along a set path laying waste to things along the way. This is interesting and all as you have to figure the best strategies for getting around specific obstacles, but removes a lot of your options for attacking from different angles. The theme of the missions included here seems to be pounding away at the enemy. You'll find yourself embroiled in some long sessions of bombardment from afar drawing games out for much longer than many gamers will be used to in an RTS.   Adding to the expansive time consumption is the addition of the gargantuan maps that will either drive you nuts or give you the feel of an epic war... mainly you may actually find yourself playing a seven year war. While I didn't time it, I've seen that on the biggest map, it'll take your slowest unit an hour and a half to move across from one side to the other. Maybe it's just me, but that isn't something that I would really want to brag about. Sure there are ways to get around this by building new settlements as you move your way across so you can bring all of your slow moving troops as you make your way across, but after playing one of these maps for a couple of hours, it was just too much in a game that already borders on being too much.   Luckily for us there was one really major addition to the gameplay that's worth mentioning. That's the addition of a pause and command feature. Now you can control your troops with a little more precision than you used to be able to by pausing, giving orders, and unpausing to watch your maneuvers take effect. What were once totally chaotic battles that were sometimes near impossible to control are now feasible if still chaotic. The pausing feature won't alleviate all of the problems that come with controlling a few hundred units in battle, but it will help out a bit so that your units will attack the units you actually want them to and you'll be able to assign the proper defenses where needed before the computer can stomp all over your slow face.    Too bad you can't pause in multiplayer, right? At least there's some new additions to the multiplayer as well that will add some new bit of spice and interest to the game. The biggest is the addition of peacetime. This option allows you to set a temporary truce where each player is confined to their own section of the game map for a certain amount of time ranging from 10 minutes to 4 hours. That much time might be a little much, but starting out without the cloud of destruction hanging over your head at the very beginning of the game is fairly nice.  Borders are marked by frontier posts and your units will not be able to move past this point until that white flag of truce is burned and left on the ground to whither like the fragile peace that the people of the land once celebrated.   The other major addition to the multiplayer is the global ranking system that will keep tabs on the outcomes of matches played in the league, which of course, gets everybody more involved and hyped up to play. Players that log in with their ranking name will get points every time they win a game. These points will show along with additions to an empty outline of a personal coat of arms that starts to fill in as you gain points and ranks. You'll also have titles appear by your name so everyone can see just how special you are. Or just how sucky you are. And laugh at you. And call you names. And make you feel horrible about yourself so you have to take the game out of your drive and burn it. Evil game! Evil people! I damn you and condemn you to hell! To HELL!   The look of the game is still the same with the aforementioned additions in terms of units and buildings for both the Bavarian and Denmark factions. Sure, it isn't the best looking thing around compared so some of the titles released in the last year or so, but I still count it among my favorites to look at simply because of the sheer variety of unique building art among the different nations included in the game. It's all pretty detailed and looks appropriate to the era and culture. Units are all pretty simple but are plenty good enough to play the game and be able to tell what's going on with the 8 billion units you can have on the field at the same time.   Sound is fairly decent as well with some of the music tracks much better than others. Acknowledgements and battle sounds are pretty well done as well with nothing that gets particularly annoying at any point.   Lastly but not leastly for you creative types out there is the map and scenario editor. It's fairly straightforward to use so those that have Cossacks will undoubtedly see even more historical scenarios pop up across the web and maybe even some of those fun ~what if~ scenarios where history gets changed around a little bit.   Cossacks: The Art of War isn't the best expansion I've ever played, but it fulfills most of its promises by expanding the amount of content in your game. Don't look to find anything really new or amazingly different about the game. But if you're just looking for some more Cossacks to play, then this will be perfect for your needs.Cossacks brought a whole lot of history into the RTS genre and managed to be pretty fun while doing it. Sure, it had its share of problems, but nothing that couldn't really be dealt with. The Art of War attempts to fix a couple of these problems in pretty easy ways by basically listening to what the fans have been clamoring about on the various boards around the Internet. It does manage to fix a few of these problems, but it seems as though those could probably have been fixed in a patch.But the fixes aren't where it ends and anyone that has been slapping their arms looking for some more Cossacks injection will probably be pleased by what they find. There's a bunch of new missions, new units, new nations, and a scenario editor that should keep the fun running for a long time to come.", "date": "Apr 12, 2002"}
