Oh, they smile politely when I tell them that I've pre-ordered Donkey Kong 64, or come to work dressed like one of the vehicles in Wipeout 3  but underneath it all, I think they understand that some of us just can't give up the console habit, despite our love of PC complexity. I cried, vomited, passed out and then cried again until I got Homeworld to review, and I did the same thing when Rayman 2 came through the offices. Want to know which one I had to fight for? Exactly. I'm in the fortunate position of wanting most of the games that the rest of the staff doesn't really care about  until they saw Rayman 2 in action at least. This is one of the few times that the fellow staffers came around to gaze at some of the incredible levels in the game, when cube-sharers from across the hall walked over because of the fantastic music, and when the console kids weeped in misery over not being able to play the game in all its glory (it's coming to Dreamcast, in case you were worried you'd never see a comparable version on a console). The greatest, most compelling thing about Rayman is that long after the graphics have faded, and the music has sunk into the subconscious (which they don't, actually), the gameplay and sheer smarty-pantedness of nearly every level of design make this not only one of the best platformers of all time, but one of the greatest PC games of the year. And most disturbing of all, this French-designed game now lifts the curse forever from French gaming. Try it:   ~Could you believe 'Sacre Bleu Fron Fron Fromage Dancers 2?' It was so beautiful, but it played like crap! Those French designers can never ~  ~What about Rayman 2?~  ~Oh. Oh yeah. Damn.~   I know that no matter what I say, there are those of you that won't play a console game on your sacred PC. Which is why I'm setting out to convince you of its merit in a Baldur's Gate slashy, Quake III bashy universe. The rest of you  go buy it. As nearly every white Korn listening teenager will tell you, it's ~super-dope flim flam count fat-ula word up on the totem pole.~ And now, for the skeptics:  1) It's pretty: Being that this is possibly the best year in videogaming ever, it's hard for even a stellar title to stand out among a league of extraordinary games hitting this month  yet Rayman seems to up the ante with what ends up being a living, breathing cartoon, but with all the freedom of a video game. This game doesn't look anywhere near realistic  its stylized beyond belief, from the non-limbed Rayman and his detailed animations, to the worlds that look as if you took animation backgrounds and inflated them into a 3D space. I've rarely seen textures this seamless, and almost never with this amount of detail. Someone over in France had to hand-draw a myriad of those beautiful things, and for that I salute him. Now get back to work. Unlike earlier 3D platformers, the environments in Rayman feel complete. The skies are filled with clouds, with beams of sunlight spraying highlights on the ground through the trees. Everything from dark caverns to lava-filled temples, to huge flying pirate ships are painted in the Rayman style, never ceasing to impress.  2) You'll never forget how it sounds: After blasting Tanktics all over the office, I thought the only response I'd get to music and sound effects would be shock and horror. Fortunately, Rayman 2 has put me back in the sunlight once again, with music so incredible that my neighbors have all but forgotten about that ~bleep bloop~ incident. People kept walking over, asking if I was listening to Danny Elfman, or a movie soundtrack. Ubi Soft has spared no expense or effort in their attempts to create mood through the music  from the big orchestra sounds of the first few levels to the harmonica and blues-guitar harmonies of the swamp levels. They're instantly tappable without ever becoming embarrasing  and thankfully, very, very un-platform like in their maturity.  The characters all speak in an odd gibberish that causes you to turn your speakers louder rather than off  especially the fly-like creature who gives you hints and tips on the game, and hums in a harsh, monotone whisper that's alternately frightening and hilarious. Rayman himself speaks like this: ~gabbo johsansalo, com-jha Rayman!~ Really, he does. He sounds... look, you'll have to hear it for yourself. Trust me when I say it's funny as hell, and worth keeping your ear out for.  3) The gameplay is beyond addictive: I'm not going to say ~it's as addictive as crack,~ cos' we all know that that phrase is way too tired, and besides, drug phraseology hasn't become well-known enough for me to say the all-new ~as addictive as GHB.~ Technology has grown to the point where designers are able to craft the escapist's dream, places where you don't just explore, but become lost in. Whereas Mario 64 leaned towards floating blocks and otherworldly ~game~ environments, Rayman 2 successfully mixes the best of both worlds. Butterflies nest on trees and plants, surrounded by waterfalls and pools  and yet you still have all the standard ~collect the object (in this case, glowing spheres called 'Lums')~ standbys that have become the backbone of platform gaming. Rayman still runs around collecting things, looking for exits, hitting creatures and jumping from one precarious platform to another. It's in the details that the game truly shines.  Take any of the rocket riding sequences, for example. Rayman must allow a rocket with legs to chase him until it gets tired, then ride it haphazardly through the level, only to dive off at the last second so it can explode on a specific door, giving you access to the next part of the level. Though he can speed it up, he can't stop it until it crashes, making for the equivalent of alien bull riding. In other segments, Rayman must carry an explosive barrel to a certain door  the only problem? He's got incoming enemies, which can only be defeated by tossing up the barrel, firing off a few shots, and then catching the barrel again. Touch the same barrel to a torch, and you've got a controllable missiles which can be flown through the air to access new areas. In another sequence, Rayman must avoid a creature chasing him, while you're given the jaws-eye view from inside the creature's mouth, complete with oozing drool which drips from its teeth. Giant plums can be plucked from trees and tossed into lava to provide transportation  the only glitch being that he can only move by firing off his shots on opposing walls. The list of game gimmicks goes on and on, and furthermore, each one is backed by easy control, and fun animation.  One big, big warning about the game however  you can't configure the controls. Yep, you heard right. You can use a keyboard or a joystick, but you can't reconfigure your keys. Why? I have no friggin' idea, only that while my analog gamepad moved like a dream, it was awkward to control at times, particularly when locking on to an enemy. Please please please tell me they'll have a patch for this.   It's not the most original of concepts  you've still got all the conventions of platform gaming involved in the mixture. But it's really the execution that makes it so interesting. Not since games like Zelda and Homeworld have designers mixed storytelling and gameplay so well. With all the added features, seamless action, and addictive level-structure, what Ubi Soft has crafted is a game that's all meat, and not gristle. No offense to those of you in the gristle lovin', marrow-munching community.  And in the end, you must remember one thing, whether you like the genre or not: it's $30. You spend that much money in your sleep, especially when you're sleeping underneath that bridge  you know, the one that you got ~rolled~ at last week? Yeah, that one. Anyway, the point is that if you want something to show off your computer, this is it. Oh, and if you want what might possibly be the best platform game ever made, this'll do pretty well.  -- Vincent Lopez The only problem with this game is that it was released long after versions hit store shelves for both the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Dreamcast. Simply put, if it weren't for the fact that the Dreamcast version of the game wasn't already pushing the limits of Sega's 128-bit system in terms of visual excellence and game design, Rayman 2 for PlayStation would probably stand out a lot more than it currently does. The simple truth is that some of the magic of the game is lost when you play it on PlayStation after seeing how beautiful the world looks on Dreamcast. However, that's not really a legitimate reason to knock the game and compared to its peers on PlayStation, Rayman 2 can hold its own against any other platform game on the system. The game has very few flaws, it's one of the best designed platform games of all time, and if you don't have a Dreamcast and you consider yourself a fan of 3D platform adventure games, there's no reason why you shouldn't go out and buy this game right now. It's right up there with Ape Escape as the system's best platform game and it's a better overall gaming experience than any of the Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon games.", "date": "Nov 19, 1999"}
