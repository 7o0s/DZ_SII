Pull over and stop at any time in Burnout Paradise and a few seconds later the game switches to a slow black and white flyover of Paradise City, backed by some of the most recognisable classical pieces of all time. It's the perfect counterpoint to the insane speed and over the top action of the game proper, and an almost laugh out loud surprise the first time it happens. It's clear, then, that the team has had fun taking the game that single-handedly revitalised the arcade racing genre and moulding it into a very different shape. And in theory, it's the perfect time to take the series in a different direction. Better to try something new than slowly lose relevance, right?   That was certainly our thinking when Criterion revealed the brave new world of Burnout Paradise. Now that we've spent some serious time with the retail code, however, we're not convinced the team has nailed it. Burnout Paradise is an impressive achievement in many respects, but the flame of the series definitely doesn't burn quite as brightly.   Powersliding is a man's best friend. At least, I believe that's the saying.  For those of you who haven't followed our coverage of the game and didn't play the demo, a quick bringing-you-up-to-speed-athon is required. As you'd know, Burnout used to be about firing the player down a tunnel at insane speeds while you battled rivals and either wove through traffic or simply knocked it aside. A fine balance between risk and reward lay at the heart of the series, urging the player to race harder and harder, with the twist that crashing was almost as cool as racing. Essentially it was crash-porn; Burnout elevated bone-crunching collisions into works of gnarled, twisted art.   Burnout Paradise, on the other hand, retains many of the hallmarks of the series  the speed, the takedowns and the crashes, but instead of shooting you through a tube, it plonks you in Paradise City  a sprawling expanse of motorways and city grids with a thoroughly unstructured approach to gameplay. You're free to hoon around as far and as wide as you like, and when you want a race, simply roll up to a set of lights, agree to the challenge available and away you go. No more working your way through a long sequence of events  this is freestyle racing.   Flame decals make a car go faster. That's science.  Everything has been tied into this approach. Traffic lights yield a number of different challenges: straight up races from the lights in question to one of eight end points aligned to eight directions on the compass; Road Rage challenges which allow you to race anywhere you want, as long as you keep racking up those takedowns; Marked Man challenges where your opponents are out to get you and you must reach an end point without totalling your car; Burning Route challenges which replace the Burning Laps of previous games and are essentially a time trial; and Stunt Runs, which charge you with combo-ing together a range of different stunts to beat the specified score.   There are a number of other challenges layered on top of that. By changing the road rules you can try to beat the best time for getting from one end of a street to the other. This is available for everystreet in the game, no matter how short or long. Same with Showtime  the new Crash mode which can be entered into at any time by tapping L1 and R1; each street has a score to beat. The city also has a huge number of Smashes (yellow barriers that section off shortcuts/other areas), Billboards and Super Jumps to find. Then there's online. Hit right on the D-pad and you can seamlessly join a game with up to seven other players. Whoever created the game can then set up races for everyone or set challenges such as meeting at the Baseball Stadium (which inevitably turns into a destruction derby) or catching 800 feet of air in total, with every player contributing in order to beat the challenge.    So the online integration is seamless and there's plenty to do. Sadly, however, Burnout Paradise just isn't as compelling as we were hoping. For us, the ability to take any path to the finish line of a race actually takes away from the joy of the series. Burnout was always about navigating the road ahead with blinkers on; a white knuckle experience where you're concerned with four things  taking the best line you can around corners, avoiding/checking traffic, beating/checking opponents and boosting your way past the sound barrier. As soon as you throw an open-plan environment into the mix things get less fun; the experience ceases to be as streamlined. Suddenly you're trying to work out what the best path to take is  often at 200mph and with plenty of pausing to look at the map.    The idea, of course, is that after playing for a while you won't be bringing up your map every twenty seconds. Instead, you'll learn the best paths around the city and the locations of shortcuts. Unfortunately, Criterion simply doesn't make it easy for you to do this. Stuff up a corner or take the wrong path and there's no quick restart option. Instead, you must trek all the way back to the junction the race started on to give it another crack. More often than not you won't bother because you're miles away and instead will choose another challenge, reducing your focus and making the game feel a little aimless. If we were able to retry races over and over again to find the perfect path it would be a different story, and learning the city layout would be a more welcoming challenge. As it is we found ourselves yearning for more traditional tunnel courses  or for a more intuitive street layout, ala Midnight Club.    Ridge Racer eat your heart out.  Presumably the team didn't implement restarts in order to avoid a significant load time. It's an admirable goal to keep loading to a bare minimum  and the resulting seamless world is hugely impressive  but we'd take load screens and a smoother gameplay experience over load screens and frustrations. After all, then we'd be able to select challenges from the map screen too, which would be another huge bonus. Players would still have to explore the city to find every junction in order to select it from the map, but it would make taking on challenges far more rewarding.   Indeed, that's not the only design decision we think is counter-intuitive. A number of junctions, for instance, are dedicated to Burning Routes, with a certain car required to take on the challenge. Instead of simply being able to swap cars on the spot, however, you must trek back to the nearest Junkyard (there are five in the city) to swap to the relevant car. It seems a pretty arbitrary call  given that other cars are loaded in before races, and means a lot of moving back and forth from the various Junkyards if you want to beat all the Burning Routes. Why not less us swap on the fly? Surely the team wants us to experiment with the different car types and to test out all the cars in the game?   Rolling down the street smoking endo sippin' on gin and juice.  So how do the other challenges and modes hold up? The new freewheeling Road Rage works a treat although veterans will find the going far too easy. Since you're free to go wherever you want, you'll quickly learn that a detour through one of the garages (to instantly repair your car) is more than worthwhile. Thus, if you're anything like us you'll be getting 60-70 takedowns when you need far far less. It takes a long time for this mode to become a challenge. Stunt Run, on the other hand, ramps up in challenge nicely, fitting its learning curve to a tee. It won't be long until you're building your multiplier by flat spinning off ramps and leaping through billboards, then boosting and drifting in-between ramps and shortcuts to keep the combo going. Perhaps you'll even try and factor in the locations of Gas Stations (another new addition which instantly refill your boost metre) to help keep the combo alive. Again, it feels a little aimless having to find ways to earn points in the environment from a relatively random starting point, but it definitely comes down to learning the map, area by area.    Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the game, however, is Showtime, the new Crash mode. Simply put, it's a shadow of its former self. There is simply no reason to give players the freedom to set off a crash sequence anywhere they like unless it's going to be as compelling as designated junctions. And it's not. The traffic isn't heavy enough in most areas, and even sections of land that would be perfect to create a massive pileup don't work by virtue of the fact that if you leap off a jump and onto the traffic below  that's your one shot. You can't simply try again unless you want to drive all the way back up there again. The system has changed, mind you, so now you earn boost by hitting cars which then translate into Ground Breaks, which let you hop your car  hopefully in the direction of more mayhem. You can chain together some impressive runs but it doesn't have the poetry the Crash mode once had.   Indeed, we always loved the lure of Crash mode; the feeling that each location was an elaborate set-up, a cunning puzzle to be unravelled to score maximum points. Which car do I slam into to start the chain? How best to hit this ramp? Now you have to go looking for that puzzle, and more often than not it fizzes in your face. Crash mode is meant to be constructed, and despite Paradise's open-world setting, Criterion still could have structured Showtime that way.   Not pictured: spectacular crashes.  As you explore the city and beat various challenges, you'll gradually unlock the game's 75 vehicles (many of which must be earned by spotting them driving about the city and taking them down  a very nice touch which means you can go from cruising to an out and out high speed chase in the blink of an eye) and experiment with each of the three types: Speed, Aggression and Stunt, each of which have their own strengths that are tailored to various challenges in the game. Again, it's a pity you can't swap on the fly, but the huge differences in handling, weight and boost systems really help give the game a number of distinct feels. A definite plus.   For all our nitpicking, Burnout Paradise is a very solid game, and it gets even better when you hop online. As mentioned earlier, the integration is seamless, and if you're with a good group of players (for best results  arrange sessions with friends) you can spend hours gunning around the city, competing in races, beating the huge selection of online-only objectives and trying to outdo one another in the many metrics the game tracks during online sessions (such as who has done the longest drift or jumped the furthest). We can definitely see the fans coming up with unofficial modes of their own too. And best of all, we were playing the game before it was out in Australia and experienced nary a hitch with its online performance - even in a field full of players based overseas.   Fully sick rims. And so forth.  Paradise is also quite accomplished in its presentation. The game blazes along at 60fps the entire way with no loading screens across the entire city. And this place is huge: from the dense, sprawling city grid all the way up to the winding mountain trails; from freeway runs to railway tracks; and from construction sites to quarries, it takes quite a while to see everything Paradise City has to offer. The palette is nice and muted too  realistic in tone, it lets the intense speed and bone-crunching crashes do the talking. Speaking of which, while the crashes are  once again  spectacular, resulting in incredible spins, flips and savage crumples, while bits of car invariably rain down, we're not too found of the new camera angles that accompany them. Occasionally they'll nail it  tracking a flipping car as it comes towards the screen with Hollywood-style impact. Most of the time, however, the camera system is trying too hard to be arty  quick zooms going in and out of focus, close-ups that fail to show off the scene properly and so on. It's still cool, but the porn could be better.  In fact, thats a pretty good sentiment to sum up Paradise as a whole. Theres definitely enough gameplay gold here to make it worth a look for fans of the series, but its a real pity that Criterion made the decision to make the game less user-friendly than it could have been. While Paradise still has the quintessential Burnout feel, it is quite a different game, and simple elements such as restarting challenges, selecting events from the map and changing cars on the fly would have made the transition to this new Burnout all the smoother. Still, its a blisteringly fast rough and tumble racer with a huge city and great online.", "date": "Feb 5, 2008"}
