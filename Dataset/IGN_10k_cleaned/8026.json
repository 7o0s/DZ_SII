He's forever throwing himself around tennis courts and football pitches, and still has time to get in a couple of rounds of golf on the way back to the clubhouse. His forays into the world of physical exercise have been pretty successful too, so much so Nintendo seems to have a bit of a winning formula on its hands - take a well-known sport, stick Mario and his buddies in it, add a couple of familiar Mario objects - red shells, stars, that kind of thing - and wait for the cash to start rolling in. But for Mario Slam Basketball Nintendo has handed the development baton to over Square Enix. The question is, has the Final Fantasy creator committed a foul with its first Mario sports title?   The answer is yes. And no. Square certainly seems to have relished the opportunity to Mario-ise (an actual scientific term) basketball. But compared to some of Mario's previous sport outings, like Mario Tennis for example, Slam Basketball bears about as much resemblance to basketball as Sonic to a real hedgehog. In fact anyone picking up this game expecting to play an in-depth NBA-style sim will be dreadfully disappointed. Yes, you bounce a ball round a court, but that's pretty much where the similarities to basketball end.     Instead what you get is the Mario Kart equivalent of shooting hoops. Shells fly around the court, mushrooms can be grabbed to increase speed and question mark blocks line the floor. For Nintendo fans it's an absolute treat and, considering this is developed by Square Enix, we have never seen a Mario sports title infused with so much of the iconic plumber's history.   Even scoring a basket has been given a mustachioed makeover. Scoring a basic point is pretty straightforward but it doesn't net you many points. To score big you need to dribble over question blocks that contain coins - each coin represents a point, so collect 50 and that amount is added to your score when you slam dunk the ball. However, to hit the really big scores it's essential to use each character's special move, which is satisfyingly over the top and outrageous. After all, it wouldn't be a Mario sports game if something didn't catch fire or explode.   Special moves are activated by tapping the touchscreen, either to spell out a letter or draw a shape. The shape you need to draw depends on the character you're playing as, so it's an M for Mario, a B for Bowser and so on. Once charged these visually spectacular signature moves are unleashed, doubling the points you'd normally score when the ball sinks through the hoop. Clearly Square has been doing its homework to ensure special moves are in keeping with each character, so Diddy Kong straps on a jetpack to fly towards the net whereas Bowser Junior flicks the ball with a giant paintbrush. Waluigi's baffling love for swimming, shown here and in Mario Power Tennis, is still totally beyond us though.    These spectacular shots are only the start of Square's touch screen basketball revolution too. Pretty much everything can be done with a stroke of the stylus, from shooting to passing and even blocking. What's more, Square has done a decent job of translating the moves of basketball to the touchscreen, so  it feels extremely natural to dribble the ball away from opponents by tapping the stylus rather than just pressing a button on a joypad. One criticism we have about the controls is that, in the heat of the moment, with Bowser breathing down your neck to nick the ball, stylus flicks are often panicked and result in accidentally shooting the balls forwards, rather than passing it to a team mate.   Admittedly panicking isn't really much of a problem in the early stages of the game. In fact the initial tournaments are laughably easy. The computer players stand about, barely moving, so it's a cinch to dribble the ball around them, kinda like the Harlem Globetrotters taking on a bunch of OAPs. The difficulty level does ramp up though, and the Rainbow Cup is a tricky test. Unfortunately, although opponent's AI increases in tougher tournaments, the intelligence of your team mates is pretty dire. They do virtually nothing to prevent the other side from scoring, so it's left to you to keep swapping between team members to try and defend the net manually.     Although it's a real shame Square Enix lost its way regarding the difficulty, some of the game's elements still manage to shine through. The graphics are fantastic and if we got knocked down by a bus tomorrow at least we'd snuff it knowing that we'd seen some of the best visuals the DS is capable of creating. It's bright, the animations are fluid and the frame rate never drops for a moment.   Unfortunately, the wonderful graphics aren't backed up by a particularly fat roster of modes. Apart from the main tournaments there's a fairly enjoyable multi-cart mutliplayer, as well as three single-player mini-games, but that's it. Thing is, there's little to distinquish one mini-game from the next, the aim for each being to bounce a ball to a finish line. The court changes, as do some of the obstacles, but that's it. So, for the lone hoop-shooter there isn't really a great deal to hold your attention, unless, of course, you like looking at pretty graphics, in which case you'll be gazing at this for years to come.Without a doubt, Square Enix has managed to pull off one of the most visually appealing games on DS and it easily stands proudly alongside the Mario sports titles released on GameCube. So it was perhaps inevitable the gameplay would never reach the heavenly heights of the graphics. All the necessary Mario-themed items, colourful courts and a long list of characters are in there, but the lack of a varied single-player mode and inconsistent AI means Mario Slam Basketball only gets the bronze trophy.", "date": "Feb 9, 2007"}
