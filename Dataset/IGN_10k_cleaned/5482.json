Though we didn't live under the specter of ~duck and cover~ drills like our parents did, the possibility of military conflict between the United States and the USSR seemed, at times, all too near. Though this war never actually materialized, it remains an intriguing ~what if?~ setting for stories, movies and games.  Matrix Games's Flashpoint Germany postulates just such a flare up between Warsaw Pact and NATO forces in Germany. The Soviet military, under pressure to justify their massive budgets and relieve the burden it places on Joe Commie and Sally Socialist, decides to launch a quick attack on NATO forces in Central Europe. Using surprise and infiltration tactics, they hoped to take Western Germany's economic assets within a month's time, the point at which the costs of the operation would become prohibitive. If successful, the balance of power would shift in favor of the Soviets, who could then afford to make the military cutbacks necessary to maintain the Union's economic health.   The new game, developed by Simulations Canada, owes much to the classic Main Battle Tank games. The player is in charge of entire brigades composed of platoons of tanks and artillery, with a few helicopters thrown in for good measure. (Infantry units are represented as well but they're merely tied to your other units.) Your forces fight across a map 200x150km in size. The map is divided into 5km squares and the turns vary in length from just a few minutes to half an hour. There are four total maps here and 17 scenarios depicting various battles.  Though the commands are issued in discreet turns, the action plays out in real time (much like Battlefront's Combat Mission games). This means you'll have to issue orders and then watch the action play out in real time for a full turn before you have a chance to amend your orders. I really like this method because it reproduces the real limitations a commander faces in the field. There's nothing worse than ordering your units to maneuver around the flank of the enemy only to watch helplessly as they march straight into an enemy ambush. Since you can't adjust orders on the fly, you have to put that much more thought into your pre-planning.   This doesn't mean that your units will march straight into certain death. There's a very credible morale model for the units. If they start facing too much enemy opposition, they'll try to dig in. In extreme cases they'll even turn tail and run. You can control a unit's engagement doctrine by setting their operating procedures. By adjusting a few variables, you can determine how close they try to get to the enemy and what range they'll try to engage them at. This can be put to great use in setting up ambushes. For a realistic challenge, set these values as unchangeable once the game starts.  Controlling units is fairly easy. You simply right click on a unit and select an order from a dropdown menu. You can set up to three waypoints for a unit and preview the path they'll take to reach them. If you'd like to coordinate the movement of a number of units at once, you can add order delays to these waypoints, telling, for example, one unit to halt at waypoint 1 for ten minutes before moving on to waypoint 2.  When moving your units around, you'll want to keep your units hidden and scattered until they can concentrate and destroy the enemy in detail. Where some wargames reward players who probe enemy lines with HQ units, you'll definitely want to put this responsibility on your recon units here; your HQ units are just too valuable for keeping things running smoothly.   In terms of issuing orders, you'll need to deal with the problems that real commanders face. In the first place, the limited staff rule puts a ceiling on the number of units you can order around in a given turn. If you're playing with longer turns, you'll get the chance to issue more orders at a time. Limiting the number of orders you send out also limits the chance that your enemy will use the radio traffic to zero in on your HQ units. Luckily you can rely on many of your units to take care of themselves when faced with danger.  Though it's a very realistic game, there are some compromises in terms of realism. We already mentioned that the infantry aren't properly modeled on the field so you don't need to worry about them. You also won't need to worry over considerations of unit facing and supply. The fact that the missions take place over such a short period of time means that supply and repair isn't possible but your efforts to flank your opponent is limited by the fact that there's no facing option.      NATO and the Warsaw Pact forces each have distinct, sometimes differing objectives. Though there are some victory sectors both sides want, it's possible then for both sides to do reasonably well. Victory points are also awarded for casualties inflicted but Flashpoint Germany makes no distinction between wounded and KIA actions. As long as they're hors de combat, it's all the same.  And since no Cold War-era game would be complete without them, your forces will have tactical nuclear weapons on the field. These are handled just like artillery except that they do tremendous damage to a lot of enemies and demoralize enemies in a large radius. The only downside (apart from your own ethical concerns) is that you'll have to sacrifice a substantial number of victory points to bring them into play.  A good commander plays towards his strengths and minimizes his weaknesses. In the case of the NATO forces, you'll find that they're better in terms of quality but almost always outnumbered by the Warsaw forces. As a consequence, NATO forces have to be a bit more stealthy and choose their battles carefully. NATO's also underserved in terms of overall artillery but their artillery units are much more versatile than those of their opponents. You can view the detailed unit descriptions to get a better idea of what they're capable of but the game doesn't bog you down with tons of details.  The game's AI puts up a credible fight in the scenarios. You can toggle a number of handicaps on or off to tilt the balance to one side or the other. The AI can't quite put up the same challenge that you'd get facing a human opponent in the game's PBEM, LAN or hotseat modes.  Wargame fans will like the graphics. The map itself is colorful and detailed but it looks a hell of a lot like a boardgame. While I'm not against that in principle, the fact that elevation and coverage are represented by simple numbers rather than being built into the map's design keeps you from being drawn as deeply into the game as you might otherwise be. The units are represented by traditional chits but, even if you can't read an order of battle or table of organization and equipment, you'll soon get the hang of it.   Combat graphics leave a lot to be desired. For one thing, it's very, very hard to tell which units are engaged. A small set of arrows or some colored outlines would definitely help clear things up. The small explosions that appear on the chits aren't very impressive either. While they do let you know when vehicles are being destroyed, they're just not very exciting to look at.  The game's sound palette is remarkably limited. There are specific combat and vehicle sounds tied to the action on the map but the sounds themselves are fairly mediocre and wind up just blending into a wall of irritating noise that you'll soon shut off completely. Luckily the game runs in a window, so you can just play your entire folder of Nena MP3s in the background. Flashpoint Germany does a good job of making wargaming a little less dry than it sometimes seems. The setting is engaging and the combat and command modeling is very solid. Though there's no denying that Flashpoint Germany is an enjoyable game for the hardcore crowd, it just doesn't seem to have much personality. Though ultimately this isn't as important as the accuracy of the combat modeling, it definitely limits the market for the game. Gamers who aren't already into wargames won't be won over by the presentation.", "date": "Feb 10, 2005"}
