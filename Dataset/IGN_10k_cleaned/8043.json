But for us old-timers, who remember when Defender was the height of videogame excellence, Arcades Greatest Hits can be a pleasant stroll down memory lane. All of the games here enjoyed healthy successes in the arcades, and its clear to see why. While the graphics may be pretty poor compared to todays polygon standards, the gameplay is spot-on. Joust, Robotron, Defender, Defender II, Sinistar, and Bubbles all favor great control over graphics, although the control isnt quite as good using the PlayStation controller. (Robotron just isnt the same without those twin joysticks.) The games themselves are straight ports from the original arcade versions, so they look and sound right on.  It's a great value for your money, and with six games you cant go wrong. So if nostalgias your thing, you could a lot worse.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
