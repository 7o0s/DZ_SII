Originally picked up by Empire to ship in January 2003, it (and pretty much Empire as a whole) vanished from view, and after more than a year and a half of sitting in limbo, the North American version has shipped via DSI Games. The GBA game hasn't changed from its two-year-old incarnation released two years ago in Japan and Europe, which is both a blessing and a curse. This revisit to the arcade classic retains nearly everything that made the 80s Taito arcade game such a hit, and this design works great in a portable format. But don't be fooled by the ~New!~ in the title -- it's all just a spot-on gameplay conversion with updated and tweaked graphics. Features Old and New modes 100 different levels Cartridge save (two slots) Link cable support for two players (single and multi-cart modes)  Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who've been utilized in the Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move puzzle series originally started their videogame career in the classic Taito arcade game Bubble Bobble. In it, players controlled one of the dinosaurs, either solo or as a team, in an assortment of single-screen platform challenges that put to use these creatures unique ability: bubble blowing. The idea was a simple one: trap enemies in bubbles, and pop those bubbles to clear out the screen and move onto the next. The simple design was enhanced with the ability to create clusters of bubbles that would create chain reaction pops to destroy enemies in a much more impressive (and satisfying) explosion. It starts out simple at first, but when the game starts throwing complex platform layouts as well as much more intelligent and roguish enemies out at the player, the game gets hard. Damn hard. Clearly, 100 different levels will take a while to clear out, even with the help of a second player.  Its cuteness and solid game design put Bubble Bobble all over the map in home conversions over the years, from the NES to computer PC ports. A few years ago, the game even hit the Game Boy Color in a graphically enhanced version called Bubble Bobble Classic that may have retained the cuteness and gameplay, but removed some key elements from the game design.  The Game Boy Advance version, Bubble Bobble: Old & New is separated just as clearly as the title indicates: the game's divided into two parts: the classic game, and the enhanced update. The ~Old~ mode is just that: the original sprites, the original level designs, and the classic music that just won't get out of your head even if you tried. Like the Game Boy Color version, the GBA can't accurately fit the exact resolution of the arcade game on the LCD screen, so a portion of the playscreen remains off the edges with a ~scroll~ to follow the player's dinosaur. This does limit the game since it's tough to locate off-screen enemies and items, and it was this element that hurt the enjoyment of the original Game Boy Color game. However, Taito went a step beyond and offered up an extremely handy, dynamic ~zoom in/out~ function that utilizes the GBA's scaling feature. The downside: the character sprites aren't quite as crisp in full-screen mode, but who cares when you can see all of the action?  The ~New~ mode is a bit deceptive. When developers update a game design, they generally take the idea to a new level that makes sense to the franchise. For Bubble Bobble: Old and New, the only ~new~ element is in the artwork. Taito revamped the plump, super deformed dinosaurs to make them more hip and athletic. They've lost their old-school charm in the move for no real reason than to say, ~Hey, we've given the game a brand new look!~ New mode is nearly identical in gameplay to Old mode; no new gameplay elements have been added, so it's definitely not like you're getting two different games in one package. It's the same game with two different looks.  So, yes, it's disappointing that ~New~ mode is just ~Old~ mode in new clothing, the fact that the original game is still fun and challenging still makes Bubble Bobble: Old and New worth it. The GBA game features two save slots that records a high score table to cartridge, a handy function since the game's not just about beating all 100 levels...it's about seeing how much you can score in a single sitting. The cartridge save also makes note of the highest level obtained, so players can jump directly to that round right from the start if they so choose. And the best part is the single cartridge multiplayer; Bubble Bobble's best played with two players, so it's great that the original arcade game can be played with two systems with only one copy of the game. The limitation is that the cartridge-free system doesn't have a soundtrack during gameplay, but honestly...who cares.  Bubble Bobble: Old and New's only real problem is that it doesn't offer as much bang for the buck as the title leads you to believe. The feels slightly out of place since the amount of game inside the cartridge would be better off in a Taito classic game compilation than in a stand-alone cartridge. But it gets away with it because of several elements: its budget price, its cartridge save, its link cable mode, its hidden extras via D-pad and button codes...and, more importantly, because Bubble Bobble's still a simple and fun classic game. And if Nintendo can get away with repackaging individual old-school games for a 20 dollar premium, why not Taito?", "date": "Oct 1, 2004"}
