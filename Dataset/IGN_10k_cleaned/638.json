We originally devoted a good part of our days to playing the game, but one by one we each lost interest. The problem seems to be that the realization of the game fell short of the designers' conception. And that's a shame. It's always nice to see developers break away from the standard conventions of their genre. In this case, Turbine seemed to know early on that they didn't want to make a standard Tolkeinesque fantasy RPG. So they had to come up with a whole new set of ideas.  In nearly all cases, we can honestly say that the ideas were incredibly intriguing -- no more character classes, no more dwarves or elves, no more 'one-size-fits-all' magic system. But nearly everything that's good about this game is colored by some sort of flaw. In some cases it's a minor thing, in others it's a little more serious. Let's take a look at the specifics ...  The Story  I wish I could care a little bit more about the background to the game. The recent history of the world, although significant to the current state of the world, seems to be absent from my experience. The wizard Asheron accidentally opened a portal, some bad bug guys known as the Olthoi came out and Asheron had to enlist the aid of several Heritage groups in combating the bugs. The bugs were driven back 10 years ago but still hold sway on some of the more remote areas of the world. Now Asheron has gone into hiding. There's a lot more to it than just that, but it will serve the purposes of this review for now.  The thing is that the outward signs of this struggle aren't easily found in the game. There are some ruins and whatnot that hint at the existence of an earlier, more powerful civilization, but these are few and far between. Normally I wouldn't expect the game to start with such an earth-shattering event in the recent past and it could've been used as a tremendous story telling device. After all, your characters were presumably kids when the bugs were driven back. But there's very little narrative drive to the individual games that you'll be playing. Although AC is a dynamic world with the potential for big changes, it doesn't seem as if the world has a life of it's own.  The Characters  Go ahead and list the character creation system among the innovations made by the team at Turbine. But innovation comes with a risk. Trends and concepts eventually become conventions because they work. Whether in terms of style or utility, something just seems right about them. If you must deviate from the standard models, you better have a half dozen reasons and you'll still get an argument from most people. Two of the most revered and honored principles of the RPG world are fantastic races and character classes. Turbine took a big chance by eliminating those categories from the game and wound up with a mixed success.  Although you can choose from three Heritage groups for your character, this really has very little meaning in the game world. All three groups are pretty much the same, thereby eliminating one of the most exotic and unusual elements of a fantasy world. Don't get me wrong; sometimes I get bored of wave after wave of elves and dwarves in fantasy games, but they contribute to a sense of the outlandish and bizarre that you just have to have if you want to sustain a feeling of magic and wonder in the players. I'm not saying that this game needs elves and dwarves specifically, but it needs some kind of distinction between the Heritage groups. For the most part they're just humans with different cultural trappings.  The decision to include a skill based character system opens up numerous opportunities for character creation. There are some basic templates for you to use, but you're by no means bound by them. Most people seem to opt for custom character classes. You can develop any skills you desire and make exactly the character you want. Think it would be cool to have a swordsman who is also able to cast enchantments on his weapon? That's entirely possible. How about a healer who can hold her own with an axe? No problem. The only real limiting factor is that you run the risk of spreading your skills too thin to be much use to anyone. I know it always seemed strange to me that wizards weren't allowed to wear armor of any kind and Asheron's Call doesn't place any such restrictions on you. One downside to the free-form character creation process is that it becomes difficult to recognize broad skill sets in other players -- something definitely crucial to party formation. I will say that the statistics and skills in the game aren't just abstract numbers. Even a single point difference will result in changes in performance ability.  Magic  The magic system in AC is also a mixed bag. While there were some really amazing innovations, the implementation falls far short of the potential of the concepts. Let's just take two examples. Magic in AC is regulated by a spell economy. Both an individual and a worldwide supply of mana power each spell. If you cast a fireball spell over and over and over, then its effectiveness will decrease. This phenomenon is also mirrored in the overall game world for each mage who casts the spell. In other words, the more people use a spell, the less powerful it becomes. This is a tremendously cool device for encouraging spell research and protection of spell knowledge. After all, if your spell book is put on the open market, you'll soon find your abilities severely reduced. That's the way it's supposed to work at least. I have to say that I never saw the effectiveness of my spells drop below 99 or 98 percent. And that includes the common spells that nearly everyone knows.  Now let's talk about the mechanics of spell casting. Casting spells requires at least five (sometimes more) specific components combined in an exact order. You start with just a few spells and must discover the rest through experimentation...or you could grab at least the first few levels of spells off of some of the more unscrupulous fan sites. You might even be able to find a patron (more on this later) who's willing to teach you what he knows. Overall, it's pretty easy to discover the more superficial syntax and grammar of the spell formulae. I dig the concept of a spell language but it's ridiculous to force magic users to carry around almost two dozen separate ingredients just to maintain readiness.  Combat and Death  For those of you without the style or flair to handle spell casting (Tal, I'm talking to you), grab a sword and start slashing. But the combat in AC isn't entirely ham-fisted. The combat system in AC has a little more finesse than most. While you can't take direct control of the action in terms of specific moves and tactics, you have quite a bit of control over your character's actions. Once you equip your character with a weapon and enter combat mode, you have several options open to you.  Once you find a suitable opponent, you select the strength of the attack, which is in inverse proportion to the speed of the attack. Missile weapons have the same interface but trade speed for accuracy rather than strength. Once this is done, you can set the height of the attack. Use low attacks to kill bunnies, use high attacks to kill wasps, use middle attacks to hear Pop'n'Fresh giggle. While this gameplay certainly doesn't qualify as twitch, it does keep the Quakers from taking unfair advantage of the RPG crowd. Instead combat performance is an outgrowth of the skills and experience of your character.  And while we're on the subject, let's talk about death a little. Characters may attune themselves to various Lifestones throughout the world. These are usually located just outside of most towns but they're rarely immediately apparent. You're going to have to ask around before you can find some of them. They seem to be placed on the edges of towns rather than in the middles. That doesn't make any sense to me. It seems like you'd want to protect these Lifestones and put them in a highly visible area. But what do I know?  The Allegiance System  The AC allegiance system is a neat way of encouraging social interaction among characters. Basically you swear allegiance to another character in return for his aid and influence. What the Romans called gratia. What does the patron get? Well, your patron receives experience points from your adventures. You as the vassal don't lose anything; it's just a nice bonus for your boss. This social hierarchy is another interesting idea that doesn't seem to play out in practice. It does reward veteran players for helping newbies get themselves acclimated to the world and both parties certainly benefit. I just assumed it would be more complex and dynamic than it is.  The allegiance system is much more important on the Player Killer servers, however. On this server, life is indeed cheap and the only way you're going to last long is by banding together with other individuals. The outgrowth of the allegiance system on the PK world is a group of massive clan wars. The various allegiance groups engage in an endless struggle to redress the wrongs of the past. There's a real sense of family among the allegiance groups that I imagine is exactly what the developers were aiming for. This is the way the system should work on all of the servers. It's hard to know just who to blame for this failure. If the designers place a system in the game and the players failed to utilize to the fullest.  The World  The world of Dereth is huge. Like everything else in this game, it winds up being both a strength and a weakness. The breadth of the world necessitates the inclusion of lots of flat, featureless terrain between the landmarks. It takes forever to run from one town to another and there's very little along the way to catch your eye. Just spend a few days wandering around and you'll be struck by the overwhelming horizontal orientation of everything. As this makes it particularly hard to navigate around, the designers included an in-game map and compass that you can use at any time.  The size of the world also makes it far too easy to get that anonymous, lost feeling among the residents of Dereth. I think the world is too big for the populations that are currently on the servers. It's very difficult to find more than a few characters gathered together and nearly impossible to find a place that qualifies as crowded. While some gamers may enjoy the elbowroom that this relatively unpopulated world offers, it certainly doesn't help to foster the idea that you're part of a society and community all involved in your various pursuits. That communal awareness is surely one of the biggest strengths of online RPGs and it's definitely lacking here.  Even the towns seem tiny. When I think of fantasy towns, I imagine something exotic. Sprawling cities surrounded by thick stones walls, networks of burrows hidden deep within the swamps, delicate cities of glass built on the tops of mountains. None of that is here. At least not that we've seen. Instead the cities consist of traditional European, Arabian and Eastern set-ups. But the towns are still too small. Even the largest of the cities we've been to hardly constitutes an urban area. Most of them are fairly unprotected and out in the open. And there are no townspeople -- just shopkeepers who stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And the shopkeepers don't move around either. Their shoes must be stapled to the floor.  And while I'm talking about the towns, I might as well mention that there aren't any banks. But that's okay, there's not that much to buy either. Once you've gained so much money that it's weighing you down, you can trade it in at the local merchant for a credit note. It's only worth its full value at that same shop. If you go somewhere else, you only get 80 percent of the cash back. This is huge problem if you hope to travel abroad without losing any money. Being forced to carry around all my character's worldly possessions stinks and I'm far from taking the cheap shortcut of creating a mule to hold it all.  Monsters  The monsters in AC are also a strange blend. At first glance it seemed that there weren't that many creatures in the game. But like in most fantasy settings, the monster species are differentiated into various types. Shreths for instance are composed of Gnawer Shreths, Carrion Shreths, Sand Shreths, Blood Shreths, etc. The bestiary for the game is fairly large but your initial experience will probably be limited to just a few of these types. Once you're able to move farther afield, you'll run into other creatures...and you'll regret it. Not that the monsters are all that smart. Their main tactic seems to consist of running right at you at full speed. I haven't yet seen anything more sophisticated than that, and I don't imagine that I ever will.   And while I'm on the topic of monsters, let me lodge on further complaint against the game. When a Banderling runs at you brandishing a spear, you expect to be able to loot that spear from his corpse, right? Not in this world, pal. The items that the creatures carry bear no relation to the items which they wield to attack. That's irritating.  Graphics and Sound  The graphics are nice at the extremes but look very pixilated when you get up close. I had few complaints with the environments but it was the character and creatures models that really disappointed me. The characters are blocky and stiff when moving. One of the most promising features of this game when it was first announced was the face customization feature. Unfortunately when you jump into the game, it becomes impossible to tell the characters apart simply by their faces. In the absence of races with substantial physical differences, there needs to be a way to recognize characters from afar. You can click on them to examine them, but it would be nice to have tags above the players' heads. On a good note, I was very impressed with the spell effects.  The sound in the game is about as well developed as this paragraph.  The Sum of Its Parts  While nothing is exactly final about the dynamic worlds of most online RPGs, our collective opinion of AC falls a bit short of our initial appraisal of the game. While several of the game features seemed promising at first, the ultimate realization of those promises involved some compromises and oversights. That's not to say that the game doesn't have strengths -- it clearly does. But those strengths are held back by the overall execution of this project.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jan 15, 2000"}
