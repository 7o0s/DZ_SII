After forming a new Global Coalition, North America and its surrounding countries are prospering, while Europe finds itself reeling from faltering technology and an expenditure of weapon resources. Spotting this weakness, the remaining WORF forces and its superior technology approach European leaders with promises of support and progress. Not too long afterwards, the FN outpost in Newfoundland is under a severe threat by a horde of massive unidentified sub-orbital objects from space. What does this all mean? Well for starters, it signals the beginning of the Frontier Nation's return to battle, and yours as well.   In case you're curious, the outline above is the setup for Sammy Studios' continuation of last summer's lukewarm flight title, Lethal Skies. Appropriately named Lethal Skies II, this Asmik Ace-developed trip to the heavens is a huge improvement over the severely deflated installment we played in 2002. It's faster, tougher, better looking, and offers several new features and planes in comparison to its predecessor. Even the game's presentation has been increased by what seems to be ten-fold and the prominence of the storyline is huge.   But is it enough to dethrone the current PlayStation 2 flight king Ace Combat 4? Can it match up as the best effort in the genre? Well, not quite.   Gameplay  Appropriately mixing various elements of both the arcade and simulation philosophies, Lethal Skies II does a much better job of striking a balance that the previous version so terribly lacked. Originally plagued with a mission structure that made dog fighting almost completely useless, planes with limited payloads and stiff controls have been dropped in favor of a more action-oriented approach. While not as over the top as Ace Combat 4 in terms of the arsenal, your missiles, bombs, and other such ordinance are no longer restricted to the point of conservation.    Also improved is how each individual plane handles. They're more responsive and dynamic than the previous version of Lethal Skies and have made a couple of key changes for less a sluggish manipulation. More importantly, each of the 19 different aircraft handle with more noticeable differences, and if you're piloting an F-15 for most of your journey only switch to a Black Ops craft, you may have to learn how to fly all over again. And while it was previously damn near impossible to make adjustments for faster planes if they banked in other directions, it's a lot more doable now with the game's deeper jet selection (though the rudders and brakes are still less effective than they should be).   The most important change, however, is the enhanced enemy A.I. and the inclusion of wingmen that actually listen. Not only are you able to dictate what weapons your teammates can carry before each mission, but your flight buddies themselves can play key roles in assignments that see you outnumbered. The wingmen are especially helpful when your objectives require you to be in multiple places at once (though truthfully, they're still a little delayed during the more hectic battles) or if too many hostile aircraft are surrounding you. Speaking of hostile aircraft, they're definitely more aggressive here in the sequel. Opponents have managed to advance their fighting techniques to include their entire arsenal (guns and missiles) beyond just one attack and team-based tactics can be implemented as well.   There's no doubt from the start that Lethal Skies II is difficult. In fact, it's probably one of the hardest games we've sampled in quite some time. Regardless of the objective type (escort, infiltration, dogfight, air-to-ground, or anything else), the CPU attacks everything its not associated with pretty mercilessly -- even on the easiest challenge setting. If the 20-stage campaign doesn't sound like your cup of tea, though, gamers can still partake in a couple of head-to-head multiplayer modes via split-screen or the rarely employed iLink feature.    Sadly, a lot of the same problems that was bothersome in the original rear their ugly heads here as well (in addition to a couple of new ones). The targeting, for example, is a little dodgy when aiming at ground units in contrast to air marks and chaff is controlled by the computer instead of by the user -- which makes it a rather useless feature to have considering that the A.I. never releases it when should. Other minor issues like confusing objectives, too many canyon-like navigational areas, and a somewhat repetitive campaign structure hold this one back from reaching its full potential.   Graphics  Another example of Lethal Skies' improved aspects is the keen graphical engine. Boasting a large amount of special effects, the speed-induced motion blur and realistic weather effects are definitely worth mentioning. Chaff, bullets, and missiles aren't over-embellished in the least and the explosions are quite ~the nice~. Of particular note, however, are the hyper-detailed jet mock-ups. Very realistic and exceptionally modeled, they're truly the standout visual centerpieces of the game.   Environments are also impressive for the most part, and offer plenty objects, units, and clouds in every section. Subtle effects like lightning flashes and wounded-but-spiraling enemy airplanes bump up the presentation quite a bit, and just go to prove how cinematic the producers wanted to be. In fact, Lethal Skies II most valuable asset is its high production values, with top-notch menus, movie-like progression, and multiple camera angles. Its only real visual enemy is the occasional stutter and low-res ground textures. Otherwise, the graphics are quite stellar.   Sound  Musically there isn't much to boast about outside the generic sounding butt metal that populates every stage. But in terms of sound effects and vocals Lethal Skies does a solid job. Though it's only been encoded in standard stereo surround sound, there's a ton of speech before, during, and after every campaign mission. Professional and concise, the narrative goes a long way towards upping the score for the excellent presentation we spoke of earlier.   The audio effects are plentiful and of high quality, but we couldn't help but recognize their broad nature -- we've heard this all before (then again, there's only so many sounds you can make in a flight game). Even so, it gets the job done and at the end of the day, it's all that matters.The team at Asmik Ace that's powered Lethal Skies II should be commended for successfully improving on a title that bordered on the cusp of mediocrity. Though this new sequel does teeter on a line of repetition, there are enough improvements and cool presentation elements to warrant some tries from curious wannabe jet pilots.Interestingly enough the development on the next edition of Sidewinder (the Japanese version of Lethal Skies) is already well under way. And if the level of improvement that Asmik Ace has shown in this sequel is any indication, the next version of Lethal Skies may be the one to finally give Ace Combat a run for its money. As it stands now, though, Lethal Skies II is pretty good flight/action jaunt -- it's just not a great one.", "date": "Sep 12, 2003"}
