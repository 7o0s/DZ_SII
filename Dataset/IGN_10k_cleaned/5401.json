Who knew the quiet debut of Vin Diesel as the next super bad-ass would kick off an entire universe around its indifferent murderous anti-hero? What's more, certainly nobody expected a knockout first-person shooter starring the now notorious anti-hero to sneak its way into stores and stab the delighted hearts of gamers. Which is exactly why The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay was so well received on the Xbox and has now been transferred over to the PC in good style and with new content.    Put simply, Riddick is a first-person shooter that blends equal parts blasting, hand-to-hand combat, stealth attacks, and even some platforming into the mix. Riddick takes noticeable risks in a crowded genre and succeeds. From its movie-inspired presentation to its minimalist HUD and the deadpan delivery of Diesel's likeable killer, Riddick is saturated with a sleek kill-or-be-killed atmosphere that pervades all. The combat is sharp, the AI can be smart and relentless, and the level design deft.   Obviously, the transition from Xbox to PC can be a complicated one, but the transition here is very good. Not only are all of the mechanics of shooting better (as we all know the mouse and keyboard is simply better than any game controller) but the stealth and hand-to-hand combat that was so brutally satisfying on the consoles remains easy to learn and use with success.   On top of that, the graphics have been given the royal treatment adding in all of the goodness of the latest and greatest additions to visual shading delights. Riddick already looked good on the Xbox, but the clarity of higher resolution brings a much more detailed and crisp experience to gamers. Character models are good, though stiffly animated at times, and textures are wonderful. The main problem comes with characters generating strange shadows, as was the case in the Xbox version of the game. You can see triangles of shadow missing or drawing incorrectly. Unfortunately, Riddick's character model also has some visible seams between different sections of his body, most notably his shirt area and head. These blips are small, but noticeable in cutscenes. Otherwise the game is grand in design and detail and wonderfully for visual enthusiasts.   Almost everything about the game works well, but after completing the 10-hour adventure on the Xbox, it was hard not to want more. Well, they added more. Along with new cigarettes to find, new levels of fun and frolic also come from the dark to attack the PC version of Riddick. These additions include a romp in a suit of riot gear, which is certainly fun for the thrills of straight up slaughtering guards and other, less able riot gear soldiers. This portion of the game is simply an excuse for Riddick to go on a shooting spree. There isn't really any thinking involved, but it sure is fun for the duration. The new levels won't add a ton of time to your game, but at least there's something.     But then again, the amount of time wasn't exactly the issue. There were plenty of paths to explore and things to do. It's really still the fact is there is no multiplayer option. Yes, it would be tricky to pull off successfully. But creating an experience like that in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is likely possible. With such a smart design, it's just kind of a shame. While the lack of a multiplayer option is sorely missed, the meaty single-player missions really are wildly varied and create a surprising, exhilarating, and entertaining experience.   Adding even more replay value for those hardcore fans that want to find out a lot about the game's development and how the project came about is a new unlockable commentary option. I'm not going to say this will appeal to all fans, it won't. But those that are really into this game will enjoy the plethora of info about the development process that sit all over the game world of Butcher Bay. It's easy to equate to the commentary track of a DVD, but this hasn't really ever been done before in a game and is surprisingly extensive. It's a great feature and may be one that we see in the future in more AAA title collector's editions. I can imagine that it wasn't a small task however, so it might be a while before this becomes extremely popular.    The DVD-like commentary option is just one of the elements of the game that will remind you of a movie. One of the brightest points in Riddick's delivery is its superb movie-style presentation. Starbreeze's captured a film-like essence consistently throughout the entire game.    The game is simply steeped in atmosphere from the moment Riddick walks into the dank, dingy maximum security prison. It's dark, not only metaphorically, but actually physically dark, which aside from being moody, plays heavily into gameplay. You can almost smell the thick stink of Butcher Bay and its inhabitants from the grime on the walls, dirty clothes of the inmates, and environmental textures. This places oozes with style and creates sense of reality in which it's easy to become immersed.     It can get a little frustrating in some of the more obscure story sectors, which clearly tie into and are meant to be explained in the movie, but their presence isn't overwhelming and is one of the strange aspects of a story that ranges across various types of media. While the minimalist approach to presentation is to be rewarded, its downside cannot be ignored. Finding out what to do next -- progressing through the game -- can be puzzling and frustrating. It's not like the game should spell out everything that needs to be done, but Riddick's level design is often complex and hive-like and can become confusing.    Riddick covers a span of more than 30 levels, split into checkpoints. During the game you travel though various levels of hardcore security that include some surprises such as an alien infestation. As mentioned earlier, new levels also give players the chance to step into riot guard gear as well as battle some riot gear soldiers that aren't quite together. In any case, the variety of levels and design is welcome.    It's hard not to like Riddick's myriad parts and its smart, evolutionary structure. The game immediately introduces prison life and Riddick's abilities, who has no inventory when first arriving at Butcher Bay. The first part of the game opens up the prison culture, its trade system, and the ins and outs of empowering yourself. Also introduced are the light RPG elements of speaking with inmates, accepting missions from them, gaining information and eventually acquiring small hand weapons. It immediately feels like an adventure with RPG elements, and it's handled well.   After that, the fighting system is quickly introduced. Since the guards' weapons are controlled by a DNA-encoded system, picking one up sizzles your nervous system leaving ranged weaponry out of the picture. This means fists and sharp objects will be the only tools of combat for a bit. The melee combat system is simple and easy to learn, but it's deeper than you might expect. The left mouse swings a punch while the right blocks. Different attacks are executed by pressing a different directional key and the attack button at the same time. Combos, which become your best friend, are executed by stringing these different attacks together with perfect timing. Picking up brass knuckles, shivs, and clubs increases the damage done in a fight. By beginning with nothing, absolutely nothing, and fighting your way up in the empty, dismal, inhuman setting provides players with a real sense of empowerment.    The fighting isn't complex by any means -- this isn't a fighting game -- but it's deep enough and simple enough to work well and it just feels good. And for a first person shooter, it does a solid job, though it won't compare to anything like Half-Life 2 or Far Cry in this respect. Guns in Riddick aren't bad, they just don't feel as solid as those in other FPS games. But this game is more than the sum of its parts.     Controls are standard for any first-person shooter on the PC, though new tricks such as eye shine require a key of their own. Unfortunately, the mouse wheel isn't utilized to switch weapons, something that's typical of shooters on the PC. It's not like that function is necessary to have fun, but it would have been nice.   Blending several genres used to be an absurd thing to do. Games were either great at one thing, or bad at multiple things. Riddick is impressive in that as you depart from the RPG elements of the second max prison, you descend into the mines, and therefore into a myriad of stealth and explorative objectives. Equipped with only a stun gun, which only temporarily stuns enemies, these parts of the game are challenging and based entirely on quick thinking, use of stealth, and skill. It's a complex section of the game that is very open in design. Those who really dig exploration, stealth, and collection, this is for you. On the flip side, strict first-person shooter fans could end up frustrated.    While the weapon set is rather small, Riddick makes up for it in moves, including stealth kills. From the get-go, Riddick is empowered with the ability to hear another person's heartbeat, so he can crouch in the shadows (indicated by a blue sheen) and sneak up on an enemy to break their neck, slit their throat, or whatever based on the melee weapon equipped. Naturally, Riddick is adept at killing, using a dropdown stealth kill, two kinds of neck breaks (slow and quiet or quick and loud), and counters. The counters are dangerous but incredibly satisfying. If timed right, Riddick can catch and force a guard's gun into his chin and then pull the trigger.     Later on when Riddick acquires EyeShine, he can see in the dark, which becomes very handy in every dark situation, especially since lights can be shot out. EyeShine only becomes a nuisance when Riddick tries to climb crates and the camera switches out of EyeShine view. Otherwise, it's an excellent addition to the game, giving it another level of depth.    The level design is mostly excellent and takes advantage of Riddick's many skills throughout. There are almost always multiple paths, and the vent system is complex and vast. Some sections are more straightforward, such as the combat levels, while others are all about exploring, such as the mines and second prison. Then later on, the final part of the game, Riddick even becomes a balls-out shooter, complete with mini-gun action and even the ability to step into the cockpit of mechs that can shred enemies like paper dolls.    One of the only unfortunate parts of the game is that the RPG elements eventually stagger and dry up later in the game. It becomes difficult, but not impossible, to backtrack from the mines to the Double Max Prison if you happen to move in the wrong direction too soon, which is easy to do because of the lack of direction from the game. The difficulty in completing the side quests is that the mines are dark and the mission objectives minimized, so players can easily get confused about where to go and how to achieve the goals. Despite what we thought, you can accomplish all the side-quests, but almost all of us here that finished the game initially thought the game was flawed in design. While the level design is usually deft, it's often so subtle and so unexplained, you can pass by missions, clues, items, and passages that are crucial for the completist. For instance, once you progress far enough into the game (the alien bit), if you never figure out how to return to the Double Max Prison, those side missions are erased.    What ties everything together however, is Riddick's uncompromising mentality and unflinching desire to escape. Here Starbreeze shows their ability to keep their eyes on the prize. The game, though predominantly action-based, is driven by a story, and it keeps you wanting to get out of Butcher Bay just as much as Riddick does. The only real problem with the story is that Shirah (played by Kristen Lehman) and Riddick's mysterious Furyan powers are never explained, nor are they adequately explained in the Chronicles of Riddick movie. It's a big gap that needs some explaining.     Lastly, Riddick is loaded with vocal talent. After Vin Diesel's superbly emotionless delivery of each and every line (which is a good thing here), you'll hear Cole Hauser as Johns, Kirsten Lahman as Shirah, Willis Burks II as Pope Joe, and Ron Perlman as Jagger Vance. The Ron Perlman bit is kind of a trick, really, because he hardly even shows up in the game, so while he really is in the game, he speaks for all of one minute. The dialog is well written, spoken believably, and gives players good reason to stop and listen to other conversations.The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay is an excellent hybrid of first-person shooting, adventure and RPG elements, stealth and combat. What's even more impressive is that Vivendi Universal Games and Starbreeze were able to put a creative, original game outside the set story of a movie. The equal blend of game elements is superbly crafted, and I am honestly surprised at enjoyable the stealth and hand-to-hand combat really is.Still, if you consider around 12 hours of gameplay short, then Riddick is just that. But then again, it's doubtful that you'll complete every mission or collect every cigarette pack the first time through, so there is incentive to play it a second time. Also, because the game saves at each checkpoint, you can start it up from any checkpoint in the game. Nifty. While Riddick is an impressive hybrid, the lack of multiplayer options is still a bit of a bummer. It would be awesome to sneak up behind an enemy and snap his neck online. Still, just like Half-Life 2, this is an excellent single player game that deserves some good praise for its fun and playability. It isn't perfect, but it is most certainly recommended.", "date": "Dec 14, 2004"}
