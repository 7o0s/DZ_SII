It's a fighter, sure. It isn't Street Fighter or Tekken, but there's a reason for that  the developers have given you, the gamer, control of nearly every aspect of how the game plays. From the standing pose to a super combo  you can do things in Fighter Maker that only programmers and system hackers were able to do before. So is this a game, or something more? Read on. Gameplay  Fighter Maker is a fighter creation tool. If you've ever had creative ideas of a special move or style of battle for a fighter, this game will let you put it in action.  Fighter Maker has a lineup of twenty different fighter models. Take your pick of which guy you want to edit. The unfortunate thing about Fighter Maker is that even though you can edit almost everything in the game, the only item you cannot alter is how your fighter looks. You're stuck with the twenty fighters the game gives you.   Once you've picked your on-screen persona, it's time to give him or her a little background information. You can enter the name, age, occupation, hobby, and -- because it's a Japanese fighter -- even the blood type of your fighter.   Your character can have up to sixty-nine custom-created moves. To give your player a certain move, you'll have to pick one to edit. In the edit mode, you're faced with an image of your character in 3D. In one instance, a move has four points of animation: a starting point, two mid-points, and a finishing point. You'll have to go in and edit how your character is positioned before you activate the move  is he standing, crouching, laying on the ground? Once this has been chosen, you'll need to edit the first ~action~ frame. Pick a limb or joint and move it any which way you want. Move his arm, head, torso, leg, whatever, into a position  every joint of the body can be moved in all three axis. Go ahead and make it as extreme as you like, since the game will automatically fill in the frames between the two key positions. When you've got your character in the position you want, work on the next key frame  making the leg or arm move further into the air, whatever you want.  After you've made the two key positions, the game will show you how he'll move. You can alter the time it takes to go from one key position to the next, either speeding it up or slowing it down to make it look more like what you've intended. Hell, you can make it so that a punch takes more than a minute to pull off, but that would be silly since you need to make a character that can fight  not just look cool.  After you've created the move, you can set the point where it will connect with your opponent and how large a target it makes. You can also edit how much damage that move will take off the opponent if it connects, as well as what sound it makes. And, of course, you'll need to attach what button commands activate this move.  And we hope you have a few memory cards handy  one character takes up one whole card.  When you actually put the character into the game, controls are pretty tight and solid. Thank god, too  after all the work you've put into making a character, it would suck if the actual fighting engine was worse than War Gods. It more feels like Tekken than anything else, from the canned combos to the juggling strategies.  You do have to put up with some extended loadtimes, since the game has to not only boot up the character 3D model, but also the animations that were created. Graphics  Tekken this game isn't  but it is in the PlayStation's high-resolution mode, and it does move very smoothly. But that's mainly because there's no background detail: a single flat, scrolling bitmap for scenery, and an infinitely scrolling, one texture playfield.  Maybe it's because the designers made the game so manipulative that the joints have awkward angles and the polygons skew in such sharp angles.  The game doesn't feature motion-captured moves, since all animations have to be manipulated by the game's editor  a few characters move a bit akwardly. But you have to take the bad with the good  the game is a utility, first and foremost. The game is secondary. But we won't ignore the slight slowdown that happens on occasion during a fight, as well as the constantly disappearing shadows. Hey, we have to nit-pick somewhere. Sound Thwap, oofs, and kicks are rather standard fare in Fighter Maker, and the music is your typical Japanese keyboard style. Nothing to write home about here. Think before you put your money down on this one  you shouldn't buy it just as a fighter. This is a utility program for your PlayStation. A game that gives you the ability to design your own moves. If you can think it up, you can probably create it. Keep in mind that making a single punch will probably take you at least a half-hour to animate. Only pick this game up if you've got a lot of time to spare, as well as a bunch of memory cards at your disposal. It has a pretty high learning curve, but once you've done a couple of actions, you'll know exactly what you're doing and construction will be that much easier. The huge downside is that you can't change the way a character looks, graphically. That would have been a killer addition right there.As a fighter, it's not that bad  there are some limitations to the animation compared to other 3D fighters out there. But because most 3D fighters feature motion-captured moves for realism, and in this one you have to animate by hand, you can forgive the way some of the characters move around. Fighter Maker is one of the most unique software packages on the PlayStation. I'm guessing we're going to see a ton of websites dedicated to characters gamers have created, uploaded with the handy-dandy DexDrive. The competition between friends is going to be fierce. Who can create the coolest, most utilitarian character in the game? Good stuff, Agetec. Now you just have to release RPG Maker.", "date": "Jun 18, 1999"}
