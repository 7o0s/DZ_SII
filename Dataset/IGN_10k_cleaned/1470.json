Because Myst has been re-released again, in 3D. Myst. In 3D. This is all fine and good -- this is totally appropriate. But is it right according to your average gamer's morality scale? Probably not. Myst has been released, re-released, and re-released over the years, and now the original been given a 3D makeover in order to market once again this holiday season. This is Myst in its original form, exact to the tiniest detail (and that includes the same exact puzzles as well), only now there's a secret bonus for people who bust through the entire game -- a new age, which I'll mention in secret-o-text below. Highlight the blank space and enjoy if you don't want a spoiler:  The age is called Rime, and it's a tiny little icy island with some nice snow effects, and some neat whale-like creatures under the water's oily, dark surface. It's beautiful, and actually runs a bit smoother than the other ages. We'll get to the details later.color>  The new age to explore and the 3D graphics will probably be enough to snag most diehard Myst fans, but what about the rest of us? While Myst sucked in a whole generation of gamers with its atmosphere, beauty, and Zen-like pacing, Riven reminded us that after the glittery lights of a new CD format dimmed, there was still something called gameplay that needed to be answered. While Myst popped eyeballs and lit a match under imaginations, Riven seemed to tread the same water -- but with much less success, at least in the eyes of the hardcore. Even with near-photorealistic environments to explore, gamers had become sober to the fact that they basically could care less about having to write down obscure codes, and travel back and forth across empty screens for hours to flip switches. Riven, despite all its flash, couldn't sustain and entertain the way the original could. And unfortunately, what realMyst will most likely remind fans is that the original game had some pretty big faults beneath the initial glitz.  Like the original Myst when it was first released, the visuals are the highlight of this title. The detail is pretty stunning, particularly in the bedrooms and inner sanctums of Atrius' children. Because of the game's pre-rendered origins, the textures are more detailed and varied than your average 3D title. Drawers open smoothly with a click, sculptures twist and turn when touched, and breezes cause light wicker baskets to sway like leaves. The tiny touches and details are impressive, particularly in moments where familiar environments (like the lighthouse age) feature new tricks, such as changing light conditions and weather.  There's no doubt that Cyan put the maximum amount of work into recreating the original Myst, as well as added lots of touches to make the game that much more immersive. Unfortunately, all this detail means that the game runs like a slideshow at times, with framerates so choppy that you'll have to struggle to click on a specific object without overshooting it with your mouse. Myst sold incredibly well due to its low requirements and broad appeal, but if my powerhouse computer could barely push the polygons needed by realMyst, I'm wondering exactly how lower end computers will be able to play this game in any sort of coherent way.   Cyan's always been about simplicity of control, and don't think for a second that jumping into 3D has somehow changed that. Use the mouse. Click the left mouse button, go forward. Click the right mouse button, go backward. Click on things in the screen, watch things move. Press shift button, run faster. If someone emails IGNPC with a question regarding how to strafe better, or that the control's a little too confusing, let me know. I'll be happy to take your computer away. Because you've got full freedom of movement, there's also no problems with trying to figure out where things are situated in an environment, or what direction you're in.  So the graphics are fantastic, the sound is great, and the control is simple. Unfortunately, the gameplay is a chugfest. Move a tower, run all the way up the tower. Write down everything you see, and work an annoying puzzle to gain access to more puzzles that have you repeating simple tasks ad infinitum. If you've never, ever, ever... ever, ever played Myst, than realMyst may get you for a little while puzzle-wise, but by the time you've hit your second or third age, you'll be wondering just how many time you'll have to enter numbers and symbols into a machine in order to open a door. It's sad because the world of Myst is very real and enthralling, while the puzzles are so ridiculous at times that they pull you completely out of the wonder of it all. Exactly why do I need to find dates on a planetarium to raise a ship? Who knows. One thing's for sure -- if you've played through Myst once, chances are you probably won't want to redo the puzzles again, even if that means seeing them in 3D.  I decided that the new age would really be the test of the gameplay -- it's a completely new environment with new problems and puzzles, and would let me experience the Myst world fresh once again to see if it was just me, or the game. Unfortunately, I ran into the same problems. The world instantly grabbed me, the mood made me instantly want to explore every little chunk of the age... but the puzzles reminded me that, after all the wonder, it was all about writing down some clues to put together another elaborate form of a safe cracking code. While I really wanted to experience the Myst world, the repetitious nature of the puzzles in the new age just reminded me of why I stopped playing these types of games years ago, and moved onto new interactive experiences like Half-Life and The Sims.  So realMyst really is in a conundrum. Even with 3D graphics, realMyst isn't really worth playing if you've already played through the original, especially once you realize some of the puzzles you'll have to redo in order to get to your favorite ages. The new age is nice, but short, and the puzzles in that age are in the same vein of the other ages -- which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you feel about the puzzles in Myst and Riven in general.  Hardcore fans won't want to venture into the Myst universe when there are so many other beautiful 3D adventures to undertake, and casual Myst fans who want to explore their favorite locations freely will undoubtedly find that they don't have the hardware muscle to push the polygon power needed to make realMyst run smoothly. Odd crash bugs (realMyst is the only game I've experienced that's actually crashed to a blue screen while I was exiting the program) and incredibly long save/load/quit times round out the problems, making this game iffy at best. If you love Myst, then you're best to keep it where it belongs -- happily sitting back in your memories.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
