Yes, people occasionally get in fights over decades old sports rivalries, but try telling some guy in Catalonia that Real Madrid is the best Spanish club, or that Inter is the best club in Milan...    And that's only the beginning...   Did I hear somebody mention South America? The fire in the veins of Brazilians, Argentineans, or Columbians; Africa, Asia... Well, football is all over the place, and it's (very) slowly creeping into the hearts of US fans.   So, as we're nearing the year before the turn of the millennia, in comes the newest product to promote the magical game, titled appropriately FIFA 2000. As far as the world of football simulations goes, EA Sports has the undisputed heavy weight champ in their corner. The FIFA football series is by far the best one on the market, and there hasn't been any serious contenders to the crown yet.  Annual Evolution of the Series  Now that EA Sports has established their dominance with FIFA simulations, the real lurking question is can they deliver something fresh every year.  Why would the FIFA fans turn their heads solely to this year's title?  It was much easier to deliver fresh things in '98.  We had The Road to World Cup, followed by its natural successor, World Cup '98. FIFA '99 concentrated on the league play, and the clubs, refreshing the scene from the furious France experience. The newest edition isn't based on any themes in particular, or better yet, has all of them incorporated. One nice, new option added is the ~classic teams~ mode. By selecting a famous squad of the era we finally get the chance to play with the likes of  Pele, Maradona, Savicevic, Platini.  This is a great feature for those of you who have been following the sport religiously for years, because you can play with all of your favorites from years past.  The rest of the set up is pretty straight forward. Players can choose from 17 different leagues (Italian, English, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, etc.) The good news for the US fans is that the game includes MLS (EA is hoping to bring more attention to soccer in the States). Or, if none of these are your favorites, you can always choose one of the teams from ~The Rest of the World~ section.  Other modes of play remained standard. Players can choose to participate in exhibitions, tournaments (cup, league play and customized), seasons, or good, old-fashioned training sessions to practice their skills.  FIFA 2000; How Does It Look... Sound?  It's not an easy task making a good looking game look even better year after year.  The visuals in World Cup '98 are still considered top class by many, so I guess it's the nuances that decide if the graphics are considered a notch higher than they were the year before.    FIFA 2000 shows some nice touches of improvement over its predecessors. Player models are definitely more complex and sharper looking.  Weather conditions are more realistic (especially like the drops of rain on the pitch), making the general impression of the match more appealing. The crowds graphics have undergone some qualitative changes, adding a lot more animated characters.  They still aren't entirely believable, but it's closer to real life. Also, the stadium background is redone, and it adds the atmosphere of a packed house once the match starts, something that has been sorely lacking in past installments of the FIFA series.   Falling into the visual category of FIFA 2000 are beautifully used replay cameras.  If you watch a lot of football on TV, you'll notice the same kind of behind-the-goal cameras used after a player scores a goal. It's definitely a nice attention to detail from the developers, and it shows a good insight into the whole idea of match coverage.   Although the marketing hype over the game was pointing otherwise, the players' faces could still use a lot of work. But the real question is who actually needs that? When playing the match one tends to focus on the gameplay, and if you want to have any kind of orientation on the pitch it is common to use the tower cam. Now, you can rarely see the faces from the tower, can you? The only time the game could benefit from more complex facial expressions is in the replays, but you can overlook that fact just by watching the amusing ways players tend to celebrate after scoring.  As far as the sound effects goe, one thing stands out from the usual. There is a much harder ~OOMPH!!!~ after a player gets fouled or there is a mid-air collision. FIFA 2000 sounds a lot more physical, reflecting accurately the direction the actual game has taken. The cheers of the crowd do not appear any different, and the same goes for the commentators' coverage. Although there are many new, well placed liners (80,000 words by John Motson, Chris Waddle and Mark Lawrenson), it's not enough, at least conceptually, to say that it differs from the previous versions. Musical scores continue the fine tradition of new age, techno beats, with a mix of rock and pop tunes. Leading the line up of musicians is UK's Robbie Williams, largely popular here in Europe. Musical score creates just the right mood before the player steps on to the pitch. In fact, I liked the music so much that I had a tendency to linger on the menu screen for a couple of minutes just to listen to ~You Can't Stop the Rock.~  EA Sports definitely knows what they're doing when it comes to choosing cool melodies, and FIFA 2000 is no exception to the rule.  It's Time to Play Some Ball!  So, what are the new gameplay experiences in FIFA 2000? Are there any tactical and AI innovations that will heighten the need to ruin our eye-sights even further in front of our PCs?  The controls didn't show any drastic changes, which is only natural considering the fact that the other FIFA games played just fine. The list of controls still has a lot of features that the player will rarely use in the match. Watch out for the long holds of the button and the single/double taps. It is very important during the match to differentiate things like headers from the volley shots as it really does affect your scoring opportunities.  Gameplay tactics in FIFA 2000 include a lot more ball control features which are supposed to make the game more fluent and less irritating for the gamers. Being able to make a through pass in a crowd is a great idea. Arrows will point in the direction your player is passing, conveniently colored red (hard pass), yellow and green (soft pass). Making a winning pass requires just the right amount of timing and skill. Chest trapping also provides for a lot more useful control, and it really does enhance the dynamics of the game.   Other new tactics, shielding for example, work for and against the game though. Shielding the opponent with your arm makes it easier to advance once you dribble pass the player, but it also does allow for some awkward situations in which many real life refs wouldn't hesitate calling a counter foul. I've seen Ronaldo do such moves on a couple of instances, but even he doesn't get away with it every time. Of course, if you look at FIFA 2000 as an arcade game that would be just fine, but it's supposed to be a sports simulation, right?  Staying on the subject of game's realism, there are a couple of more things that just don't seem all that true to life. Has anybody in EA Sports ever heard of  a passive offside? If a player is not in any way directly involved in the offense, referee should wave play on, and there shouldn't be any offside called. It happened a few frustrating times when I took a clear shot at the goal. One of my players was standing in offside 20 meters away from the action, and yet, the flag was up. Further more, there is a problem with the foul attempts inside the box. In all fairness, the difference from the earlier editions is obvious.  There are a lot more penalties called, and you could change the referee strictness, but what gives with the commentaries when a charging attacker is tackled inside the 16? Ok, so the ref didn't call a penalty, but have you ever heard the (not so) nice things said amongst the audience and the commentators when a player dives or gets brought down. Suffice to say it's supposed to be a heated argument, but the reactions from John, Chris and Mark don't even turn to the fact that the challenge was a possible penalty situation. Instead we hear the usual comments -- ~oh, that was a hard challenge...~  Marketing hype surrounding the game's release focused a lot on the improved AI. Goalie AI shows definite signs of improvement. This is the first time in the FIFA series I actually felt comfortable with the goalkeepers. They don't make silly mistakes, and they choose depending on the position of the attacker if they're going to catch the ball or punt it outside the area. What didn't impress me so much was the other team's AI. The game will more times than not turn into a midfield header contest that will stretch all the way through to the penalty area. It's true that similar situations happen in football, but not to every team in the world, and not so frequently. Imagine playing against the team of Brazilians that never get to show the luxury of their dribbling skills and the passing game. That sure doesn't sound like Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Romario and the crew.  You would think that after so many years of development EA Sports would get it down to science. It seems though, there is always some room left for improvement.  In a Nutshell  Is FIFA 2000 worth your money? Sure it is.  Fans of the game will go out and get it the first day, no matter what somebody says. Is it still the best football simulation around? Yes it is, all the advantages and faults mentioned in the text considered.  Where is FIFA series going?  Well, that's another question now. Maybe it isn't such a good long term strategy to keep shipping new products on a yearly basis. Look at what happened to the Tomb Raider series. If it is about the money it's the right way to go, but if it's about the fans ... I don't know. You figure it out.    -- Uros Jojic In the end, the only way the game manages to be fun is if you imagine it as a sort of hybrid rugby-soccer game where the object is slide-clobbering your opponents. Occasionally, since it is rare, it feels really good to score as well. But I felt as if I were triumphing over the controls more than anything.  The straight dope: FIFA 2000 is a weak effort that does not live up to its name. A total overhaul should be in order if FIFA 2001 is planned.", "date": "Nov 9, 1999"}
