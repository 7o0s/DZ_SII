The common American gamer is hard pressed to name a Strategy-RPG other than Final Fantasy Tactics, while the common Japanese game-o-phile is swimming in a cornucopia of 'em. Among some of the first traces of this attention-garning genre splice were seen by Americans when Konami stepped up to the plate with Vandal Hearts, an RPG with a queer sense of strategy thrown into the battle mechanics.  Final Fantasy Tactics and Vandal Hearts 2 both expand on the basic idea of blending strategy with RPG elements, with each game having its own distinct shining points and short comings. The very fact that both games share the Strategy-RPG nest will encourage comparisons, so I'll just say it now: Vandal Hearts 2 isn't as good as Final Fantasy Tactics. But that hardly means it's all bad, as with most games, it garners its own array of small and large victories -- Not to mention that toppling anything by the all-powerful Square is quite the tall order indeed (sarcasm? you decide).  Gameplay The storyline gives a nod to classic Final Fantasy settings, as while it may be very detailed, it quickly becomes apparent that it's all too grandiose and complicated to try and involve yourself. Joshua was your run of the mill peasant until he got on the bad side of the law by assassinating a political figure -- Running from the law, Joshua starts his own little militia ala gangstas in hopes of survival and prosperity. It kind of just takes off from there, and even after finishing the game, I find that I never really paid much attention to what was going on plot-wise.  At a glance, Vandal Hearts II seems to follow a very basic, tried and true gameplay system. It does, but isn't conventional in all respects. Namely, the game features what Konami likes to call ~The Dual Battle System~ -- Which is really just fancy talk for ~AI moves during your turn~, i.e., the battle segments include some traces of real time action. For the most part, the system works very well, and only encounters a few rough spots with some of the AI logistics that sometimes throw you into loop holes (i.e., you have to waste a move to make the CPU waste a move, so that you'll be in a position to attack). This doesn't detract from the experience at its core, but still is that much more $%(# to wade through when you really want to get into the meat of the gameplay.  Vandal Hearts II features very dumbed down character development, but is still integral to the game. Different characters may excel in certain skills or with certain weapons, but it's all very straightforward, and bearing in mind the strategy inclination of Vandal Hearts 2, is well placed.  One minor gripe I have about the gameplay system is the discovery of new spells. Each weapon has spells or new abilities locked inside of it, but can only be unearthed by your character by carrying it for a number of turns. To put it straight, this is a real bitch. Discovering these spells is vital to your success, and to do it you often must romp through the battlegrounds for no other reason but to try and unlock spells. This doesn't present a genuine challenge, it merely forces you to play longer in order to accomplish the same goals. Growl. Fsst.  Graphics I know this is really an over-used locution, but the overall visual scheme in Vandal Hearts 2 is quite a mixed bag. In the battlefield, the level of detail is acceptable and everything looks good -- But, on the other hand, the sprite based characters on the map screen just look sinfully wrong. They're choppy and misshapen. The color depth and quality, in some areas, is just laughably bad -- The character portraits in particular come to mind, as they look reminiscent of things seen during the 8 and 16-bit era.  Overall, graphically, Vandal Hearts 2 combines a lot of average elements with some pretty darn bad ones -- The end result is a little less than memorable, but, being a Strategy-RPG, it doesn't rely quite as heavily on visual prowess as perhaps games of other genres do.  Sound In the sound department, Vandal Hearts 2 comes across pleasantly, but not powerfully so. There's your typical, predictable speech/sound effects on offer, and a really nice, orchestrated sound track to top it off. The final package compliments the flow of the game well, but doesn't stick out as being extraordinary, but rather quaintly neutral. No complaints. If you remember any of your gaming experiences of today five years down the road, Vandal Hearts 2 probably won't be one of them. Fortunately, though, it is a fun and much welcome addition to the Strategy-RPG genre, and worth checking out by fans of the genre or simply fans of RPG's.", "date": "Feb 3, 2000"}
