With promises of more realism (if you opt to turn the realism up), an expanded career mode, training challenges, and most important of all, online play, MotoGP4 is touted as the biggest game yet in the series.   While it's true that there's more here than ever before, MotoGP4 does end up feeling much like its predecessors when it comes down to what's important. Sure, there are a bunch of new things here and there and the online play can be great fun, but there are still many elements of the game that are far from perfect.   In large part, the game feels much like previous titles in the series. That's not necessarily a bad thing as it's always been a fun racing experience, but it's not for everyone. The controls are tight and using your weight to lean around corners at high speeds can be great fun. The series has been all about technical racing through and through, and MotoGP4 is no different.    One thing that we wish had been addressed here is that each of the game's bikes essentially feel like the same machine with different stats associated to them. Sure, some are faster or handle better than others, but it feels as if you're driving the same physical bike regardless of which you pick aside from that. They all seem to have the same weight, sway the same and so forth. It's understandable that many of these machines would be similar anyway, but it would be nice to have a little more variance between them than simply stats.   The courses in the game are all real-life environments, so if you're a fan of the real MotoGP series, you'll already know your way around these tracks. The attention to detail here is pretty good, and as best as we can figure these courses are spot-on. The one downside to the game's courses is that as they're all built strictly for racing, the scenery isn't all that varied or fun to look at. Still though, the course designs are great.   One new and welcome addition to the MotoGP series is a training mode. Being as tough as it can be to master the game when set to its simulation mode, there was plenty of opportunity here to help players learn how to handle their high-powered bikes. Unfortunately, MotoGP4's training mode does little more than have you perform rather routine racing tasks and doesn't really help you learn the finer points of handling the bikes. It's also oddly ordered, such as how one task finally switches on the simulation mode and has you take the bike through a couple turns, but the very next lesson turns off sim mode and turns brake assist on. It doesn't make much sense to go from quite difficult to exceedingly easy. It's also unfortunate that there's only one lesson that makes use of the simulation mode, so you're basically left to your own accord to figure out how to properly handle the almost overpowered bikes.    Another thing that hurts the game's overall presentation is its ~upgradeable~ parts and bike customization. Through the course of a season, one of the guys in your crew will come to you and say that a sponsor has a new part for you. The catch is that you have to pass a challenge in order to keep the part, and you only get one attempt at the challenge. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense because you'd figure that if you're having problems winning races you need the upgraded parts to help out, but if you aren't very good at the game you'll never be able to earn them. Sadly, once you actually have the new part you can't really do anything with it either or even directly see how it's affecting your performance on a spec page or anything of that sort.    Your bike's customization is simply a handful of sliders that lets you skew the performance between acceleration or top speed, handling or stability and so on. Again though, these are simply sliders and you're not actually tweaking a part of the bike, like spring rate, gear ratios or anything of that nature. It wouldn't have taken much to keep it as simplistic and approachable as it is but attach these sliders to actual tweaks and show you performance numbers that would result from them, like horsepower, torque or some such.    MotoGP4 once again includes a series of short challenges, 125 in all. These range from having to complete a short piece of a circuit in a set amount of time to weaving through cones to beating another rider. They're fairly entertaining when you skip around through the list in order to mix things up, but after a while the challenges can get a tad repetitive. Having to race against a single rider a dozen times in a row or more gets a little boring, especially after you've been racing with a field of 21 in the career mode, but again, when you mix things up the challenges can be enjoyable. They also serve to earn you cash so that you can buy things in the store, so that's always nice.   As mentioned, the biggest addition to the game is its online mode. You're able to play with up to eight players online, which though it may be a far cry from the singleplayer game's 21 riders, is still a great deal of fun. Rather than watching AI riders follow each other perfectly into corners, diving and turning in an almost synchronized fashion, human players are a lot more fun to race against. It's pretty awesome to take someone on an inside corner after having chased him for a lap or two, so there's a lot of payoff to be had here. The voice support helps a bunch to add to the social atmosphere as well, which is cool.    Option-wise, you don't really have any as far as modes go but the setup gives you plenty of choices. You're able to have bots fill in for empty player slots, and the host has options for turning on a shortcut penalty, the type of weather, specific machine classes, whether tuned machines are allowed, whether or not players should be handicapped and more. It's certainly a nice set of options, though we still wish there were leagues or some such to play in. Still, it's a nice first effort that's a lot of fun.In all, MotoGP4 plays much like past games in the series and still has a number of presentation quirks, but it's certainly a fun game. The driving mechanic feels really good and the track designs are great (they're real courses), so the basic act of racing is a good deal of fun. It would have been nice if some of the presentation issues had been cleared up, like having to complete a challenge to keep a new part, but it's a fun game overall and fans of the series will love it for the online play alone.", "date": "Jun 22, 2006"}
