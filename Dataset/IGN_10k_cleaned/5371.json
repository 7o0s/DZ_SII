Rule changes are settling in, ugly melees are making headlines, and the reassignment of several superstars are shaking things up. Commuting sports fan needn't crane their necks to peek at some other cat's sports page to get their b-ball fix, though, as several basketball games are landing on their cellphones. Last month's JAMDAT Sports' NBA 2005 made a solid splash, but now THQ Wireless -- fresh off a deal with the NBA to produce a suite of NBA wireless products -- is offering its take on the sports for wireless gamers.   Features:   Full NBA license  All 30 teams and fresh rosters complete with 150 players  Isometric view  Play-calling   NBA Basketball 2005 offers a solid mixture of arcade-style gameplay and the sim trimmings a hardcore NBA fan desires. As wireless sports games become more complex -- thanks to more powerful handsets and clever programming teams -- having a full license is important. NBA Basketball 2005 greatly benefits from a complete NBA license with all thirty teams (including the new Charlotte Bobcats). Each team also has both home and away uniforms.   Both above and beyond that, you get to play with real NBA stars. NBA Basketball 2005 has 150 players that are accurately rated in nine different skill categories, such as dunking and blocking. That means that when you play as Shaq, you'll have the muscle to bust up to the basket and put in a solid lay-up. Unfortunately, though, you cannot change the line-up of your team. Each team has five players, period.   (Speaking of Shaq, NBA Basketball 2005 does not include freethrows. JAMDAT's baller didn't either, and while we understand the justifications of not including free throws -- memory, etc. -- many games are decided by them. They are just too pivotal to basketball to neglect.)   NBA Basketball 2005 features five-on-five basketball gameplay, rather than the two-on-two style we enjoyed in JAMDAT's baller. The result is certainly a more realistic ballgame, as you now can set up real defense plays and keep defenders busy when going for the hole. But running AI routines for ten on-screen players is a little meaty for a cellphone game, so NBA Basketball 2005 does a few things to streamline the action.   Because each player has assign skill points, the game uses those to determine the outcome of some match-ups rather than letting you have direct control over the play. For example, you cannot just directly steal the ball with a button input. When on defense, you press the action key which reads the pass skill value of the matched-up players. The higher your skill value, the greater your chances are to swipe the ball should you be against a man with a low rating.   Similar things happen on offense. There is not a button assigned for dunking versus lay-ups or jumpers. What the game does is read how far you are from the basket and then looks at your dunk rating. If you have a high dunk rating and are next to the basket, you dunk. If you're dunk rating is low, you just go for a lay-up. This takes away from some of the control, but it's likely necessary for a manageable download. That doesn't make it any easier to give up, though.   NBA Basketball 2005 does try to make up for it, though, by allowing you to call plays. The five offensive plays are: isolation, high screen, low screen, high post, and low post. There are three defensive plays: zone, man, and press. You can call all of these plays on-the-fly by pressing the ~#~ button. Having this sort of control over the team is good, and it makes managing your five guys much simpler. The number pad is no substitute for a good console controller, so calling plays is a solid way to let you control multiple facets of the action at once.   THQ Wireless' game, thanks to its isometric view, reminds us of some of the older ballgames of the 16-bit era. The players are certainly less detailed and less animated, but the action looks approximately the same. The display is pretty clear, and there are pkenty of on-screen cues to help you keep track of the action. For example, a yellow arrow on the edge of the screen shows where the off-screen player you're currently controlling is standing or running. On offense, a red arrow shows which player is most open. There is also a small ticker beneath the screen which reports on the action, such as who is shooting or who gets the ball.NBA Basketball 2005 walks a precarious line between arcade and sim, and it does a solid job of staying on course. I liked the play calling, which helped me manage all five of my players at once, allowing me to concentrate on engineering important plays. And I certainly appreciated the full license, as I have a couple teams I'm fond of and enjoy actually playing as specific player rather than nameless fellas that wear a colorful jersey. However, I wish I had a little more direct control over things like blocking and stealing, attempting a dunk versus a simple lay-up. Basketball is such a hands-on game and it's hard to relinquish these kinds of controls. If I want to dunk, no matter how bad my player is at dunking, I should get to dunk -- even if it clangs off the rim. Who knows, it might have been my magic night.If you like a more arcade style game, stick with JAMDAT's NBA 2005. It's fast and fun, much like the classic NBA Jam games. But if you prefer a game more like SEGA's NBA 2K5, put your download dollars on NBA Basketball 2005. You'll like the five-on-five action. Hopefully, next year we'll get the free throws, as they are just to important to leave up to the computer.", "date": "Dec 4, 2004"}
