It's not possible to pinpoint one single element that makes Yoshi's Island such an outstanding platformer. The combination of technical effects, solid controls, clever level design, and the sheer variety of things that the lead character can do is what pushes this game into the ~Best of the Best~ realm.  And the same game converted for play on the Game Boy Advance shows that the original design hasn't missed a single beat; Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3 is definitely the finest action platformer on the GBA...not to mention the best damn platformer ever developed. Features Seven worlds Several mini-games Cartridge save (three slots) Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge support) Only for Game Boy Advance Yoshi's Island opens up with a stork carrying a precious package: brothers Mario and Luigi on their way home to their waiting parents. In a botched kidnapping attempt, only Luigi was snagged...Mario ended up plummeting like a pipewrench down to Yoshi's Island and right on the spine of an innocent Yoshi. As one of several colored Yoshis, players have to babysit an infant Mario as he rides bareback. The task: traverse six worlds of eight levels each to rescue Luigi from the hands of the Koopa family. After each level, the current Yoshi plays a little relay and lobs Mario off to the next waiting Yoshi to continue the trip. These guys love working together.  Though this game claims to be a true sequel to the Super Mario branding, it introduces so many new and unique gameplay elements that it's honestly its own franchise. Oh, sure, Yoshi can jump and bounce on certain enemies just like the mature plumber can in the umpteen games in the Super Mario series, but Yoshi can do so much more than that. He can slurp enemies and either spit them out for an instant projectile, or swallow them down and squirt out an egg. With the egg he can aim in almost any direction and lob them at enemies, items, and objects. Yoshi can pull off a hover jump, that familiar maniacal kicking first established by Luigi in Super Mario Bros. 2/Super Mario Advance, now given to the dino as his trademark move. Also, a powerful stomp can be pulled off by pushing down on the d-pad, a move that can flatten even the hardest of enemies and objects. In many locations, Yoshi can even morph into vehicles; take flight as a helicopter, dig as a mechanical mole, hit the speedzone as a sportscar, or ride the rails as a toy train. These morphing elements are very strange, but they're implemented extremely well and just add to the variety of the game's design that much more.  Yoshi is himself, virtually invincible. The dinosaur can take a hit from almost anything in the game...except for spikes lining the surface of a level, and the ever-popular fall-off-the-edge move. Though this may sound like a cakewalk, the designers put the focus on Mario here...if Yoshi takes a hit, Mario will be dislodged from the dinosaur's back and float helplessly as a timer counts down. If it hits zero, then the Koopa henchmen will fly down and steal the baby away...so it's important not only to keep track of your ~package,~ but also to build up the timer by collecting happy little stars that bounce around the levels. Yoshi's Island was originally designed for play on the Super NES, but without the power of the additional FX2 chip embedded inside each of the cartridges, Yoshi's Island honestly wouldn't be nearly as clever or versatile...the system's ability to squash, stretch, shrink, grow, rotate, bend or otherwise manipulate sprites actually gives the game's design a ton of variety to them, not to mention an added level of ~life~ to the world of Yoshi's Island. And the level designers obviously had a lot of fun exploiting these new-found abilities, with rotating platforms that collapse or spin under Yoshi's weight, rolling objects that our hero must push, and inflatable balloons that double as moveable surfaces. Since the GBA can do all these features in its hardware, almost every effect that was used in the original SNES game is reproduced exactly or better.     All of the game's six worlds are split up into eight different levels, two of which are boss rounds. Every single level in this game feels so different from each other...the driving force behind getting through its diverse challenges The game keeps track of how well you perform in each of these levels, and by completing an entire world at 100%, a special, GBA-exclusive level will open up that are downright devious in design. To get 100 percent, you'll have to collect all five ~flower~ icons, all 20 hidden and not-so-hidden red coins, and exit a level with a full 30 seconds on the clock...not the easiest task in the world, that's for sure. But the designers borrowed from Super Mario World by giving Yoshi the ability to store power-ups that can be called upon almost anywhere. So, if you, say, needed an additional 10 seconds on your clock to finish the level with everything complete, you can activate a ~+10 star~ power-up...if you've earned one, that is. A magnifying glass power-up will also come in handy to reveal all the red coins in a level. These power-ups are earned in Yoshi's Island's various mini-games...all of which are cool to discover because they add even more variety between the standard platform action.  And even though the graphics are almost a decade old, they hold up extremely well and look absolutely fantastic on the Game Boy Advance screen. Yoshi's Island has a very ~coloring book~ style to its art, with backgrounds that have scribbled crayons filling in the hues. The designers went one step further in the sound department, incorporating Yoshi's cute voice into every move he makes. It's definitely appropriate, seeing as it was Yoshi's Story on the Nintendo 64 that established Yoshi's vocals, and every game featuring the dinosaur since then has featured these noises. And they work quite well in this platformer and sound great on the GBA's small speaker...even if purists might complain that the FM effects of the SNES game should have been left alone.   The GBA version does have a bit of unfortunate slowdown during particularly processor-intense areas, mostly when players discover a pocket of stars in places where there are several items and enemies wandering on-screen. And one particular effect that looked great on the Super NES version is a little crudely pulled off on the GBA edition: touching Fuzzy Wuzzy will get Yoshi drunk and dizzy for a short time, and on the Super NES, the screen appropriately twists and warbles during this temporary setback. On the GBA, this effect has been abridged to something that's more awkward to watch...whether the GBA just couldn't handle the original game's effect, or whether it was a design decision to cut back on the dizziness, it's just a little disappointing to see this in action. Even if you've never seen the effect running on the Super NES, you'll definitely notice the poor implementation of the GBA version. Of all the Super Mario Advance games to hit the Game Boy Advance, this game is the finest available. When I played through the original Super NES game back nearly a decade ago, I felt that Yoshi's Island was the best 2D platformer ever created. And after playing through the Game Boy Advance version, I still feel that way...the variety in what Yoshi can do and the diversity in level designs, not to mention the wonderful use of scaling and rotation for the level structures and the incorporation of a half-dozen clever mini-games makes Yoshi's Island the best damn platformer ever.In terms as a Super NES port, the Game Boy Advance pulls off most of the original game's levels extremely well. It has some issues with camera scroll due to its lower screen resolution. The GBA developers kept the art assets at a one-to-one ratio, but because the GBA does not have as much height or width resolution, the visible screen area is a bit less than what was intended by the original level designers. The GBA programmers attempted to remedy this issue by using a ~smart~ camera system that scrolls the view up or down when players need to see above or below them. But it's not perfect, and players will have to move Yoshi in specific directions in order to see the blind edges. The slowdown also needs to be mentioned...it's not terrible, but it is obvious when it happens.And why Nintendo insists in having the same dang Mario Bros. mode that's been included in the previous two Super Mario Advance games is just a mystery. And it's a huge disappointment to see, considering that Yoshi's Island features some great mini-games that would make some seriously fun two, three, or four player challenges. But nope...the only multiplayer game you get in Yoshi's Island is the identical multiplayer game that's been released twice before. It's almost insulting the way Nintendo's rehashing it again and again.But conversion and multiplayer issues aside, these minor problems can't and won't hinder the sheer amount of enjoyment that's to be had in this downright brilliant 2D platformer.", "date": "Sep 24, 2002"}
