Due to its overwhelming success in arcades in 1979, the game spawned sequels, spin-offs (often unofficial), and firmly entrenched itself in popular culture.  Simplicity and addiction at its core, Pac Man - while inherently repetitive - always delivers as a fun and rewarding gaming experience.  However, this comes with one caveat - paradoxically, because of its very success, there are so many versions and opportunities to play, and opting to spend 500 Wii points on this one may not be the most prudent purchase.   For those not acquainted with the premise of the game (or perhaps also unfamiliar with the wheel or the discovery of fire), the player controls Pac Man, a very hungry yellow blob, as he attempts to eat dots scattered about a maze -- all the while avoiding getting devoured himself by evil ghosts.  By grabbing energizers at the corners of the maze, the ghosts become vulnerable and can subsequent fodder for Pac Man's snapping jaws.          Eating them in sequence yields more points, but it is not necessary for completing the level.  Once all the dots are eaten, the level is cleared, and a new round begins.  Unfortunately, other than the game speed increasing and the duration of the energizers decreasing, there is no variation from one stage to the next.   Of course, the game was the first of its kind and it would be silly to fault it for not having varying maze design like its successor, Ms. Pac Man. Nevertheless, when reviewing VC releases such as this, one must look at the big picture: while a faithful port to the arcade original, there isn't anything that really beckons for this iteration to be downloaded onto the Wii.  There are even web-based Pac Man clones that can be accessed through the Wii's internet browser.  Alternatively, the controls are very tight and rewarding on the VC, primarily using the Gamecube or Classic Controller and their respective analogue sticks.  It really gives the game an arcade feel that simply was not present when playing on the NES, or any other console with a D-Pad for that matter.  It's highly probable that anyone that would be interested in downloading this latest VC release may very well already own the game as part of a collection, on another system, or perhaps even an original arcade unit.  As already mentioned, this is a truly respectable and accurate port of the original.  Yet if it's already present in your gaming library, there's really no need to download it again.  Further, much to the chagrin of purists, some even argue that Ms. Pac Man is an all-around better game -- that may even ultimately see a VC release itself.   And once again, with Nintendo opting for the quick-and-simple releasing of ROMs onto the VC (instead of opting for extra features like an online scoreboard on Xbox Live), your 500 Wii points may be better burned elsewhere.", "date": "May 14, 2007"}
