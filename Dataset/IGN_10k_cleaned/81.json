I remember playing this game for hours and hours at my local Chuck E. Cheese, establishing patterns and beating whatever high score was up there. I had the reflexes of a cheetah and could make Popeye do things Nintendo did not mean for him to do. Now that I'm older, I have the reflexes of a snail and I can't remember any patterns I may have had. While my reflexes and pattern recognition skills may be gone, my fondness for this game has been renewed thanks to Namco's faithful remake.   Olive Oyl is once again in distress and it's up to Popeye to save the day. After rejecting Bluto's advances, Olive is looking for Popeye to save her. Popeye has to rescue Olive in four different stages each with their own theme. Every stage requires you collect all of the tokens Olive drops down from the top of the screen. The higher you catch the hearts, notes or letters the more points you score. If the tokens reach the water at the bottom, you have about 10 seconds before they fall in the drink and you lose a life.   While the goal is simple, actually doing it can be quite difficult. Bluto is doing his best to stop you. He'll run around randomly, going up and down stairs in an attempt to catch Popeye. If he's right below you, he'll jump up and punch you. If he's above you, he'll reach down and try to swat you. He can also throw bottles at you. Later in the game, the Sea Hag will show up on the edges of the screen to also throw bottles or skulls and Bernard the Buzzard will try and stop you with his airborne attacks.   But the world's most famous sailor does have some help. A can of spinach appears on each level for Popeye to eat. Eat the spinach and for about 10 seconds Popeye will be strong enough to knock Bluto off the level into the water below. Eating spinach also freezes any tokens floating toward the bottom of the screen and their point value is doubled during this time. You can also punch the bottles thrown at you and sock the buzzard right in the kisser when he comes flying at you. I recommend doing both as much as possible to rack up the points. The first level even has a bucket in the middle of the screen Popeye can use to drop on Bluto's head.   Each level is just like the arcade original and the animations are spot on. There's even an extra construction level in Enhanced Mode where you have to catch a sleepwalking Olive's falling ZZZ's. There's also a ~Spinach Run~ bonus round where you try and grab all the spinach cans before time runs out.    You can also earn Popeye comic strips that you can view on your phone. Tokens earned allow you to 'buy' comics using your cell phone's internet. It's a nice touch and adds more enjoyment to the game. After each act (there are 15 acts in Enhanced Mode) you also get some Popeye trivia. Did you know Popeye actually started out as a side character for another comic? See? You actually do learn something new every day. If you don't want to play the Enhanced Mode, Arcade mode is also available.   Controls are spot on but I sometimes had difficulty going up and down the stairs. Popeye is a game meant for a joystick and controlling him can sometimes be cumbersome if you have fat fingers. Sometimes Bluto would catch up to me because I wasn't able to get up or down the stairs quick enough because of the tiny cell phone control pad. There were also times when I'd press punch, but nothing would happen. That could be the phone's fault or my own ego blaming the game for me screwing up and not paying attention.  Theres no school like the old school. Popeye is an excellent quick gaming fix and a spot on recreation of its arcade original. While the controls can sometimes be a little wonky, its still a fun game. I love these retro games because it reminds old farts like me about the golden years of gaming. I actually feel kind of bad for the gamers of today who didnt grow up in the arcades. You guys missed out. Lucky for us, companies like Namco do their best to keep those golden years alive and kicking. Even if its for a few moments at a time.", "date": "Mar 25, 2008"}
