The Delta Force is called in, inserting a three-man team into the field to thwart a terrorist threat bent on creating instability in the region. You control that three-man team, which includes a point man, a sniper, and a bomb-diffusing engineer that also has the ability to heal teammates and call down air strikes.   This is your basic tactical shooter, as you inch the team through winding environments with a cursor. Team members can be moved one at a time when situations require their special talents. Is there a mine in the middle of the street? After eliminating any immediate threats with the point man, send in the engineer to diffuse the mine before moving the whole team to the next fire position and engaging the enemy. This move-act-move-act formula is fine, but I wish I could somehow give the troops different tasks to use at the same time. Why can't the point man lay down cover fire while my engineer takes care of a mine or gets the coordinates for an air strike?   Just a question: When will bad guys stop standing next to exploding barrels? So many terrorists in this game manage to put themselves in the dumbest positions, standing around barrels of what must be rocket fuel. I understand this is now a convention of the genre, but it's one that should be on the way out. If there are five thugs in a group, let me find a smarter solution that sending the point man out in the middle of the street to target just a barrel.   The team also gets to drive a vehicle, switching things from tactical shooter to straight-up shooter. With a 50-cal cannon always blazing, you just position the cursor around the screen, targeting shooters and barrels. Enemies on motorbikes try to get alongside your armored transport, but you can drop mines at chokepoints and corners to send them flying. There is also a sniper-specific section, which I really liked. There was genuine tension as I swept the environment, trying to find the last target before time ran out.   Between each mission, a news bulletin gives you an update on the story. It's a fine storytelling device, but the developer -- and all developers, really -- needs to spend an afternoon watching CNN to see that we've moved beyond a woman looking into a camera and one TV monitor in the background. Also, the text in Delta Force needed to be run through a grammar checker.   The game looks pretty good. I played it on a Sony Ericsson w810i. I liked the rain effects quite a bit. The animations are smooth and the environments have a solid amount of detail. The HUD is also easy to read, allowing you to accurately keep track of your troops, their equipment, and any power-ups found on the field in crates.  Delta Force is a fine tactical action game for fans of the genre. There are not as many different ways to work through the stages as hoped -- you can really only get creative in a few places. The pacing of the game is uneven, thanks to dialog scenes. You'll likely hit ~skip~ a lot to push through them and get back to thug-busting with air strikes and sniper rifles. While I prefer past entries in the genre, such as SOCOM (which seems to have dropped off the decks) and a few of the Tom Clancy games, Delta Force provides an adequate fix.", "date": "Oct 5, 2007"}
