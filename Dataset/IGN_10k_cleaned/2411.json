The scenario is really simple. Choose one of  twelve funky-looking combat submarines, and then pilot it into battle against other weird underwater vehicles.  The objective is simple. Enter an underwater playfield, which increases in size and complexity as the game progresses, and collect the five green alien pods that are scattered around. When all five are picked up,  a ~Threshold~ -- essentially an undersea gate -- opens up, which is flown into to complete the level.   The challenge comes due to the fact that every other craft in the playfield is trying to do the same thing. Since once a pod has been picked up, the only way it is dropped is if the craft carrying it is shot, a pitched battle ensues as craft fight one another to steal all five orbs and quickly rush through the gate. A wealth of power-up weapons that are spread liberally across the seascape, plus each craft's has its own built-in special moves help to ensure it's a frenzy.   As I said, it certainly sounds like a lot of fun. But unfortunately it's not that great. Here's why.   First of all -- rubbish graphics. The submarines themselves are totally uninspiring. Team Earth Hope's dolphin-like sub is very cool, but most of the others are unimaginative and dull. The landscapes are bland and look very similar to one another. This is a problem that most underwater games have, but this one doesn't help itself at all. The textures aren't pretty, and despite some original arena themes (Pacific Rim's underwater city is interesting), they're all much of a muchness. Another problem is the fact that it's just not a particularly realistic underwater environment, period. Unconvincing sprite cards of undersea vegetation break up the otherwise barren seascapes, and apart from the occasional bubble trail and the blue lighting effects, I never really felt immersed.   Then there's the gameplay. The first annoyance is that it's really difficult to tell where your sub is relation to the scenery because it has no shadow. Okay, I know it's underwater, but it's really irritating to crash into things because you have no feeling of depth and space. Then there's the actual controls themselves. They lack finesse and have no inertia, which destroys any feeling of being underwater -- it feels stiff, like it needs a few more weeks of tuning. Some subs have better handling than others, but the majority are either too sluggish or, when you press the ~turn fast~ button, too twitchy.   Then there are some general gripes. The chase camera sometimes gets totally lost in the heat of battle, so that you lose your bearings. Sometimes the screen fills with explosions so you can't see what's going on, resulting in more bearing-based problems. Oh, and you can also get bashed about in the midst of combat by unseen enemies and feel out of control. Guess what kind of bearing-type issue that throws up. All this is immensely annoying. Bottom line, you should always feel in control, and you should also always be able to see what's going on. When you can't that's bad design, whether it deliberate or not.   Finally, there are some slipshod elements. Submarines tear and clip at close quarters, the textures can look incredibly pixelated close up and the fact that the game just freezes dead when you go through the Threshold is just cheap. Some kind of animation or sequence would have helped, but as it stands it just looks lame to see the screen freeze for a few seconds until the score screen appears. And the general presentation is just functional.  Challenge-wise, the game is moderately tough. The first couple of levels are easy. Fill up with weapons, park on the top of the Threshold and wait for everyone to kick the crap out of each other. When one craft has all five pods, just blow it up, steal its pods and rush through the Threshold before it recovers. After a while it gets more difficult to do this, but it's true that the game is easier if you stay away from combat and let the AI's do most of the work for you. Later on it gets more fun, but the annoyances outlined above really take the edge of what otherwise could have been an enjoyable game.  A quick mention about the deathmatch mode -- that's where the game is at its most fun. But to be honest, there are many better two-player games than this, and most of them have better one-player options too.   So what we essentially have is a fairly lame Twisted Metal underwater. It's not totally dreadful -- it's fun for a while -- but it just lacks lasting appeal and is filled with irritations. To be honest, the whole thing feels like an early '96 PSX game, and certainly doesn't compare to the likes of Twisted Metal II, which is its nearest competitor and was strangely enough produced by the same developer.
