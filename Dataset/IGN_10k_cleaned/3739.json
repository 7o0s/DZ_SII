From .hack to Xenosaga, Dark Cloud 2 to Dragon Quarter, the PlayStation 2's long list of new and exciting titles has only been matched by the sheer number of quality sequels to balance them out. And with names like Final Fantasy X-2, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, and a pair of PS2 EverQuest installments slated for the end of the year, an endless supply of hit points and magic spells appear to be just what the wizard ordered. Let's face it, 2003 has been an RPG lover's dream --and we're only now approaching the end of June.   In the sea of big name mega-hits and quirky hardcore rarities, however, one role-player in particular has gone somewhat unnoticed. Developed by the little known Cattle Call and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, the linear sequel to last year's Arc the Lad Collection is practically a phantom when paired with some of this season's bigger, more popular choices. It's almost fitting actually, as Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits isn't quite as grandiose or boisterous as several of this year's other ~save the world~-type scenarios; but rather, finds itself to be a quiet, subtly emotional throwback to and era when these types of adventures didn't take themselves so seriously. And while the game isn't without a hitch or two, we'd be lying through our teeth if we didn't admit how much we like it.   Story  Should returning gamers expect to take over the reigns of Arc, Liza, Shu, or several of the other popular characters from previous titles, they're sorely mistaken; Twilight of the Spirits takes place hundreds of years after the events of Arc the Lad III. It uses an almost entirely new cast (though against our better judgment, we'll admit that a familiar face or two will make appearances in the latter sections), and only barely touches on the events from the other sequels.    For this story, the world has been divided into two separate areas. One inhabited by the familiar human race, with the monster-like Deimos occupying the other. There's an overwhelming hostility between the two sides, and the possibility of war is always looming. As our story begins, players are introduced to the main human protagonist known as Kharg --son of the legendary female war hero Nafia and former prince to a newly democratic society. The first phase of the game entails his journey from his peaceful village of Yewbell and his personal struggle against the supposed threat of an approaching Deimos, and the consequences of hating without knowledge.   In a satisfactory twist, the next phase of the experience switches over to a Deimos character named Darc. Revealed to be Kharg's twin brother in a rather speedy fashion, Darc's adventure turns out to be an even more personal struggle that question the definitions of things like loyalty, racism, and passion. To make matters worse, Darc finds himself caught in a heated love triangle that would spoil far too much to be explained any further. But as you can probably imagine, it's a twist with implications that take Arc the Lad's plotline to places you wouldn't expect.    As expected, the paths of the two brothers eventually cross and a much grander tale ensues. Players will be able to switch between the two brothers in order to accomplish their goals and assemble parties based upon the identity of their lead. Admittedly the pace and direction of the game is a little on the slow side near the beginning, but if you can hang in there and wade through the molasses in the beginning, some of the later bits are really quite satisfying. Just make sure that you approach the narrative from an forgiving point of view; as some of the subplots and mini-stories are left mysteriously unresolved. That said, Twilight of the Spirits is full of emotion, personality, and character; it's just a matter of staying fast through the rough spots to find it.   Gameplay  Surprisingly, Arc the Lad has one of the better battle systems of recent memory. Borrowing several elements from Capcom's stellar steampunk RPG Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, Twilight of the Spirits has done away with the familiar grid system-based found in the earlier games. Mixing the positive elements of turn-based and real-time influences into one, the game now allows for its users to move within a set field based on each character's ratings. Unrestricted by movement points unlike Dragon Quarter, however, TotS is a lot more forgiving of your mistakes. Worrying about overstepping your bounds and having to reset your position over again isn't a concern here -- Arc the Lad allows you to keep moving until you're ready.   Once conflict begins, the game moves in a traditional turn-based format with heroes and enemies trading blows like there's no tomorrow. What makes the battle system particularly useful, however, is that Arc the Lad permits you to flank or pincer attack an enemy. Rear maneuvers, frontal strikes, and other such wargame-like tactics can be pulled off too, and rather than get restricted by grids or squares like that of a tactical RPG, Twilight of the Spirits allows you to improvise and create your own assault pattern. On a similar note, players can also pull off team-based special maneuvers that are based entirely upon the position of adjacent squad members. Enraged characters that have taken too much damage can combine their strikes for a more powerful blow without using one of their partners turns, or more importantly, without using spirit stones.    Which brings us to Arc the Lad's touchiest subject, the spirit stones. Used as a ~magic currency~ of sorts, spirit stones can be picked up during battle or purchased in stores and are an absolute requirement in order to use special skills and magic. Rather than give characters frequently replenished spell points or provide them with a rechargeable magic meter, they must constantly re-supply themselves with the stones instead. It's this management feature that serves as Twilight of the Spirits greatest point of contention.   On the one hand, it's great to see that the designers were in search of a way to keep magic abuse to a minimum (how many modern-day RPG's just let you sit back and cast spell after spell for an easy victory anyway?). On the other, it appears as though the engine discourages you from wanting to use those special attacks altogether. With hefty stone requirements for the higher-class skills and a relative weakness for the lower-powered ones, the incentive to manage the stones isn't very substantial. It was an interesting idea yes, but one that needed a lot more balancing. As is stands right now, gamers will likely use their weapons in skirmishes 90% of the time.    Much to the delight of battle weary gamers, however, Arc the Lad allows players to control how frequently they fight and the rate in which they level up. Using an overworld map resembling Final Fantasy X's point-to-point system, users will be able to click on a destination in the blink of an eye. Most times, the map will provide several stop-over points that one can activate over and over again for quick experience battles, but should they choose to skip over the points and get right to the meat of the story, they can do that too. It's a nice way to combat the common ~random battle~ complaint associated with the genre.   Sadly, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits is limited by its rather straightforward nature. The sidequests are few and far between, story-based battles aren't that difficult, and some of the cool extras from earlier titles (like Hunter Jobs, Wanted Monsters, and Card Captures) are nowhere to be found. This linearity cuts into the game's playtime quite a bit (probably around 35-40 hours) and unless you purposely make it longer with the special challenges and level building, it ends a little too abruptly. To make up for this, Cattle Call has included two special characters for your party that are extremely difficult to recruit, but even after nabbing those two folks, we were left wanting more.   Graphics  Visually Arc the Lad managed to impress us with its collection of high-quality textures, structures, and camera work in towns and dungeons alike. From the subtle detail of a cobblestone pathway, to the complicated nature of an intricate web of steam pipes, the environments in Twilight of the Spirits were an obvious but dedicated focal point for the game's art team. Even the oak-built windmills in the opening town of Yewbell look marvelous, and when we saw them circulating in the afternoon breeze for the very first time, we were almost positive that Cattle Call had developed a way to motion-capture blade wheels.    Interestingly enough, models and animation for the characters leave plenty to be desired. Animated as they are, the constant gesticulation and sign language are embellished beyond understanding. And while members of our party weren't waving their hands in the air like enraged birds during their conversations, they might as well have. ~I'll go with you,~ says Paulette as her arms emulate those of a riled Medusa's head. ~Okay,~ replies Kharg --with his limbs convulsing into seizures.   Once battles start, however, character animation improves quite a bit with realistic reactions and motion for nearly every weapon imaginable. The particle and lighting effects used to illustrate special skills are nice too, with a boatload of cool-looking special attacks (such as the simple Sling Knife maneuver). The only caveat to the visuals during battle is that the enemies seem to lack personality; and for the most part, follow a common cookie-cutter like design that we've seen in countless other RPGs before (a sad fate that the otherwise great, Suikoden III suffered last year). On the whole, though, Twilight of the Sprits' overall look is quite strong.    Sound  Recorded in Dolby Pro Logic II, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits boasts a striking audio mix that sounds absolutely terrific on a properly equipped receiver. Just as notable when played through a television set, the crystal clear vocals, music, and Foley further prove how much of an impact quality sound in a videogame can truly make.   While we're on the subject of quality, it should definitely be mentioned that Takashi Harada's (A Tree of Palme) soundtrack is actually quite good. Flambed by a great deal of players who hoofed through the early part of the game as ~just another videogame score~, Harada's on-again/off-again composition really hits stride once the story moves into Kharg's meeting with Maru. It's a given that there are several sections of the game that boasts music that doesn't quite fit (too many happy-go-lucky songs in moments there shouldn't be), but once those uncomfortable moments are over, there are some truly haunting melodies to tell your otaku friends about.   Vocally, Arc the Lad is a little less schizophrenic; with a healthy blend of competent American actors providing some rather solid voice-over work. Though several of characters may sound a little to similar to dubbed anime from Saturday Morning television programming, what we get more than suffices, and is on an equal if not superior level to other modern translations such as .hack. Our only real qualm is: why do characters repeat the same phrases in battle so much? Do they really have to tell us that ~You'll be sorry~ after every other hit?In the end, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits has a lot going for it. Despite its relatively simplistic nature and less than inviting challenge, the interpersonal relationships between the game's fascinating characters and its entertaining battle system are quite enjoyable. In fact, its battle system is the best polished of its kind since February's Breath of Fire sequel. And for those of us who played that chewy piece of software, we know how profound that statement really is.On a much deeper level, Arc the Lad shares with Konami's Suikoden series a rare bit of emotion that we almost never see in videogames. Comparable to the original 1960s edition of the Star Trek television series, Arc the Lad does a great job of masking real-world issues such as hatred and racism in an otherwise fantastical setting while simultaneously examining it with a realistic and honest morality that we never could have expected.Take it for what it appears to be, and Twilight of the Spirits is a commendable but flawed RPG romp through a traditional medieval world. Take it for what it is, however, and you'll discover something a lot more meaningful.", "date": "Jun 24, 2003"}
