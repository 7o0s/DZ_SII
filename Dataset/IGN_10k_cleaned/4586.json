Combining a stylized mix of spooky camera perspectives and a slew of horrid-looking things that go bump in the night, Biohazard (as it's known in Japan) has set new standards in the in the realm of digital terror -- even if its control scheme and lack of progression between sequels has irked some of its more casual fans.   But change is definitely on the horizon as the GameCube's Resident Evil 4 exclusive is assuredly turning some heads. Boasting an abundance of new features, visual upgrades, and most importantly -- better gameplay mechanics, the vastly different sequel from Studio 4 is as evolutionary as it is anticipated. Luckily this kind of change isn't assigned solely to Nintendo's platform either, as Capcom's other premier production house known as Studio 1 (Monster Hunter, Devil May Cry 2) has been hard at work creating a PS2 project of its own. And while Studio 1 has had the foresight to attach several different types of character classes, provide an open-ended approach to solving puzzles, and include a massive amount of hidden unlockables, it's the incredibly popular online component that truly makes Resident Evil Outbreak so appealing.   Of course, the real question from Biohazard diehards is whether or not this jump to the world of online connectivity is enough to propel Resident Evil Outbreak to the same level of respect enjoyed by the original and its sequel. Quite frankly, the answer to that question is no -- but that doesn't mean that the game doesn't have its merits.    Story  Unlike any of the Biohazards before it and due to the fact that it's designed for online play, Resident Evil Outbreak doesn't offer a formal storyline of any kind. Better described as a melange of different perspectives, the plot this time around is all about the T-Virus and how it spread through Raccoon City in the first place. Instead of affixing itself to the point of view of only one or two super-powered characters like Jill or Leon in games past, however, Resident Evil Outbreak unfolds through the eyes of the everyday citizen; or rather, eight different citizens from various walks of life.   The types of characters at your disposal are pretty broad in terms of their backgrounds too, with police officer and Tom Cruise look-alike Kevin Ryman joining fellow tough guy and security guard Mark Wilkins as the game's muscle. Doctor George Hamilton and waitress Cindy Lennox do their duties as the paternal caring sort, while plumber David King and journalist Alyssa Ashcroft chime in with their strong wills and fierce determination. Finally we come to the cowardly subway driver Jim Chapman and the overly intelligent university student Yoko Suzuki. Combined, that's quite an eclectic group of personalities.   Unfortunately it's Outbreak's distinct lack of plot that serves as one of its biggest overall detractors; because as an adventure game, it's the storyline and character development that should be one of its most important priorities. And while players do receive specialized introductions, endings, and interim cut scenes based on the characters they select, they'll rarely do anything more than pace the action. Real background information or compelling scenes of dialogue are about as rare as the Magnum rounds are in the original Resident Evil. Luckily a small handful of these cut scenes are pretty impressive and fun to watch, but the flow events is so slip-shod and devoid of direction that it can creates quite an air of disappointment.    Gameplay  Though their storylines are a little on the thin side, the diverse selection of characters is probably Resident Evil Outbreak's most compelling new gameplay element. As not only is each and every one of them completely different in terms of appearance and background, they're overly dissimilar in play style as well. As a general rule each of these eight different heroes-in-training are provided with a unique personal item in addition to their own set of special actions to round out their abilities. Kevin Ryman, for instance, doesn't need to find a weapon in the beginning as he initiates his adventure with a .45 pistol right off the bat. Complimenting that attribute, he also has the ability to kick over oncoming enemies and take extended but powerful pot shots for extra damage.   Plumber David King, on the other hand, can utilize his toolbox for all sorts of helpful functions. Whether it's a folding knife to slice enemies into ribbons or duct tape to create a specialized arsenal, his skills definitely lend themselves well to the more creative players. Individual character abilities don't stop there either, as users of Jim Chapman can avoid zombie attacks by lying on the floor and playing dead while Yoko Suzuki has increased item storage and an extended back step that can be used to avoid danger. This variety in character selection is not only fun to exploit and experiment with, it's also extremely well-balanced -- with just about every known play style accounted for.   Another welcome element to the series is the analog control that Dreamcast users were enjoying years ago. With this new addition, maneuvering around enemies is a hell of a lot easier to perform with much quicker reactions and better navigation in tight spaces. Of course, the constantly changing camera perspectives may still pose a problem for detractors of the franchise's classic digital control (i.e.: pushing in a specific direction doesn't necessarily move you that way), but we've pretty much come to expect that kind of control scheme by now.    We do have to say, though, that Capcom's decision to allow gamers to interact with backgrounds and other players was a wise one; as it really helps to supply the stages and environments with a little more life (oh the irony). In fact, interaction with characters is really what Resident Evil Outbreak is all about -- to help other people survive the forthcoming massacre. There are all manner of ways to interrelate with other players too; be it picking them up from the ground when they're injured or grabbing their arms as they dangle about from dangerous ledges. You can even trade and exchange items or weapons and give basic pre-recorded vocal commands with the right analog stick, and whether or not your fellow survivors are computer controlled or human it doesn't matter -- a good mix of skills and teamwork is still what it takes to make it.   But the interesting and compelling additions to Resident Evil Outbreak don't stop there. New status effects like the bleeding affliction will draw enemies to you as they pick up on your scent and follow your trail. Nail guns can either be used offensively as a projectile weapon or defensively as a tool by pinning boards to doorways in order to keep things from coming through. Furthermore, players will be able to crawl through airshafts, hide inside lockers and other secretive places, or even create barricades with the various objects around them. Long story short, there's a nice amount of variety and plenty to be said for the efforts made to improve on the series.    Because of its decision to move away from a deeper storyline, Outbreak's main goal becomes that of collection. Be it secret costumes, bonus cut scenes, extra background music, or whatever else you can unlock, your primary objective in the game it to find as many hidden secrets as you can. To do so, players simply need to finish their chosen levels with quicker and better times, avoid using certain kinds of tactics, and lose as little help as possible. When finished, they're awarded a pool of currency-like points that they can then spend in the collection screen; resembling the system set up by Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance rather closely.   To help extend the life of this philosophy, Capcom was clever enough to make different demands on different characters by only allowing certain items to be available for specific characters in definite locations. The result is an incredibly massive and intensive undertaking that will no doubt take months to complete for even the most dedicated of gamers. Throw in the fact that you can only get a 100% completion rating if you participate online, and you can guarantee several dozen hours more spent searching for the hidden stuff. And let's face it: Online is where most players will likely spend the majority of their time anyway. But the problem is that it's this aspect of the game, the segment in which the whole premise of Resident Evil Outbreak is based in the first place, where the game design ultimately disappoints.   Unfortunately there isn't just one glaring problem that sticks out as the culprit behind this disappointment, there's actually several. The first and most obvious of which is the lack of scenarios to participate in: which are five in total. And while we'll readily admit that four out of those five are absolutely gigantic in size, running through the same locations over and over again can get repetitive fairly quickly (even if there are several alternate paths with enemy behavior and locations that change from game to game). It likely would have been a much better strategy to double the amount of scenarios to ten while cutting their size to half as big. Not only would have given more variety to your missions, but it would have sped the game a long as well.    And that's yet another issue: the speed. Plagued with loading times both online and off, Resident Evil Outbreak boasts 12-17 second load times in almost every transition. What's worse is that these transitions happen with great frequency: sometimes within only a few seconds within each other. Meaning that segments involving a character entering a room, watching a 15-second cut scene, and exiting to the next room takes as long as one minute to experience. That's a poor trade-off for 20 seconds of activity. It's really pretty bothersome. Of course, you can use the newly-released HDD to help out with those load times (an approximate 40% improvement), but even still -- Capcom could have at least included the old walking up to a door animations that it used in the older PSOne titles.   Perhaps the biggest problem of them all, though, is the fact that this is one online experience that actually feels pretty lonely. Since the A.I. bots (which aren't exactly the smartest cats in the world) accompany you in single player, there's no real novelty to playing with other humans in the online arena. Granted those players will definitely make better decisions than their A.I. counterparts, but since they can go off and do their own thing without you ever knowing it, it doesn't really seem to matter.    It wouldn't be so bad if there was a better way to communicate with your fellow humans when playing with one another. But with the only keyboard support taking place before the game begins and your conversation limited to unchangeable commands pre-programmed into the right analog stick, you'll likely be perplexed as to what is going on. And while we can definitely understand why developers would want to keep constant hints from experienced players hidden or talkative chatterboxes to a minimum level, there still should have been a more direct way to speak with one another to form more sophisticated game plans than just ~follow me!~   That doesn't mean that Outbreak still can't be fun, though. On the harder difficulty settings in particular it can be quite a magnificent challenge with a collection of puzzles are really well done; especially in comparison to the earlier efforts from the PlayStation One days. The sad part is, it won't take players very long before they memorize every solution to every scenario in the book, which makes the need for some kind of downloadable content all the more important -- A feature that at the time of this writing will not officially be supported by Capcom or Sony Computer Entertainment.   Graphics  The Resident Evil games have always been strong visual powerhouses and Outbreak isn't any different. Though we did find the polygonal backgrounds a bit dated-looking compared to some of Capcom's other big name titles (namely Onimusha 3 and Resident Evil 4), the atmosphere is still impressive with a high level of detail and plenty of subtle references to earlier Biohazards. From J's Bar to Raccoon University, this game absolutely oozes that distinct Resident Evil personality and should instantly make returning fans feel right at home. Moreover, Outbreak's character models are just as respectable with a large number of polygons that are highlighted rather convincingly by an impressive lighting engine and some of the best CG cinematics in town.    What Outbreak and the Resident Evil series really needs, though, is a more realistic set of animations. Still stiff and robotic looking when compared to most other action and adventure titles on the market, the silly-looking character movement can really take away from the spooky realism that the game otherwise conveys. Additionally, Outbreak does suffer from a couple of interesting graphical glitches (zombies will pop in and out of doors) and there's no collision detection by human characters when walking through portals or climbing ladders together (making for some very interesting clipping experiments that can create spontaneous three-headed people). On the whole, though, there are a lot more positives than there are negatives.   Sound  With the original Resident Evil Capcom really set our expectations high for bad voice acting and continues that tradition effectively in Outbreak. Ridiculously funny in some areas and surprisingly effective in others, the game's vocals definitely show inconsistency. When compared to other games in their series, though, they're probably not that bad; but because the right analog dialogue commands illicit vocal representations from characters every time it used, the voices can get pretty repetitive rather fast. Throw in the fact that the A.I.-controlled NPCs constantly repeat the same few words over and over again and you could have yourself a headache in the making.    Musically, though, Resident Evil Outbreak is terrific. The opening song alone is easily one of the single best melodies in the history of videogames and the supporting ambient music is similarly strong. Composer Akihiko Matsumoto (Space Travelers, Returner) has done a wonderful job of capturing the mood and feel of the RE franchise and should definitely be recognized for his work. Audio effects, on the other hand, are pretty much the same samples we've been hearing in the series for years and while they get the job done, offer little new in terms of variety.Resident Evil Outbreak is the classic example of a title that had worlds of potential only to fall short in the end. Though shifting its focus to that of a collection game may have been a great way to extend its overall shelf life, it still should have been supported by a stronger storyline, better A.I. for NPCs in the offline mode, additional scenarios to participate in, and more streamlined load times without the need for a hard drive. And if the game was going to support the hard drive, why not support it with downloadable goodies and missions in the future? Not to mention the fact that the need for better and additional communication options is a must. After all, in this modern technological climate where keyboards and voice chat unite gamers the world over in various platforms, this pseudo-sign language bit just doesn't seem to stack up.Sadly these nitpicks may come across as much harsher than they actually are. As Resident Evil Outbreak is still a solid survival horror experience that should give returning fans of the series plenty of new elements to sink their teeth into. Hell, being able to transform into a zombie and terrorize your friends and neighbors in itself is enough incentive to give this one a try at the very least. And that doesn't even begin to count the expanded exploration options, unique character abilities, and genuinely cool monsters (some of which are exclusive to this new offshoot) that players will be able to enjoy on their way to escaping Raccoon City.What we think it all comes down to is the fact that a network version of Resident Evil is so rife with possibilities (persistent online world anyone?) that it makes legitimate yet basic attempts like this sting us extra hard when it doesn't quite measure up. Sure Outbreak is a nice way to pass the time for Biohazard fans anticipating the release for Resident Evil 4 later this year, but for those of us who revere the series (this author being one of them), it isn't quite what it should have been. Here's to hoping that Capcom will make good use of that Hard drive rather soon.", "date": "Mar 26, 2004"}
