With an emphasis on gameplay over graphics, Puzzle Fighter is a game that both casual and hardcore gamers can get behind. Whether you've been a fan of the game for years or haven't yet given it a try, this HD Remix of the classic is worth a look.   At first glance, Puzzle Fighter is reminiscent of any number of Tetris clones that popped up after developers recognized the demand for block dropping action. Look a little closer and you'll find a game with enough depth to keep you stuck in front of the screen for hours.   Gems of four different colors drop from the top of the screen in pairs and pile up on the bottom as you attempt to maneuver and rotate them into the best position. To clear them, special round Crash Gems are used that will wipe out any like colored gems that they touch, along with others that those gems are touching in a chain reaction. Large enough chain reactions will send a whole stack of Counter Gems at the opponent, giving the enemy even more to think about. If your stack reaches the top of the screen in the fourth column, you lose. If it happens to your opponent first, you win.   It's simple in design, but play against anyone who has a lot of experience with Puzzle Fighter and you'll find a significant amount of strategy and quick reflexes are required to hang with the best. Setting up combos, building large attacks and countering weak ones as well as knowing your opponent's drop patterns are all keys to success. Choosing a character is more than a cosmetic choice. Each one has a unique pattern of Counter Gems that they send at opponents. Knowing what the enemy is going to send at you and being able to prepare for it is the difference between a good and a great player.     As this is an old game and we're now in the HD-era of gaming, Capcom went ahead and updated the visuals of Puzzle Fighter. This is where the ~HD~ part of the HD Remix title comes from. This nomenclature might be a bit misleading. The gems, break effects, menus, and backgrounds have all been updated and look quite good for a low-priced downloadable title. Yet, for some reason unknown to us, the sprites that do the on-screen ~fighting~ as you play haven't been touched. Instead, they've just been blown up to fit on the hi-res screens. It looks completely out of place with the rest of the game, especially during the little scenes that play out at the end of the single-player game.   Capcom may not have gone the full step into the hi-def world with HD Remix, but it did take the time to ensure that the game was brought up to date. While the gameplay itself hasn't been changed, some of the rules and options around it have been fleshed out and adjusted. Online play, leaderboards, the ability to check drop patterns mid-game, and even a drop pattern editor have been added. New modes of play have been added to the mix as well. In addition to the classic X mode, an all new X' mode has been included that adjusts the damage ratios on several characters to better balance the game. For hardcore Puzzle Fighter fanatics, this is all a big deal.    Those that don't have a long and storied Puzzle Fighter history will perhaps be more impressed with the nice variety of options present in this remix. In addition to the X and X' modes, there are Y and Z modes that offer varying takes on the Puzzle Fighter gameplay to a degree where they almost feel like entirely different puzzle games.    There's an offline arcade mode that can be played with a friend or alone, but the online game is where most will probably feast. Leaderboards for each mode and enough options to customize the match to your exact liking are a good start. Getting into a match is as easy or specific as you want it too, with options for being tossed directly into a match or selecting from open matches to find the best ping. A four player ~quarter mode~ where two watch and wait their turn is the icing on the cake. Spectating in a game like Puzzle Fighter is great with a group of friends, but also works with strangers as you get to sit and watch more experienced players have at it while you learn their strategies.    After a significant number of online matches, we only found a couple that had enough lag to affect the quality of the game. We had a bit of trouble with getting the quick match feature to work at first as it kept returning a message saying that no games could be found, though this issue seemed to become nonexistent after our initial troubles.Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is most definitely addicting. At times, I found myself with sore eyes as I refused to blink during particularly intense matches. How often does that happen with a downloadable game? Not often enough. Although the Xbox 360 d-pad isn't the best choice for puzzle games, it works well enough that this game is still a great deal of fun. Give it a shot.", "date": "Aug 30, 2007"}
