This year, noble superheroes will do battle against rascally pirates. On the smaller screen, there's another brawl during summer. It takes place in living rooms across the country, where blockbuster-inspired games fight for supremacy. One of these games, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for PSP just recently sailed into retailers.  This game is nothing like The Legend of Jack Sparrow, which shipped for the PS2. Instead of re-imagining the events of the first movie, Dead Man's Chest on PSP sticks to the plot of the sequel. It follows pirate Jack Sparrow and his crew as they battle the infamous Davy Jones. It seems Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp in the movie, has made a deal with Davy Jones and now it's time to pay. The payment? Only his soul. Sparrow decides he'd rather not spend eternity as a sea monster and decides to fight. No real surprise there.      For the first few minutes, Dead Man's Chest plays a lot like its console sibling. Both titles make combat their focus and each plays from the third-person perspective. But give it a few more minutes and you soon realize the two games couldn't be more different. This is true of every element, too. Apart from the pirate theme, nothing ties the two products together. Whether the differences make Dead Man's Chest a better game lies with your personal taste. But this much is fact: A series of flaws plagued Legend of Jack Sparrow and very different, yet equally serious flaws plague Dead Man's Chest.   It has all the necessary elements, including combat, puzzles, upgrades and various enemy types. And while each element works well within the context of the game, none of them feels refined. Combat, for instance, should make up the most fluid and stable element yet it's downright clunky and rough. Problem is, the game shoots for those multi-person battles made famous by the movies, but the engine in place is ill-suited for the task. Combat only seems to work well when Jack is up against two, maybe three people, but the game constantly uses more than five.   And it's not the traditional swordfight, either, which isn't much of a problem but takes some getting used to. Here's how it works: instead of combining sword thrusts with blocks and parries dynamically, like in most (virtual) sword fighting, you need to pay attention to a button icon floating above an opponent's head. This icon tells you what button to press at any given time. You need to hit X, X, X, then square a few times to defeat one type of enemy, while another will require a few taps of the square button first, followed by a few of the X button. The system works fine for the most part, though it's still not as exciting as it could be.   Plus, as mentioned above, the system practically falls apart when fighting a crowd of villains. You can juggle multiple enemies only by pressing the circle button, which causes you to stun them, but it's only partly effective. You will usually sustain damage anyway, regardless of how well you try to defend yourself. Things get worse when you're fighting a crowd in the foreground while pirates stand in the background and shoot you with pistols. This really sucks and it keeps showing up in games. Unless there's a system to dodge or block incoming fire, there shouldn't be people (or whatever) firing at you. On the upside, character animation during combat is fluid and admittedly impressive, especially during Jack's killing strikes.       When not fighting, Dead Man's Chest throws a number of puzzles and obstacles in your way. You may need to cross a chasm or lava pit by activating a bridge, for example. Or you may need to blow open a door by strategically placing barrels of gunpowder. Most obstacles and puzzles feature a giant skull and bones icon floating near them, so you know you can manipulate the environment. It does make things a little easy, but seeing as mobile games need a sense of brevity anyway, it doesn't come off as overly simplistic.   More than anything, it just helps the game flow better. As well designed as these puzzles may be, they still suffer from the aforementioned lack of polish. Since most require you to explore a given environment and use a variety of objects, such as ropes for swinging or ladders for climbing, there's always this underlying sense of sloppiness. You'll notice some of the context sensitive actions won't respond right away, either. Sparrow won't latch on to ropes, for instance, or he won't pull levers and switches as fast as he should.    As far as multiplayer goes, Dead Man's Chest includes a naval warfare game. In essence, you sail around the seas and blast other ships by firing your port or starboard cannons. It's surprisingly fun and even slightly addictive, especially when played against live opponents. You control one of five different class ships, including the Brigantine and Frigate in three different modes, including plunder the Flag, Last Man Standing and Deathmatch.   Ship selection is pretty important since each has different speed and power attributes, and you can upgrade each in a number of different ways. You can also collect power ups that upgrade your cannon shots, repair your sails, etc.  Obviously, this isn't a strict simulation. It's very fast paced and action-oriented. This also means you don't have to worry about weight or wind conditions.  Ironically, sailing the high seas feels more natural than controlling Sparrow. In summary, it's a definite plus that it's included in the game.   Dead Man's Chest had the makings of a good, maybe even great, portable pirate adventure. Unfortunately, poor execution and shoddy control sabotages much of the experience. Character animation and environmental detail do impress, but it's not enough to keep the adventure from sinking.", "date": "Jul 6, 2006"}
