First it was The Unholy War with its strategy-action mix, now Trap Gunner comes along toting a blend of action and puzzle elements that hearken back to the days of Spy vs. Spy on the NES.  Assuming control of one of six characters, each with their own attributes (especially their weapon of choice), you must pursue the remaining cast members ~bounty hunter~-style through several multi-tiered stages which range from museums to warehouses.  You've got one character to catch per stage, but there's more to it than simply knocking the living daylights out of them. You see, both of you have the ability to set various traps which range from simple remote-triggered bombs to whirling vortexes  lethal ~combos~ of traps are even possible.   These traps can't be seen with the naked eye, so you've also got to enter a special ~trap detection~ mode to sniff out and disarm them. Performing the latter feat puts you in possession of said trap; fouling up the process (which requires entering button combinations) sets it off in your face. Ouch!  In addition to the standard game comes a two-player variant, which essentially plays the same, but with the obvious benefit of going head-to-head against a leaving, breathing opponent.   That's the game in a nutshell  here's how it went over with the review crew.Pure and simple, Trap Gunner is a refreshing break from an otherwise rapidly stagnating pool of me-too action games on PlayStation. Presenting a well-balanced mix of action and what can best be described as puzzle elements, it's simply one of a kind.It's visual and level design are spot-on, sound's great too, and the concept is one of the best I've yet encountered in an action game. It takes a decent amount of time to master the process of effectively laying and detecting traps  all while running and attacking  but one you do, it's a one-way trip to addiction city.If anything, I'd liken Trap Gunner to some of the earliest (and most unique) steps taken in console game development. It offers a style of play seldom seen these days  yet it's not entirely original. Spy vs. Spy did it first, but Trap Gunner makes it better in more ways than one.Simply super as a one player experience, it's sizzling as a two-player game. As far as party game go on PlayStation, this one ranks right up with the best of them. I'm highly impressed by Trap Gunner, and would recommend it to action fans  especially those looking for something very different  in a second. In fact, I just did.", "date": "Sep 29, 1998"}
