Last December's Digimon World DS was a pretty decent RPG, and arguably the best Digimon game since, well, ever. So naturally the guys over at Bandai Entertainment Company followed it up with a more courageous endeavor: Digimon World: Dawn and Digimon World: Dusk. The double SKU title is bigger than its prequel, but unfortunately, that doesn't quite make it better.   Players that aren't familiar with the Digimon franchise won't get much help from Dawn/Dusk. The game assumes the player knows what's going on, and it was probably developed for fans of the franchise, or at least people that played its prequel, Digimon World DS. Thankfully, there isn't too much to get. The entire world is digital, and humans can enter it, befriend sentient monsters, then make them beat each other up in an amalgamation of a martial arts tournament and a cockfight.   Trouble starts in the digital world when a virus busts in and disrupts connections to various areas, and somehow turns a bunch of Digimon into digieggs. So as the hero, players have to investigate the cause of this virus and try to restore order to the digital world.   Dawn/Dusk is pretty standard RPG fare. Players control a ridiculously dressed hero or heroine through an isometric world full of themed ~caves.~ While in these areas, monsters will randomly attack, throwing the player into a battle mode. Dawn/Dusk uses the popular collection-oriented monster team for the battle party and players can collect hundreds of different Digimon through battles, or ~digivolving~ acquired monsters to get new ones.   Some of the monsters are pretty hardcore. Others, not so much. Players that did pick up the first Digimon game on the DS will likely feel very familiar with Dawn/Dusk. In fact, that's the game's major fault. The levels are all very familiar, and there is an unshakeable sense of digi-been there, digi-done that. Everything that made Digimon World stand out is back again, but this time it's not new. The previous game had made some good steps to separate the Digimon franchise from its competitors. The developers didn't add much in the way of truly unique gameplay elements to further that progression.    In fact, the biggest change the game made is actually a detriment. The story has been delegated to a Quest system. In order to progress the story, players go to an office, and talk to a Digimon behind a counter to receive the next part of the story. This is how all the quests work, and for the side quests it's fine. Digimon ask for help, and trainers can come to the office to see what requests have been made. Why, however, would the Chief of the Union go to the petty grievances office to ask the player personally to go save the world? It completely destroys any pulse the story has, and makes the main character seem more like an errand boy than a hero.   A poorly presented story doesn't ruin the game. There are still some interesting mechanics that keeps the game pretty fun. The monster collection system is intact, wherein players scan small pieces of data every time they see a certain monster, and after enough data is collected, that Digimon can be added to the collection. The collection and raising of the Digimon is a fun experience. Since many Digimon can evolve in branching paths, planning out ways to get them all becomes almost as important as trying to save the digital world. The Digimon have different personalities and players can interact with their monsters, where the personalities shine through. Dialogue differs dramatically in the digi-small talk depending on if the monster is ~cool~ or ~scared~ or ~prissy.~   The battles are still the same as they were in the prequel, which is good since they worked just fine. The graphics aren't amazing, but it has a stylized charm. The attacks are vibrant and colorful, and the Digimon actually look like they're hurt when they get hit with a big attack. There is a lot of strategy involved in the battle system since the field is split into five zones, and different attacks affect different zones. Positioning ally Digimon and choosing the right attack becomes crucial in the later stages of the game. The fights seem tougher this time around, another possible side-effect of this being a game aimed at fans of the first title.     One thing that did get a makeover is the DigiFarm. The mechanics are the same as before. The DigiFarm is displayed on the top screen for most of the game, and as time passes within the game players get updates. The farm is used to train Digimon that don't fit in the party, and is a much more desirable alternative to sticking them in a PC box. This time around though, instead of having players buy certain types of farms - that are beneficial or detrimental to certain species - they buy a basic farm and customize it as they see fit. By buying and swapping out Terrain Boards and Background Music, players can customize the farm (which is now a farm island) to accommodate their Digimon. Unfortunately, the upgradeable farm goods has changed too. Before, the longer farm goods were placed and usable, the more they would upgrade, increasing their effectiveness. Now players earn upgraded farm goods via quests. While this does offer a larger variety of items, it also makes upgrading the farm a much longer process. And really, the DigiFarm isn't very useful until it's upgraded.   Last year's Digimon game had some Wi-Fi capabilities, but they were lackluster. This time around players can trade, battle, mate, and train their Digimon over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The battles actually earn tamer points, the same points given out in quests, so there is a benefit to it. The ability to battle with friends, even if it is tethered by the friend code system is a welcome addition. Being turn-based battles, the gameplay doesn't suffer when playing online. It would have been nice to be able to communicate with people though.   Don't take the teddy bear for granted. He'll kill you. Now unlike most games that offer two versions, there are substantial differences (at least in the beginning of the game) that would affect which title fans pick up. The first has to do with the starting teams. Sure, players either start on Light Fang or Night Crow depending on if they get Dawn or Dusk respectively, but that's not a big deal. Players that really care about the NPC's clothing colors, make that the deciding factor. However there is a difference between what Digimon the player starts with, and which ones are attainable early into the game. Dawn has a focus on the Holy, Dragon, Aquan and Bird species. Dusk rocks the Dark, InsectPlant, Beast and Machine species. Since the game gives you a starting team based on these species, it may be best to choose the one that seems more appealing. Also, Dawn/Dusk, while having nearly identical storylines, differ slightly in their progressions. The different caves and areas are unlocked in a different order, initially creating a focus on each game's flagship species. So it may not be a lot, and in the end, both games come out nearly the same, but that difference is more than most games offer. However, this doesn't warrant buying both games. The dialogue is practically identical in both titles and even though the backgrounds are different, it's the same Digimon World experience. There are about 400 different Digimon within the game, and it takes both games to get all of them, so that might be enough incentive for some.   Maybe it was because BEC was developing two games instead of one, or that were working on getting Wi-Fi abilities into the title, but the production value for Dawn/Dusk seems to have diminished. The game still has the basic look and feel of Digimon World, but is less polished overall. The character seems to slide around the environments, and not in time with the walking animations. Non-Playable Digimon are often walking in place instead of just standing which looks funky. In addition, when a cut scene or dialogue occurs, most of the NP-Digimon just vanish, and then reappear.It's not necessary to tell fans of Digimon to pick up this game. Gamers that have stayed with the series through all the iterations don't need an excuse, and they'll likely be pleased with this title. Still, it feels more like an expansion pack or parallel game than a true sequel. There are a ton of Digimon to collect, it's just unfortunate that players are forced to progress through a fetch-quest storyline. The battles are solid and the multiplayer can be a lot of fun. For RPG fans that are looking to pick up a new title, try to find the first Digimon World on the DS and become more familiar before starting Dawn/Dusk. Hopefully if another Digimon title comes along, it will digivolve enough to truly make a stand-out RPG.", "date": "Sep 18, 2007"}
