Hold 'em videogames of course came in droves, and while most of them weren't any good at the start, the overall quality slowly crept up as time went on. Unfortunately, World Championship Cards is a giant leap backwards. It's the ultimate example of a publisher spitting out a title by using existing tech and putting as little effort as possible into its creation to make a quick buck.   For starters, there's no poker to be found here. Sure, there are some 43 card games to choose from (10 of which are solitaire variants), but given that I had entirely assumed that some sort of poker would be included by title alone, I can imagine that a number of gamers who pick it up without warning will be severely disappointed.   Why? Oh, but you can play War! Let me tell you how incredibly fun it is to quickly tap X 50 or so times until either the rounds run out or someone wins. Oh wait, it's not fun at all. It's incredibly stupid. War isn't fun in real life, and it's even dumber in videogame form. The other games here are probably what you'd expect from a general card game title. Crazy 8's, Old Maid, Queen of Spades, Ride the Bus, Hearts, Golf and others are here to play. But do you really want to play Old Maid on your PS2?   World Championship Cards uses the same engine as the last World Championship Poker title (the games with Howard Lederer attached to them), but a lot of stuff added in later years has been removed. You don't have a world map to browse and choose games from. Instead, you just hit up your computer and sign up for a game in the next level of your overall championship.   Each level has a handful of games to play, each of which you must win in order to pass the level. You aren't actually betting anything, so losing doesn't hurt you, which essentially makes games like War a random winnings generator. The world map in the Lederer games was cool because you could skip the stuff that you didn't want to play (for the most part), but here you're forced to win even the dumbest stuff.   Entertainment galore! Do you already know how to play bridge? If not, you'd better learn because you're going to have to win a game. Luckily, there are in-game rule sets for each game, though complex games like Bridge can be a little confusing to learn if you don't know the basics of things, like what a trick is. The tutorials in the Extras menu does help with this a little more, however, as it'll explain a few rules, have you perform them, and then give you a few more. It's not the slickest thing around, but it works.   While that part of the presentation is decent, there are other elements which are downright terrible. The worst of the bunch is that the results screen after a given round doesn't display the points and whatnot well. You actually have to scroll around the window in all four directions, which is ludicrous because said window doesn't take up the whole screen. Does the text really need to be that big? And why isn't the window larger?   Playing cards requires selecting a card and then confirming your selection, which while a bit nitpicky, is a little frustrating at times. The menu and play sometimes lags and you think you've chosen something, but haven't. This is problematic when you're trying to knock in Ride the Bus or something similar.World Championship Cards is boring, poorly put together and, at times, annoying. If this had poker, I'd make a joke about folding. But, it doesn't.", "date": "Apr 3, 2008"}
