Digital Chocolate was first out of the gate in America with Brain Juice, a tight homage to the Brain Age game found on the Nintendo DS. IQ Academy, however, is tuned more like Big Brain Academy on the Nintendo DS -- a slightly more arcade-ish experience that offers brainteasers, but not with such a clinical interface.   Lest anybody think, though, that IQ Academy developer G-mode or Digital Chocolate are blatantly copying Nintendo, it is important to note that Nintendo really only popularized the genre for today's audiences. Trivia and brain games have been around for years. G-mode, for example, released its first brain training style game in Japan in 2003, which pre-dates the Nintendo DS. IQ Academy is actually a collection of games from G-mode's previously released brain training titles in Japan.   IQ Academy offers eight mini-games to test different cognitive skills, such as math and spatial awareness. None of these games are bad, but some are definitely better than others, such as Shape Building (you decide if the offered pieces can construct the displayed shape) and Which Way (you must press the pad in the same direction of all white arrows, but the opposite direction of black arrows). All answers are handled by pressing specific directions on the pad. In the box counting game, the game assigns three possible answers to three directions on the pad. The system definitely works, but in the clock game -- where you have to quickly discern the time on an analog clock -- the small answer text on the bottom of the screen is occasionally problematic.   There is a practice mode which lets you hone your skills at all of the mini-games before jumping into the test phase. The test runs you through all eight mini-games with a ticking clock. You need to burn through the test as fast as possible with the greatest degree of accuracy to get a good score. It's unlikely you'll ever run out of time completely, though.   Unfortunately, IQ Academy offers little reason to return to the game more than a few times since it keeps nothing close to the vest. The very first time you play, all of the mini-games are available. That decision completely removes any sense of discovery, since you see everything there is during your first play session. IQ Academy also fails to offer any fun brain tracking charts so you can track your progress. It uses a system of stars to judge test performance and doles out an IQ rating, but there's no real way to track your improvement over time unless you did so with a pencil and paper. Now, this feature certainly isn't required, but it's a genre staple and an odd omission, because half the fun of these games is charting progress -- whether it's truly scientific or not.   On Sprint, IQ Academy does use the Game Lobby feature so you can check out your brain power against other players, which is a cool addition.    IQ Academy -- which I played on an LG Fusic -- has a clean interface, where the puzzles take up the majority of the screen. The game offers a gallery of pictures that show off your current rating. Everybody starts out as a school kid, but with practice, you'll soon be a sunglasses-wearing college grad. The game also pumps out some harmless background music while you play.  IQ Academy is a decent entry in the brain training genre, but it lacks sufficient reasons for constant replay. What you see is what you get and repetition sets in too quick for me to really recommend the game. With better structure and some good stat tracking tools, IQ Academy could have been a solid buy. As it is right now, even with the Game Lobby feature for Sprint players, IQ Academy is better left to those that are obsessive over this genre.", "date": "Sep 14, 2006"}
