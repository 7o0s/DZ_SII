In every way better than any of the next-generation kart games, CTR is also the most unoriginal, from its structure to its characters to its powerups and courses. This game reeks of Nintendo's Mario Kart 64 and Diddy Kong Racing in every facet, and yet if you can push aside the maniacally smiling, pasted-on smile of Crash bursting across the finish line, then you will like this game. To be fair, Naughty Dog has integrated its usual technical magic by making CTR good-looking, fast, and four-player.  Gameplay Crash takes the best parts of Nintendo's Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing (which by the way was also fabulously unoriginal), brews them up in to a fresh polygonal world, and puts a Crash Bandicoot face on the kart genre. But the kart formula hasn't changed much here since Mario Kart on the Super NES. Race for first place and tag buddies with as many power-ups as possible to dismantle, destroy, and undermine their chances in every single lap. At the same time, players need to look for shortcuts, learn the ins-and-outs of the courses, and become a better driver, too.   Players can choose from all of the goofy characters in Crash's world, including Crash, Dr, Neo Cortex, Tiny Tiger, Coco Bandicoot, Pura, Polar, Dingodile, N. Gin, plus bonus characters, and play through several play modes. For quick and dirty one-off, players can choose Arcade Single, but if they want to blast through more than 17 of the courses than they should choose Cup, a race that pits you in four races in which the winner gets the best accumulative point score. There are four cups, each with four races in them, and a big winners parade at the end.   Also selectable is Adventure, which mimics Diddy Kong's single-player mode almost perfectly, except they don't get to pilot a plane or a hovercraft (Darn!). Players do, however, get to explore new and freaky areas of Crash's world, from sandy deserts to polar caps to mountainous ranges, too. Each time Crash wins trophies, keys or special icons, he opens up a new course, or an entirely new realm filled with new challenges. Bosses appear at the end of each of the worlds to signify your success in that area.   Another mode to play is Time Trial, which is based solely on time, and then save their best times as a ghost to play against in any future race. Or, when as many as three other friends are available, you can turn to Battle, a multiplayer kart racing section that makes use of the Multitap peripheral.   For those who have played kart games before, and I've played many, CTR pays a lot of attention to the games in its heritage, and in so many ways it excels over them, especially in the technical department. First off, there aren't really any kart games on the PlayStation to compare this game to. The rest all pretty much suck. So I'm going to compare this straight up with Mario Kart 64 and Diddy Kong Racing, the two best on the console circuit. Naughty Dog took apart every aspect of those games, at least that I could see, and made CTR a better game. First, the game is fully polygonal, and the characters are all polygonal, too, something that Mario Kart wasn't, but Diddy Kong was. That basically enhances the game's looks, and gives it a better overall gloss. Diddy Kong, despite its marketing technology called ~RDA~ (realtime dynamic animation), still suffered from slowdown. CTR suffers from none whatsoever. Not even in multiplayer.   Second, Mario Kart offered several courses based on a variety of racing, dirt bike, kart, street racing, whatever. So does Crash. It's got the frozen, icy levels, the desert levels, your tubular courses, and the floating-in-mid-air courses. What would we do without the obligatory hovering-somewhere-in-the-atmosphere courses? But CTR is riddled with little differences that make the game more enjoyable than your average kart game. Bash though at least one tube section and watch as your kart scrapes the wall, while little fiery sparks fly off. Nice subtle touch. In the icy levels, when any one of the riders hits the actual frozen lake sections, the sliding physics are remarkably realistic, far more than in any kart game on the PlayStation. Grab 10 apples and watch as your arsenal grows more powerful and your speed increases, just like in Diddy Kong. And while taking certain turns, some of the road shoulders are up on another level, and the karts adjust in 3D without a hitch. These are just some of areas Naughty Dog addressed that make CTR a superior kart game.  The list goes on and on, and with at least one exception, I think they're all totally credible. This one is just too damn close for comfort, and it simply must have been left in as a ridiculous joke. When playing as Crash, he says at least two things, one when he's smashed, and another when he is sent spinning. When he spins off, he says, ~woah-whoa-whoa-whoa,~ EXACTLY like the voice of Luigi in Mario Kart. Is that some kind of joke or what?   And of course, the meat of the game is multiplayer, Vs mode. Finally, a four-player split-screen kart game that rocks on the PlayStation! If you must have a party game this year, get this game. It's true, though, the characters get really small, the split-screen is difficult to use at times because the other screens are distracting, but once you taste a little bit of it, you'll love it.   Innovation and Originality Kart racing just got a little extra feature that hopefully will be picked up in future kart games -- although I certainly hope there aren't too many more coming down the pike. PlayStation has had more than its fair share of cute kart games this year, CTR not exempt. But to the point, the new thing is the turbo boost. The one big innovation Naughty Dog has dolloped up for us is the manic, airborne behavior of the turbo boost. Players must seek out jumps, ramps, and ridges to get hang time. Each millisecond that your racer spends in the air he or she gains in turbo power back on the ground. Of course, karts move slower in mid-air, but the boost is worth it, right? Whatever way you look at it, speed and time management are key. Drive fast, use the boost as often as possible, and it will benefit you. It's a good, useful addition to kart racing that deepens the game.  I liked some of the variations on courses, too. Much of CTR brings new-ish light to kart course design, especially a few special courses. Tiny Area, the dirt track course, is a blast. First, it's a long course, with lots of turns and good solid straight-aways for serious weapon exchanges. But there are these little mud pits in which your character will sink, that are cool to look at, and are part of the obstacles you must avoid to win. In some cases, jumps are deftly placed to launch over these, if you're prepared, and in others, you simply have to know the course. Polar Pass is another excellent course with a little of everything, annoying seals criss-crossing in your path, huge jumps for awesome turbo injection, extremely sharp turns that absolutely require drifting skills, a branched area, successive jumps for good speed, and those amazing physics-heavy icy patches. I also liked Hot Air Skyway for its narrow paths, massive jumps, and drift-heavy 180-degree turns.   Other than that, the game is an absolute wasteland of unoriginal concepts. Even Chocobo Racing, which stole from Mario Kart and Yoshi (with the 2D, pop-up book concept), wasn't as eerily close in shape, concept and structure as CTR is to Diddy Kong or Mario Kart 64. (Chocobo Racing wasn't as good, either, but at least Story mode was different, and so was the power-up and vehicle system.) Every aspect of CTR seems to have been cloned and reformed just like Nintendo's and Rare's kart games. The courses, the modes, the adventure aspect, everything, and all with a big, gleaming Crash Bandicoot grin. Rod Sterling would have found this remarkably strange, to say the least. So would Xerox.  Graphics Crash looks great for what it is. Just as the second and third Crash games reached their height in graphic PlayStation power, CTR seems to have benefited from Naughty Dog's sharp programming skills. The sharp looking environments are clean and fully formed. With the exceptions of a few seam problems in the courses here and there, they are great looking. Of course, the world is totally Crash. It's cartoony in every aspect and fits right into Crash's world without missing a beat.   The polygonal characters are small and minimal in design, but all kart characters have been that way. Each is full of funny animations and cleanly designed. Each kart also reacts extremely well, with no lag times, or hang-ups. In any one of the single player games slowdowns simply doesn't exist. Even if there is some slowdown here and there, even the most critical player would have to search them out. These frame rates are solid stuff, enabling fluid motion and a good sense of speed, which is consistently felt and seen throughout the game.  Sound That classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat is right back in Crash Team Racing. It's got a little beat and it's simple, but it's not necessarily great. After a few courses, you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it makes you want to cry or pull your hair out, or both (Ex: see any picture of bald Doug). Perhaps the best way to go about listening to Crash is to pump up the sound effects and turn down the music. Thankfully, most of the sound effects work well, but only a couple of the voices seemed to have any life. Aside from the cloning of Luigi voice, only a few of the characters say anything worth repeating to your opponent while playing, or for that matter, remembering. I do remember repeating the too-cute sayings in Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing, like, Wario's ~Ohhhh! I knew it!~ or Pipsy's ~I'm Pipsy~ because it was so stupid and mousy. But sound-wise, there's nothing really that cute, clever or memorable in CTR.  Well, if you haven't already gotten a sense of what I thought about Crash Team Racing, I'll make myself even clearer. I feel a little like Crash and Lara Croft have something in common, which is that I've seen too much of them in the last four years. I know it's terrible to say, but I'm kinda of sick of Crash Bandicoot, and I could take a big long vacation from him and his comical dance for a long while. It took me a long time to get into this game because every time I look at Crash can see dollar signs blinking in his eyes. Once I got past that major obstacle, I faced the game's all too familiar feel and structure, which depressed me. Finally, after getting about 50% into the game, through sheer force, I started liking it.But most folks have only a few choices come the winter the winter holidays. So, here's the bottom line, all cynicism aside. Like I said in the beginning, once you get past the insanely capitalistic smile of Crash, the game is rock solid in playability and graphics. Hell! It's a four-player kart game that's on the PlayStation. Isn't that enough? I mean, not only that, but none of the problems of the other kart games even exist in this one. So what's all the fuss about? If you want a pure party game -- and the best kart game on PlayStation or Nintendo, for that matter -- get Crash Team Racing.", "date": "Oct 30, 1999"}
