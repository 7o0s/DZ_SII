First, Electronic Arts' excellent Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, a half simulation, half arcade take on the sport. Last the highly anticipated Mario Golf, which is destined to grace the console sometime in 2003 courtesy of Camelot Software. And somewhere in between is a little known entry called Swingerz Golf from Eidos Entertainment. It's a game that at first glance appears to be the epitome of arcade golf: over the top, cute characters, colorful graphics, and a limited supply of courses and options. But it's not quite what it seems. A complex, initially unintuitive driving system clashes with the look and style of the project, and that's bound to confuse some golfers looking for a quick, speedy day on the green. For those who can adjust to the unique play style, though, Swingerz ultimately arrives as a worthy alternative to Tiger and a decent stand-in for Mario.  The Facts  Six courses based on wide-ranging terrain including red-rock deserts to the classic English countryside Choose from 14 personality-laden golfers, each with different skill sets Take advice -- if you dare -- from your choice of six loudmouth caddies Four modes of play including Tournament, Stroke, Match, and Short Course Go toe-to-toe with intense weather effects such as strong winter winds and tropical downpours Realistic physics engine brings real-world golf to GameCube and even has you swinging your clubs with analog control Mini-games such as ~Nearest the Pin~ -- a nine-hole, par-three course -- extend replay value Win tournaments and beat rival golfers to earn better gear Save your unbelievable shots to memory card Gamers will have access to a full range of gauges measuring wind speed, hole distance, and more Multiplayer mode supports four players, and includes an ~even~ setting to equalize stats and keep things fair Requires 10 blocks of data for saves   Gameplay Swingerz Golf, which is developed by Telenet Software out of Japan, is something of a golf mystery. After extensive play with the game, we're not sure if we'd classify it as an arcade or simulation representation of the sport. It sends mixed signals. On the one hand, all of the basic options are in place for an arcade take on golf. The game features six fictional courses of semi-realistic, though overly saturated and colorful design. It has four modes of play, from single game Tournaments to multiplayer Match and Strokes. It even has a small selection of mini-games. But its driving system is so drastically different -- more complex and difficult -- than competing golf games that it's nearly impossible to call this a ~pick-up-and-play~ title. That would be wrong.  So what's the big difference? Most golf games follow a simple swing structure that revolves around an on-screen power meter. When a button is pressed, a bar on the meter rises and drops, and it's up to players to time the bar; usually the highest point represents power and the lowest accuracy, so the swing button is pressed twice. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, meanwhile, follows a different method altogether, and one that relies only on the back and forth motion of the analog stick to determine power and accuracy. Swingerz' configuration borrows elements from both types for an experience that isn't bad -- it's just harder. It too relies on the back and forth swing of the analog stick for shots, but it does so in conjunction with a meter that measures power. Gamers must pull back the camera stick on the GCN controller to ready a shot and then push forward to render a swing -- and this execution is performed solely for the function of determining accuracy. Meanwhile, the process of pushing forward on the camera stick must be timed as the bar on the power meter reaches its highest point. That's one extra step beyond other golf games, which already makes the setup a difficult one to juggle for the inexperienced.   Swingerz Golf on GCN  However, there's yet one more element to deal with, and it's a real doozey: golfers must also be sure to make sure that their shots are perfectly straight. The game tracks the exact forward motion of the camera stick, and if one's stroke is not within a set of boundaries -- too far left or right, in other words, it will result in a ~bad~ or ~poor~ swing. The result is a control scheme that's sure to confuse and frustrate initially. After some practice, it becomes clearer, and over time also easier. We even appreciate some of the finer points gained by the setup. For instance, when a ball is hit in the rough, the boundary of what measures an acceptable swing decreases, which is an excellent way to mimic what it's like to actually play from such an unfortunate point. The downside, though, is that the configuration is neither as precise as the strictly analog control in Tiger Woods nor as friendly and intuitive as in the standard golf game. Strangely, it's also a scheme that simulationists are more likely to appreciate than those seeking an arcade take on the sport, which seems to go against everything else the game has to offer.      Gamers who can adjust to the scheme are otherwise in for a fun alternative to the golfing norm. The selection of courses, limited we admit, is still large enough to check over, and the holes are unique and challenging. Some shots are extremely satisfying when nailed. For instance, there are several holes that require players to sink their ball on an island halfway to the hole -- it's difficult, but not impossible by any means, and a very entertaining task. Putting, meanwhile, follows the traditional outline of the sport: a grid appears over the green and players determine the right amount of power and proper angle to sink it. It's intuitive as ever.   The game features 14 playable characters, many of them over the top, but sadly only two are available from the start. The rest must be unlocked in various matches of the game, a disappointment. Meanwhile, the so-called colorful player caddies do little more than stand around and say the same line over and over again: ~Come on! You can do it!~ Not exactly a mind-blowing addition.  Graphics There are two hands here. On the one hand there is the 3D engine powering Swingerz Golf, which is commendable. It easily spits out large 3D courses skinned with crisp enough textures, filled with geometrical additions such as polygonal trees complete with branches and leaves. The greens are colorful, with varied rough and sand traps, all surrounded with water gaps, mountainous lumps, rocks, and various background textures. There are likewise cinematic camera angles that show off the real-time nature of the courses with fly-bys, or follow the balls as they soar triumphantly through the air. There is even a camera view that shoots the action upward from the inside of the hole. It looks good, and best of all it runs fast -- 60 frames per second smooth. And on the other hand we have the character designs, which are downright poor, not to mention generic. The polygon counts of these beasts have to be in the single digits, and the characters are not saved by fluid or impressively unique animation -- it's mostly a stiff selection of wobbles and putter swings. It's as if two different development teams worked on the engine and the characters. At day's end, Swingerz is still a solid looking golf entry, but it's not nearly as pretty as Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 or the upcoming Mario Golf.  Sound Annoying. Unnerving music mixed with standard sound effects. The tunes in the game will make players wish they had an anti-stereo and the caddie commentary is so colorless that anybody who hears it may go blind. We're not sure how that connection works, but somehow it does. Trust us. The sound effects -- the whacks and thumps of the balls, are somewhere in ~get the job done~ territory. This is the type of game best played with volume down and the music from the stereo CD player up.Swingerz Golf is a fun alternative to Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003. The golf swing mechanic is unique and on some levels deeper than most competing games. But it's also unnecessarily difficult and un-arcade-like -- a strict contradiction to the rest of the game. That's not to suggest that it isn't fun -- it is, but it takes some getting used to. Meanwhile, the game's selection of courses is adequate and challenging and its 3D engine solid, though I'm baffled about some of the character designs and audio implementations in the game.Not bad. But if you have to choose between the two games, go with Tiger Woods. It delivers a better arcade mode with more options and it has far better graphics.Recommended as a rental for most.", "date": "Nov 5, 2002"}
