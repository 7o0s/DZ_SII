Their ship, piloted by Dangerous Dan -- a goofy, decidedly unattractive, balding anti-hero of a man -- and Evo, your basic microchip-operated robot, plows through space in search of a long lost man-made space station. A space station that was built more than 1000 years before by Earth and, shortly after its launch, vanished. The station has since then mysteriously reappeared and it's bound on a collision course with Earth. Unless Dan and Evo can stop it, all will surely perish.Upon booting the game, players are treated to an opening intro that highlights our heroes' journey to the space station. As Dan and Evo argue over musical preferences, their ship smashes into an asteroid and plummets directly towards the lost Silicon Valley. Far below on the space station, a dog named Roger and sheep named Flossy have thrown the shackles of society off and have pledged their forbidden love for one-another. It's at this defining moment in animal history that Dan and Evo's ship comes crashing through the shell of Silicon Valley and lands directly upon Roger, killing the dog instantly. A moment later, Evo is ejected out of his chair and sent soaring into the ceiling of the space station, where the robot is shattered into a number of pieces revealing his inner, microchip core, which falls back to the ground unharmed. As Evo cannot survive without a host, the microchip makes his way to the corpse of Roger the dog, and the game begins. Welcome to DMA Design's latest adventure for Nintendo 64: Space Station: Silicon Valley.Are you confused? Disturbed? Good. Buckle up, because things only get worse from here. At first glance, gamers may be fooled into thinking this game is just another Mario-esque ~platformer~ with cartoony graphics and silly animal designs, but there's much, much more to Silicon Valley than that. In fact, it can be said that this game is downright twisted, and, at times, a little sadistic. But SV's off-the-wall sense of humor and freshly original wickedness are disguised beneath the game's cute outer skin -- and that maybe the only reason DMA managed to sneak this gem behind Nintendo's back uncensored.GameplayThe idea behind the game is fairly simplistic: players take on the role of Evo, a robotic microchip that possesses the unique ability to take over the bodies of dead (robotic) animals. Evo must make his way through a variety of levels and worlds filled with different objectives and, of course, different animals. Because no two levels are alike, it would be impossible to describe exactly what must be accomplished to complete a world. For example, the game's first stage simply has players killing a sheep, taking over its body and picking up some energy. Another level sees players as a dog, herding sheep up into a gated area and then jumping into the body of a mouse-on-wheels. Yet another level pits players in the role of rat, which must make its way through a complex maze of sewers, activating hidden switches to open doors and gain access to new areas. There's even a stage where players must intentionally piss-off a hippo by laughing at him using the hyena. The game consists of four different huge over-worlds, including Europe, Desert, Arctic and Jungle, and more than 35 unique sub-levels. Early levels can be completed in a matter of minutes, whereas later stages may take hours to figure out. It's ~old-school~ gameplay at its very, very finest.Just as there are tons of levels, there are even more animals. Just a few include: flying bi-plane dogs, mice-on-wheels, laughing pink hyenas, elephants, tank-turtles, fire-foxes, rocket dogs, lightning-scorpions, exploding-feces-dropping-rats, swinging apes, helicopter rabbits, hungry huskies, snow-throwing penguins that float with umbrellas, circus juggling bears, roaring lions, angry rams, motorized walruses and, of course, hovering sheep. Each animals possesses its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, elephants are terrible slow, but hard to kill, whereas a mouse-on-wheels maybe extremely fast, but hard to maneuver.GraphicsVery simple, very stylistic and extremely humorous. Silicon's visuals are colorful, bright, cheery and silly. Sheep, which are puffy balls with four legs sticking out, stare mindlessly at nothing, blinking. Dogs shake off water and run around aimlessly. Rats deposit disgusting piles of feces that steam and then explode. Silicon Valley lacks the graphic finesse of a title like Banjo-Kazooie, but that said, it's still not bad looking. Levels are, for the most part, very polished, sporting nice water effects, subtle real-time lighting effects and more. However, this game isn't so much about eye-candy as it is clever gameplay. Later levels boast a bit of slowdown, but nothing that can't easily be overlooked. All in all, not bad at all -- and certainly funny.SoundVery well executed. The music itself, a questionable mix of ~futuristic space-pop~ and elevator-like tunes, plays at different volumes depending on area locations. DMA Design attempts to explain the music in Silicon Valley through a series of speakers located in various areas of each level. The closer a player gets to a speaker, the louder the music. Tunes can be turned off entirely by blowing up a speaker. It's actually very entertaining.Sound effects for animals are equally satisfying. Sheep ~baa!~, dog's bark, hyena's laugh maniacally, rats fart and so on. It's all quite amusing and adds greatly to the overall experience. You may find yourself dropping exploding feces now and again just for the sound of it.Silicon Valley maybe the most original game to hit Nintendo 64 yet. We would warn any gamer not to judge this title by its cute exterior. Rent it if you're unsure of its subject matter, but don't pass it up. This game is an absolute gem that truly emphasizes old-school gameplay mechanics in a stylized 3D world -- all with a wicked sense of humor and loads of animals to kill. There's so much to do, whether it be imperative to the game or not, that players can have just as much fun exploring and experimenting as they can completing level objectives. Each level presents new obstacles, new animals and inventive, witty humor. Silicon Valley's only downfall, as far as I'm concerned, lies in the fact that it doesn't dish up a multiplayer mode. Had that been an option, it may have received a perfect score. Now is your chance to send a message. Amidst a sea of mediocrity, reward the developer that takes a chance, delivering an inventive, original game that is just as hilarious as it is addictive.
