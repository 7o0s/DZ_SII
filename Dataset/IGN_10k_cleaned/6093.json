NBA 06 (not to be confused with NBA Live 06), is the latest basketball simulation on the handheld that promise real hoops action complete with online play. Fortunately, the game is better than the one that game came out at launch. With a better look, cleaner gameplay and the addition of two cool new mini-games, this is definitely a step up. But those improvements aren't quite enough. There are still some details that have missed the dev team's attention, details that could've made the experience closer to excellent.   Cosmetically, the game has undergone some noticeable changes. For one, the 989 Sports label is gone. Once the actual game starts up, the first thing I noticed was that the player's character models have improved. They're cleaner, with more animations the help pronounce the athleticism of basketball. The player's body movement will even reflect a joy after drawing a foul while making a shot. Even when they're guarding another player or backing in for the turnaround jumper, it all looks more refined than before. The game is running at 60 frames per second and it's quite apparent at just a glance. The PSP is proven once again to have a nice amount of graphical power.   From the main menu you can hop into quick play, which offers an exhibition, all-star or online game. The next big section is game modes, which breaks things down into Exhibition Mode, Season Mode, Playoffs Mode, Shoot Around Mode, and Free Throw Mode. The season mode is pretty much identical to the way it was in the last game. Simply press the square button to simulate or X to initiate the game. The actual season length can be set to play 29, 58 or 82 games. The Playoffs are adjustable for single elimination or best of 3, 5, or 7. Getting free agents is just as simple as before. The interface will list the name of the present roster next to a list of free agents. Scroll and match for a likeable swap and press X. Done. There's no worry about money issues -- real straight forward.     The next big section, and arguably one of the most fun, is Mini-games. This time you have five to choose from: Skills Challenge, Own the Court, 3 Point Contest, Horse, and Dodgeball. Again, just like before, the Skills Challenge game works out better than Practice Mode because it helps develop more than shooting skills. The new Horse game is a little tough if you're not that comfortable with the controls. Just like the school yard game, it requires you to pull-off tough shots in hopes that your opponent can't do the exact same. If they miss copying and making a shot you pull-off, they'll get a letter in the word horse. If you miss getting one of their shots, you get the same. This first one to get the entire word ~Horse~ loses. You can try hook, bank-shots, and even turnaround jumpers. If that sounds a little to complicated, then the new Dodgeball game will probably suit your taste. You can play with actual NBA teams, and the object is to tag out players by hitting them with a basketball. It's fun just for the fact that it's so whacky looking. In all, the mini-games are one of the greatest features here because they're quick, easy to learn, and challenging at the same time.  Online gameplay is available for NBA. There is an option to play with people across the country through the Internet (the word Infrastructure has been gratefully taken out due to obvious confusion), or go head-to-head through the Ad hoc option. It's nice to see these features utilized to their fullest considering the fact that the PSP was built for hi-tech gaming.   One of the biggest issues with the last game was the shooting mechanism. In hopes of breaking new ground, shooting was accomplished by having players tap the circle button once to begin the process of the shot, and then tapping it again to release it. If it wasn't timed just right, the shot missed. Once the ball turned green in the hands of the player, you had to tap the circle button at that time to get what they called the ~Perfect~ shot. Green meant good, yellow meant maybe, and red meant you could expect a sure miss. This feature has been thankfully improved.    Now, the hold and release control mechanism is back, and it works pretty well. If a user happened to have gotten use to the color coded indicators from before, those are back too. The idea is to release the button as soon as the ball turns green in the hand of the player. If they're just annoying, there's option to turn them off. Sometimes they feel as though they helped, and other times, not so much. There were occasions when I pulled up for a jumper, released in the red, and made the shot anyway. On other occasions, I timed it just right, released in the green, and somehow missed the shot. So it's really up to the user on whether the indicators work for them or not.   There's an added feature this time around with the Upper Deck framing system. In the previous game when players would make key plays, there would be freeze frame captured with an Upper Deck sports card frame. This time around, those cards get saved and you can trade them with your buddies over Ad-hoc. It sounds pretty cool, except for the fact that this a virtual card. The whole point of collecting real ball cards when I was younger was so that I could touch them, flip them over, store them in special holders so that they wouldn't get messed up, keep them in binders, and all that stuff. There's not as much charm involved in keeping players cards on a memory stick. Plus, the close-up of the actual faces doesn't look close enough to the real thing for me to appreciate them as ball cards. The character models might look good on court, but the detail in the faces still needs work. Also, the whole card framing system wasn't so intrusive before. They would flash on screen quickly, and then leave. Now they linger a little longer with an improved rendering of the Upper Deck frame, and it all distracts from the game somewhat.     The overall gameplay on the court has improved this year. It's faster and a bit cleaner. And even though A.I. has improved somewhat, I still saw some issues that I saw in the last game. Sometimes teammates will still let players run up the hole and put in easy lay ups. It was most frustrating was when I saw my teammate let an opponent just dunk on him1 The opponent just ran for the hoop and started his dunk animation, and I didn't select the defender just because I thought he would actively pursue the player with the ball. If he would have at least ran with him and got dunked on, that would have been ok. But instead he just stood still as if he was frozen in place, and the opponent just ran right by him. And it's not like he was manning up, guarding another player. The guy just went around him. There were other small glitches as well. Every now and then after a point was scored, I'd see players on the court making dribbling motions with their hand with no ball in sight. Another one was when a player was running across court and he just got stuck mid-motion, and started running in place.  Some things were just plain tacky. At the team selection screen, the two players that have recently joined the Heat team were still wearing their old jerseys. Antoine Walker was in his Celtics jersey and Jason Williams was in his Grizzlies jersey. If the dev team didn't have recent pictures of these guys in their new jerseys, they could simply went with head shots of all the players they wanted to show for the teams, or  they could've ditched the whole player image idea in the team selection screen all together. Instead, the stale jerseys make the game look broken because you see Walker grabbing his green Celtics jersey as the game identifies him with a Miami Heat logo.  Yes, the game does look better, and the new mini-games are really fun, but the overall product does need more work.  The players need to be more pro-active in defending the hoop. I didnt watch the opponent just barely slip by my teammate. No. I really saw my teammate give the guy an open lane to the goal  tons of space. He didnt even look at him, or try to do anything about the fact that he was on his way to score on us. Its frustrating and it needs tuning.", "date": "Sep 27, 2005"}
