Jumbuck Entertainment has found a way to combine both of these into a single title, Shaft Sharp Shooter.   Features:   18 mini-games  Soundtrack   Shaft Sharp Shooter takes the character of John Shaft, one of the baddest muthas (shut your mouth!) to ever carry a badge, and drops him into a Hogan's Alley type shooter. You remember that NES classic, yes? Thugs and gangsters appear on-screen randomly and you have to blast them. Naturally, Shaft Sharp Shooter doesn't have the luxury of a Zapper light gun, so instead, you control a crosshair on-screen with the touchpad.   The game is really only ~Shaft~ in spirit. At no point past the title screen do you see Shaft, and even then, it's only the back of his head. However, the game does manage to throw in a little street talk to at least attempt an urban feel.   Shaft Sharp Shooter is essentially a series of 18 shooting mini-games. Every game has the same basic premise -- blast the bad guys and save the hostages -- but it does switch up locations and backdrops, as well as include some training-esque missions back at the academy. Mini-games include shooting paper targets of criminals, tagging knives as they're thrown at a hostage, emptying a back alley of thugs, and nailing bad guys as they pop out of doorways in a long hall. Of course, scenes like this are made harder by the unfortunate arrival of hostages that always manage to get in your way just before you line up a shot.   Control is pretty basic. Cursor speed is actually faster than you would expect, making it pretty much your fault alone if you miss a criminal or accidentally tag an innocent.   Most of the mini-games are timed. You usually have specific score requirements that must be satisfied before moving on to the next mission. As you play, you receive promotions. You begin the game as a Wise Guy. Depending on your talents, you progress to higher ranks where the contests get even more challenging.   Shaft Sharp Shooter is a fairly average-looking game. The graphics are not award-winning, but they are clean and the sprites are decently detailed -- there is never any confusion between thug and hostage. The different mini-games has a solid amount of variety so it doesn't feel like you're looking at the same screen over and over. Shaft Sharp Shooter's action is accompanied by a looping soundtrack.  Games like this are tricky to judge. If you like shooting games and don't mind that this is just a basic light gun game without the light gun, Shaft Sharp Shooter isn't a bad purchase. But most gamers will likely dismiss the admittedly shallow game play -- moving a cursor around the screen -- in favor of the increasingly complex games arriving on handsets now.", "date": "Sep 9, 2004"}
