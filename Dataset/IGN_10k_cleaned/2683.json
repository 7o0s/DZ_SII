Recruited by a mysterious (re: English) wheelchair-bound ex-roadster on a mission to collect buckets of money for the both of you, you've been thrown into a world of fast talkers and even faster cars. An adventure all over the world waits, with your passport sitting in a dirty garage inside a newly painted yellow Barracuda.That's the premise behind Infogrames and Pitbull Syndicate's latest street driver, Test Drive. A follow-up to the popular PlayStation series that sold gazillions of copies all over the planet, the first PlayStation 2 game is looking pretty good. And while the title of greatest racer ever is still secure with bigger names like Gran Turismo 3 and World Rally Championship, this Test Drive could still be the best in the series so far.Featuressize=5>Constructed with the single gamer in mind, Test Drive has a respectable lineup of options and possibilities. An ~Underground~ story mode that follows the exploits of Dennis Black, Donald Clark, Lisa Lux, and other make believe characters, underground is the best way to go. Not only will the story mode allow you to see the most tracks, but it also adds a face to the usually lifeless racing genre.Of course, most standard features are in the game too. Quick Races, Single Races, and a Two-Player split-screen mode help round out the package, including a short but fun drag racing option for a pair of button-twitching buddies. Best of all, the game keeps track of all your statistics of play: track records, car specifications, and other little nuggets of info are yours at the push of a button.The only feature missing that we wish was in there, was a duel story mode. It would have been pretty cool to race as competing drivers under Mister Clark in the same household, and could have increased the competition factor that much more. While we're on the subject, a few more multiplayer options wouldn't have hurt much either.Gameplaysize=5>If you've played Test Drive or Ridge Racer before, then you'll be entirely familiar with this old school setup. Throwing the newer fad of accelerating and braking via the shoulder buttons out the window, the latest Test Drive goes classic with a standard face-button configuration.Using ~X~ for gas and ~Square~ to brake, the simplified manipulation scheme makes for easier to get into races and a more intuitive feel. Shifting is reserved for the shoulder pads, and camera angles (both forward and back) can be altered with the ~Circle~ and ~Triangle~ keys. A throwback to our favorite racers of yesteryear, it was a nice change of pace not to have to be overly ambidextrous to move my vehicle through the track.This is Test Drive however, so the synonymous ~floaty~ feeling when steering the cars is back. Happily, we're proud to report that your choice of cars legitimately affects how well the car drives. Hop in a Lotus Elise and it's light low-horsepower architecture feels like you're riding on a feather, get behind the wheel of a fat 1970 Chevy Chevelle SS 454 on the other hand, and the extra muscle and weight will quickly make a difference in your movement.It's too bad that crashing into objects doesn't hinder gameplay much. While going head-on with concrete barriers will certainly slow you down or even stop you, it won't affect the performance of the car you're in one bit (making obstacles a near useless track element). Where's the reward/risk factor of piling through traffic if it  doesn't have a consequence? Forgivable perhaps because of Test Drive's status as an arcade racer, we still found it strange that crashes would stop the A.I. completely and knock them out of the race, while leaving you completely unscathed. At the very least it could have been an option to turn on and off.Luckily, the tracks are imaginatively designed and based on real world locations. Spread throughout popular locations in London, Monte Carlo, San Francisco, and Tokyo, each stage has its own feel and hazards, and will keep you on your toes at incredibly high speeds. Populated with landmarks, stunt ramps, and all sorts of things to keep you busy, the available areas are well designed. Would it have hurt much to add a couple more cities though?Graphicssize=5>Visually, Pitbull's creation is a mixed bag. As the lighting effects and backgrounds are extremely well done with a realistic lens flare approach that has rarely been matched. In fact, we could go on record as saying that Test Drive has one of, if not the best solar stars in the history of video games (that means sun for those of you scratching your heads).Our favorite visual aspect would have to be the cities and how well they're captured. San Francisco especially looks just like the metropolis it's modeled after. However undetailed that it may be (general buildings and shapes instead of familiar signs and other interesting tidbits), you can still recognize popular landmarks and street routes. From the Golden Gate to the Embarcadero, Nob Hill to Geary and Fisherman's Wharf, it's all in there and done so very efficiently.    Once you're out of the city and into the countryside, the level of detail is stepped up yet another notch. Trees, grass, and dirt are recreated flawlessly and even the roads appear to look more realistic. Even the frame rate is worth mentioning, chugging rarely and steady at a brisk 60 even when racing two-player. Fine looking specimens to be sure, there are only two specific aspects that keep Test Drive from reaching the elite in graphical prowess.The first is the on again/off again draw distance. Not too bad in the city levels, the more wide-open stages are plagued with a ton of popup in the skyline. Not immediately noticeable at first, the frequent redrawing can take your eyes off the track and fixed on the strange polygon creatures forming on the horizon.Secondly, we have the aforementioned lack of damage to your automobile. A standard feature in nearly every new racer to come down the pipeline, smashing into a bus or tree at 130 MPH should have consequence to your paint job. A minor quibble maybe, but that extra mile could have been enough to really move Test Drive to the next level.Soundsize=5>The Audio is a real standout. Mostly due to the high-end technology created by Analog Devices, the SoundMAX SPX coded speech and music tracks are crisp, clear, and vibrant. But more importantly, react to the onscreen action and in-action in a reaslistic and fluid manner. And might we just say by the way, that Test Drive's soundtrack absolutely rocks. A collection of thumping drive tunes that we've listened to over the last couple of years; the radio-quality music has everyone from Moby to Ja Rule slapping the crap out of our ear drums. In fact, the soundtrack is so diverse and big-name that it reads like one of those ~best of~ collections you'd find on a late night infomercial. Here's the complete track listing:Moby - Oil 1Moby - BodyrockJa Rule - FuriousJunkie XL - Dance USASaliva - Click. Click. Boom.Bubba Sparxxx - UglyJunkie XL - SynasthesiaAurora Borealis - The Milky WayDMX - We Right HereJunkie XL - Future in Computer HellSaliva - Lackluster (Dance Mix)Ja Rule - Livin' it UpCrud - All Used UpCrud - This Is Not RealityYoung MC - Know HowAlice Deejay - Got to Get AwaySound effects are pretty spot-on themselves, with the atypical habit of actually sounding like the real cars you're driving. Instead of the common habit of reproducing a lawn mower noise between engine revs, the Barracuda motor appears to be taken right from the source. Honking horns, car crashes, and every other automobile noise you can think of has been handled quite well, and is plagued only by a low volume in comparison to the score (music overpowers the sound effects regardless of its level).Even the voice-overs are excellent, with the proper amount of American attitude and British snobbery that the director was trying to capture. Telling the story effectively throughout, Test Drive is yet another videogame that's slowly trying to erase the memory of the horrible vocals brought about in the Sega CD/3DO era. Thank the maker.An overall solid production and a merit to the developers who programmed it, Test Drive does a lot of things right. The weight differential between automobiles, the excellent visual presentation, and superbly planned track design to name a few. But with a little extra planning however, it could have ascended to the next level and been something great.A fun experience nonetheless, hardcore racing fans should do themselves a service and give Pitbull's latest another look. For the more casual racing fan however, a nice weekend in rental mode could suffice.", "date": "Jun 3, 2002"}
