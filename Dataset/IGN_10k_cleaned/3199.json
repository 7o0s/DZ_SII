Rascal is so crap that words can barely describe it. Think of a platformer, imagine the things that could go wrong, and multiply it a hundred times, and you've got Rascal. That's how bad.  The theory is sound: Make a 3D platformer, make it graphically pleasing, with a cute mascoty main character, and set it in a non-linear world like Mario 64. Sure, it's paint-by-the-numbers commercial thinking, but if Fox can do a decent job with Croc, Traveler's Tales should have at least tried to make Rascal good.  The final product is a nightmare. Start with camera angles and 3D. Tracking is so pathetically incompetent that more often than not you'll find Rascal in the center of the screen and not much else. Without independent camera control, learning the layout of a room is more a matter of chance than anything else.  Dealing with the camera is almost a puzzle in itself, like one of those frustrating chain puzzles where the solutions you discover almost work, but doesn't. It lags behind so long before shifting viewpoints that players will get disoriented. First, you'll be moving towards the camera, then suddenly you're moving at a right angle without even changing directions. In fact, if you don't move far enough in one direction, the camera will forget to change at all. There's just something wrong about fighting a boss and not being able to see him at all that just takes the fun out of a game.  If that wasn't bad, it's unbelievable that the programmers thought people would enjoy playing a plaformer with a character that controlled LIKE A CAR. This makes no sense--there is absolutely no reason characters need to do a three-point turn to back out of a corner. It may work in a Doom-style game, but in a platformer, you need instantaneous control of your character. You can't afford to waste time turning around or backing out of a corner if there are enemies on your tail. If you use digital control, Rascal moves like a five year old geriatric ward patient. Analog control is significantly better, but combine its quirks with the ugly camera control, and it's still unpleasantly painful to play.  Graphically, Psygnosis is still painting a pretty picture, but it's sloppier work than ever. Items have no depth cues or shadows, so actually jumping at them, much less touching them, is virtually impossible. The interface is nonexistent, with virtually no clues on how to open doors, or which items are usable in the house. Exploring each level is an adventure in finding out what you can move or get and what's nailed down.  Overall Rascal plays like the unholy progeny of Spot Goes to Hollywood, Swagman, and Jersey Devil.  Weak camera, ugly control, and half-assed game design just help to underline Psygnosis' perhaps deserved reputation as a graphics tart. Avoid this game at all costs.", "date": "Mar 26, 1998"}
