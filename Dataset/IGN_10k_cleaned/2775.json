Shoved away in the corner of TDK Mediactive's booth at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the ill-advertised budget game was incredibly overshadowed by TDK's press giant, Robotech. Briefly glanced at by myself and a few other editors while perusing the booth, most of us were quick to write it off as yet another cheap title ready for critical execution.   Surprisingly however, we were quite mistaken. As PRYZM has turned out to be an enjoyable little game which more than justifies it's initial $20 dollar price tag. Despite the fact that there's easily a kilometer-wide list of graphical glitches and a difficulty level that could discourage the youngsters it's aimed at, Digital Illusions' little project that could, passes the time away nicely.   STORY  Many centuries ago, the trolls, gnomes, elves, and nymphs each had their separate lands of paradise. Beautiful havens for the people of each race, the world was at harmony. But without warning a plague came, and it twisted the kingdoms of Luminantia into disgusting mutations of what they once were. Citizens who were affected transformed into hideous monsters, and the surviving population fled to Tu-lum, the land of the unicorns.   Eventually gossip began to spread, and the remaining groups began to believe that the unicorns themselves were responsible for the plague. After all, why was their country safe from the plague and the others were not? With dissention among the people building, the last unicorn seer Anreena saw a revelation within her visions. A winged unicorn with sunburst markings would cleanse the world of the plague and heal the remaining creatures that had been affected.   The news of the vision comforted the naysayers, and turned their confidence years later towards Pryzm; a winged unicorn with the markings beheld in the Anreena's dreams. Finally mature enough to fulfill her destiny as the Savior of Luminantia, Pryzm has joined forces with Karrock the arch-mage of the trolls and set out on her journey to cleanse the land.   Or so that's how it starts anyway. Playing out after each completed mission like a dark episode of The Care Bears or The Smurfs, this is a lighthearted fantasy running wild with its younger gamer origins. Initially announced as a game for the under-high school crowd, PRYZM moved into slightly more mature territory somewhere down the development cycle. But other than a few violent moments here and there the plot is still kid friendly, and did a pretty good job of keeping me interested.   GAMEPLAY  The Mark of Kri appears to have started a trend. As PRYZM follows rather closely the idea of using both analog sticks to aim and attack your foes with. But that is where the similarity ends, as your control is divided into halves with each side of the Dual Shock representing one of your two characters. And the end result is a good one.   Manipulating Pryzm with the left stick, your movement is handled via the unicorn. With jumping maneuvers, hover attacks, and holding-spells at her disposal, it's obvious that she's designed to be used strictly for defense. With little to no damage delivered through her attacks, and an effectiveness relegated mainly to stun techniques, you're forced into attacking almost exclusively with your troll.   Which makes sense, since he's much more effective in combat anyway. With his enchanted staff by his side, Karrock can pummel foes with the best of them. Using the complete directional advantages of the right analog stick, our short little friend can attack his enemies in a near-720 degree radius. Unfortunately his staff doesn't have a very long reach, which means that his primary role is that of a melee warrior. Used in conjunction with Pryzm's long-range stun magic, the uncomfortable alliance between the dynamic duo ultimately involves quite a bit of strategy.   And it's that technical fact that probably makes or breaks PRYZM's gaming experience. Piled on top of the already moderate learning curve, the requirement to do something other than run and destroy is an approach that the casual fan may not appreciate. In the 30-second mentality of today's adrenaline rushed gamers, plotting a course of action in a 'swords and sorcery' title could prove to be too much. But in reality, it's a factor that supremely argues the case for some deserved attention.   Level designs too, are pretty fantastic. With multi-tiered madness hiding the mini-bosses quite securely, gamers are forced to think their choice of paths rather carefully. Required to strip multiple sacred flowers of its poison in every one of the 16 levels, getting past 24 different types of enemies while withstanding projectile attacks from gigantic evil plants briskly transforms into a challenge worthy of the hardcore.   But that's what I enjoyed most about PRYZM: it's difficulty. Throwing caution to the wind, the developers decided to stray away from the recent ideal of making games easy for Joe Average Gamer. I want to be pushed to my limits when traversing new levels! And I demand that I be slapped around and be forced into multiple restarts by a super-tough opponent to justify the target of my purchase! What could make beating a game all the more sweet, than knowing that you earned it? Wise decision TDK!     GRAPHICS  If only Digital Illusions had spent a little more time in the art department. Presenting a sound interpretation of classic fantasy characters, TDK's finished product comes out looking a little too plain. Low-Res textures and the classic PS2 shimmer is predominately the visual theme with additionally bothersome pop-up, draw-in, and clipping problems. Due in part to a sometimes delayed camera, the mountains, rocks, and even our troll buddy Karrock are constantly reforming in jagged misshapen heaps. Not a pretty sight.   Strangely, there's a first-person mode that's been included in addition to the third-person action. Useless for anything other than gazing at your surrounding scenery, it's a feature that could of should have been nixed in favor of greater visual detail. What use does a first-person feature have in a game like this anyway, if your movements and attacks are restricted within it?   To its credit though, the character models still run rather smoothly, with very few cases of the dreaded chop demon. Especially of note, are the neat special effects that make up your duo's magical power; as particle effects, light sourcing, and vibrantly splendid colors help to produce a nifty light show worthy of the Fourth of July. Still, there's little excuse for the lack of graphical polish in a supposedly finished product.   SOUND  Musically, PRYZM is unnaturally well done, with an 80's quality soundtrack that has plenty of range and emotion to back up its oboes and harpsichords. Conveying a good bit of the mischievous flavor, each of the themed accompaniments is an effective companion to their respective levels.   Voice acting on the other hand, isn't quite as melodious. Overly cheesy and apparently sourced from a myriad of ancient Saturday morning cartoons, the two main characters sound like a Nelvana-produced married couple. It really wouldn't be so bad if they didn't repeat the same couple of lines over and over again, but with the frequency of their banter and the lack of variety, it can get bothersome very quickly. At least The Dark Unicorn bad guys sounds cool.Categorical breakdowns aside, PRYZM Chapter One: The Dark Unicorn is above all else, fun. A sloppy, not so pretty effort for sure, the innovative play control and old fashioned challenge dissolves that barrier away.Deserving at least of a couple of playthroughs before shrugging it off as yet another budget disaster, the journey through Luminantia can be, for the forgiving, a splendid side-quest to our otherwise busy gaming schedules.", "date": "Jun 27, 2002"}
