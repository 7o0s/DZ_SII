One of the greatest genres of the 16-bit era was the action RPG. The category combined the leveling-up style of traditional role-playing character progression with faster, real-time combat and, generally, was a ton of fun to play. Big hits on the SNES included Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore and Illusion of Gaia. On the Genesis, there was Beyond Oasis.   This game hit Sega's system back in 1994. If you're from a country other than the United States, you may remember it as The Story of Thor  but in this edition, it's the story of Prince Ali. Ali is restless royalty. Unhappy with just spending his days lazing about the palace, the young Prince entertains himself with his hobby of treasure hunting. And his latest find is major  an ancient Golden Armlet, an artifact left behind from a legendary war between wizards.   Recovering the armlet from its hidden resting place sets into motion a change of events that Ali finds himself unwittingly thrust into the middle of. It's up to him to restore the power to the golden gauntlet by finding and reawakening four sleeping, summonable spirits and, along the way, save the kingdom of Oasis from disaster.       Beyond Oasis' plot is set up wonderfully by a set of colorful opening cutscenes, and the vibrance continues into the gameplay. Ali runs, jumps and attacks with fluid animation, and it's immediately enjoyable to run around and fight as the Prince. The environments, too, are done well, though the fantasy setting is a bit of a mixed bag  lacking a true hook that sets Oasis distinctly apart from any other 16-bit realm of adventure.   Control isn't perfectly tight. Ali's flowing animations are numerous, yes, but triggering each takes a bit of getting used to. Simple strikes with his dagger, for example, all hinge on proper timing  lightly tapping the button will activate a quick, forward jab, while holding it for a second before releasing will unleash instead a more powerful arcing strike. Beyond Oasis does a lot with a little in this way  it was made to work on the Genesis' three-button controller, so using different timing cues allowed each of those three buttons to serve double duty.   The A Button (which will change places depending on whether you're wielding a Wiimote, Cube or Classic Controller here) is initially unusable. It's reserved for a technique you pick up partway into the adventure  spirit summoning. Once they're found and awakened, Ali can call forth each of the four elemental spirits by projecting a ball of light into a representation of their unique element. For example, the water spirit Dytto can only be summoned when there's a body of water around. A lake, a waterfall, something like that. Puzzles in the game take advantage of this unique mechanic  there may be a wall of fire blocking your path that you need Dytto to douse, but first you'll have to trigger a switch, to activate a geyser, to provide a source of natural water that Dytto can be summoned out of. Very stylish.  And it's that stylishness that makes Beyond Oasis a hit. It's not a timeless classic, and it could have used a bit more polish in several areas. But it is a solid representation of 16-bit era action RPGs. Does Beyond Oasis deserve to be mentioned alongside such classics as Secret of Mana? Assuredly so. And since a lot of Nintendo-only gamers would have missed this one back in the '90s, it also appeals as a hidden gem that those players can unearth for the first time here on the Virtual Console. Check it out, genre fans. You'll be surprised.", "date": "Mar 21, 2007"}
