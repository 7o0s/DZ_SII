The original Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2 absorbed quarters like the IGN offices devours spicy chicken wings.  While these games were fun beyond belief, the entire fighting genre was very underdeveloped.  The games had limited storylines, minimal interactions with the game environments, and no amazing depth to the games.   Now it's time to flash forward to 2002.  MK and SF are still around, despite lackluster attempts at developing a 3D masterpiece.  It is quite well documented that the king of fighters this day in age is Soul Calibur.  With the anticipated sequel months away, there is a gap of space where fighting games can make their appearance, hoping to grab the attention of the console world.   Here enters Barbarian.  It combines the special moves found in Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat with the storyline found in Soul Calibur and environmental interactions commonly found in Power Stone.  While it is a solid attempt at fighting greatness, too many gameplay flaws hold it back from breaking through into the massively popular fighting kingdom.   Gameplay   You have to give Saffire props for trying.  They must have had Soul Calibur on their mind when they were making this game.  It's set in a medieval times, where freaking creatures, sexy women in armor, and big barbarians with gigantic clubs rule the land.  Each of the playable characters has their own story, as they are set on a quest to free the land from the dictatorship of Zaugg.  The battles are set up with a large amount of text (for a fighting game) describing the situation in which the two (or sometimes more) characters are set to engage in a brutal fight for.   The fights seem more like a turn-based RPG than a fighting game.  After one player gets to hack and smack a combo of either skill or button mashing, the other player (if it isn't not on the ground) gets a huge advantage for the next attack.  This is due to the lack of flow present in each fight.  After being spoiled by Soul Calibur, it's hard to pick up this game and try and flow freely through a bout.   However, the game does include some cool special attacks.  Similar to Ryu's fireball, the characters in this game have a special attack where they can hurl a ball of magic at their opponent.  It can be very difficult to hit your opponent since you have to judge where the other character from a fixed camera angle, but the magic is very useful and a taste of old school fighters as well.   Your character can also pick up objects and toss them to smack the enemy to the floor.  There are three levels of objects to pick up: heavy, medium, and light.  You can only pick up certain levels of weight depending on which character you choose, until you can add on to the players attributes.   That's right folks, this game has RPG like elements in the sense that you can actually upgrade your character to better fit your competition.  You can add life, strength to your combos, power to magic, speed, and all sorts of other skills.  This definitely gives the game depth that is desperately needed in fighting games.   The wizard halts his opponents for he needs to take a bathroom break.   Graphics   While not impressive, the graphics of Barbarian do not disappoint.    The character models are a bit rough, with a little bit of jag from polygons found on them.  The model's details are above average since their outfits and bodies reflect what one would expect from someone in a medieval environment.  The muscles are bulging and the clothes flow with the body, which is quite nice to see.  However, the overall presentation of the character models is merely average at best.   The maps are nicely detailed, as well.  While barrels and other objects are all generic, the maps do contain a great deal of rumble, stones, cracks, and other small, seemingly unnoticed aspects of a gloomy room.   Similarly found in Dead or Alive, you can also fight on different levels of the maps.  For instance, jumping from a large tower to the ground will present new scenery with new objects to use for your own defense.  This makes the maps feel quite large, and it adds more personality to the player's quest.   Despite this great amount of detail of the maps, the actual background is quite horrendous.  It reminds me of a set on a sitcom or B-grade movie.  There is generally a dull, flat color that paints the sky, which is very ugly.  So while they spent a good deal of time with the overall appearance of the map, they did miss the background and it sticks out like Michael Jackson at the Million-Man March.   Sound   To start off, the narrator is good for the part; he has a deep, dark voice that molds with the games feel.  He speaks before each level, describing the crisis at your hands in which you need to correct.  This makes the game easy for either the reading-impaired or extremely lazy people.  While he does sound a little bit too much over the top (surpassing James Earl Jones at times), it is better than the alternative (Richard Simmons).   The game's music is typical dark ages music.  Many string instruments and horns are used, while chants in a dark harmony are bellowed.  It does get a bit annoying after listening to it for 15 minutes, which should ultimately make the mute button on your remote a useful tool.   Also scattered throughout the game are background noises.  However, these noises are not impressive and, as the music does, they get annoying after an extended session.  For instance, the wind can be heard rustling through the air as you stand hundreds of feet from the ground.  The sound clip is short and it is one that repeats itself frequently.  It does get a little too loud at times, as well.  In fact, the wind gets loud enough that it sounds as if the character should be swept from their feet and land flat on their ass.  Once again, that mute button looks mighty helpful.   The sounds of clashing swords, splitting armor, and the use of magic are more suited for a previous game console rather than a next-generation system.  The clips are low-pitch, low treble sound effects that make the game sound distant and artificial.  There are a ton of possible improvements that should be fixed in this aspect of the game.   Overall, the sound is a collection of bland, muffled noises and scores that make Green Jello sound like musical gods.In all honesty, this game didn't cut it out for me.  There was nothing exciting in Barbarian or nothing that grabbed my attention for an extend period of time.  While the game does feature some decent visuals, the overall gameplay is lacking the jazz that comes standard with top-notch games, like Soul Calibur.  The multiplayer game is not that fun since it is too slow and doesn't have the flair and flow that one expects from a fighting game.  This game, however, can be a fun single-player game with an intricate story and RPG elements.  While the PS2 guys gave this game a higher score than I did, I just can't live with giving this game close to an 8.0.  I just doesn't deserve that high of a score.", "date": "Jul 31, 2002"}
