Repeat. But rather than just fart out an updated Pong for mobile, JAMDAT really knuckled down and created something special -- an air hockey sim with smart mechanics that manage to really replicate the experience of standing across the table from a bitter rival at the local arcade.   This is accomplished by the movement of the mallets, which you don't directly control. Somebody very, very clever programmed a series of algorithms that move the mallets around the table very naturally, in broad strokes that anticipate the movement of the puck. Using only your thumb, you attack the puck by pressing OK, making the mallet zoom in and strike. The trick to success is to watch the mallet's sweeping movement and time your attacks to create killer bank shots -- and then let geometry do the rest. Taking complete control of the mallet out of your hands sounds bad on paper, I understand, but once you see it in motion, you can really appreciate how it elevates the game.   EA Air Hockey offers a few different play modes, such as a quick game and a challenge mode that throws a series of objectives at you. JAMDAT included a two-player mode where players share the same handset, but this didn't really float the collective boat of a friend and I. Perhaps the mobile screen and control inputs are just two small for a pair of bananahands.  EA Air Hockey was something of a surprise. I saw this game a long time ago when the project was in its infancy, and back then, I thought it was just OK. However, in the many months since then, somebody over at JAMDAT has been lovingly tinkering with it. The result is a fresh game. The way the game handles the control of the mallet for you is incredibly smart. If you are looking for a casual game that doesnt somehow involve blocks or letters, this is your next download.", "date": "Apr 4, 2006"}
