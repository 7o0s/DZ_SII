Out of nowhere, titles like Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter starting flying off the shelves showing the kind of sales numbers that PC developers only dreamed about a few years before. Unfortunately, for the most part, these first generation titles were all pretty bad. Most of them not only had really terrible graphics and movement, but they were also very one dimensional, appealing to a broad consumer base with their novelty rather than their entertainment value. Now it looks like all of that is changing. The gang at Wizardworks has just put together Deer Hunter 3, a great looking game with multiplayer options and a host of real hunting techniques represented, EA Sports is dropping into the game with their Deer Hunting Challenge, a mission based variant of deer hunting designed to pacify the impatient, and for those who don't mind a little break in realism, Carnivores 2 will soon be available, offering up a museum's helping of dinosaurs for those seeking the ultimate hunting experience.   While all of these are worthy, if redundant additions to the increasingly glutted hunting game line-up, one of the most impressive titles we've seen so far, in terms of raw entertainment value is Gonzo's new Ted Nugent Wild Hunting Adventure. This quirky new title manages to take the genre somewhere it hasn't been before by blending action elements and a reverent approach to the rules, regulations and history of hunting with a solid engine that delivers the spirit of the hunt without delivering the mind-numbing dullness of sitting in a tree for six hours. Better yet, the title offers up a simple but effective economic engine to ensure players feel like they have a reason to keep trying to down new targets.   Here's how it all works. You start the game with a single deer tag, a .44 Magnum revolver, $100 in cash and an opportunity to hunt on the first of the game's five different locations, Sunrize Acres. Since you won't really be able to afford anything but a couple of calls, a scent or two and maybe a few extra bullets, you'll need to head out to hunt in order to earn yourself a little more cash. When you finally locate a deer and kill it, you'll be paid a certain dollar value for the animal based on how much meat it has on it (how big it was). With this cash, you'll be able to buy more license tags (you need one for each one animal you kill or you'll be fined for poaching), which will in turn allow you to bag more animals. Eventually you'll have enough cash to purchase new weapons, ammo and equipment in addition to tags for more exotic animals (which are also worth more money).  In addition to your dollar total, which fluctuates with each purchase you make, you'll also be awarded a point score for each animal you successfully track and kill. Once your point total reaches a certain amount, you'll be awarded a new rank title (you start at Tenderfoot and can work your way up to Whackmaster) and access to new hunting lands. While there's no doubt that this whole point and money system is probably not the most realistic in the world, it's a great game device that'll have you going back to the game again and again just to earn enough for that next big gun or access to that cool new area.  The hunting itself is fairly simple. You wander through the woods with your weapon of choice with your numeric pad and use your mouse to lift your gun at fire at any nearby targets. If your shot hits a vital area on the animal, it'll drop and you can approach it to clean the kill and claim your prize. If it hits a non-vital area, Ted will give you a verbal lashing and you'll have to go track down the animal and finish it off. One thing that is really noteworthy in the game's setup is its realistic attitudes towards safety and hunting regulations. If you run with your gun drawn, you'll lose points, earn another tongue-lashing, and you might end up shooting yourself. If you kill an animal that you don't have a tag for, you'll be fined for poaching. If you fire your weapon at a bridge or hunting blind, you'll be fined for shooting property. This is a really nice change from titles like Deer Hunter 3 where you can actually run after an animal while looking through a scope. Ted Nugent Wild Adventure Hunting doesn't keep you from doing it, but it let's you know what the repercussions of such a reckless act will be. Fortunately, the game is not married to realism in areas where it might hurt gameplay. While you won't be surrounded by animals all the time, there are always plenty to hunt on any given map, so if you've got the proper tags, you won't ever find yourself bored.  The first four areas are all pretty nice and each offers up a pretty distinctive set of hunting challenges. Sunrize Acres is farmland next to some woods and has loads of deer, wild boar and bison to hunt. Kalamazoo River is a winter area with lots of trees and rolling hills and is full of bison, deer, wild boars, and rams. I've even spotted wolves in this level once or twice. The third level, Whackmaster Falls, has a little bit of everything spread out along several riverbanks. While I found this to be the most visually appealing level, it always seemed that game was a little hard to come by. Bear Canyon is the last of the standard hunting levels and as it's packed with grizzlies, wolves and rams (oh my!), it's also the most dangerous. When you're ready, you'll have access to the fifth level, Gonzo Gutpile. This final hunting challenge is closer to Tomb Raider than it is to hunting, and you'll have to jump crevasses, avoid pits and kill loads of predators to make it to your prize.  While each animal has its own specific AI, each of the animals in the game (whitetail, rams, wild boar, bison, wolves and grizzlies) tends to react in one of two ways. Deer, rams and bison will all bolt when they hear the crack of a gun, forcing you to run them down. Boars, wolves and grizzlies on the other hand will immediately head at you looking to end your life. The best thing to do in these situations is either stand your ground and make damn sure you kill the charging animal before it gets to you, or to head for the nearest tree stand and wait until the enraged animal leaves. If an animal hits you, you will lose some of your 100 health points which can only be replenished by stopping the hunt and returning to the lodge or by snacking on some of Ted's Super Biltong jerky (which can be purchased in the general store). Overall though, I found the animal AIs to be a mixed bag. Animal response to you when they catch your scent or see you is pretty good, but once you injure a prey animal, they often do some pretty stupid things (like running around in circles). I also saw quite a lot of animals run straight into a tree, continuing to try and flee even though they couldn't move. These are the easy kills.  Hunting games have never been known for their fine graphics (although I must say the Deer Hunter 3 looks pretty good), and Ted Nugent Wild Hunting Adventure is no exception to the rule. While the animals are nicely modeled, the rest of the objects in the game are passable at best. This is not a title you'll be using to show off the graphic capabilities of your system. Still, the addition of some extremely funny video clips of Ted offering up hunting and cooking advice adds a little bit to the overall visual impact of the game. Sound is excellent in the game, boasting several new guitar tracks by Ted Nugent created just for the game, loads of Nugent filled voice clips, and great gun and animal sound effects.  This is not a game that's going to change your life, but I found it to be a lot more fun than anything I've seen yet from the genre. The game's modest price tag (it only costs $20), good attitude and novel play dynamics will make it a favorite with anyone who enjoys hunting titles.
