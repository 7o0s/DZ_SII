But many mobile games based on the event remain in their wake, still available for download. Does Reaxion's Pax Athletica, based on seven classic Olympic moments (even though there isn't a single direct mention of the international competition in the entire game) manage to remain entertaining now that the hype has subsided?   Features:   Seven events  High score tracking   Pax Athletica certainly has the right kind of hook to elevate itself above the competition. The Olympics have hosted some of the most truly remarkably moments not just in sports history, but history itself. Jesse Owens' amazing dash past Der Fuhrer at the 1936 games in Berlin. The massacre of Isreali athletes at the 1976 games in Munich. And the famous jet pack flight in Los Angeles in 1980 that was supposed to usher in a new era of transportation. (Who else is waiting for their flying car?)   Pax Athletica attempts to celebrate, or at least invoke these classic moments with its small, seven event game. The problem is, it's hard to drape these events with their storied importance with the little amount of fanfare a cellphone allows. For example, Owens is never mentioned by name. There is no reference to Hitler. In fact, the lead-in text just states, ~In 1936, the will to win rose above propaganda.~ Is Reaxion just trying to be vague enough to lead gamers to a history book?   The seven events must initially be played in order before an exhibition mode allowing you to go for the world record in individual events is unlocked. The events include fencing, diving, gymnastics, pole vault, running, hammer throw, and jet pack. Not that jet pack is an actual Olympic event, making its inclusion interesting but odd. Even odder is that the one event not based on an actual sport turns out to be the most entertainment mini-game.   Pax Athletica is an overly simple game -- almost to the point of frustration. Pressing a single button as a meter crosses a specific mark controls most of the events. This has been the staple of track and field games for years, and that's not what we complain about. It's that the meters are strangely unreliable. Due to odd programming or whatever, the meters do not ebb and flow smoothly. Hitting the action button at the right moment is not easy, as you almost have to guess when the meter with ~chunk~ into the right position.   For example, when you play the gymnastics event, you but nail the mark twice before the event: Once for technique, the other for landing. Now, not only does the game refuse to tell you at which points you are supposed hit the marks (they're opposite of each other), but if you blow either of the marks, you're forced to watch the entire event before being allowed to try again. This is incredibly tedious, because in an event like gymnastics, where you must nail 9.0 landings, you know instantly if you're going to miss it.   Pax Athletica is actually a fairly decent-looking game. We downloaded it on the LG VX6000 and were impressed with the overall brightness and good use of color. The athletes themselves have a solid amount of detail and their animation, while not entirely fluid, is still well done. We also really liked the game's music. It's not exactly plentiful, but the jingle that plays when the event's ~cultural statement~ flashes on screen is pretty compelling. Too bad the actual game play that follows is most certainly not.Pax Athletica is a tragic disappointment because it's presentation hook is one of the best I've ever seen in a mobile sports game. Younger players may not appreciate the cultural milestones that many of these events represent, but if you're up on your sports history, you'll like the idea of running Owens past Hitler's box. It's just too bad that the game play undermines the game's hook at every turn. Meters are unfairly frustrating to nail and when you flub, you have to sit there watch the painful fall, splash, or landing before getting another chance. On a console, that may not be a big deal, but when I'm eating battery life by watching my gymnast land a perfect 4.0, I'm not exactly amused.Pax Athletica deserves a sequel. And it deserves one before the Beijing Olympics because it is such a good idea. While I just cannot recommend downloading this game, I would be more than open to revisiting it if some changes were made.", "date": "Oct 21, 2004"}
