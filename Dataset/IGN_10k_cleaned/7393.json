Console gaming was once dominated by mascots -- colorful characters synonymous with their corporate handlers -- before the keys to the kingdom were handed over to the likes of Master Chief and CJ. Several mobile makers have tried to craft personalities in the mold of mascots, such as Digital Chocolate's Johnny Crash, star of their excellent stunt-o-rama series. But Gameloft's Furrito, an adorable squirrel creation, is the closest mobile has seen to an original mascot. His is a face that deserves to be seen in more titles; he's cute, expressive, and versatile. Not unlike, say, Sonic or Crash.   Tropical Madness is an action-platformer not entirely unlike Sonic 3D Blast for the Saturn and Genesis, but there are definite touches of SEGA's Super Monkey Ball in this day-glo romp. The round-ish Furrito rolls through a series of mazes, brightly adorned with palm trees, fire-breathing snake idols, and green loop-de-loops. Furrito's goal? Bop enemies with his homing attack (pressing ~5~ makes Furrito hop into the air and crash down on a nearby monster) and collect colored stars for bonus points. After bouncing across enough barrels and smashing enough nasty animals, Furrito throws loose the gates to a prison full of his friends, only to move on to the next stage to do it all over again -- with tougher jumps and meaner enemies, of course.   Furrito spends most the game tucked into a little ball, but when grinding across ziplines or freeing his friends, you get a peek-see at the squirrel adorable mug. This little fella has a face that melts an old-school gamer's heart. As mentioned, he deserves an encore or two. Maybe in a traditional 2-D side-scroller as well as the already-needed Tropical Madness sequel.   Rolling Furrito around his isometric universe of sliding platforms, loops, or other environmental hazards requires a bit of hardcore finesse. Tropical Madness is not a casual game -- this is twitch action. Coaxing Furrito onto the corner fragment of a splitting platform takes practice, especially if you are working with a new handset. (The game was tested on a Sony Ericsson w810i.) But with a little practice, you'll be bouncing from itty-bitty ledge to crab and back with an acceptable level of assurance. Easier to work your way through are speed sequences, where Furrito is whisked through bright locations with minimal steering required.   This is not an easy game, but the rewards of sticking with it are great, as you're treated not only to more time with Furrito, but also some pretty sweet level design from the good ship Gameloft. No corner of the Tropical Madness universe looks stagnant, thanks to detailed, animated backdrops, plentiful enemies, and no shortage of twinkling stars.  Tropical Madness really appealed to the kid in me that saved for months to buy a SEGA Genesis -- this is classic gaming mechanics, sweetened with a touch of new school via the Super Monkey Ball elements. The game has sufficient challenges to remain on your handset for some time following the initial download, especially one run in a lava level that had me muttering horrible things to the handset. Loops, barrel bounces, speed runs -- if you loved 16-bit gaming, you'll love Tropical Madness.Oh, and hello, Furrito. Make yourself welcome. I hope you'll stay a while.", "date": "Oct 18, 2006"}
