People need variety in their gaming and developers have responded to their request with games that provide everything from racing elements to moments of hardcore action, both of which are seamlessly integrated with an engrossing love story. Trying to hit on as many cylinders as possible to maximize a game's audience is common place, but things too often go awry with developers losing their focus along the way.    We can't help but feel as though GripShift, the latest title to come out of Sidhe Interactive, loses its way somewhere along the path to gaming greatness. It's a title that features elements of puzzle solving, multiple paths to completing a stage, and then a Mario Kart clone replete with weaponry and four-player racing. But because it dabbles in so many different genres and gameplay dynamics, GripShift loses a bit of its luster after you've been blasting around the game's handful of environment types for a few hours.    The meat of GripShift is its 120 challenge levels. These force gamers to do things like collecting a certain number of stars that are situated on the track, making your way to one inconveniently placed GripShift logo per level, and plotting the fastest route from the beginning of the level to the end. When all is said and done each map has three essential tasks that need to be passed to fully complete the stage.   The real trick to these puzzles comes when you grasp the techniques required to traverse the winding, creatively designed landscape. You'll find things like magnets placed on the side of the track, full loops, ramps, floating islands, and a number of other impediments. Luckily the game's engine allows for an insane amount of mid-air control so you can handbrake, spin around, accelerate, and even boost while aloft. Much of the initial fun of GripShift is discovering the techniques required to get to some of the tougher items, but once that wears off you'll likely realize (as the developers clearly did by offering an entirely separate and unique game mode) that you're solving the same puzzles over and over.   The next problem that struck us while trekking through the puzzle-centric stages is that there's really no sense of continuity or reward as you progress. Sure, you'll unlock skins, wheels and music tracks, but who really cares about that? You can beat the game just as easily with the three starting vehicles and the standard music as you could with any of the unlockables. If only we could have unlocked new abilities for our little roadster, then maybe the game would sport a bit more longevity and fun. As it stands the puzzle levels are decent for a time, but I can't imagine many that will want to blast through all 120 tracks.   Mid-air control rocks!  The racing elements in the game are a bit more fun but still lack the overall focus to be a quality standalone experience. Much like Mario Kart, GripShift features small, boost-powered cars shooting across different levels, strapped to the gills with things like homing missiles, oil skids, and of course the obligatory shields. One notable change when switching from the puzzle mode to the racing battles is that as you up the difficulty you'll notice that more weapons are unlocked. Moving from easy to intermediate unlocks the green goo and fire shield and the trend continues as you progress. But even with the added armaments you can't help but feel like you're just racing the same three dolts over and over again. Then you realize that you are.   Multiplayer action on Xbox Live does extend the game's life a bit and is a welcome change of pace from the AI competition. You get deathmatch (our personal favorite), single race, and championship to toy around with and they perform just as you'd hope. There are unique maps to fit the given mode, so you don't have to worry about racing around a circular track when all you want to do is explode your buddy's muffler. Contrary to what some might be thinking, GripShift isnt a bad game by any means. It has more gameplay than most XBLA titles and certainly will last you a good while if you want to trudge through all 120 challenge levels as well as the 25 race maps (several of each type are exclusive to the Xbox 360 release) but its made extremely clear early on that it really doesnt have a point or a focus. Some will be able to take it for what it is, but I need some sort of glue to hold my games together, some sort of over-arching point as to why Im playing them, sadly GripShift doesnt have any of that. Again, its not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, and some will likely garner hours of enjoyment from it, but it needs more focus to truly excel in the crowded arena of XBLA releases.", "date": "Dec 12, 2007"}
