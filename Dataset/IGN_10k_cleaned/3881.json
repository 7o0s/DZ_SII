Grandma brought one home from a garage sale with greasy fingerprints all over it. And although you scoffed at the idea of such a rudimentary plaything (after all, you had a Genesis with Mortal Kombat), you gave it a shot. And two hours later, you had forgotten all about the over-pixellated Goro. You were all about the labyrinth game.  And now you're going to be all about the RotoSphere.  Features: Ten levels Full-screen, 360-degree rotation  Link-U Mobile's RotoSphere is what SEGA Monkey Ball shoulda been. Sure, both are flat, 2-D games, but at least RotoSphere gives you control over the maze, not just the little ball.  The goal is simply to get the ball from A to B, as quickly as possible, and without striking any of the level hazards, such as the dangerous-looking skull balls or the trio of ghosties that wander the maze.  Using your control pad (or, on the Samsung N400 we used, the mini-joystick), you rotate the maze. The effects are slick and seamless, and the first time to see it running on your celly is like the first time you saw Mode 7 on your SNES. Try to keep some idea of gravity in your head, despite the game plays fast and loose with the concept of inertia. It may be a little floaty, but at least it's consistently floaty, and eventually, you permanently adjust.  There are ten levels in RotoSphere. Now, that doesn't sound like a lot -- but with the difficultly increasingly ramped up, you'll get quite a bit of mileage out of the game. Plus, this is truly one of those games where once you finish it, you're compelled to start all over and see if you can finish it faster. The mazes are smart and cleverly crafted, with each one presenting different challenges. They get bigger, too, but there are green arrow balls that point little lost players in the right direction.  The mazes themselves?  Really, not all that much to look at, but the sacrifice was probably necessary to get that rotating effect in there. Which then leaves you wondering how they were able to stuff in all the audio into the reasonably-sized download. There are several jingles, such as when you fire up the game or pause.  Each one is different, it's not just the same old loop over and over again. And better still, they're not unpleasant to the ear. RotoSphere is quite an achievement for such a small game. With game houses able to start fusing Mode 7 effects into their products, it opens up quite a few new gaming possibilities. Link-U Mobile has crafted a very impressive tech demo that happens to be a very impressive little game. Highly recommended, as it will have you hooked from the get-go.", "date": "Sep 4, 2003"}
