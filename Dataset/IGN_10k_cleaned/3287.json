These games are attempting to make a legitimate competition out of a fixed sport.  It's a sport which derives almost all of its entertainment value from the fact that the outcome is predetermined and the performers are cooperating in order to put on a show.  Now, in some cases, this is not so much of a problem.  Games like SmackDown! and Fire Pro compensate by letting the players put on the show themselves, providing a massive selection of options for moves, match types, and so on.  They lack the extra excitement added by the angle -- what goes on outside of the ring to set up a match -- but they can usually live without that.  The key problem with Legends of Wrestling II is that it's patterned after an era and a style of wrestling where that extra drama was far more important to the excitement of a match.  Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant together couldn't wrestle their way out of a paper bag, but few fans will deny how exciting WrestleMania III was.  Magnum TA and Tully Blanchard spent most of their classic ~I Quit~ match simply pounding on each other, but the violence and hatred of that confrontation remains practically unmatched in history.  No matter how hard its creators may try, a videogame can't re-create that kind of drama, in or out of the ring.  Acclaim has made a pretty good go of it with this game, despite its fundamental limitations, but it can't quite be called a success.  The limitations of the 3D engine and clumsy control inputs compound basic weaknesses in its presentation -- the one hampers the ~wrestling~ aspect, while the other tarnishes the ~legends.~  Some players may find its odd visual style or its unusual grappling system to their particular taste, but they probably won't find themselves in the majority.  Gameplay Legends of Wrestling II builds on the rather questionable old Warzone grappling system by slowing down the pace a trifle and adding the ~IPS~ system, which is another one of those silly trademarks that Acclaim seems so fond of.  In practice, it's a meter that appears when it's possible for the player to reverse an opponent's move or extend one of their own with a combination.  An indicator moves along that meter -- stop it while it crosses a highlighted section and some favorable outcome will result.  The IPS system lends the game a deceptively deep moveset.  There are two separate grapple attacks -- immediate moves performed with the triangle button and lock-up moves using the circle button -- and many of those moves can be extended into more complex moves with an IPS combo.  In addition, certain grapples set up positions from which moves can branch out.  For example, you can lock up with the circle button, transition to a piledriver setup from there with one command, and branch from there into a powerbomb, piledriver, or another move that starts from the same setup position (a Pedigree, a double-underhook suplex, a Tiger Driver, and so on).  Success, then, is a matter of mastering the IPS timing and remembering how to transition into different setup positions.  It's not as easy for a beginner to pull off a wide variety of moves as it is in something like SmackDown!, where all the grapples are performed with one button, but practice and memorization offers a great many more moves at the player's immediate disposal.  Dizziness is also a factor, modifying the types of moves available, and its occurrence seems to be a good deal more consistent than it has been in past SmackDown! games.  The IPS system frequently seems just a little too simple, though, especially between players who have the timing down.  Reversing moves is very easy, particularly in the early stages of a match when the wrestlers are relatively fresh, which can lead to a boring stalemate in multiplayer games. Meanwhile, the computer AI often has ridiculously accurate timing, reversing nearly every move in some matches.  For reversals, at least, I'd rather see a system with less obvious cues or more complex inputs (that would be the Aki reversal system or the present Yuke's system, respectively).  I like the way the IPS system can be used to extend and combine moves, but the reversal aspect could use some tuning.  Striking maneuvers, meanwhile, are plagued by odd collision and input detection.  Whether or not a strike hits seems to be dependent on what you had for breakfast as much as positioning and timing.  The game also insists on waiting for an animation to play before it will register another input, so it's not possible to chain moves together in advance.  Having to wait for animations of varying length to play out tends to throw off the timing of a planned sequence of moves -- in comparison, SmackDown! does a nice job of queuing  up rapid button inputs and executing them in order.      The pace of simple movement, at least, has been substantially increased in comparison to the first Legends of Wrestling, which was much too slow.  The sequel is actually almost too fast in the case of some wrestlers -- I don't ever recall Andre the Giant moving this quickly, even in his prime.  For the most part, though, the wrestlers' speed is appropriate to their style, with smaller guys like Ricky Morton moving quicker than others and Mil Mascaras almost a blur in comparison.  Legends of Wrestling II offers most of the basic match types appropriate to its milieu, as well as some extras just for fun.  I don't recall many three- and four-way dances in the '70s and '80s, but they're here if you want them.  Framerate problems can hamper fights with more than a few men in the ring, though.  Three or four wrestlers in a free-for-all confrontation can cause some pretty nasty intermittent slowdown.  Meanwhile, in tag matches, the distant and static camera is often an impediment to the action.  At one point, a combination of the long camera shot and having the ropes in the way lost me a match -- I thought I was rolling the other guy up, when in fact it was the other way around.  Cage matches are done well, though, providing you don't have a philosophical objection to the WWF escape rules.  There's even an energy meter to represent the state of the cage door, so you can break through without the aid of your devious manager on the outside.  Career mode, as in the first Legends of Wrestling, is based on the old territory system in pro wrestling.  You have to work your way up through different territories, divided up as they were in the '70s and '80s -- the Northeast (WWWF), the Midwest (AWA), the Southeast (Mid-Atlantic/Florida), and so on.  Also as before, success is dependent not so much on winning or losing as your ability to work up the crowd with a varied, exciting match. Like the Audience Match mode in Fire Pro Wrestling, it encourages the player to use more than just a few reliable techniques.  Along with a few more cinematics and bits of voice acting to show off the cartoonish promoter designs (which I can take or leave, personally, but they're not much of a factor in the larger picture), the key addition in part two's career is simple storylines that guide progress through a particular territory.  For example, the promoter might want you to knock off a top star who's getting too powerful, or wrestle a particular style of match.  They're nothing very complex, and the career mode doesn't throw in wrinkles at anywhere near the pace of SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, but it's still nice to have a little more rhyme and reason to the progression of matches.  Create-a-wrestler is missing the more esoteric model-manipulation features available in other games, and it's a little shorter on moves and parts than some, but it's still a substantial improvement on the first game. Particularly impressive is the amount of options available for names and nicknames -- the voice library is pretty damn huge.  The parts library is generally dominated by the game's cartoonish style of visual design, but if you have a philosophical objection to that aspect, you probably shouldn't have bought Legends of Wrestling in the first place.  Legends of Wrestling II has most of its bases covered.  It has a decent grappling system, improved from its first iteration, an also-improved creation mode, and a decent selection of ancillary modes to go along with basic in-ring confrontations.  However, it also has some significant flaws that bring down gameplay.  The aforementioned framerate drops are pronounced in the PS2 version, which ranges from nagging to crippling depending on when they decide to hit.  Load times are also an aggravating issue -- the game actually inserts a lengthy load in between wrestler entrances and the match itself, and career mode has plenty of loads breaking up the action as well. I could have easily done without the automatic character model preview in the wrestler select screen, given how the load-time blips hamper progress from option to option.  There are also less tangible problems, at least from my personal perspective.  This may be a decent wrestling game, but it doesn't do a great deal as far as presenting a different flavor of atmosphere and action in comparison to games based on contemporary styles and promotions.  It's full of wrestling moves and styles that were utterly unheard-of during the time it's meant to represent, and many of the licensed wrestlers have downright irrational movesets, even other wrestlers' obvious signature moves.  Andre the Giant, for whatever reason, does the Junkyard Dog's trademark headbutts. Ricky Morton does the Stone Cold Stunner, complete with middle fingers and kick to the gut (unless I'm counting fingers wrong, in which case it's the old Texas Longhorn symbol, which makes even less sense).  Billy Graham has the Rock Bottom.  There also doesn't seem to have been any attempt to implement relative weighting between wrestlers, so Mil Mascaras has no problem whatsoever slamming Andre the Giant.  As outlined in the introduction, the things that made old-school wrestling exciting can't be replicated in a game.  Something like the WWF TLC matches can be done in a game, because it's purely an acrobatic exhibition -- implement the right foreign object physics, environment interaction, and aerial moves, and there you have it.  Magnum TA vs. Tully Blanchard, on the other hand (and speaking of which, why aren't they in this game?), is made exciting by something that could only happen in reality.  Call me a mystical crank if you will, but while games are fun, there's often no substitute for the real thing.  Graphics When I played the first Legends of Wrestling, there was an eerie quality to its style of design that I couldn't put my finger on for a while. Finally, it hit me -- they look just like the old LJN WWF action figures, from way back in the '80s.  And as before, the sequel is populated by larger-than-life cartoon representations of the stars of the past, with smooth surfaces, bulging muscles, huge hands, oddly-proportioned joints, stiff facial features, hair that wouldn't budge in a wind tunnel, and other qualities that give them an unsettling resemblance to the plastic of yesteryear.  This you can take as you will, honestly.  I'm not fond of it, but that's my personal reaction to the style, not an objective judgment of its quality. Acclaim has done a pretty good job of making its characters look like action figures, especially with the aid of the dynamic lighting displayed in the entrance sequences, and they move a fair bit better than the action figures from the original game thanks to a faster pace and expanded animation libraries.  Their transition animations are still pretty lacking, but the sharper resolution of the characters helps make up for that somewhat.  So if you want a wrestling game with action figures, this one will certainly serve you well (although not, perhaps, as impressively as the action-figure-dominated Kinnikuman).  Outside the action figures, however, the level of quality inarguably drops off.  Legends of Wrestling II has big, flashy arenas, but they lose some of their luster after a close look at the details.  The crowd looks terrible, built as it is of sparsely-scattered 2D sprites, and the camera often does it no favors.  Some angles make it very clear that the sprites are the same on either side -- thus, it looks as if they're staring away from the ring.  In other cases, when the action moves out of the ring, the camera can actually get stuck behind parts of the crowd for a brief time.  Curiously alone among wrestling games on the market these days, Legends of Wrestling also includes blood particles and a realistic damage system for character faces, but that seems to be one of the factors that can hurt the game's framerate.  Though it works well enough in a one-on-one match, it's a contributing factor to slowdown in more hectic matches.    Presentation The roster in Legends of Wrestling II includes nearly every wrestler from the first game, as well as additions to bring the total over 60.  It's obviously been chosen by someone who knows what they're doing -- this isn't just the Legends of the Mid-'80s WWF.  Hulk Hogan's the cover star, sure, but there are also some less mainstream favorites.  Cheers for including guys like Harley Race, Bruno Sammartino, and Superstar Billy Graham, from whom Hulk Hogan nicked his entire act.  Nearly all the wrestlers included have multiple costumes, too, generally from two up to four.  The contrast between the different variations of Scott Steiner is great fun.  Some presentation elements that have become de rigeur in wrestling these days are pretty lacking, however.  The entrance animations aren't much, for example -- the music is frequently bland or inappropriate, the video screens play only simple, low-res animating textures, and there don't seem to be special introductions for any of the tag teams.  Pairs like the Steiners, the Road Warriors, and the Rock & Roll Express still come out separately, even if you pick them from the specific tag-team select screen.  On the related subject of tag teams, furthermore, I question the sanity of licensing the R&Rs and leaving out the Midnight Express.  What's the point in having Ricky Morton in the game without Sweet Stan and Beautiful Bobby to beat the crap out of him for 20 minutes solid?  But we could go on in that vein forever.  To reward dedicated players, there's a substantial collection of unlockable features in the game, acquired by completing the tournament mode or spending coins earned in career mode.  There are hidden wrestlers, hidden international arenas, locked create-a-wrestler parts and attributes,  and some ridiculous themed texture sets for custom wrestlers.  You can create a guy done up like the Canadian flag, if you like.  The unlocking scheme is a lot more versatile than last year's model -- I like being able to pick and choose what to unlock, rather than linking specific items to specific achievements.  The best extra in this game, though, is definitely the interview section. Available from the start in the extras gallery are about 15 video interviews with several of the wrestlers in the game, most of them original interviews conducted by Acclaim.  All of these guys are tremendous characters, and the interviewers got some great stories out of them to cut together.  Handsome Harley Race has a yarn about Owen Hart and a stun-gun that I'm still not sure I believe, but it's pretty damn funny regardless.  Some of them also include excerpts of classic footage, too -- Bruno Sammartino's movie, part of a documentary about him, includes several very well-edited clips.  The only problem is the size of the movies, which are shrunk to fit a small inset window for some reason.  They don't look bad, but I'm curious as to why they couldn't have been presented in full-screen resolution.  Sound Imagine my shock when we booked a classic confrontation between Andre the Giant and Billy Graham, to be greeted by the sounds of Saliva's ~Superstar~ blasting out of the speakers during the match.  On the one hand, I'll allow that the Billy Graham association is pretty clever.  On the other, however, hearing nothing but generic nu-metal playing during old-school pro wrestling eventually proves just a little too incongruous to be entertaining.  The selection of tracks also isn't nearly large enough to prevent the game from repeating itself far too often.  It's depressing to hear this sort of thing, because back in the day, the better pro wrestling promotions had genuinely good taste in music.  I have tapes of video packages that would blow you away with pure old-school quality -- Jake Roberts set to Pink Floyd's ~In the Flesh,~ the Rock 'n' Roll Express set to ~Honky Tonk Women~ by the Rolling Stones, and Cactus Jack's entry into the UWF with ~Helter Skelter.~  Why not track this with some good period music, instead of a lot of rot that sounds like it ought to be playing over some motocross game?  Why do the Road Warriors not come out to the ominous chords of ~Iron Man~?  Acclaim can license this Saliva nonsense, but it can't pony up the scratch for Black Sabbath?   Elsewhere on the aural landscape, though, things tighten up a bit.  The ring announcing is just fine, especially when you consider the huge selection of names and nicknames available in the create-a-wrestler mode.  I can create Abdullah ~The Atom Smasher~ Acevedo from Parts Unknown and hear the announcer rattle all that off as he walks to the ring.  The dynamic crowd noise also dovetails well with the excitement level registered in career mode -- bonuses are accompanied by the appropriate pop, and the level of noise corresponds to about how well you're working the crowd.To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if Legends of Wrestling has chosen a task that its creators could ever accomplish.  They have wrestling, and theyhave legends, but they don't have what made them legends in the first place.  If the game were completely solid in every other respect, withunquestionably superior graphics and gameplay, maybe that could make up for its conceptual flaws, but given its technical issues and the bugs that remain in its control scheme, it can't quite make it over the top.The engine, as I say, is good, and would make a great foundation for something in a different milieu.  Married to a strong creation engine and original designs, I think there's definitely room in the market for a wrestling game with no license at all -- come up with a colorful cast of characters with a wide variety of styles and you could have something that could stand up well against the relatively stagnant WWE license.For now, though, we've got old-school wrestlers with no hint of old-school style.  And man, this Saliva crap is just inexcusable...", "date": "Nov 30, 2002"}
