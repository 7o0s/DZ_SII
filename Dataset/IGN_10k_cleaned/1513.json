And there is an overwhelming gap between the two -- a giant chasm that separates good from the merely mediocre. Unfortunately, Texas based Ion Storm's bug and robot-infested PC first-person shooter falls on the latter side of the blackened software abyss, but that hasn't stopped Kemco Japan from porting the decidedly average title to Nintendo 64. With the translation, mediocre gameplay turns to sloppy, boring graphics turn to blurry, and a somewhat fulfilling multiplayer mode turns to a pointless mishmash of clunky control and cliche play. Still, somewhat surprisingly, Daikatana N64 is not a horrible experience. It's not unplayable by any means, and in fact there are certain portions of the game that deliver some sort of twisted play satisfaction in the same way that throwing a ball up into the air and catching it over and over does. But like its PC predecessor this N64 port offers absolutely nothing new to the shooter genre, and truthfully also fails to measure up to already released competitors GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, or any of the Turok offerings.  The Facts  Shooter and RPG elements.  Character building.  More than 25 different weapons. Weapons and items are time period specific. Play through four eras  25th Century Japan, Ancient Greece, Viking Norway and 21st Century San Francisco.  Climate conditions. 60+ different enemies. Expansion Pak support for high-resolution mode. Controller Pak compatible.   Gameplay The setup for Daikatana N64: The year is 2455. A magical sword -- the Daikatana -- was recently unearthed by archeologists and promptly stolen by Kage Mishima, a greedy mastermind hungering for world power. Using the special abilities of the sword, Mishima has traveled back in time and rewritten history to his liking, and subsequently also altered the future. It's up to you, Hiro Miyamoto (inspired by the last name of the master game designer himself), to take out Mishima and restore the planet to its nature state.  Daikatana N64 delivers both shooter and RPG elements, character building, and time travel, but none of this really changes how the game ultimately plays, which is exactly like every other first-person shooter on the market, except a whole lot more clumsily. The experience really consists of walking through hallway after hallway while shooting various flying mosquitoes, robots, and guards -- all of which sport impressively retarded artificial intelligence. The levels themselves are different from those featured in the PC version. Every once in a while a switch will need to be pressed, an access card retrieved for an unlocked door, or a non-playable computer character enlisted to open access to a new area. And if you pay close attention, you might even notice that a hit point counter rises with every enemy killed... but probably not. What you're more likely to eye repeatedly is your watch after rounding corridor after mind-numbingly-boring corridor shooting enemies that stumble out into the open without bothering to shoot back at you most of the time. It's not good. It's not bad. It's just ridiculously bland.   What Daikatana N64 fails to deliver in innovation (or fun) it more than makes up for in glitches and gameplay bugs. It's not uncommon to occasionally walk through a wall where you will be treated to an invisible-field view of the entire polygon level map. Similarly, it's no trouble at all to fall off a ledge onto the head of an enemy, who continues to fire blankly in the wrong direction.     Whereas the PC version of the game featured bumbling sidekicks who would follow our hero around and (allegedly) help out in the action, the N64 version doesn't. Sure, you rescue them from imprisonment, but they only return the favor in cut-scenes. And considering that the incredibly poor enemy AI already hampers the game's fluidity, it's probably a good thing. Meanwhile, Daikatana's multiplayer modes, which allow you to either deathmatch against up to four players or fight it out to see who can collect the most gems (hidden throughout arenas), doesn't offer much incentive to play as it's simply no fun. A slow sensation of walking speed coupled with boring weapons, environments, death animations, color schemes -- basically everything -- turns the multiplayer game into a chore.   Graphics Kemco has apparently decided to pay homage to 1997 with Daikatana's graphics presentation, which boasts a wide array of blurry textures, extremely low-polygon characters and maps, robotic animation routines, and archaic level design that makes Hexen 64 look brilliant by comparison. There is nothing so bad on the eyes that it'll make you want to turn the game off on sight, but on the other hand, there is nothing good either. And when we consider that Daikatana arrives in the final stage of N64's life cycle, that in of itself is very, very bad.  Sound Yes, but barely. A single guitar riff plays through the first several levels of the game as the only background music, and then another guitar riff covers the next batch of areas. Add in adequate explosions, screams, gunfire, thumps, and robotic noises, and you've got the listening sensation that is Daikatana N64 -- an experience that is, like the rest of the game, neither good or bad. A mediocre PC first-person shooter gets worse with the transition to Nintendo 64. Slow, sometimes sloppy control mixed with boring, uninspired level design, dumb enemies, and sleepy weaponry come together for an entirely average N64 shooter -- one that really isn't good, but at the same time isn't exceptionally poor either. After releasing the game as a rental-only title in August, Kemco and Electro Source have now decided to unleash Daikatana N64 onto unsuspecting retailers and Holiday shoppers alike. It shouldn't have bothered. If you're absolutely dying for another game of this type and can look past the blurry graphics and clunky controls, you could do worse than shelling out $3 at Blockbuster to check it all out for yourself. I certainly don't recommend it. As for buying Daikatana 64 -- save your money, please. There are far better budget titles out there that deserve your hard earned cash more than this mediocre port.", "date": "Nov 22, 2000"}
