Of course, I'd have to omit a few choice lines here and there if only because Nine Breaker doesn't feature as much stuff. Funny how a sequel can offer less, eh?  Armored Core: Nine Breaker can be taken as a product designed to launch new recruits into the franchise and get them excited about forthcoming Armored Core releases on the next-generation of consoles. We can only assume this is Nine Breaker's intention because it offers practically nothing new for avid Armored Core fans. That is, none of the challenges are interesting, the technical improvements are minimal, the arena combat is limited, and it still fails to incorporate an actual online mode. So it must be for rookies.   Then again...   In as much as it fails to cater to the enthusiast AC fan, Nine Breaker also does nothing for new players. The robust Core configuration tool is still a mysterious collection of numbers casual gamers are not going to understand. The controls are still clumsy enough to prevent pick-up-and play users from enjoying themselves. And, there is almost no accessible help, prompts, indicators, tips, or general advisements to steer terrible pilots in the right direction.  In terms of modes, Nine Breaker essentially offers challenges and arena matches. The challenges, of which there are over 100, are designed to develop specific skills users can apply in arena matches. But the actual gameplay involved in just about every test is never interesting or helpful. In fact, a casual gamer might fail one of the painfully redundant evade routines dozens of times before he realizes that his current heavy leg setup simply isn't going to let his Core maneuver around anything. Even when he realizes this, the user may still have difficulties choosing a new hover system if only because there are no adequate descriptors present. This creates excessive trial and error.  Here's how it works: Try something out. Realize it either does or does not work. Go back and reconfigure your Core so that it might work the next time around.   While this type of gameplay may seem like brain teasing experimental problem solving, it becomes awfully tedious, since each new subset of challenges often requires a measurably different Core than the last one. Of course, there are never any good descriptors around to tell you that. Also try and remember that the challenges largely involve busting up boxes or shooting lame drones (hardly interesting missions). So basically, if I didn't know Armored Core, I wouldn't know what anything meant, nor would I care because actually playing the challenges is tiresome.   Clash of the Titans IX  What are the positives and negatives when comparing laser vs. ballistic vs. explosive weapon systems?   How heavily should I emphasize weight on a per arm basis?   Why would I want a higher ECM rating?   How is a hover torso more beneficial for a Core designed to harass enemies with machineguns and then strike with laser blades?   What good is an awesome radar in close-quartered arena matches anyway?  Are melee weapons really useful? If so, which ones and against what?  What sort of lock-on weapons might work best against a maneuverable enemy Core?   Simple aides could have explained all this and more. Simple aides could have made Nine Breaker a much better game for new gamers assuming the gameplay got some work. That's the other problematic part of Armored Core...the actual fighting.   This style of basic arena combat pits the player against all kinds of differently outfitted computer opponents. Like Nexus, Nine Breaker allows gamers to use the ironed out dual analog controls, but the basic multi-weapon to hover to jump to dash Core piloting the series has always been known for is the same. If you're not familiar with Armored Core at all, it's basically like a cross between MechAssault and Zone of the Enders, though not as smooth as either. Think of mechanical third-person shooting with an emphasis on target locking and jump jet propulsion.  None of this is really fun in Nine Breaker because there's no real sense of victory attached to the matches. You just play and win or lose to no cool end. Of course, there's no story. It's just you and some random computers in a cave or desert or industrialized area.  There's also a splitscreen mode and networked play in Nine Breaker. Competitive gaming is certainly the highlight of this title, but without a legitimate online mode and a properly managed ranking system, it feels way too limited. I also remember playing splitscreen in the past. It's time for some advancement. Simply, Armored Core: Nexus players have no reason to purchase Nine Breaker. To a lesser extent, gamers that have enjoyed Armored Core 2, Another Age or Armored Core 3, will also be wondering what the fuss is about (assuming there is any left at this point). And for those that are new to the Armored Core franchise and are just looking to break into the series, please note that any of the previously mentioned games (Nexus in particular) will offer a better starting point.This is because Nine Breaker does not offer fresh content, nor does it deliver anything to accommodate new players. It's just kind of there.", "date": "Sep 19, 2005"}
