Eidos' freshly shorn asassin has starred in a series of games, most recently Blood Money. This mobile adventure is an off-shoot of this game, sub-titled Vegas, since that's where Agent 47 must go to clean house over a series of assignments.   Routine breeds contempt -- in both real life and in video games. Hitman takes a serious tumble due to its oft-repeated game play formula. You must comb a Vegas resort for your target (usually an unsavory character) with the help of CCTV cameras, use some modicum of stealth to sneak up on them, and then eliminate them with a gun or your trademark fibrewire. And you do this, over and over, just looking in different rooms for different bad guys.   Variety only comes from a few things: weapons and stealth options. Agent 47 can use everything from poison to an assault rifle to kill his targets. The problem is, more often than not, it's easiest just to walk right up to your target and pop them right in the head with arms outstretched, not drawing any attention to yourself, right?    Stealth plays a minor role, as Agent 47 can take on disguise, such as an employee, or slink through crowds to avoid detection. The crowds are on auto-pilot, though. The only non-playable character in the game that seems to have any idea that a killer in the casino is none other than your target. I'm not expecting a fully realized living, breathing world in a small mobile download, but my gun should cause some sort of alarm in a room of innocent people -- even if that room is in Las Vegas. Seriously, try pulling your weapon in the middle of a room full of people. Nothing. Your stealth meter, which monitors the awareness of your target and any guards, in the upper corner hardly registers anything. After killing a guard in cold blood, waitress, card dealers, and patrons never even broke their stride.   (Oh, and really, some disguises don't even seem to work. I stole a guard's blue uniform, pushed the nekkid body in a corner, and then tried to slip through a crowd. Guess what? I walked by a guard, only to be shot in the face.)   After a few missions, you'll realize that this is only a Hitman game in name alone. Whereas the console games, such as Blood Money, offered incredible locales and assignments that required clever thinking, this mobile game is just a boring shooter. Get briefing, find bad guy, shoot bad guy, find exit. If it wasn't possible to squeeze the strategy of a Hitman game in a mobile download, I can accept that. But then don't call the game Hitman.   There are a few touches in here that I did like. For one thing, the controls worked fine. Having a ~run mode~ is useful and a clean targeting reticle lets you know exactly when you have a shot. The CCTV feature, where you acquired the position of guards and targets, is actually neat. The map is useful for monitoring guards and whatnot.  Hitman Blood Money Vegas is a paint-by-number action game masquerading as a Hitman game. The mechanics of the game are too simple. After a while, you'll just abandon using stealth and the array of weapons and just go for gunplay. That's not a world-class assassin -- that's a cheap contract killer. Plus, some of the mechanics -- such as disguises -- don't work very well. Pass on this one.", "date": "Oct 31, 2006"}
