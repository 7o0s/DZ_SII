{"name": "South Park", "name_review": "South Park", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/south-park-5", "text": "I could write this review in just three words: ~throw snowball, repeat.~  But I'll embellish it a little bit so you'll understand exactly why I want this game to go to hell, go to hell and die.   The story behind the game ... well, it's not really important.  It's South Park, right?  You all know about South Park.  There's lots of foul language, blood, violence, and mother bashing.  Unfortunately even these fine elements that make one hella funny TV show couldn't save the computer adaptation.  This game is shallow, uninspired, bland and just plain boring.  What could have been a great license has been ruined by Acclaim, and, as Cartman might say, ~This game licks ass-in the proverbial sense.~  What really ruins this game is the sheer repetitiveness.  Every aspect of the game becomes tedious because you've seen it or done it a thousand times before.  The five episodes are each broken into four levels.  The level design is so straight forward that a three year old could simply walk from the beginning of each level to the end with no problems.  Considering this game carries a 'Mature' rating and has a warning on the box stating that it's not for kids (hmmm ... and obvious ploy by Acclaim to get kids to buy the game? Me thinks so), you would think that there would have been some challenge to the levels themselves.  Instead, the design team decided to throw an endless number of baddies at you to make up for the game's linear levels.  Rarely was there a time that my finger was off of the right mouse button and this game boiled down to nothing but constatnly chucking snowballs at anything that moved.  Now where's the challenge or skill in that?  To make matters worse, the huge levels usually contain about three different types of baddies ... and even the different types are repetitive.  For example, in the first level you'll ward off turkeys, larger turkeys and, finally, mechaturkeys.  And every episode is exactly the same, just insert a different enemy-clones, robots, etc.  I do have to admit that South Park looks pretty friggin' good.  The art team managed to take the 2D cutouts used in the show and turn them into 3D objects without losing the look and feel of the characters.  And when you're running around the town you'll bump into a few landmarks you'll recognize from the show, like City Hall and Tom's Rhinoplasty.  Unfortunately, like most of the game, the graphics get incredibly repetitive as you'll play the same levels again and again.  Arggghhh!!!!  The only thing that actually saves this game is the multiplayer action.   Like the N64 version, you can pick from almost every character in the TV show: Cartman, Big Gay Al, Mr. Garrison, Mephisto and Chef to name just a few.  And since PC manufacturers don't really have a problem with showing religious or cultural icons in games like the folks over at Nintendo do, you can also pick to be Santa, Jesus or Beelzebub in the PC version.  However, even the multiplay experience gets stale after a while.  But in the end this game just pisses me off.  It's obvious that Acclaim got the South Park license and got so excited about rushing a game out the door that they didn't bother the give the design team enough time to make a good game. It's just another example of a publisher landing a big license and screwing it up just to make a buck.  I hope some of the folks over at Acclaim read this and take heed of this warning: give your development team enough time to finish a game before releasing it to the public.  Otherwise, you run the risk of sucking ass.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 13, 1999"}
