Being in my early twenties I keep in touch with what's hip, what's in and what's cool and can usually explain to the elderly why we young people enjoy certain things. Nonetheless, the SpongeBob SquarePants phenomenon that struck several years back is one that left me scratching my head. How can so many people, young and old alike, be so enamored by the shenanigans of an underwater society lead by a creature that is nothing more than a cleaning utensil and a pair of khaki shorts (they're not even pants!)? It just doesn't make sense to me.   Either way the franchise has made Nickelodeon oodles of money, both from the cartoon series and the monstrous marketing campaign that followed. Everything from underwear to lunchboxes to videogames has had the SpongeBob name slapped on them, the latest entry to the marketing juggernaut being SpongeBob SquarePants: Underpants Slam! for the Xbox Live Arcade.   Multiplayer Action  Players must traverse through ten levels, choosing from an assortment of characters that any SpongeBob fan will recognize in order to collect 99 separate pairs of underwear. Yes, you read that right, you're collecting underoos. Tidy-whiteys, whatever you'd like to call them, it doesn't change the fact that you'll be jumping to and fro in order to collect what I can only hope are clean pairs of undergarments. Standing in your way are jellyfish, some with different personalities than others. Occasionally they'll swim away with one of your coveted pairs of undies and you'll need to time an attack just right to avoid their electrified shock.    While most of the underpants can be collected by exploring the two-dimensional landscape, there is also a hefty portion that will need to be unearthed by smashing objects that sit in the background. At first it might seem a little tough to spot these objects, but once you get the hang of keeping an eye out for these boxes, pipes and treasure chests the game's overall simplicity shines through.   There are only ten levels in Underpants Slam! and the majority of them are sequels to previous levels. It feels a little cheap to have three renditions of Atlantis when you're paying ten dollars for the download. On top of that the game is really nothing more than a mundane collection exercise. Every level feels all too similar to the next, a different coat of paint being the only real differentiating factor. There are trapdoors, treadmills spinning in certain directions and pieces of the environment that will break away if you slam down on them, but overall there just aren't enough new pieces to each level to keep things fun.   Luckily Underpants Slam! does deliver some nice power-ups to keep things as fresh as possible. You'll see things like a magnet to attract any stray underpants that are resting nearby, one that makes you invulnerable, then there are negative pickups that will reverse your controls or slow your character down.    SpongeBob SquarePants: Underpants Slam!'s greatest frailty can almost be called a bug. For whatever reason the developers decided to map the jump and the slam abilities the same button, so if you double tap A then you're going to come slamming down. Okay, we wouldn't have done it that way but it's fine. The real problem comes when you're standing on the side of a platform, no fear of falling off, press jump twice and somehow your character goes plummeting off of the side. Is there a strong current in the level? No, because you can jump straight up and land just fine, but accidentally tap the jump button again and you'll go careening off to God only knows where. In some situations it isn't that much of a hassle, but if you're standing at the bottom of the level with only one bubble of health left it's more than a little annoying.    The multiplayer aspect provides little reprieve from the tedium of the solo quest and time attack modes. You can buddy up with three other mates and participate in a timed competition to see who can capture the most pairs of underwear. The only real twist that differentiates this from the single-player game is that you have the ability to punch your opponents and steal some of their underpants away. In the end it's essentially the same tedious experience, only slightly more fun.SpongsBob SquarePants: Underpants Slam is one of those XBLA purchases that will be tough to justify for many. If youre a diehard fan of the show -- yes, I realize there are many of you out there -- then you might want to check this out as the characters do come with some decent personalities and funny quips, but the common gamer probably wont (and shouldnt) look twice at this exercise in tedium.", "date": "Jan 3, 2008"}
