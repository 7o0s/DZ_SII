On one hand, the game is a simple button masher, and a tired one at that given its +15 year age. From arcade to PlayStation, Track & Field has been the same finger shattering game.  But on the other hand is the fact that the frenetic competitive spirit of Konami's veteran sports game is still the best representation of Olympic athletics put to silicon. The game makes you sweat. It makes you work. It can even make you bleed.  Gameplay  As with all T&F games, International Track & Field 2000 is mostly composed on wailing on the controller like there is no tomorrow. If you find little bits of blistered flesh stuck between the joints of the buttons, you're probably playing IT&F 2000 correctly.  This latest Track & Field tries to mix up the competition, with varying degrees of success. The sprint events and tosses are still hysterical button-mashing events with a small degree of timing involved, but some more technical events are also added to fit the new sports. For instance, Clean and Jerk Weightlifting and Springboard Diving events involve sticking the move precisely during a lift or spin, while the Women's Horse Vault Gymnastics event is like Parappa the Rapper in that athletes must dial in moves in perfect timing to plant the move and stick the landing. They've also added lunges and leans for photo-finish victories (at the expense of a stumble and sudden speed loss if you time it wrong). Still, more could have been done here, especially with the sudden proliferation of the Dual Shock due to games like Ape Escape. The dual controller sticks could have been used to better simulate the canoeing and bicycling events. Also, many events are just too strenuous for a finger diddling game. A hundred yard dash is one thing, but pounding on the buttons as fast as possible for a kilometer in the biking event is just bloody murder!  Graphics Stylish TV presentation has come a long way since the 8-bit NES days. With the flying camera angles, the personal close-ups, and the wide-angle action shots, the game looks like the sport being emulated. The graphics surely aren't breathtaking coming from the house of Metal Gear, but the style is perfect.   For instance, the canoeing event is boring and ugly like dirt, but it looks like a TV broadcast of a sport that's boring and ugly like dirt (there's even a replay to show all the glory of canoeing). On the other hand, the biking events (set in a dome) are incredible, and it's just fun to watch a belly-flop in the diving event. All of the character animation is good in motion, although the winning sequences are repetitive and dull. One other caveat on the graphics -- the pole vault event is set at an obtuse angle, making the timing on the event very different and very difficult compared to the original series.  Sound Good sound samples compliment the action, and Konami was smart to keep music out of the actual races. The intro and highlight music is appropriately hyper, smooth, and classy, but nothing here is worth writing home about. One gripe I have is that the game doesn't have actual athletes, and not that I would know any real athlete if my life depended on it, but the generic ~From Kenya, Player One~ announcement does nothing to make me feel like I'm at the sport. A very basic but complete effort. Track & Field. Love it or leave it. This is the best anybody's done to capture athletic events outside of sports, but it's still a simplistic game despite the additions of strategy and timing. Even four-player bouts are typically weak -- there's always some Craig Harris guy who just dominates every event. You find that out when you find him leading the field by 80 yards in an hundred-yard dash. Still, if this type of fast-action athleticism is to your liking, this is the best presentation and widest field of events for the series yet (and, unlike the N64 version, all of the events are ready to go without need of unlocking). Good for what it is, a relic that still proves itself on the turf, but hopefully Konami will go back to training with the series and come up with an even closer Olympic experience.", "date": "Jan 21, 2000"}
