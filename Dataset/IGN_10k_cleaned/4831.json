But nobody is acknowledging poker's risqu cousin, strip poker. Nobody but Gameloft, that is. The game house behind such grim-faced hits as Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six is showing off its feminine side -- all of its feminine side -- in their new strip poker sim that is probably best kept out of the hands of kids.   Features:   Play poker, video poker or blackjack  Six ladies to challenge   Sexy Poker 2004 is a silly, sassy, saucy game of strip poker that keeps its tongue planted firmly in cheek. More than just a poker game, it's a sim for sleazy wannabe producers. The story goes, you're looking for some ladies to cast in your new, uh, movie. But you don't really have the proper funds to hire these beauties, but should you beat them at strip poker, they'll work on your film at a discount. Dude, if that isn't the plot of a 1983 porn movie, we dunno what is.   Casting couch.   Apparently, your movie calls for six sexy femme leads (what are you filming, a Sidaris flick?), so to round out the cast, you must line 'em up and knock 'em out in a half-dozen rounds of poker. But know this, these ladies are no pushovers. They are skilled poker players, each one better than the last. They can and will mercilessly destroy your ~surefire~ hands.   However, this being a sim of sorts, they can also blow it, big time. We've raised the stakes impossibly high with a full house, only to have the girl try and bluff us out of the hand. When the cards were revealed, poor lady had nothing. And she wound up wearing even less.   We added the black bar. Let's actually get the answer to the inevitable question out of the way right now. Yes, they get naked. Very naked. Boobies are shown. But Gameloft did exercise a little restraint. When the panties come off, you're treated to a pixelated blur straight out of a ~Girls Gone Wild~ infomercial.   Now, getting them in the pink is not simple. They have plenty of clothes on. For example, the surfer girl has what looks to be just a sweater and shorts, but once you peel those back, she has a wet suit on underneath. And then a bikini. Nothing comes easy in this game, we tell you. However, if you pay attention, the girls sometimes have ~tells~ that hint at their hands. Look at their expressions. (If you can concentrate on her face.) Learn these giveaways, and she's be feeling a draft sooner than you think.   The best way to get them clothes on the floor is to play aggressively. Don't be afraid to jack up the pot from time to time, even if you have a weak hand. If she wants to stay in the game but is out of cash, she will ~sell~ an article of clothing for extra chips. Win the hand and she must toss the bra. However, if she gets on a winning streak, she can buy back her duds. And this will happen from time to time, especially when you are ~thisclose~ to seeing something R-rated.   Clever girl.   There are two other game modes in Sexy Poker 2004: video poker and blackjack. Video poker plays exactly as it sounds. Blackjack, however, is a very neat little addition. It's a good, smart game of blackjack that, while not as deep as poker, will keep you entertained.   Naturally, Sexy Poker 2004 looks good. The girls are nicely drawn, and their expressions are well animated. But let's be honest -- you aren't going to find real thrills here. Sure, it's fun to see how nekkid you can get 'em, but if pixilated breasts raise your pulse, you have problems.Sure, Sexy Poker 2004 uses its feminine wiles to lure you in. I mean, who could really say no to a game of strip poker, other than maybe John Ashcroft? But once you've played several hands, you realize that Gameloft isn't just coasting on boobies -- this is a very solid game of five card. And the story is just awesome, including the straight-outta-porn dialogue, full of too-obvious double entendres. If you're an adult and can appreciate a little sexy, sassy fun, Sexy Poker 2004 is a good download. But if there is any chance that a kid can get a hold of your handset, do the right thing and don't download it. Because of Gameloft gets a bunch of irate parents calling and emailing, this will be the last adult game for handsets you'll ever see on these shores.", "date": "Jul 10, 2004"}
