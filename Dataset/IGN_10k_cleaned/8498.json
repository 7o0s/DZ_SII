To be fair, it's barely a sports game either, in the traditional sense. The traditional sense being anything that doesn't involve banjo-twanging sky dives, epileptic disco mushrooms and intoxication by fart, obviously. Yes, ladies and gentleman, it's time to hit the pitch with Mario and chums once again, as Nintendo proffers another wedge of paper-thin football relevance hanging staunchly over a pile of impossibly addictive insanity.   With so much going on at once, it's easy to get confused. Or explode.  First things first then, if you're at all familiar with the original 'Cube Strikers title you'll be instantly at home with this Wii offering. From a basic perspective this sequel plays much the same as its forebear. However, Nintendo and developer Next Level have really worked to shape the original formula into a much deeper, far more satisfying game this time around.   That's evident right from the off, with Mario Strikers' menu screen stuffed with various better-defined modes and options. For single-player games there's the Road to Striker Cup tournaments and Striker Challenges, with multiplayer matches making use of Domination mode alongside Nintendo's much-touted inaugural online console offering. There's even a Hall of Fame tracking your various achievements as your shooting skills increase with play.   Mario and co. are full of character, thanks to some excellent animations.  While the Road to Striker Cup is a fairly traditional tournament style romp, seeing you face off against various computer-controlled teams in a series of progressively tougher matches to win all manner of shiny awards, Striker Challenges go some way to increasing the solo longevity of proceedings, which the first game seriously lacked. As the name suggests you're presented with a series of challenges, nominally based around classic Mario grudge matches. So, for instance, Mario and Donkey Kong are pitted in a sudden death play-off, with the aim being to score the single winning goal. Elsewhere, that time-honoured sibling rivalry comes to the fore as Luigi finally strives for Mario's comeuppance, turning the match in his favour before the whistle blows.   There are plenty of challenges to work through, all ranked according to difficulty. They're all generally short and varied enough to remain engaging and - even better - your toils are rewarded with player cards, as you complete a set of character challenges, viewable in the Hall of Fame. Success in both Challenges mode and Road to Striker Cup gradually unlocks a hefty variety of cheats - split into environmental, power and character categories - which can be used to mix up the action even further in multiplayer Domination.     Admittedly we're a little torn here; while the original Mario Strikers offered a more flexible head-to-head options roster from the beginning, the wealth of tweakable elements that can be opened through persistent play definitely provides a tangible incentive to work through Striker Cup and Challenges mode, not to mention a thorough tutoring in the ways of the game. However, it's a little disappointing to note that some basic, much demanded options aren't available from the off - we know from experience that some players would prefer to disable those score-seesawing power shots, for instance. Elsewhere, there're plenty of other goodies buried deep within the game for more dedicated ballers, including myriad cups and trophies, captains (incidentally, Bowser is a playable character from the off this time around, rather than a pitch-stomping annoyance, fact fans) and stadiums.   Alongside ten new stadiums, all seven originals are available from the off.  Speaking of stadiums, one of our main criticisms regarding the original Strikers game was the somewhat repetitive selection of stadiums on offer. While there was some variation in the arenas themselves, the smallish pitches featured little to distinguish one from the next - with most consigned to bland, distinctly incongruous smears of brushed metal and rusty steel, presumably a direct result of the game's beginnings outside of the Mario universe. Thankfully though, Next Level's pretty much hit the nail on the head this time around. Not only has the stadium roster been upped from seven to 10 (with all original arenas making a spruced-up return, available from the start), most take a more obvious cue from the Mushroom Kingdom. Even better, each sports its own unique environmental hazards, making for a welcome change across matches. Whether it's the wind hurling tractors and livestock into players on Thunder Island, Thwomps smashing onto the pitch in The Sand Tomb or intermittent electrical pulses sending shockwaves throughout the Stormship Stadium, arenas actually serve more than a cosmetic purpose in Strikers Charged Football.   Elsewhere too, Next Level has apparently listened to fan feedback and rectified some common complaints from the first game. For a start there's now a more diverse selection of captains, totalling 10 in all, each with their own unique super ability to master. As with power-ups, these are earned when the opposing team makes a foul such as tackling a player who's not currently in possession of the ball. Super abilities range from Donkey Kong's ground pound and Mario's predictable growth spurt to Wario's frankly alarming player-confounding trouser expulsion. Importantly, these are never so powerful they completely upset the status quo of a match, but can offer a much needed moment of respite against the opposition. Used carefully, they can open up the field, adding another welcome layer of depth to proceedings.   Each captain sports their own special move - perfect for evening the odds.  Likewise, it's now possible to completely tailor the remaining members of your squad, picking from a line-up of eight possible characters. Featuring the likes of Koopas, Toads, Monty Moles and Shy Guys, each specialises in either Balanced, Playmaker, Defensive, Offensive or Power play - all with slightly different skill sets. It's perhaps not immediately obvious how this affects in-game play, but experimentation with your line-up can yield some significant results over time. Again, it's a relatively minor addition, but one which banishes the original game's somewhat superficial nature even further.   Out on the pitch, things play out much as before from a basic perspective. In other words, aside from the aforementioned additions and their affect on gameplay, anyone who's played the previous Mario Strikers game will feel right at home. Charged features the same phenomenally taut, breathlessly fast-paced and addictive arcade action of its predecessor, with the multitude of offensive and defensive tactics all present and correct.     Thankfully, Next Level has paired down the game's controls from Charged's Leipzig debut last year, with the slightly fussy waggle-tackle now replaced by a simple button press. In fact, despite using remote and nunchuck attachments, controls are impressively stream-lined, with the developer reigning in any wayward waggle-tendencies for a more straightforward, accessible approach. As it happens, only the Wii's unique pointing functionality makes an appearance in the game and, even then, it's limited to a brief Duck Hunt style mini-game during Mega Strike Goals.    Arenas all feature their own unique environmental hazards now.  As before, these are power shot-style special attacks specific to captains: find a clear area of the pitch (easier said than done with the entire opposition on your heels), hold down the B trigger and hit the markers on the golf swing-style gauge. Success determines the number of balls you unleash, as well as the speed of attack. Differing significantly to the original Strikers however, the defending player can take direct action during a Mega Strike attack. Using the pointer, goals can be saved by taking aim and hitting the A button as balls roar toward the screen. It's a brief but tense addition and actually manages to heighten involvement in proceedings by giving you complete control over the outcome of a Mega Strike. In other words it's a genuinely integral part of gameplay, far more than a simple Wii remote gimmick.   If you've not got the message by now, Mario Strikers Charged is exactly what a sequel should be. Next Level has taken the successful framework of the GameCube original and really fleshed-out those areas which were lacking first time around. Consequently, this package feels far better-rounded, making for a much juicier experience. Nowhere is this more evident than in the much-heralded online mode. Rather than covering old ground, you can check out our detailed breakdown of Charged's Wi-Fi features elsewhere on IGN. In summary though, it's an incredibly promising start for Nintendo's online ambitions. Even with those ever-controversial Friend Codes present, it's hard to fault the feature list here.   Bowser's no longer confined to stomping duty, instead being playable in Charged.  With a permanent friend roster keeping track of everyone's online status and game progress; extensive leaderboard data; Rival play; individual Mii-specific Friend Codes so multiple players can record their football prowess; a simple instant notification system for match requests with another online player and the option for four-man matches, with two players per Wii, there really is much to be admired with Mario Strikers inaugural online advances. Sure, Xbox Live stalwarts might complain about lack of voice chat and a good few other things, but for a first console attempt on an entirely free service we're more than happy with the feature list and smooth play. Hopefully we'll see even more from Nintendo as its online service matures, but there's absolutely no denying the massive boost Charged's online option gives to the games longevity in both multiplayer and - more significantly - solo modes.Ultimately then, Mario Strikers Charged is an evolution of the GameCube original with the game's scope somewhat limited by its very nature. In other words, don't be surprised if you grow weary of proceedings after extended play. However, by directly addressing all of the first game's shortcomings with gusto, Next Level has created a sequel which almost feels like a completely different beast. Minor tweaks and upgrades significantly bolster the game's breadth and depth, while managing to retain the original's deliriously raucous multiplayer game. With the addition of online play this time around too, Next Level has cannily overcome issues concerning the first title's single-player game. In short then, Mario Strikers Charged Football is a deeply satisfying, hugely entertaining title and highly recommended.", "date": "May 21, 2007"}
