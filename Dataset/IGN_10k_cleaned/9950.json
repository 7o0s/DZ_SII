It was cool during an elementary school fieldtrip when you got to look at polar bears instead of learning long division, but lame when the parents decided to go there instead of a real amusement park. When Zoo Tycoon came out on the Nintendo DS in 2005, it made us dislike zoos in the way that the prospect of getting mauled by a tiger at one does. It's a couple years later, and Altron has developed Zoo Tycoon 2. This version has no tigers to maul us, and we got to pet otters! Plus, it's pretty fun, too.   So it's a Tycoon game. Which means it's a game about running whatever the subject is, in this case, a zoo. The Zoo Tycoon series has been around the PC for years, so this isn't anything new. Long time DS owners may also remember the 2005 Zoo Tycoon, and how bad it was. Thankfully, quite a few of the issues with the previous game have been fixed, giving players a far more engrossing experience.   The biggest change and new feature is Zookeeper Mode, which allows the player to enter the enclosure and interact with the animals. Touch screen minigames allow the player to feed, clean, pet, and nurse the animals. Each animal is represented in 3D, and most have different models for male and female, and everyone has a model for the babies. A few of the species are a bit funky looking (like the bug-eyed panthers), but most of them are pretty good. They animate differently based on their mood, and they all have realistic sound effects.   Zookeeper Mode is a bit of a step away from the Tycoon formula, but it's a welcome feature because Zoo Tycoon 2 still looks pretty bland in the overview mode. There is an improvement, meaning you can actually tell what animals are in the cages this time, but there is really nothing spectacular. The animations are probably the most noticeable improvement, with guests and animals alike actually moving around semi-realistically. Still, even at the most zoomed in camera mode, the game still has a detached, god-like view.   If you don't keep the animals happy, they get cranky. Like all economic simulation games, the main point of Zoo Tycoon 2 is to effectively bring in the cash. Players also want to raise their zoo's rating, since a higher rating unlocks the ability to add fancier exhibits and more expensive animals.   There's very little challenge in keeping the zoo physically running. Money comes pouring in and, unless the player is inept, the animals should be perfectly happy all the time. Guests are easy to please (they like restrooms) and there aren't disasters to speak of (no tigers will escape and kill anybody).   The Campaign mode does make some sort of challenge by giving the player certain objectives to complete within a time limit. At first it's pretty basic, but the later campaigns do get a bit harder. It's not difficult to get a zoo in tip-top shape with some expensive animals, but to do so within the 50 month limit means there can't be any stalling. It's clear the difficulty is geared towards a younger or more casual audience, and Zoo Tycoon 2 doesn't have a lot of micromanaging to do besides feeding the rhinos, so simulation enthusiasts will probably blast through the game in a couple days.   Still, the campaigns are kept pretty diverse and interesting. The 15 scenarios are broken into five sections, including a tutorial. One of the sections focus on fixing troubled zoos, and another is all about distinguishing the different biomes animals inhabit. It's slyly educational, but not as educational as the trading cards players unlock by opening animal exhibits. It's the best kind of edutainment: the kind we can choose to ignore.   The Campaign mode also features another improvement over the prequel. As soon as all the objectives are met, the scenario ends and allows the player to move in. In the first Zoo Tycoon players had to just wait until the time ran out before they could continue.   There is a Free Play mode that allows players to build a zoo any way they want. Players can customize the scenario, choosing how much money they want, what rating their zoo starts off at, and what animals are unlocked from the beginning. Some of the more exciting creatures, including mythical and extinct beasts like unicorns and dinosaurs, are unlocked by earning trophies in the Campaign mode. And some of the cuter star animals are unlocked by beating the Campaign scenarios. So to get a zoo full of sea otters, saber-toothed cats, pandas, and unicorns, players will have to complete the scenarios.People either like Tycoon games, or they don't. In that respect, Zoo Tycoon 2 is a decent choice for a handheld economic sim since it has all the features of a good sim game, but shortens it to be able to play for couple minute increments. For gamers that have somehow not developed an opinion on the genre, or for that new generation of young gamers-to-be, Zoo Tycoon 2 is a simple, decently paced title that still has a good amount of hands on interactivity. Like we've said before, animals are the best veil to hide education behind, and this game has plenty of opportunity for learning. Just don't get mad at us if you're kid starts asking why there are no unicorns at your local zoo.", "date": "Feb 4, 2008"}
