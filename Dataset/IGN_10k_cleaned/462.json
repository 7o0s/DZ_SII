Sure it was controversial -- it was a game that encouraged carjacking vehicles and running over pedestrians, not to mention committing felonies and driving like a maniac. But come on...the pacing was slow, the 3D perspective made me literally seasick, the controls were pretty horrible, and it was a game that was nothing but going from Point A to Point B to Point C to Point D without getting caught. But because of its controversial nature, it sold well enough across the board to justify a sequel (released a few weeks back on the PlayStation and PC) -- but more interestingly, it sparked a developer to work on a portable version of the game for the Game Boy Color. What we have is an outstanding Game Boy Color conversion of an absolutely dull, clumsy console game.   Features Three cities More than 100 missions Conversion of PlayStation and PC title For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Right off the bat, if you've never played the console version you'll be completely lost. Rockstar's instruction manual for this somewhat complex-controlling game is an absolute joke -- the Warranty and Service Agreement is half the booklet. Cripes, GTA isn't Tetris or Pac-Man, people...the game isn't exactly user-friendly. The high learning curve is reason enough to include a small tutorial -- and they seriously dropped the ball. So if you're scratching your head trying to figure out what to do, listen up:  You're a man-for-hire set out to commit freelance crimes -- steal a car and bring it back to the garage or deliver naughty packages. The towns are huge, so to get around you don't want to hike it on foot, so you'll have to carjack a few vehicles to get where you need to go. When you're on foot, you can pull out a pistol and shoot bad guys  that get in your way. Take too many hits, and it's off to the hospital. Get by the cops and you're thrown in jail. Sound like fun yet?   I have to hand it to Tarantula Studios. For what they had to do, they put together a very nice looking, 2D version of a 3D engine. The game still takes place in the top-down view, but the camera is fixed at a specific height instead of zooming in on the action. The game looks really nice, even for a Color title that's backward compatible.  The problems, though, are big-time huge. First of all, the streets look like they've been ripped out of  the movie ~Night of the Comet.~ In other words, traffic is near non-existent, which is not exactly a good feature when the whole idea is to stop cars to hijack them. Second, control is downright obnoxious. I was never a fan of the original's configuration, and with a three button limitation it's just plain annoying. Trying to actually get into a car is a challenge in itself, and the physics of steering the car are way too tight -- trying to turn a corner might require you to stop, back up, pull forward, stop, back up, and drive on. Heck, I've even trapped myself to the point where I had to quit the game, simply because I couldn't get my car unstuck from a tight single-lane alley, thanks to the terrible controls. And let's not mention the music. Oh, what the heck, let's. Just imagine the worst sounding melodies possible, then reproduce them on the tinny Game Boy speaker, and you've got a pretty good idea. Thankfully you can turn off the music and just leave the sound -- a welcome addition to the options menu.  And let's not forget about the overall game design. In all honesty I don't find driving back and forth all over town, following an arrow to get to the next checkpoint a lot of fun. It's more work than enjoyment, and I can't say I liked having to trek around town just to reach the waypoint, only to have to go back across town to the next point. Boring.  It's great to see console ports on the Game Boy, especially when the games looks as good as Grand Theft Auto. For what its worth, control problems aside this game looks a hell of a lot like the PlayStation game. And that's the problem -- as close as it is to the original, a bad game is still going to be a bad game in a smaller package. Only buy this game if you liked the original -- otherwise steer clear.", "date": "Nov 30, 1999"}
