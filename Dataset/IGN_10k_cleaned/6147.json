Nobody can really expect the graphics or sound to be much of an asset for a title like this, but at least there could be some decent gameplay modes. Essentially, this game will only appeal to those with an unprecedented degree of patience and who take great pleasure in putting massive gambles on a seemingly endless string of horse races.   That's not to say Breeders' Cup is completely without gameplay modes. The game features Quick Race, A Day at the Races, Challenge a Champion, and Career Mode. Quick Race winds up being fairly useless since it's just a single race. In Breeders' Cup, racing a horse isn't very exciting. You'll press A to jump out of the starting gate as quickly as possible, be able to manipulate your horse's speed during the race, and rotate your viewing angle. In addition, you can move your horse side to side and press A when an icon appears near the end of the race to whip your horse.   Even with these options, controlling your horse is a boring experience, and we found as long as we ran our horse somewhat intelligently, we won. Because controlling your horse is so boring, the Quick Race option where you participate in a single race is pretty pointless. Aside from that, A Day at the Races is a mode where you can gamble on a series of consecutive races at a selected track. While the range of gambling options is impressive, including exacta, trifecta, superfecta, pick 4, 5, and 6, place, and show bets, there's no point in playing this mode either since you can't use the money you win for anything but more gambling. You can, however, compete against a friend in either of these modes, if that appeals to you.   The Challenge a Champion mode might appeal more to fans of the sport. In this mode you can race some famous horses throughout history like Smarty Jones and Silver Charm on any of the game's tracks like Belmont Park and Emerald Downs, among many others. These horse challenges are unlocked through the game's most worthwhile mode, the Career mode.   In Career mode players can race, breed, and train horses, enter them in special cup events, and do a whole bunch of betting. Even with the amount of options available, this mode just isn't any fun. First and foremost, once you pick a sire and a dam to breed a new horse, you can't name it. This I found extremely disappointing since part of the fun in creating your own stable of horses is giving them unique, wacky names. Instead, the game assigns one of its many stock names that consist of two words. You'll often race against horses with two word names that generally consist of an adjective followed by a noun. For instance, Ferocious Miracle, Furious Gambler, Ferocious Thunder, Gracious Fire, Chocolate Machine, Dixie Stallion, Ferocious Miracle and variations thereof are names you'll hear on a regular basis.    Though each horse has its own specific stats and history, betting on other horses is rendered useless in career mode since you can just bet on yourself to win. Once you do win a race, which is incredibly easy if you choose to control your horse, you make a gigantic chunk of cash. In turn, you can then afford to breed the most expensive horses and quickly build up the best stable. At this point, it's only a matter of time before you dominate the entire game.   Though you can pick different jockeys, enter your horse in different training programs to build stats, recover from injuries, and win special cups, this quickly becomes tiresome since your horses will be so good. Also, there's no way to quickly skip to your own race when there are eight other races going on. You have to manually skip through them, which takes an annoying amount of time to get through several screens that show the same horse win animation every time, a bet payout screen, and then a loading screen. Multiply this the amount of times you aren't betting on a race or running a horse, and you'll find there's a good deal of wasted time associated with playing this game. You'll also need to be careful when skipping through to your race since there's no indicator of which race you're actually in. It's entirely possible to completely skip your horse's race, and there's no indicator of which race your horse is in. You have to manually go through the race cards if you're unsure and look for your horse's name.   Nothing about the graphics in Breeders' Cup's is impressive. The horses animate smoothly but without a sense of weight. The puffs of dirt that fly up from the track all look exactly the same for every hoof impact. The stadium textures are bland and you'll see the same animation sequences hundreds of times. Sonically the game is equally unimpressive. Though the game uses clips of Breeders' Cup announcer Tom Durkin to commentate on the action, they're laughably recorded and sound as artificial as a telephonic voice menu system. For instance, you'll hear the phrases ~just in behind him.....behind that~ and ~off to a clumsy start~ almost every race. The total pool of recorded voice clips is extremely small and each clip was included with only one version so you'll hear the same intonation and vocal inflection every single time.   The game is almost entirely devoid of customization options. You'll only be able to manipulate three volume levels and whether the controller vibration is on or not. Before races in some of the game modes you'll be able to alter how many horses you race against, whether it will be sunny or rainy, and whether the race will be short, medium, or long. There are no camera angles to switch between, which is especially bothersome if trying to spectate a race.Unless youre an absolutely massive horse racing fan or an obsessive collector of video games, theres really no reason to pick this title up. Despite a variety of options, the gameplay turns out to be extremely limited since its so easy to make money  and quickly create the best stable possible. Betting on eight or ten races in a row grows stale and theres no way to skip right to the races you want to see or control. There are game modes outside of Career, but they dont provide any sort of lasting play experience. It is, however, only a budget game, but considering you can pick up Xbox Platinum Hits for the same price, this title isnt worth investing any time in.", "date": "Oct 12, 2005"}
