When we weren't clearing balls from the driving range, washing clubs, mumbling ~yes sir~ and ~yes ma'am~ to surly (and rich) club members, and banding together with fellow minimum wage grunties to torment obnoxious junior teen members, we'd be racing each other in the golf carts. It would always be a competition to see who could do the sweetest powerslide around a wet corner, or who could catch the sickest air (4 feet was the record).  And who could, of course, could pull off the coveted 720 spin. And when we weren't getting scolded and threatened by our boss for those activities, we'd try to get an occasional round of golf in  after all, for us, it was free. So while I don't consider myself by any means an authority on golf, I know too well what a golf course looks and feels like. So when I received my copy of Links LS 2000, I was eager to jump right in and relive the glory days. After all, I figured it's safer that I stick to the virtual course.  With my shoddy skills, more than once I nearly clocked an unsuspecting friend with a wild drive. There's an expectation of quality that comes with a Links game, as the Links series has been the dominant force in the golf-sim genre. On top of that, the ever-devouring Microsoft has recently picked up this series. Has the Microsoft name defiled the cherished Links brand? Or have they pulled off another revolution in golf-sims with Links LS 2000? While LS 2000 doesn't include the option to pull off outrageous stunts with a golf cart, it's a very solid and enjoyable golf title.   It's hard to make gameplay improvements to a game like golf. After all, well ... it's golf. That's the strongest thing going for LS 2000.  Because the gameplay doesn't have to be constantly improved and electrified (unlike in a game such as Quake III), the development team can concentrate on making the absolute best simulation of this age-old game. And yes, they've done it. The ball and course physics are probably the best yet seen on a golf-sim.   There are five new courses: St. Andrews Links Old Course, St. Andrews Links New Course, The Jubilee Course, Fuzzy Zoeller's Covered Bridge, and Hawaii's Mauna Kea and Hapuna courses. They're all interesting courses, and it's especially fun to play on the historical St. Andrews Old Course (where the Millenium Open will be held). LS 2000 also supports importing of courses from older versions of Links, which is absolutely necessary for a game like this. LS 2000 has absolutely every conceivable option. Sick of regular stroke play? There are over 30 different modes, ranging from Match and Skin based games, to the newly introduced Wolf mode. Don't want to play on a standard sunny day? LS 2000 allows for a number of course environmental settings, including wind conditions, green conditions, green speed, fog, haze and custom cloud generation. It's also possible to view any given shot from a number of different camera angles, such as putting, side, and profile cams - basically, any camera angle you see when you watch golf on TV.  A small overhead map of the current hole is always in the right hand corner of the screen, and I found this to be an indispensable feature. There are so many options, it becomes a little ridiculous.  Only the most die-hard (or anal) player will want to fiddle around with even half of these options.    Links LS 2000 sticks with the same tried and true shot methods, such as 2-click, 3-click, and Powerstroke, and adds another to the mix that first appeared in Links Extreme: the Easy Swing. Though, I'm going to say right out that the Easy Swing option is totally absurd. More or less, you point where you want the ball to land, and if you hit the ball even half-decently, it'll go almost exactly to the marked point. Finally ... a swing option for my Dad and my little sister. For myself, and for a majority of the gamers out there, the classic 3-click swing is the best option. It takes some skill, but isn't half as challenging (or frustrating) as the Powerstroke method. The Powerstroke swing uses the velocity and accuracy of the mouse to judge where the ball is hit. With all the advanced club angle maneuvering and ball vs. club head placement, it gets a bit dubious, and I wondered if I had mixed up the LS 2000 manual with my math's book chapter on Characteristics of Sinusoidal Functions. So, the game's control varies in complexity from brainless (Easy Swing) to rocket science (Powerstroke). Hey, whatever floats your boat.   While the variable control and vast amount of options are the most visible strong points of LS 2000, the graphics are not. Lately, I've been playing a bit of the more recent first-person shooters (games that have traditionally been on the bleeding edge of graphics), so when I dropped Links LS 2000 in for the first time and fired it up, I felt like I'd entered the game that time forgot. The graphics look straight out of the Build Engine era. Even weighed up against an ancient copy of the original Links that I dug up, Links LS 2000 has changed strikingly little. But, I can hear the complaints now; ~A golf game can't be expected to graphically compare with a first-person shooter like Unreal Tournament!~ I couldn't agree more. But, even with that figured in, there still hasn't been an acceptable amount of improvement here. Sure, there are little things here and there, such as a beautiful sky with alterable cloud settings, nice pond and lake reflections, and even some improvement in the trees and foliage. But, when it gets right down to it, the trees and bushes still look like cardboard cut-outs (and are so pixelated at times that they are nearly indistinguishable), the crowd looks like a series of blocky wax reproductions, and worst of all, the FMV captures of the golfers look like they were cut and pasted on the course. There's a reason most game developers stopped using most FMV in the early nineties - it's expensive, and 9 times out of 10, it ends up looking completely chintzy. The water graphics are also a little bizarre. The ponds don't move, because they're ponds, of course, but the ocean doesn't move at all either. It has waves, but no movement. That's a little eerie. It's just a golf game, sure, but the Links LS 2000 experience would have been much more convincing if there had been a little more attention paid to the graphical side of the title. Because the Links series has always been the genre leader and pioneer, a more innovative approach is expected.   While the graphics may be average, the sound work on Links LS 2000 is superb. On each course, they went to wild measures to ensure the immersiveness of the experience, even recording the actual ambient noises (such as wind, surf breaking on a beach, birds, even airplanes overhead) of each individual course. While you may or may not notice the difference, it's nice to see the time and attention devoted to detail that went into it. CBS golf analyst and commentator David Faherty was hired to do the voice commentary, and he does an excellent job. While Faherty gets a little saucy at times (I've got no game, so after a slew of mocking comments I felt like slugging him), most gamers will find his commentary entertaining and professional. There's no music except for in the intro movie, and that music is a bit laughable, mostly because the song is fierce and intense. Sorry guys, but no matter how extreme you make the music, golf just isn't going to have the exciting appeal of Monday Night Football.   Golf is, after all, a sport of simplicity and incredible skill. That being said, you'll want to display your skill (or, in my case, lack thereof) against your friends, or someone online. The multiplayer side of Links LS 2000 is rock solid and enjoyable, and is where most gamers will eventually turn when they tire of playing the Artificial Intelligence. You can jump online and play almost any way you want and if you're a serious player, you'll find heavy competition on the LS Tour Online. There are always gamers eager to find competition on the Microsoft gaming Zone, and for more private functions, the TCP/IP option is there. As always, the classic trash-talking hotseat game is still an outrageously fun option.   The Links series has always billed itself as providing golf games for real golfers. Links LS 2000 is no exception, and it provides a polished golfing experience for golfers and casual gamers alike. What are my only qualms with Links LS 2000? Simply put: it's the same ol', same ol'. Where's the innovation that made the Links series a force to be reckoned with? A good game is often polished and fun, but the sign of a great game pushes the limits. I don't see this in LS 2000, and that may be a result of the Links series getting a bit too comfortable with its seat at the top. Though, with 6 interesting courses, 2 major-license golf personalities like Arnold Palmer and Fuzzy Zoeller, 12 character models, and more options than I could possibly explain in this review (there wasn't any intricate golf shot or option that I found myself wanting that wasn't there), it's a great round of golf. I was continually surprised how deeply involved I could get and in the few instances that I did outshoot my mortal nemesis  the computer AI, I'd find myself dancing about the room yelling, ~Eat that, Fuzzy! You like my money shot?!~   So maybe Fuzzy Zoeller can spank me at golf. But can he get 4 feet of crazy air in a golf cart?  I don't think so.   -- Erik Peterson", "date": "Dec 14, 1999"}
