Some unwritten rule says that your 89-year old grandmother must be able to learn the basics of a game within ten minutes, but that there should be enough depth there to keep her coming back for the last six months of her wheezy life. The new mantra of game development is 'pick up and play'.    Sadly, unless the developer is incredibly talented, accessibility is a bad thing for those who take their games seriously. It usually leads to a shallow game that hardcore gamers can master and beat in a matter of hours. There's no challenge, and as a result there's little satisfaction.    Turn 10 tried to make Forza 2 accessible. It stated time and time again that Forza 2 was a game for both novices and hardcore drivers alike.   And, thank god, it failed miserably.    I don't like being the bearer of bad news, but Turn 10 is probably not going to strike the casual gaming pot of gold at the end of the Burnout rainbow. The reality is that this is a hardcore driving simulation. Thankfully, there's plenty of bullion to be had at the other end of the racing spectrum - just ask Gran Turismo's creator, Kazunori Yamauchi.      To ease novice drivers into the world of Forza 2, the developer has enabled a stack of driving aids. ABS, TC, SC - each abbreviation makes the cars that little bit easier to control. They also chip away at one of the most integral elements of Forza 2 - the sensation that you're driving a real car.    But where the game fails most as an accessible, casual racer is the way it looks. Sure, the cars are spectacular. Just don't expect to drive them on mountain tracks that wind through waterfalls, while TV helicopters swoop above the track and yachts bob up and down in the trackside lake. In some ways Forza 2's graphics are purely functional. To a simulation fan like myself, they're absolutely gorgeous due to the fact that it all looks so damn real, but to somebody who earned their spoilers thrashing through the streets of Midnight Club or drifting around the hairpins of Ridge Racer, it's all rather plain.   And as soon as a novice gamer hits the telemetry and tuning sections, the sheer terror of being confronted by seventeen billion different widgets and dongles, that have absolutely no meaning to them, will cause said gamer's brain to implode in confusion.    But to be honest, as a god-fearing simulation lover, I don't give a toss about these casual players. Forza 2 is a game for me, not them. And I love it.   I love the incredibly deep career mode, especially the way that I have to start out with a relatively shabby car, one that struggles to hit 60km/h without a tailwind and has all the bling of a garbage man. Because, as I earn credits, that old crap-box suddenly turns into a shiny, sexy, street-sleeper that could put a Ferrari 430 to shame. The devs mentioned that there is an almost Pokemon-esque aspect to the game - collect 'em all - and they're dead right. You will want to unlock, win and purchase them just to see how hot they look on the track. But on the flipside, while the drive to collect as many cars as possible is very strong, of the 300 cars in the game, you'll only have an intimate and personal attachment to the handful that get you through the career mode. You'll spend hours lovingly stroking these chosen few, increasing their power output via the gentle placement of hundreds of different (and licensed) component upgrades. You'll ooh and ahh at the sexy new spoiler kit you've just installed, or the way your new shocks bring it even closer to the ground. I've had moist dreams about my first car, a beautiful little Supra Twin Turbo which, after I'd spent enough cash to feed a small nation, now has more horse-power than the Space Shuttle.     I can't rely on Tracy (that's her name) for all my races though, as the career mode is too smart for that. Most of the races have certain limitations on the cars that you can race. One race might be constrained to Porsches only, another could have a power ceiling of 150kW, and another might only accept all-wheel drives. Just as you think you're going to run out of cash, limiting which cars you can buy and thus which races you can enter, you'll complete another set of races and be awarded a new car, unlocking a new set of races. Handy.   While the range of tracks isn't enormous, with twelve environments housing a total of forty five tracks, the variety in the types of races keeps each event feeling very different to the last, even if you're running on the same exact track as the last event. There are literally hundreds of events, so it's going to take more time to complete the game than is healthy for your real-life relationships. And once you've done them in singleplayer, why not try them all again, but this time online? Forza 2 allows you to take the entire career mode online. But more about the online game later   For now, let's cut to the chase. While I could rant on and on for days about this game (it's that big), there's one core aspect that makes Forza 2 the lovingly crafted simulation that it is, and that raises it up above other racing titles. And I can sum it up in one word.    Physics. Handling. The sensation of driving a real car.    Okay, so that's more than one word, but they all kind of mean the same thing. By now you've already read that the physics engine runs at 360 frames per second, and that it keeps track of more variables than exist in a thermonuclear detonation simulation. But it's only when you wrap your clammy mitts around the 360's wireless steering wheel (and you will buy the wheel for this game - it's the only way to play) that this technobabble finally means something. You'll soon realise how incredibly hard it is to keep these rockets on wheels flat on the ground, and why an all-wheel drive is so much grippier than a rear-wheel drive spin-freak. Every bump, every crack in the road, every change in surface type, will feel unlike anything you've felt in a racing game. In short, it's amazing.    Combined with some excellent force feedback and audio effects, the crucial art of applying your car's power without losing traction will soon prove incredibly important (unless you're one of those tire-shredding drift freaks - which the engine handles perfectly as well). You'll hear the tires start to softly whine as the steering almost imperceptibly starts to loosen up, and you'll know that you'd better ease off the accelerator or straighten up. Compared to arcade racers, mastering the handling of these cars, keeping them on the fine line between spinning out and delivering maximum acceleration, requires the concentration of a brain surgeon.     If you'd like to kill this amazing driving experience, feel free to switch all the driving aids on, and watch your car's handling turn into that uninspired kid at school that everybody got bored with. Having said that, I'm still driving with ABS, as I feel it's the most legitimate driving aid in a racing situation, and I've also got a terrible habit of punching my brake pedal through the floor when I see an upcoming wall approaching. Note to self - pump the brake, pump the brake.    The mind-boggling complexity of the physics system becomes even more apparent when you enable telemetry in the post-race replay. To be honest, I have absolutely no idea what most of it means. Likewise with the incredibly deep tuning options - it's going to take months (and a good IGN game guide or two) to figure this stuff out.    I mentioned before that some folks mightn't be too impressed by the visuals. To these people I say you don't deserve your eyesight, and may eyeball cancer strike you down. Running at a glorious 60 frames per second, the sense of speed is impeccable. And while the tracks are all a little plain, the fact is that most real world race tracks don't look like theme parks or scenic drives through the mountains. You'll be so busy focusing on that next apex it's easy to miss the fact that while the scenery is a little drab, it's still quite detailed.      And the cars. Oh the cars. This is car porn at its finest. Barring a small amount of jaggies around the roof lines, they're beautiful beasts. From the callipers gripping the disc brakes to the way the wheels realistically bounce across the ripple strip, they're a sight to behold. Using the decal editor, which can layer hundreds of decals on top of each other, and which is deserving of its very own review (9/10!), you'll spend hours making these exotic beasts even more attractive. You can then share these designs via the auction house, gifting entire cars to friends, or show off your livery via the comprehensive photo mode. You can even take a photo in-game and then upload it to the official Forza website. We highly recommend a peek at this site, to see a great example of integrating game information into an online portal.    Speaking of the auction house, those who take the time to build artistic creations can make a lot of virtual money via this feature. It'll be interesting to see if external companies get peed off with copyright concerns, as most of the top-priced vehicles use existing logos or artwork.    Balancing out the fine visuals is a great audio engine. The roar of your engine changes depending on what you kit it out with, and most cars have their own distinctive sound. Crashing into anything more solid than a small child unleashes a bone-shattering crunch that will have you wincing, while the game's soundtrack is a brilliant electro-heavy mix. Pity that it can't be played in-game - the music is strictly for the menus, which is a shame if you like that kind of thing.   If there's one feature that's a little disappointing, it's the much touted damage modelling. It's nice to be able to break a fender off or shatter a window, but I want cars rolling and spinning, damn it! No matter how hard I drove into oncoming traffic, the cars simply will not flip, instead pancaking through the air like some kind of anti-grav UFO. And the damage seems a little under-modelled - crashes that should total the car leave it with superficial damage. Considering DiRT does full-on crashes with licensed cars, yet the manufacturers don't seem to have a problem with it, I'm not sure why Forza 2 couldn't do the same.      The AI in most driving games is about as intelligent as your garden-variety baboon, but Forza 2 has nailed a realistic feel in its AI system. They're generally aggressive without being crazy, and tend to get a little angrier if you start ramming into them. Having said that, at times they seemed a little passive, but I'm still in the early parts of my career.    If a few hundred hours of single player isn't enough for you, the online functionality of Forza 2 should keep you going until the Sun swallows the Earth. Seriously, this is the new benchmark for online racers. Eight player racing is supported, with very good network code leading to minimal lag. Tournaments can be run for organised leagues, and the auction house lets you see what the most creative minds in the world can do with a can of paint and a $400,000 Lambo. If you'd like to see how the pros race, fire up Forza TV and watch live races from the comfort of your couch. And as mentioned previously, the career mode can be played online as well. Your broadband connection is going to be sore for days after you first try Forza 2 online.  I've already said so much about Forza 2, yet in many regards I'm barely skimming the surface. This is the deepest, most all encompassing driving simulator on the market. Turn 10 absolutely adores the sport of motor racing and car tuning, and every ounce of this love has been wrung into Forza 2. It's a daunting game for novices, but one that demands every racer's attention. The old saying of ~The more you put into something, the more you'll get out of it~ has never been truer. Put the time into Forza 2 to learn how to drive it well, tweak it well and customise it well, and you'll be rewarded with more satisfaction than a game should be able to provide.", "date": "Jun 14, 2007"}
