{"name": "Double Dragon Advance", "name_review": "Double Dragon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/11/double-dragon", "text": "will always be remembered as the game that really popularized the brawler genre. Not a mindless beat-em-up comes out nowadays without someone making a quick reference to the classic Technos Double Dragon arcade game. Earlier this year, Atlus smartly scooped up Double Dragon for a Game Boy Advance release, and we're sure there were cries of joy heard all throughout the handheld community. The game produced for the GBA actually sticks pretty closely to the classic Double Dragon formula, while injecting subtle additions to update the aging action. The GBA game is a great Double Dragon experience that shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves the series, since the action really does still kick ass. But it can be completed in a single sitting, and there's not much added to the design to encourage replay once the game's been mastered. Features Two characters Arcade and survival mode Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridges)  The name Double Dragon refers to the pair of brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee. Like in the original arcade game, the game opens up with some chick named Marian getting kidnapped by a ruthless gang...eventually players learn that she's been taken by The Shadow Warriors. In the arcade game rescuing Marian was just a goal to reach for. It's the same in the GBA, though the update features incredibly well-drawn cutscenes that unfold a basic storyline about trading a mysterious secret book of Sou-Setsu-Ken for Marian's life. Regardless of why you're going, the goal is the same: to rescue Marian and kick some butt along the way.  As Billy Lee (or for the second player, Jimmy Lee), players simply move through the streets, warehouses, and other innercity locations fending for dear life as they're assaulted on all sides by thugs of various shapes, sizes, and sexes. The task is simple: stay alive and play exterminator by kicking everyone's ass. Kick and punch these guys (or gals) until they stand no more, then repeat if they get up. It's really just that simple. Double Dragon can be played either solo or with a friend via the link cable and a second copy of the cartridge. The game doesn't change a whole bunch between the single player or two player experience, it's just cool to share the action with a second person  to make the action more intense and gratifying.  The GBA game looks, sounds and plays like the classic Double Dragon, but honestly the game wouldn't score very highly if that's all it was. As good as the original arcade game was back in 1987, the design is extremely dated, which is why it's definitely cool to see additions and fixes made to the franchise. For example, the controls have been completely tweaked to make the kicks and punches far more responsive and satisfying then they have been, though there's still this odd residue of lag still around in the game where players can't quickly change direction while in a series of punches. The collision detection has also been given a shot in the arm, and enemies seem to a have a lot more weight to the way they hit the ground after a brutal combo. Some combos can even be converted into a juggle like in more current brawlers, but these are few and far between.  With the updated controls comes brand new moves that definitely add to the Double Dragon experience. The classic game always gave players the ability to pull off special moves like a jump kick, or a backwards elbow with button combination, or a headbutt by double-tapping the joystick. The double-tap is now mapped to give players a running start, which can then be converted into a specific thrust kick or punch. In addition, if an enemies on the ground, players can actually mount them to land additional punches to the face to eliminate them much more quickly, which gives players the ability to rid these bad guys before they can get up to dish a lot more damage. And the new moves aren't limited to hand-to-hand, either; there are new weapons in the mix, including kali sticks, maces, and an axe to accommodate the familiar whip, bat, and knife.  The graphics are obviously based upon the sprites and backgrounds of the original arcade game, but they've been completely redrawn for the Game Boy Advance version. If you've ever played through any of the umpteen arcade ports, you'll definitely recognize many of the locations and thugs from brawlers' past, as well as a few new ones. There are new, well-dressed thugs that look like agents ripped out of the Matrix...complete with adjusting their tie after knocking you on your backside. The soundtrack has also been retained, but it's been given a lot more life thanks to the bump in audio quality that the GBA can handle.  Along with the ability to play by yourself or with a friend via link, there's a unique one-player mode where players control both Billy and Jimmy by swapping the controls on each of the characters. It's interesting, but it just doesn't work. It only makes us wish someone would figure out how to enable two player support via two controllers on the Game Boy Player, since, like the existing Double Dragon design, players can't split up in a level anyway.  Unfortunately, another element has been retained in the translation: game length. Double Dragon has always been a finite game design, meant to be played and finished with a few quarters in a single session. The move to Game Boy Advance doesn't change this fact, though the GBA developers limit the amount of times players can continue to make it nearly impossible to beat the first or second time around. But once you learn the enemy patterns and the moves given to Billy or Jimmy Lee, it's absolutely possible (more like probable) that you'll be completely done with the game's challenge in an afternoon. And there's nothing here to encourage replay once the end is reached, apart from a Survival Mode; the cartridge doesn't have any save RAM on it, which means any high score you earn will be lost the second the system's power is cut.  I've always been a fan of the Double Dragon original game, and several of the sequels (Battletoads vs. Double Dragon rocked), and have owned home versions of the classic arcade title on the NES, Atari 7800, and even on the Atari Lynx. It's great that the game retains an old-school feel in an updated version on the Game Boy Advance, and as excellent fun as this brawler is on the GBA...it's over before it gets going. And it's not because I'm experienced in the ways of Double Dragon, either, since there's a lot of new gameplay elements that require trial and error to figure out. You'll get your butt thrashed the first or second time through, but it'll only take another one or two times to get to the end. After that, well...there's not much else to it. It's great while it lasts, though.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
