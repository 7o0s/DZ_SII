Wethinks we spoke to soon, because we just spent a good chunk of time with JAMDAT's second ~Lord of the Rings~ game, Lord of the Rings Pinball, and despite the presence of Gandalf, this is no pinball wizard.  Features:  Multiple boards Inexplicable ball physics Renders of your fave Fellowship folk  Video game pinball is probably one of the easiest genres to attempt, as well as being one of the absolute easiest to screw up. Two words: ball physics. If you don't have those nailed, there's really no point in slapping bells, whistles, renders, or whatever else on the screen. And Lord of the Rings Pinball certainly tries to distract with some eye-catching features, but do not be fooled, my friends.  You really don't have any control over the ball. It's a weird crapshoot of sorts. Not only are the flippers slow (with their impressive two frames of animation), but there just never seems to be good sweet spot for sending the ball where you want it. You know how after you spend time with a stand-up pinball machine (or a really good GBA pinballer, like Pinball of the Dead), you begin to identify exact moments when to hit the ball and send it up the ramp or into a hole? Not so here.  For example, to access the second board of the table -- where Gollum tries to prevent you from dropping the ring (read: ball) into Mount Doom -- you must sneak Frodo, Sam, and the One Ring past Sauron's watchful eye. To do this, you have to hit a little bumper off to the side. Enjoy your frustration here. And once you finally do nail the bumper three times, you need to scoot the ball up a ramp and then pop it into a hole on the opposite side of the board. Sure, this would take skill on a regular machine -- but in Lord of the Rings Pinball it takes Herculean patience and something of a miracle.  To be sure, the game does look nice. The color palette is drawn straight from the ~Return of the King~ posters hanging in your local multiplex: gold, brown, orange -- earthy tones. The character renders are pretty good. When you're trying to sneak the hobbits past Sauron's eye, which hangs ominously in the upper left corner, pics of Sam and Frodo appear front and center on the board. Many of the table's features, though, like the plunger, ball, and bumpers are plain-jane and stick out like a sore thumb.  Oh, and while the movie may have a soaring score -- expect nothing but an ugly couple of cursory beeps from Lord of the Rings Pinball. Wow, what a titanic disappointment Lord of the Rings Pinball is -- not only because it wastes an incredible, rich license, but because I was really hoping to finally get a good pinballer for my handsets. The screenshot to the right looks quite promising, but trust me, within fifteen minutes you'll want to cast this one into the fires of Mount Doom. It stinks worse than Gollum's breath.", "date": "Dec 28, 2003"}
