Not that there weren't already enough. Or that Sony ever hid its desire to approve the umpteenth Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, or Twisted Metal. But Trip Hawkins' 3DO isn't waiting around either. Army Men: Sarge's Heroes is the third of the series to hit the system in less than two years (with AM: 3D and AM: Air Attack preceding it), and Army Men World War already on its way.  So the series continues. Where AM: 3D left off, Sarge's Heroes picks up the story and deals with some of the problems of the first, but also brings a whole new meaning to the word ~unfinished.~ At its core, Sarge's Heroes is a decent action title with some good ideas. But each one of them is buried in horrible control, unpolished game mechanics, and terrible graphics.   Gameplay Sarge's Heroes actually has a hero, and a story, this time around. While Sarge was in the first PS game (AM: 3D) he's now a prominent personality, who figures much heavier into the game's humor and storyline via rendered movies and in-game cut-scenes. Trip Hawkins wanted Army Men to be 3DO's version of Mario, and so he needed a loveable platform character, and it looks like Sarge is it...or hopes to be it.   Does Sarge deliver? In ideas, yes. In actuality, no. You play Sergeant Hawk (Sarge), who must fend off the overpowering and evil Tan army, commanded by General Plasto, who invades the Tan base, steals its five leading commandos, and threatens to take control of secret portals that lead to new worlds.   Players must work their way through dozens of campaign levels, with a good variation of objectives, to find each commando, locate the blue spies, locate portals, but all to ultimately destroy the Tan army. As in every AM game, these army men pose in all of the classic poses, but this time around, a few new animations have been added. Among them, Sarge can jump and climb boxes, and can side step and strafe. New automatic targeting assists greatly in straight battles, as do a load of new weapons and gadgets, including a sniper rifle, binoculars, and the ability to drive tanks, which is a lot of fun.   But when it comes to control, Army Men Sarge's Heroes may actually be worse than its predecessor. While the soldiers control with the same basic abilities, careful control and precise movement is utterly non-existent. I mean, the control sucks. If you find yourself attacked by a few Tan soldiers and you're up in a crate, there is no animation to back up off it. You can't do it. Instead, you must turn your back to the enemy, and walk of jump off. Nice strategy, Sarge.   That's just one example. There are countless more. Laying down mines is another terrible experience. With the collision detection of a flea, each mine is basically worthless on its own. You must lay down about four to five mines just have a chance to blow up one tank. I just gave up after specifically trying to blow up tanks for about 45 minutes. It was a fruitless exercise.   Close up fights are worthless. Get up close to an enemy and you'll have a 50-50 chance of hitting him directly. Walk close to a 6-foot cliff and watch as you jump off into a shallow stream, and die. That's right. The water is instant cyanide. Kills you in a second. Like I said, the control is as good as the Titanic's turning radius, after it hit the iceberg.   Enemy AI varies wildly, too. In some cases you can walk straight up to an enemy and shoot him in the face, and he either, A) won't die, or B) never saw you there, one foot in front of hid face. Likewise, you can approach some enemies from behind and they WILL notice you, while other times, you can plug them with several bullets from behind and they WON'T react at all.   But the big tragedy here is that after I passed the first level -- and believe me, I didn't want to play this game -- I wanted to play more. The game ideas are fun and the game is compelling. The new sniper rifle is fun (but not surprisingly, any kind of precise control is crappy), driving tanks is a kick, and finding secret ammo areas was rewarding. I stayed up really late a few nights in a row intermittently loving and hating this game. But I ended up hating it more than loving it because the game doesn't reward you for gaining the necessary skills to play it. Instead, the errant sloppiness punishes you in every single level.  The control problems carry over into multiplayer, too, so while the one-on-one play is potentially fun, you're not likely to play it that much, since the control beats you up as much or more than your opponent.   Graphics Sarge's Heroes has more flair and color than AM: 3D. The palettes are more vibrant, thankfully, and have replaced the barren browns, beige, and dull greens of the first. The CG movies that follow each level are long and decently composed, and do add a good amount of interest to the characters. And the different terrain helps to keep the repetition down. I especially like the switch from Their World (the little plastic world of the Army Men themselves) to Our World (real living people's world, in which the Army Men look like the tiny little plastic toys they are). The conceptual difference is intriguing, and plays a big part in the attractiveness of the game. The first Army Men really needed more variation and this game delivers it.  But overall, Sarge's Heroes doesn't look like a fifth year product. There is no pushing of the technological envelope in any way. It could easily get lost among the second to third wave games (from '97 or '98), which in some cases look way better than this. The Army Men themselves appear strangely fluid (like they're melting, and uninjured) when moving, which in itself isn't a problem, but they look like they're in the wrong game. Like test characters, contrasting sharply with their backgrounds, or like bad blue-screen movie scenes. The visual difference is very hard to ignore. Coupled with a good sampling of glitchy camera angles and dirty movie clips that often start and stop a few times, showing your character sitting there, and then the movie appearing, then the character, then the movie, shows that this game was either A) poorly tested, B) poorly programmed, C) Rushed (which can't be the case, because the game was delayed), or D) All the above. My choice is A, B, and C.  Sound Sound...Hmmm...The game has it, and all of the characters display generally funny lines, but the music, just like the graphics, suffer from terrible production problems. When you reach a secret area, the music changes dynamically, filling you with rewarding, triumphant tunes. But the music does that every time you walk past a trigger point, So even after you have cleaned the area of weapons, the music still transitions from default to triumphant. That shouldn't happen after the first time. It's just sloppy. But at least Sarge's Heroes isn't packed with the same brutal taps themes that deflated the first one. It least the music is different, and didn't get in the way of the game.The thing about Army Men is that regardless of what the gaming press says about it, the product is almost entirely aimed at the masses. Army Men is a mainstream product, aimed at casual gamers, and its appeal is strictly based on gamers who played with Army Men when they were kids. So, if you haven't ever played a game before, or no more than two, you won't know how much this game has going against it. Then again, when you put this up against almost any recent game, the graphics just don't cut it. Even new games will notice. It's like comparing Morgan Fairchild with Tyra Banks. But like I said, the game contains great ideas, it's just that all of them are poorly executed, from the control to the graphics to the sound. Apparently, 3DO isn't paying its programmers enough. If it were, this series could take off the way Hawkins envisioned it, both financially and critically.", "date": "Mar 9, 2000"}
