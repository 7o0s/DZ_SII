On the Game Boy Color, we were spared the rehash since developer Neon designed Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. as a stand-alone action title. The game is well put together, but its somewhat sloppy interface is a bit of a bummer for an otherwise well put together Game Boy Color game. Features Six levels Five weapons Seven different types of enemies Password save Only for Game Boy Color    It's obvious the whole ~Armorines~ idea was inspired by Aliens and Starship Troopers -- but personal commentary aside about the Armorines license, the game itself is reminiscent of the arcade games Gauntlet and Alien Storm (which was an alien version of Gauntlet from Sega). You're a lone Armorine crashlanded on Venus, and the planet's infested by these little alien bugs set out to overrun the human-inhabited planet (it's the future, you see). You set out to figure out how to get rid the planet from these icky bug-like aliens before they kill off the civilization.  You're equipped with a lighting zapper-style weapon at the very beginning of the game, ample power to get to your first destination, the scientist who will activate the spare ship so you can get on with your mission. You make your way through the level in an semi-overhead perspective, and the only skill you have is shoot. Both the A and B buttons have been mapped as your fire button -- one allows you to rotate in all eight directions while you fire, the other fixes your position and fires in one direction when active. This allows you to strafe while firing, much like a first-person shooter would.  The game has its tiny puzzles, but it's a true action game to the core. The only real puzzle elements are finding the next checkpoints that activate the next part of a level. The problem is, there's not enough buttons to go around -- when you reach a dialogue portion of the game, the B button (one of your fire buttons) skips the entire conversation, sometimes making you miss the clue to your next waypoint. The other problem, is with all the weapons you can pick up, you're stuck with the weapon you have until you find another power-up -- you cannot switch between weapons during the game. If anything, Armorines is one of those games that screams ~co-op mode.~ This would have been a great game to feature a link-up mode between two systems, having two players go through the levels at the same time. But that's a minor complaint. The game has some great artwork, really strutting the ~Game Boy Color-exclusive~ development with vibrant images. The action gets a little tedious after an hour or so, but you can always pause the game to get the latest password to continue later. Armorines is a decent, minorly flawed, Game Boy Color game that's definitely worth a look.", "date": "Dec 23, 1999"}
