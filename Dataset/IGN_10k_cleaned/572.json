{"name": "Test Drive 6", "name_review": "Test Drive 6", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/22/test-drive-6", "text": "always seemed like a fun premise. Race fast, ridiculously expensive hot rods and experimental cars through long winded tracks, trying to keep ahead of the opposing 'rods all the while keeping an eye out for the coppers. It's a good formula, as it plays off that little spark of rebellion and free-spirited, ~run with the stallions~ energy that exists in even the most committed of desk jockies. Most of us jump at the opportunity to let down our hair, toss out our pocket protectors and ultimately let our devious little inner children out to play -- Test Drive 6, at a glance, seems like the perfect outlet for this sort of delinquentism. Unfortunately, the game isn't worth your time, much less the loss of a good pocket protector.  I know, I know. There are probably a number of die hard Test Drive fans who just inhaled their retainers. Sorry about that, but it really is true. While a classic and seemingly bulletproof premise such as this is hard to screw up, you'd be surprised. The astoundingly short-sighted gameplay is out-shined only by the horrific, sub-N64 graphics engine. We're not sure what went wrong, or where it did, but it definitely occurred, as Test Drive 6 rivals even Slave Zero in terms of shoddy visuals, and that's no small feat considering the earlier Infogrames title was collectively synonymized with ~just plain bad~ right off the bat.  The game kicks off with a marginally interesting FMV music video sequence, but goes quickly downhill after that. The game's engine goes far beyond mediocrity, as your first thoughts upon being pitted on the race track will be ~this is Dreamcast?~. With a ram upgrade in hand, the N64 wouldn't be hard pressed to deliver the same level of visual clarity. Glazed over, blocky courses seem to be the order of the day, with a side of low-poly car models for dessert. Sure, they've included plenty of very cool cars in the game, but they may as well not have bothered -- The cars lack any detail or artistic license, not to mention they all control about the same. Not that TD6 is anything to be proud of standing still, but the awful framerate is the real nail in the coffin. With only 5 racers (plus a few NPCs) to track and no real visual load, during play we have to ask the air around us why the framerate suffers like it does -- But the real question seems to be just who was snoozing at the wheel over at PitBull. The game just looks plain bad. If it were in a store display, it would undoubtedly turn away the heartiest of Dreamcast hopefuls.  The game controls somewhat similar to Cruis'n' USA. I.E., it feels absolutely nothing like you're driving a car. Your car almost seems to slide around the track, with no real consequence to collisions -- sort of like driving a bumper car. The wheels don't seem to have any connection with the road, and you feel like you're merely drifting around. This off-the-wall feel may be appealing to some, but without the extreme physics of something like San Francisco Rush, you're stuck between two play styles, sporting the best of neither. Overall, the feel of the game matches up nicely with the visual arena: Sloppy, undefined, and just plain bad.  There are two primary modes of play in Test Drive 6: Practice and Championship. There isn't a whole lot of actual difference between the Championship and Practice modes in terms of variety, and, because there is no real character or personality behind any aspect of the game, most players won't feel very compelled to actively compete in the Championship mode. You place your bets, you race your races, and you buy cars and upgrades. That's about the extent of it. The game's decidedly unrewarding premise does little to make you want to finish the game, or even come back to play it again.  The game features some rock tunes from Cars, Gary Numan, Fear Factory, Eve 6 and some others, but rather than acting as a supplement to good gameplay, the addition of some well known artists in the sound scheme seems more like a hasty afterthought. To tell the truth, most of the music is very forgettable filler, mostly just a lot of blazing guitar rifs and fast beats that can be found in any hardcore wannabe game.  Overall, Test Drive 6 only escapes ~completely forgettable~ because it left such a bad taste in my mouth. Take shoddy visuals, uneventful gameplay, and poorly schemed car physics and you've got one truly unrewarding experience on your hands. I was just starting to get over the gruesome play experience of Slave Zero when I was hit with this one -- Infogrames needs to hire some quality control if they care one iota about their track record. I don't think their Dreamcast reputation can afford another stinker after this.  -- Matt White, Traffic School Drop-out", "date": "Dec 22, 1999"}
