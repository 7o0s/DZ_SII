Falcom's classic action-RPG has been a major hit across almost every single platform in Japan, with plenty of sequels and spin-offs to keep hard-core fans happy for years. Despite its popularity in the Nippon, there's not much of a fan-base in the USA (though Sierra translated the PC version of Sorcerian for American audiences). Now, the original developers at Nihon Falcom are back in biz, teaming up with Victor Interactive to release a 128-bit version of the classic.  Harkening back to the 8-bit days of yore, Sorcerian is a side-scrolling, party-based action-RPG. You start out in the Adventurer's Guild, and assemble a four-member group (or just use the default band of adventurers). There are only four classes to choose from at the get-go: Fighter, Wizard, Dwarf, or Elf, so selection shouldn't be too difficult. From there, you choose one of three initial scenarios (from a total of fifteen), and head out on a typical mission of holy redemption.  The majority of Sorcerian is played from a side-scrolling perspective  even though the characters and backgrounds are built out of polygons, the gameplay is strictly locked into two dimensions. The controls are simple: the analog pad moves you around, and there's a button for melee attacks, magic attacks, and jumping. Character movement is strictly a matter of monkey see, monkey do: you're always in control of the leader, and the rest of the group precisely mimics your actions (watching all four of you jump at once is always amusing).  The real-time combat basically amounts to ~mash buttons real fast,~ and enemies frequently burrow underground and pop up in the midst of your party. Whether or not all your characters are facing an enemy doesn't matter  as long as they're within range, their melee attacks should connect.  Magic points quickly regenerate, and character level-ups occur after an area's been cleared of baddies. Whatever you do, don't try to run into boss characters  they'll peel off your hit points before you even realize you're dead.  A few of the sequences offer full 3D exploration through towns, helping out with the game's narrative. You can interview townspeople for information, though most of it consists of stuff like ~The evil Warlord Bob kicked our town's ass! Will you stop him?~ Sadly, the camera is pretty fiddly in these sequences  while checking out the first scenario, my viewpoint kept getting wedged in background polygons. Some polish would have been nice, guys.  Though the Final Fantasy games managed to age gracefully, the Sorcerian series has gotten a bit ornery in its golden years  it's kinda like your Great-Uncle Ralph and that weird flicking thing he always does with his tongue. Despite the technical upgrade with all the polygonal hoo-hah, Sorcerian is still stuck in the Super Famicom age  the combat, magic system, and character management are a mite over-simplistic. If you still groove on this gameplay style, by all means, import away  but there are much better action-RPGs out there (and most of them are on other systems. Sigh).  The lack of a gameplay tune-up is accompanied by unimpressive visuals. Despite the inclusion of the classic, babbling Sorcerian intro text, the opening CG movie looks like a bad student demo reel. The in-game content isn't much better  the munchkin-like characters I can deal with (hell, they're a staple of any Japanese RPG), but the low-poly environments and N64-style texturing don't do much for me. I just about gagged the first time I saw a dragon  the typically imposing, scaly adversaries have been reduced to dorky-looking beasties that walk like they don't wipe. Groan. I managed to dig up an old Sega Genesis copy of Sorcerian, and the usage of color was infinitely better in comparison to the Dreamcast version  despite the lack of polygon-pushing power. Chalk it up to superior art direction.  I may be going deaf, but the music sounded better coming through the 16-bit Genny, too. The game comes in a 2-CD set (folks who pre-ordered also receive a VMU carrying case), which includes a music CD of 47 Sorcerian songs. It's composed well, but spoiled by cheese-o synthesizer samples  I guess full orchestration was out of this game's budget range.  I feel really bad about ragging on Sorcerian, because I had a ton of fun playing the PC version as a kid. But as a child, my mind was full of childish things; now that I am a man, I... uh... play video games for a living. Never mind. The fact of the matter is that the Dreamcast version of Sorcerian doesn't do the series much justice, and offers little more than a low-poly facelift in the day of high-budget upgrades like Dragon Quest VII and Phantasy Star Online. Sorcerian zealots need only apply. -- Colin ~OLD ELF~ Williamson, IGN", "date": "May 3, 2000"}
