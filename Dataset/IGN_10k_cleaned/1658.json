Reviewers called it the best pool and snooker simulator on the market and just about all of them raved about its excellent ball physics and special attention to the game's overall presentation and atmosphere. While the PC version of game might in fact deserve all of the adoration that was given to it, the same cannot be said about the PlayStation port of the game that has been released by BAM Entertainment.   Gameplay  When you start up the game, you can instantly see the special attention to the game's atmosphere that the European press were so fond of in the PC version of the game. However, players will quickly find that while the atmosphere of the game has made the move to the PlayStation well, the same can't be said about the rest of the game. The general look and feel of the game makes us think that there wasn't any time or effort put into porting the game to the PlayStation.   First off, the game's font, which might have worked fine on a PC monitor in high-resolution, just doesn't work well on a television screen and looks quite ugly. And what's worse is that the game's icons, which look great in the PC game, look like complete crap here on the PlayStation. The reason that this is so important is that the game relies on these icons are used in playing the game and it's hard to tell what each represents. And if it weren't for the text cues, it might be completely impossible to tell what's being done.   The way that these icons are used is another one of the game's biggest problems. It just feels like it was designed for a PC where users would be using a mouse and keyboard and not a controller -- and it was. There are just too many different steps required to just setup a shot and the game is just more tedious than it is good.   The vaunted pool physics also seem to have lost something in the move to the PlayStation, as well. In many shots where it seems that more balls should move and be affected by the cue ball, only a few will move around the table. It sometimes appears that the game can only handle the movement of three or four balls at a time at the most. Another major problem with the game is that it's very difficult to setup accurate shots because the increments of left and right movements are a bit too large and it's hard to make a small and precise change with the angle of the shot.   Not all is bad, though, as the game features some cool little extras and is loaded with different ways to play the game. While the extra modes and customizable features might be lost by the fact that the pool interface is all shot, this doesn't affect any of the mini-games that are featured here. In addition to playing pool and snooker, players will be able to play an arcade port of Dropzone, plus a game of chess, snookers, darts, and more. None of the games are great, but they're all better than the pool game.   Graphics  The balls, the tables and backgrounds aren't too bad in comparison to other pool games on the system, but the game loses a lot in this area because of the poor fonts and butt-ugly icons. There are not any framerate problems, the textures are all passable and the balls are about as round as they'll get this side of a system more powerful than PlayStation.   Sound  The music in the game gets quite grating rather quickly and there's nothing at all that's really good to listen to. The sound effects are decent enough, as the cracks and smacks all sound pretty authentic to real-life pool, but nothing extra or really fascinating.  It might have been a good PC game, but Jimmy White's 2: Cueball lost a lot in its transition to the PlayStation. Due in large to the fact that its icons, text and interface just doesn't seem fit for a console, the pool and snooker games are just about unplayable. The game's only saving grace is that it's extras, which include an arcade port of Dropzone, checkers and darts, that might make it worth plunking down the $9.99 to get this game. However, even at that price, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you must play Dropzone on your PlayStation or you have some sort of sick and twisted crush on Mr. Jimmy White.", "date": "Dec 19, 2000"}
