Many of us dust off our copies of Shenmue every week.  Many of us are scouring web auction sites for a rare sealed copy of Radiant Silvergun.  And some of us are still hugging their copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga to sleep every night (Ed's Note: Ask Vincent over at IGNXbox... he does).  But to the millions of Dreamcast fans out there, football has become something very sacred; every since the resurrection of the Sega Sports series thanks to Visual Concepts, we have been introduced to a video game series that rivals the might of the respected Madden series.  We were introduced to a different style of gridiron, from the visuals and overall gameplay experience.  Through the past two NFL 2K's, we've seen so much innovation to the play mechanics, animations, and of course, online play, we expect a lot - some of us say, the best - with the last Dreamcast football game, NFL 2K2.  If this was a perfect video game world, it would altogether right and proper that the last NFL 2K game on the Dreamcast would be the pinnacle of pigskin war.  But let's face it... if this were a perfect video game world, SEGA would never have to abandon the hardware business.  If such a world existed, we would never have to see a great company like Visual Concepts spread themselves out on multiple platforms to go head-to-head as the challenger in the video game sports arena.  Personally, if we lived in this imaginary world, Virtua Fighter 4 would never be seen on a non-SEGA system (yes, the wound still hurts).  Those expecting NFL 2K2 to be the greatest football game ever will be letdown; NFL 2K2 is far from perfect.  Although it lacks some polish, NFL 2K2 is still one damn fun football game and, with the several improvements they've made this year, clobbers the competition on ANY system in terms of play mechanics and gameplay.  Gameplay is what Visual Concepts is all about and that certainly shows with NFL 2K2.  That has always been the core to the NFL 2K series and that's definitely the case with NFL 2K2.  First off, a lot of attention came into the AI of the game, and you'll especially notice the tenacious nature of the computer AI on defense.  Defensive linemen will bat down passes with greater frequency and ferocity, safeties will fool you into thinking a passing lane is open only to be waiting in that area as soon as you release the ball, and running on the outside is a lot tougher compared to last year's.  Much of this comes from the reduced amount of what DC players have coined the ~vacuum effect~ in blocking, making running on the inside easier than on the outside, a welcome change in my opinion from last year's running game.  In addition, running backs and fullbacks have new weapons when it comes to evading incoming dbacks armed with whiplash inducing tackles.  There are three new juke moves to execute (left, right, and a pause) for the Marshall Faulk in all of us, and when combined with the lethal stiff arms, quick hurdles, and the ever-useful spin weapons, running the ball is a whole lot more technical and fun.  It's worthy to note that timing is much more important when implementing any of these techniques in NFL 2K2; if you anticipate a diving tackle from a defensemen with the proper timing of a spin, you'll escape with little loss of speed.  However, spin too early or too late and while you may get away with a spin maneuver, you'll lose quite a bit of your forward momentum as well as some control to your runner.  Of course, you've got to take into the equation the match-ups as well; if you're using Joe Loser at running back and you try to spin away from a Zach Thomas diving tackle, chances are you're not going to get away that easily no matter how well you time the spin.  I also admire the balance of the running game; even though you've got all sorts of techniques to use in avoiding incoming lariats, even if a defensive fails to wrap up a runner properly, you're still slowed down.  There are a number of new animations that are situation based and I've often caught myself cringing in virtual pain seeing Eddie George make a spinning move in mid-air only to be nailed in mid-air by a safety that sent George out of the game for 4 plays (thanks Lynch... thanks a bunch).  Bear in mind that the success of the running play depends on a small part on the skill of the player and a larger part on what formation you call and the situation of the play.  Faulk may be arguable the best running back in the league but on a third and short situation, it's not always guaranteed he'll get the first down on a 22 iso play against the Raider's defense.  Improvements aren't just in the running game alone; the passing game has been streamlined so it's a lot more realistic and, in my opinion, it's better to have maximum passing on.  That's changed from NFL 2K1 where I rarely used maximum passing to NFL 2K2 where it's almost essential if you want to ~thread the needle~.  The timing to the passing game is very important to master, as I've run many more short yard timing routes in one game of NFL 2K2 than a whole season in NFL 2K1.  VC really went to some microscopic detail in making the whole quarterback passing game much more realistic for the DC gamer.  Going for that long 40 plus yard pass?  Better make sure your QB has some time to set-up for that heave because he won't just loft one up on the run.  Need to get the pass to a receiver fast?  Better take a step up to throw that bullet.  For that matter, if you're on the run, better make sure it's a short pass because the longer it goes, the more inaccurate the pass will be.  Maximum passing allows you to slightly adjust the flight trajectory of the ball up until the moment your QB releases the ball and that's pretty important against this revamped AI defense.  Should you use maximum passing, it's recommended to take control of the receiver so you can also adjust his movement to compensate for the pass.  It's definitely a bit more challenging but much more realistic and a ton more fun.  It's also nice to see the new QB animations, most notably, when you call a roll-out play, your QB will actually sprint out of the pocket and roll left or right depending on the play.  As I said above, the CPU controlled defense is a lot smarter this year.  There are times when a defenseman will miss a tackle or he won't cover a zone properly, but for the most part, when you call a zone defense, you're defense will play the zone just right.  I also feel playing defensive linemen is much more improved, especially if you use the advanced line moves.  NFL 2K2 has cut down the amount of ~vacuum~ blocking so spinning off a guard or tackle at the right time is definitely rewarded.  And finally, one major gripe I had with NFL 2K1 has been fixed; they actually call the intentional ground penalty.  It's also worthy to note that VC has listened to the NFL 2K fans and fixed some of the interesting bugs and cheats from NFL 2K1, most notably, the ~wave blitz~ bug cheat that allowed you to attack the O-line with your power meter filled.  Of course, let's not forget about the great online play, especially the addition to the win/loss record keeping of NFL 2K2.  There's still a touch of lag in NFL 2K2 that we experienced inNFL 2K1 and it caused a few problems with my inside running game and you may have to be a bit safer when making pass plays online.  Nonetheless, it's still a lot of fun to play online and I experienced far less dropped games during my experience online so far.  So, why am I not heaping tons of accolades for all these great changes to NFL 2K2 if Visual Concepts made so many great improvements for the last DC football game?  Because, being the Dreamcast hardcore fan that I am, I expect a lot to the last of DC game of its kind.  Expectations include not only improvements in gameplay, but also improvements in every department of the game.  As a football fan, I like playing franchise mode quite a bit and there's nothing wrong with NFL 2K2's franchise mode if you're expecting the same exact mode as NFL 2K1.  The franchise mode is nearly identical to last year's version and after seeing Madden 2002's in-depth franchise mode, it's a bit of a letdown.  The create-a-player option is also the same as last year's and I think they could've added a lot more options to tailor customized players.  When it comes to gripes about the gameplay, a lot of mine are very small details that are missed or overlooked, but nonetheless add up in the end.  Although the computer AI is improved to the point where it's aggressive, it's almost to the point where the AI gets pretty ~gutsy~.  For example, near the end of a close game, the computer attempted a 55-yard field goal with less than three minutes to go.  I'm not sure if the AI is over-aggressive or a bit stupid in that scenario, but I find that the computer takes a lot of chances that I wouldn't even take.  While the collision detection is pretty solid for the most part, there are certainly instances where it's very noticeable; when you knock down the punt returner by only hitting his wrist with your wrist from, what looks like a obviously missed power tackle, that's something visibly noticeable.  Additionally, it really can't be hard to fix some of the minor collision problems from previous NFL 2K games - players walking through the referees, player going through the goal post during their touchdown celebration animations, etc.  The newer animations also have small flaws.  Earlier in this review I mentioned how it's easier to run on the inside than the outside in NFL 2K2 when compared to NFL 2K1.  Part of this is because if a tackler doesn't wrap up on a running back during a tackle, that RB will bounce off him and continue running.  When you bounce off a defender, you lose control of your RB for a moment and this becomes slightly annoying if you're running inside.  Several times when running inside, I've had a RB bounce off defenders left and right, while I had no control over his movement.  This ~ping-pong~ effect often allows me to gain another two yards and while that's beneficial to the player, I don't like how I can't influence the RB's movements even a little bit when he's ricocheting off of dbacks.  Another annoyance is the QB rollout animation where he sprints out of the pocket to roll left or right.  I'm in a love/hate relationship with this new animation; I love that the QB can sprint out of the pocket but I hate it because you have no control whatsoever of the QB during the first couple of seconds during his rollout.  The main problem with this isn't the lack of control but often the QB will run into his linemen or blocker and will continue to push up against them effectively blocking the QB's path.  You can press the R Trigger to control him out of his rollout sprint but it would be nice if the computer would compensate if someone on your team blocks the rollout path.  Which reminds me, I don't remember Michael Vick of the Falcons losing his speed all of the sudden when he joined the NFL... did he lose his scrambling ability and speed from his Virginia Tech days?  Commentating, another one of NFL 2K's strong points, is decent but there are some flaws.  Of course, the commentary in theNFL 2K series is better than the senile commentary of other football games, but they didn't fix a few lines that were also found in past NFL 2K games.  For example, if you kick a ball near the end of the end zone, forcing the kick returner to down the kick while stepping out of bounds in his downing animation in the end zone, the commentators will say something to the effect of, ~He immediately steps out of bounds.  I don't know why he did that.~  Also, sometimes if you decline a penalty for better yardage or even a score, especially a passing interference penalty, the commentators will often say they don't know why you declined the penalty.  In addition, I've noticed that the audible levels of the commentators will get louder and suddenly softer in some instances.  Finally, I still don't think defense or special teams gets any respect in NFL 2K in comparison to the offense.  For example, make a kick return for a touchdown, or have a defensive lineman retrieve a fumble for touchdown, and you get no banner overlay of who made the touchdown and how many yards during the next kickoff.  Hey, even defensive lineman need some love, too.  If it sounds like I'm really nit-picking NFL 2K2, it's because I feel I have to.  With all the great improvements in the game, it's also necessary to point out some of the flaws they didn't fix and any new ones they didn't pick up on.  I also get the feeling that the PS2 version will be head-over-heels improved over the Dreamcast version, and it makes me feel a bit left out that VC didn't go all out with the last football game on the Dreamcast.  But as reality slaps me back in the face, Visual Concepts should get an ovation for even putting as much time as they did for the Dreamcast version, considering their upcoming battle in the multi-platform world.  We don't live in a perfect world folks, and most companies would crap out last year's version, stamp out the new title, and ship it out.  Sure, there are details that VC missed with NFL 2K2, but there are also some great improvements in gameplay and play mechanics that you won't find in any other football game.  We always talk about gameplay over graphics, substance over style, and Visual Concepts has put together a fun football game that, flaws aside, focuses on improving gameplay to the next level.  And my dear readers, that's what it's all about.  If you want to get into the huddle and Under the Helmet of real NFL football, head over to NFL.com.
