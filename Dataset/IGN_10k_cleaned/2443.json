But before the vindictive villain can complete his plans of world domination the Powerpuff Girls arrive on the scene.  Can you guide the girls through the treacherous terrain to stop the super cerebral simian?  Play on and find out. Features  3 girls to choose from 6 levels of side scrolling action Various power-up items to improve your attacks Combine all 3 girls together to unleash devastating Super Attacks Multiplayer link for up to 3 players Only for Game Boy Advance   I was forced to play both the PlayStation and the N64 Powerpuff Girls, and they pale in comparison to the GBA game because both of those systems made the crucial mistake of trying to make this a 3D game...2D is the way to go, especially when you make a game based off of a cartoon that's stylized in 2D.   Powerpuff Girls is a side-scrolling shooter in the vein of Gradius and R-Type.  The game may start you off with Blossom, but you have the option to change characters in-game...the other two girls are always floating in the background.  The girls have their trademark moves of punch and laser eyes that you must use to destroy various robots bent on stopping you from stopping Mojo Jojo.  Like most side scrolling shooters there are various power-ups to collect.  Some double the points you get, chemical X replenishes your health, the girls' icon revives a defeated Powerpuff girl, and others weapon icons improve your girls' performance.  Even though most girls have an up-close punch attack, I would find myself not using it, since it has a very short range and requires you to get dangerously close to the enemies.  But the Mega Punch does add this really cool smoky cloud trail that would go half way across the screen, doing tons of damage...something very hard to resist.  The problem I found with the weapons is time limit on them...wwapon depletion doesn't depend on how much you use them, but how long you have them.  So you could be flying around trying to save your Mega Beam by using punch, and have it disappear on you just as you reach the boss.  However, I did find a way around this.  When you collect a good weapon such as the Mega Beam, switch over to another girl.  For some strange reason as long as the girl stays inactive the weapon remains inactive and can be saved for greater threats such as a boss.  Now this is the only reason I found to switch characters, because each girl is almost identical.  The same sized life bar, speed, eye laser, and punch.  The one difference I found lies in the super attacks.  Super attacks can be performed when you collect a white star.  This is the one real feature that sets the girls apart.  Blossom commands the girls to use a triple eye laser killing everything on the screen.  Bubbles tells the girls to spin around her creating a shield.  Buttercup takes the girls and beats up the most powerful enemy on the screen.  If any of your girls are defeated you cannot perform the super attack.  There are a total of six levels, which include a very long shooting level, and a boss at the end.  During the last level in the game I came across a very unfortunate bug.  In attempting to execute my Super Attack the game locked up...something that should not happen in a finished version of the game.  Upon restarting my game I noticed that the memory had saved and I was able to continue with the last mission.  A nice little feature wouldn't you say?    Another neat feature was the fact you could interact with some of the backgrounds.  Uprooting trees, mailboxes, and rocks then throwing them at your enemies...but it's not nearly as useful as you would think it is.  The tree would hit two enemies at most and if you got hit while carrying the item you would drop it.    I do like the little cut scenes with the Powerpuff girls and Mojo Jojo...the announcer's voice was another nice surprise.  The music is great, featuring the classic Powerpuff theme song. It goes perfect with the game, as does the rest of the tunes throughout the adventure.    The worst part of Powerpuff Girls: the game is very short...I beat it in a single afternoon.  It's defintely not epic like Advance Wars or Pokemon, but it's got its charms.  This is one of those games that you can just pick up and play, no instructions needed...but it does remind me of those simplistic Cartoon Network online Powerpuff Girls games done in Shockwave...so don't expect an overwhelming adventure.", "date": "Jan 25, 2002"}
