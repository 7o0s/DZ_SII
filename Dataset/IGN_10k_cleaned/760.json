Normally a problem with comic book and movie related videogames, it's no secret that highly touted licenses frequently live short of their expectations. From the days of Maximum Carnage to the more recent WCW Mayhem, failure, disappointment and a tainted brand name seem to be bedfellows more often than not. Unfortunately, as you've probably accessed by now, Acclaim's newest wrestling game ECW Hardcore Revolution finds itself a member of the not-so prestigious disappointment club.   At its roots, Hardcore Revolution is essentially the same as 1999's WWF Attitude. Identical play mechanics, similar options, and pretty much everything else are along the same lines they were last time. As fans of both the WWF and wrestling games will tell you, Attitude managed to do a lot of things right and, despite its success, had its share of things done wrong. The bad news is that none of the latter problems from Attitude have been fixed in this new installment.   Yes, the poor collision detection and awful commentary has returned. Yes, the control is set up more like Mortal Kombat than wrestling, and yes, each grappler still walks to the ring with their legs spread wide apart, apparently inflicted with a fiery case of hemorrhoids. In other words, if you thought plenty would change in the six-month turnover since Attitude, you're in for a surprise -- as other than a roster change, very little is new.   Need a hug? Let me help you! To its credit, Hardcore Revolution's graphics and animations have been slightly upgraded, and reflect the more extreme side of professional wrestling. Not only has each grappler's face been more accurately captured than in the past, but bruises, scars, and welts have been added to skin textures as well. The fluidity and speed of each brawler's movements are also improved, and while not overwhelmingly eye-catching are enough to make the difference obvious.   Regrettably, the speed increase is actually a hindrance for the gameplay. Because of the hurried pace of a match, pulling off a desired tap-tap maneuver is more difficult than it was in Attitude. All the moves you knew how to do last year still use the same pattern, but now your response time seems to be cut in half. Repeatedly, I found myself beaten down by punches and kicks whenever I tried to execute a simple power bomb or even a little DDT. And while I'm on the subject of wrestling techniques, what's with the lack of aerial attacks and the wild prop usage associated with ECW events? The game may look like Paul Heyman's promotion and even sound like it sometimes, but it sure doesn't play like it. When a typical contest resorts to nothing more but arm bars and punches, it makes you wonder which federation you're actually watching here. Those ~ECW!~ chants from the crowd may get you to shout ~LIAR!~ at your television a few times.   Oh well, at least the blasphemous crowd has been livened up a bit since its last incarnation. Though the audience is composed of a of five-frame mess of standers and sitters, it still looks a lot better than what we had in Attitude. Signs, clothing, and a few other nuances (like chain-link dividers between the audience and the walkway) add to the improved aesthetic of each arena. Speaking of arenas, there is actually more than one this time around, as Acclaim was nice enough to let us choose from four different stadiums. But it's just window dressing really, as none of the rings have any advantage or disadvantage over the others.   Of course the most anticipated new feature has to be the addition of the barbed wire match. Everywhere I turned, I saw some advertisement or article pushing its inclusion. ~It has a barbed wire bout! Imagine the possibilities!~ They screamed. Even I was looking forward to this addition and made sure to say so in our preview earlier in the year. And then I played it. Virtually unchanged from a regular match-up, all the extra chicken wire does is add a different type of wall to be thrown into. Wrestlers can't be caught up in it, it can't become unhinged, and it doesn't seem to affect the blood flow one bit. Toss your opponent into the wire and all they do is stick to it for less than a second and thud to the floor. That's it? Some ~special feature~ that turned out to be.   But you can still turn to the excellent Create-A-Wrestler option right? Well, kind of. While a huge selection can still be found regarding your characters look and fighting style, there isn't enough that's new here to make it any different than Attitude's. In fact, all the generic outfits that were in the WWF game are here too, with no noticeable changes whatsoever. I'll admit that I liked the addition of more skin types to choose from, but why in the hell can your creation only select existing characters voices and entrance themes?   Now, I understand that most of ECW's music comes from big name metal bands and industrial freaks, so nailing down the rights for each individual song would be expensive. But at least in Attitude there were more than seven generic themes and five jobbers to listen to. Call me picky, but that small number is not enough to satisfy me when all my creations are going to sound like one another, both in the ring and out.   That's not to say that you won't spend hours in front of ECW's wrestler factory anyway. Despite its limitations, it is still pretty deep when compared to most other wrestling games -- and it's definitely the main source of entertainment the disc has to offer. Unfortunately, Acclaim didn't learn from its mistakes last time and you still can't edit an existing wrestler to look any different from a default outfit.   Also unchanged are the ring options. Three-way Dances, cage matches, battle royals, and lumberjack bouts have made their triumphant return. However, other favorites from the past like Survivor Series and the Royal Rumble have fallen through the ropes and onto the concrete floor (such is the price you pay for switching leagues that don't have 'em). Diversions at best, you'll quickly find that there are few features to separate each match from the other, and eventually ignore all but a few specialty battles all together.What ECW Hardcore Revolution ultimately boils down too is a rehashed product you'll eventually ignore. Despite a huge list of wrestlers (including my main man, Rob Van Dam) and slightly better graphics, Revolution was already months ago when it was called Attitude. Plus, when WWF Attitude first hit the shelves, it was before the genre took a big leap forward with Smackdown and WrestleMania 2000 -- two games that have set impressive new standards for the way a wrestling game should be. A generation behind, Hardcore Revolution needs to go back to the drawing board and try again.", "date": "Mar 4, 2000"}
