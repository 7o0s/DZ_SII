From the opening credits of the game where the Megatron smoothly bellows the company's name, to the spitting image recreations of the blocky action figure-to-TV product Transformer characters, to the mecha-hyper-super-ultra-nuko-freaka-hella-mega blast attacks, to the energetic vocal battle cries behind every mecha-hyper-super-ultra-nuko-freaka-hella-mega blast attack, to the glamorous vanity toy demos where you can pretend you yourself own a Beast Wars action figure in the game (which, if you are reading this, you probably already do in real life), and on to the frivolous, cornball Shoot-Out and Racing bonus games, you can see that these guys really get a jolly kick out of big robots.  Not that they know a dang thing about programming games, but still... Big robots, am I right? ~Transformers! More than meets the eye. Transformers! Robots in disguise.~ We're talking BIG ROBOTS!   Features:  Transformers that transform Morph into Beast Mode, Vehicle Mode, and Robot Mode Eight characters from the acclaimed animated TV show -- Optimus Primal, Rattrap, Cheetor, Airazor, Megatron, Tarantulas, Waspinator, Terrorsaur Surfing monkeys Rumble Pack support Available in rental outlets only -- not in any stores   Gameplay Once again, it's time to dust off your fighting skills and get ready to trash on the N64 controller for fist-to-metallic-fist battle. And this time, kind of like a lot of the other times (accounting for the fact that the N64's plate of fighters hardly qualifies as ~a lot~), you can throw magical blasts of energy at your enemy and kill them from afar.   If you loved Virtual On and Armored Core, then you'll be especially offended by Beast Wars wacky play control. Marvel, if you will, at homing shots that fail to home. Gape openly at the amazing unblockable Special Attacks that nail you to a cross no matter how off the aim is. Thrill to the jack-hole programming that negates a counter attack against a Special Attack, as when a counter is thrown, the charge that went into the special move is automatically unleashed for an automatic hit.   Transformer fans, or more specifically Beast Wars fans (seeing as how divided the original Transformer and Beast Wars fans are), may enjoy moments few and far between in this game. It's a particularly so-so-yet-fun-because-we're-shooting-each-other Two Player game. All of the TV show's big attacks are present in a blocky, jerky, blurry form, which will surely light up the day of any Trans-... er, Beast Wars fanatic.  But I want my Giant Robot Fighting games to have giant robots fighting. Instead, what we get in Beast Wars Transmetals Transformers Transvestites Transmo-Disco Boogie here is a botched VO:OT. The close-combat fighting engine is horrible, making Beast Mode just a waste of time. You can hardly get in a punch before the glass-jaw chumps take a dive, or otherwise they unleash a blasting block counter that knocks you for a loop just when you're about to lay the smack down. How heartless. The game's not even 100% true to the evolution of the show -- these are Transmetal Transformers, but they still have Energon overcharges that force them into Beast Mode. Why?   Graphics Like I said, if I'm going to play a Giant Robot Fighting game, I want giant robots fighting. The PlayStation version of Beast Wars Transmetals at least had big robots of varying sizes. Here, little monkeys like Rattrap go up against gargantuans like Tarantulas without giving an inch.   The Transformer Beast Wars beasts all are represented well, or at least as well as a half-dozen polygons could represent these characters. While the polygon count is low, low, low, it's at least... No, really, it's low. Really low. But at least the characters all have the standard Mario environment mapping effect on their metallic bodies, making them look shiny and sharp in their super-low polygon count.  It's a good thing the polygon count was kept to a minimum, because otherwise the Mode 7-style environments and fog effects would never have worked. At least, I assume that was the problem. The fogging and blurring is not just an eye sore. It's an optomologist appointment that schedules itself, as soon as humanly possible. Squinting helps. Also, the backgrounds are barren and lifeless, a far cry from the PSX Beast Wars Transmetal's trap-laden zones. Even when you get to the secret lair of the Predacons, all you get to see is a thin texture map wrapped around a carrousel with a similarly dark floor map stretched on the ground. They drew circles and triangles on the textures to show off the intricate computer hardware of the Ark space cruiser.  About the only thing nice to say about the game's look is that it has a distinct Japanese flair for camera angles and cut scenes. Pretty nonsensical for a game based on a show made in Canada, but we'll let it slide for Takara because they're the ones making the toys, and they're the ones making the game. Little touches don't exactly show up well on this life-sized failure, but it's still rad when the sky darkens as the Transformers sap energy out of the air for a huge attack. Also, even though the character animation is choppy and chunky everywhere else, the transforming effects show up well enough to see that something is happening to somebody to make them something else.  Sound Cart space was clearly a concern for Takara and BAM!, because the voices in this game are kept low. Not polygon count low -- nothing could reach that depth -- but too low for a game claiming to have a Story mode. Still, the voices are all done by Mainframe voice talents and qualified sound-alikes, and unlike the PlayStation version (which was drowned out aurally in battle cries), the voices only pop out when necessary. The music, on the other hand, isn't so good, but being an N64 rental cart with gameplay that plays better to Korn or Rage on the CD than J-Pop off the TV, it's not a problem. It's not awful. We kept saying that every time we put the game in. We'd watch it for a while and say that. We'd play it for a short stint and say that. It's easy to say that it's not awful. In fact, Beast Wars fan boys may even like the experience. But after playing a mite longer, we started noticing that shots never nail the target, that enemies have pre-programmed AI to either sit there and take hits or retaliate with unblockable counters, and that the graphics have ruined our vision. If we could still see it, we'd might still say it's not awful. But, at this point, that seems kind of moot.", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
