{"name": "Lemmings", "name_review": "Lemmings Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/15/lemmings-review", "text": "With its release for PSP earlier this year, the puzzle fanatics at Team17 have already proven that they know how to handle Lemmings, DMA Design's mind-bending legacy from days gone by. Boasting a mix of classic and all-new levels, an original artistic style, and a revamped control scheme, the portable version of the popular brainteaser was received extremely well. Luckily for fans, the Britsoft gang is back again for even more fun with its latest Lemmings update on PlayStation 3 (because, as we all know, the world's quest to use various tools and talents to reach one end of the screen to another knows no bounds).   Rather than simply rest on its laurels and release a higher-res version of the PSP edition, though, Team17 has gone back to the drawing board and delivered more than 40 new levels that no one has seen before. Handheld players may recognize the art style and interface, of course, because the developers have lifted it straight out of the portable (why fix what isn't broken?). The stage design itself, however, is completely unique and as any veteran Lemmings fan can tell you, it's the stage design that truly matters.    In that regard, the architects have done a pretty good job of mixing things up. While the game is primarily built with horizontal levels and your typical ~Point A to Point B~ blueprint, a couple of vertical environments jumble things quite nicely. What's appreciated, though, is that most every location available really makes you work for the right to finish it, and the decision to incorporate classic gameplay ideas from previous installments adds to the experience. Take the new power-up system, for example. It's the evolution of the skill acquirement feature first introduced in Lemmings Chronicles, and instead of just beginning a stage with your mindless midgets equipped with all their gifts, you have to find and capture needed abilities along the way. It's a cool little wrinkle and it adds even more strategy to a game that also boasts cloning machines that create additional drones and teleporters that allow for quick relocations.   Another new feature from our green haired friends is the inclusion of online scoreboards for every level (which, as always, are divided into Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem difficulty groups). Just remember to create a profile for yourself before starting a game (separate from your XMB log in), otherwise you'll find that tracing your rank in the sea of puzzle experts proves thorny. Additional PS3-exclusive features include the highest level of stage and character detail in the history of the series, 720p HD support, and some cool lighting effects that really enhances the mood in several environments.   When taken together, all the elements listed above make for a strong Lemmings experience... especially for new or moderate players whose previous familiarity with the series was only the PSP version (or perhaps one of its many shareware clones). If that description doesn't apply to you, however, then Lemmings ultimately runs into two roadblocks. The first of these is common among most long-standing puzzlers in that we've seen it so many times before, that it doesn't feel as impactful or innovative. Issue number two is that, unlike randomized reflex-testers like Bejeweled or Zuma, beating a stage means that you have absolutely no reason to go back and play it again; that is, unless you want to best your previous time. It's an incentive yes, but not a very compelling one.Familiarity and limitations aside, Lemmings is still a fun pick-up for PlayStation 3 puzzle fans. Priced at only a couple of bucks and stacked with some admittedly cool challenges, it's definitely a good way to pass the time as we wait for bigger, meatier games headed down the road.", "date": "Dec 15, 2006"}
