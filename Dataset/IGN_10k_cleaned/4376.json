{"name": "PO'ed", "name_review": "POed", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/poed", "text": "Originally released for the 3DO, PO'ed is one of those weird games that somehow works. Initially it looks like just another Doom clone, but it's far more than that.  First, the enemies are extremely bizarre. Second, the level designs, though somewhat confusing, are intricate and huge. In fact, PO'ed sometimes feels a little overdesigned. Fortunately, the PlayStation's graphics capabilities have alleviated some of the problems of the 3DO version, such as allowing for better light sourcing and clearer textures.  Control is also improved over the original, with the PlayStation controller's extra buttons coming in handy. The amount of moves your chef character can do is staggering considering the usual run and strafe of most first person shooters. Not only can you run and shoot, but also jump, fly, and even do backflips.  Over all, PO'ed is a fun, twisted game with a warped sense of humor. If you liked Alien Trilogy, and perhaps like to cook, PO'ed should be just your thing.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
