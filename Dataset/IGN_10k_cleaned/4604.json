{"name": "QBz for Prizes!", "name_review": "QBz for Prizes!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/31/qbz-for-prizes", "text": "Maybe you've heard of QBz, a little computer game from Skunk Studios where you must clear the screen of tiny, colored cubes before moving on to the next, and more complex, screen. It's a darling game, one that balances the line between easy timekiller and frenzied addiction. Honestly, the only way the game could get better is if somebody offered you a Target gift certificate just for playing.   Enter Atlas Mobile.   Features:  Six levels of difficulty  Head-to-head/progressive tournaments  Practice game  Prizes   Atlas Mobile, which has seen incredible success with its line of For Prizes! games, has licensed this game from Skunk Studios and ported it to cellphones. In this go-go version of the game, you can play fast-paced rounds of the puzzler, entering scores into a leaderboard. Should you manage to nail to top score for the tournament, expect some form of communication from Atlas Mobile. Your prize is on the way.   QBz for Prizes! is a clever game. The goal is simple: clear the screen. Of course, there's a matter of all these blocks in the way. You must link up like-colored boxes. The more boxes in a chain, the higher your score. Now, sometimes you'll find yourself without any colors together. You must rotate the screen to send all the cubes tumbling down, hopefully creating more chains.   The game scores you not only on how many big chains you can rack up, but how quickly you can clear boards. The entire time, there is a water meter on the left side of the screen. If the meter fills, the screen gets flooded, and it's the proverbial game over. No Target for you.   QBz for Prizes! is a colorful game, thanks to the on-screen cubes. Each box has a little face, taunting you. Teasing you. (Why do you smile so, little cube?) When you manage to clear a group of boxes, you'll hear the squeaks and squawks of the boxes before they go to QBz heaven.QBz for Prizes! further re-iterates Alas Mobile's skill for picking out appropriately simple and addictive games for their blockbuster service. The Skunk Studios puzzler is an evil, time-swallowing whore -- which is why I love it so. It is one of those little games that you plan on playing for three minutes, and before you know it, a good twenty minutes has vanished and your phone's battery is toast. Of course, the fact that Atlas is handing out prizes for playing QBz is something of a marvel in itself. I've never won a single tourney (and methinks there's a conflict of interest involved if I ever did), but a cheap, quality game like QBz for Prizes! is reward enough.", "date": "Mar 31, 2004"}
