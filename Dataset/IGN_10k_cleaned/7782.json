Where the hunters get to track animals and pull off some 100 yard headshots, fishing is about sitting in a boat and worrying about line tension. It's a relaxing way to spend the afternoon in the real world, but doing it in a video game requires extra care to keep the game fresh enough to justify its existence. As for Reel Fishing: The Great Outdoors, there was very little care at all as it feels like it was programmed by people who have never fished at all.   To start up a game of Reel Fishing is to enter into some bizarre alternate universe and it's not one of those fun anime-styled worlds filled with mutant-headed children either. No, this one can be downright creepy. You play as some incredibly pale-skinned weakling who passes out in front of a bait shop. The owner takes pity on you and invites you to his secluded cabin in the woods to fish. So, two years later, you do and he's happy to see you. He then prescribes a strict regimen of fishing, fishing, and, golly, more fishing to cure what ails you.    All of this creepiness is part of the pervading feeling that something just isn't right here in Reel Fishing Land. At the end of each fishing session you go to sleep and then talk to the same guy in the morning, but it's always dark outside. Is this guy nocturnal or something? And why does he stare at you like that?   But all of this is just the filler and the real meat of the game is the fishing itself, but don't get too excited. It's not like that would be humanly possible, but there it is. Each fishing session involves staying in one spot next to or in a gray lake with a gray sky and grayish hills in the distance. The guy must've gotten his cabin for a song since the landscape looks like it was just wiped out by a forest fire and a volcano's just erupted off in the distance. The message seems to be that, ~hey! The world is bleak and miserable, but fishing will save your soul, buddy.~   The fishing itself never gets fun, anyway. Cast the line, tug rod back to hook the fish, and then play the slow and tedious line tension game. It's enough to drive any man to go to the store and buy a nice slab of fish from the cooler and start to enjoy its tasty flavors. Back in the game, though, the biggest thrill was finding out that even though my fishing line could break if the fish fought too much, it could go through pylons without a problem. It was about then that I knew that the world of Reel Fishing wasn't for me. It's not for most people, except for maybe some freakishly pale wannabe fishermen with a lot of time on their pasty hands.Reel Fishing does nothing to excite non-fishermen and perhaps even less to those who do fish. If there was a simulation to prove that real life still has a good reason to exist, then this would be a shining star. Find another game to lay or take the day off and go fishing. You PSP will still be here when you get back.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
