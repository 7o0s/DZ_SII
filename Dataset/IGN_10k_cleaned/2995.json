{"name": "Dual Hearts", "name_review": "Dual Hearts", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/01/dual-hearts", "text": "It's hard to believe that Dual Hearts comes from Matrix, the same development house as Alundra.  Certainly there's a resemblance, given that both are action-RPGs built around the concept of wandering around various people's dreams, but sitting alongside those shared elements are some drastically polar opposites.  Alundra is one of the most depressing games ever made, with a relentless downer of a story and puzzles guaranteed to humble the smartest RPG veteran.  Dual Hearts, in comparison, is thoroughly bright and cheerful, with puzzles and combat that often don't present enough challenge.  Considering that Alundra beat me into submission on about a half-hourly basis, the experience is thus somewhat perplexing.   It is also, on the whole, not quite so well-made.  Dual Hearts is a good game, one which overcomes some technical shortcomings with unusually creative artistry and an abundance of personality, but one can't help but recall that this is ostensibly the same team that made Alundra and Landstalker, which for their time were far better action-RPGs.  The relentless challenge and smart pacing of those games have been moderated in this outing, perhaps as part of that eternal quest to reach a broader audience, and as a consequence, die-hards may find it a less rewarding adventure.  It doesn't deserve to be overlooked entirely, though -- there's still some places worth seeing in the game, and puzzles worth scratching your head over.   Gameplay  This is Matrix's first solo effort in realtime 3D, given that Alundra 2 was some sort of peculiar collaborative effort, and it seems to be a cautious attempt at taking advantage of this form of presentation.  The environments in Dual Hearts are frequently pretty linear, and those that occupy a larger space tend to consist of several discrete elements, well-separated, as opposed to the complex and intricately-designed 3D spaces in something like Sly Cooper.    If Dual Hearts is a little simpler than its fellows in the current generation of 3D adventures, though, it still manages to offer an interesting challenge now and again.  Most of the best puzzles involve exploiting the relationship between the two characters: a human treasure hunter and a Baku, a cartoonish little mythical creature whose purpose it is to wander in and out of people's dreams.  On top of his own abilities, the hero can take advantage of the Baku's special powers and maneuvers, which are powered by Tummy Points.  Yes.  See, the Baku has to consume Esamon to use his powers, little floating wisps left behind after enemies are defeated.  So long as his tummy's full (famous first note: this is the first IGN review to ever make extensive use of the word ~tummy~), he can jump high, breathe deadly breath, stomp recalcitrant switches, and perform other useful actions.   Dual Hearts' weapon system is probably its strongest suit, combining a wide variety of tools (a la Seiken Densetsu) with a fast-moving combat system that provides plenty of opportunities to take advantage of them.  Our hero begins the game with two weapons -- a spear and a sword -- and acquires a new one after completing each level, earning more useful destructive and defensive implements.  Each has a charge-up attack that finds an implementation in certain puzzles, and you're not limited to using one at a time, since the hero can hold a weapon in each hand.  Thus, there's a lot of freedom to find a particular preference for combat, and less time spent swapping weapons around in the sub-screen when one is required for a battle or puzzle.   On the other hand, the game sometimes has trouble giving you enough to do with these tools.  Pacing is one of the key sticking points I found with Dual Hearts.  It sits as an odd counterpoint to this fall's other major action-RPG, Kingdom Hearts, a game which was occasionally too fast-moving, crowded, and frenetic for its own good.  Dual Hearts, in comparison, is often not frenetic enough -- movement, combat, and exploration seem a bit too slow-paced to be engaging.  Some areas feel like they need more enemies or puzzles to fill in the space, and the characters' slow rate of movement around larger areas leaves chunks of dead air where you're simply walking around from point A to point B.    Nevertheless, there's still a lot of fun to be had here in the more inventive levels.  When Matrix is on its best game, the mixture of puzzles and combat is engaging, taking advantage of the multitude of tools to acquire, and the level designs provide a pleasant backdrop.  The theme of exploring different dreams allows for a lot of variation in style, and it takes the old RPG concept of casual home invasion to a very funny new level.  The generally lower difficulty may be a problem for some, but given how brutal Alundra could be at times, perhaps we should count our blessings.   Graphics  Again, this is the developer's first go at an entirely 3D game, and that certainly shows.  This is a pretty rough-looking piece of work, technically speaking -- it's not pushing around many polygons or throwing around high-resolution textures.  The few noteworthy effects, like the motion blur that accompanies certain weapon attacks, stick out in rather conspicuous fashion, because they don't have many fellows to occupy the spotlight.   If Dual Hearts is not so technically accomplished, though, it often has a very nice artistic sense going for it, particularly in some of the more inventive dreams.  Each level is patterned after the unconscious of a different character -- an artist, an archaeologist, and so on -- and there are some very thoughtful designs reflecting those different personalities.  The best is probably a little girl's dream, done up in a child's crayon scribbles, although the ~Ringworld~ of the artist's dream is a nifty way to spruce up a fundamentally straightforward design.   Sound  Dual Hearts' soundtrack almost makes it up over the same wall as the graphics, but in this case, personality can't quite save weak execution.  Though there are a few catchy tunes, many more simply sound amateurish, taking little advantage of the kind of sound quality that can be produced with modern consoles.  There's cute, but it sits rather close to the border with ~cheesy,~ and Dual Hearts frequently steps over that line.   The effects suite is more innocuous, albeit about equally simple, keeping with the generally bright atmosphere of the graphics.  It includes a few voice snippets, but they're so short as to be almost inconsequential -- none of the cutscenes feature spoken dialogue, although that's nothing to count against the game.While Dual Hearts isn't going to set the world on fire, it's nice to see SCEI giving it a chance to get made, and Atlus giving it a hand across the ocean.  It's a fun action-RPG with some bright ideas and no small amount of personality -- the Baku is one of the most visually entertaining characters to come down the pike in a long while.  Maybe some gamers will get sick of the happy Baku dance before this one is over, but they're probably of the same ilk that thought Gungrave was too short.There are bigger and better games in the genre this year, then, but this one doesn't deserve to be overshadowed entirely.  Give it a look, especially if you enjoyed Matrix's past efforts, and rest assured it won't make you curse quite so much as Alundra.", "date": "Oct 1, 2002"}
