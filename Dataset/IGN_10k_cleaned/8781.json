It's the sort of game where if a character goes an entire sentence without uttering at least one profanity, you start to suspect it might be broken. The foul-mouthed antics come thick and fast, all while hookers walk the streets, blood geysers spew from the neck stumps of the people you kill, and you're running around buying and selling drugs. It's Scarface all right - bless it - and bizarrely enough it's on the same system as the delightfully twee Wii Sports. No matter, the Wii needs titles like this.    Or does it?   Scarface may indeed be hyper violent and feature more swearing than a Deadwood convention (I can't back that up - Deadwood still wins hands down), but it's yet another port to Nintendo's system. So we do the same dance again. (Running Man, if you must know). How do the new Wii-ified controls stack up against the original? Do they bring anything new or are they a lumbering, shoehorned mess? Do they make the *insert length of time here* wait for the Wii version worthwhile? How do the graphics stack up on Wii? Are there any other bonuses that help make the *insert length of time here* wait worthwhile? Has any online play functionality been unceremoniously stripped out of the Wii version? And so on.   Before we move on to all that Wii-version specific stuff, however, let's take a brief, oh, 996 words or so, to run through the game. You may never have played it or read about it (those other sections of IGN are EEEEEEVIL!) or you may be afflicted by explosive amnesia from a bump to the head from a falling grand piano in an ivory store. I don't know, so here are the basics. What if Tony hadn't been killed 23 times over at the end of the movie yadda yadda yadda. Yes, Tony Montana lives to fight another day. His empire has been burnt to the ground, the ashes scattered to the winds like so much cocaine, and he's left with nothing. Except, of course, his word and his balls. It's time to climb back to the top of the heap, the only way Tony knows how. By rebuilding his drug empire in Miami, then killing Sosa.   Tony's new role protecting heritage listed buildings.  It all boils down to an open-world game design (the genre formerly known as 'GTA Clone') with a few twists on the usual formula. For one, Tony is one hell of a chatty guy, and there's a huge amount of dialogue in Scarface. It's good dialogue too, and for the most part well acted. This really helps immerse you in Scarface's world and in Tony as a loveable scamp. It's not limited to cutscenes either - you can stop for a full conversation with just about anyone in the game the guy behind the bar, the hooker turning tricks on the street or the bikini babe down at the beach. It's a nice touch and there's no doubt that the audio department is this game's most formidable. Sure, it has the usual - very good - eclectic licensed soundtrack, but it also has the original score from the film and a massive voice cast; from James Woods and Elliott Gould to Ricky Gervais and Jason Mewes, from Ice T and N.O.R.E., to Cheech and Chong and B. Real and Sen Dog. And while Pacino is only there in sound-alike form, it's a damn good sound-alike.    The game also wins points by streamlining things and letting you get to the fun faster. Need an awesome car? Well, once you've hired a driver you can call one out from your garage as often as you like. Oh, and your guns (and chainsaw) are in the boot sir. This ties in with the game's Exotics system. The game is geared around increasing your Reputation about town, and what better way to do this than buying the most hell-ass opulent shit you can lay your hands on (sorry for the swears, fresh off a Scarface session and it kinda seeps into the blood)? So, cars, boats, tigers, solid gold dancers and a huge list of other goodies can also be bought. You can even redecorate the Mansion should you wish. This is a game that's all about making money, and thankfully it gives you plenty of ways to spend it too.   Miami's a little different than I imagined it.  And what, you ask, are the 'meat and potatoes' (or perhaps 'mirror and razor blade') of Scarface's gameplay? What do you spend your time doing? The answer is not so inspired for the most part. Your basic goal is to dominate each major turf in Miami by taking over all its fronts and running successful drug operations out of them. And to do this you need to convince the owners to let you do so (no standover tactics here - you're almost always running errands to gain their favour), then you need the cash to buy the front.    Cash is earned by dealing and through money rewards for a few other styles of missions. In the early game you're schlepping around to different contacts on your map. You'll buy drugs off a dealer (the cost determined by a boring golf-power-bar-style mini-game) then drive about visiting lower level dealers to sell it (the cost determined by a boring golf-power-bar-style mini-game). Once you've made some cash, it's time to head to the bank to launder it (the cut determined by a boring golf-power-bar-style mini-game). Die before you launder your money and it's adios, muchachos. If by muchachos, I mean money. Which I do. Later in the game you scale your operation up quite a bit - buying and smuggling coke in bulk, then driving it around to all your fronts. Honestly, you'd think Tony would have people for this kind of stuff.    Other missions see you dropping off packages (by land and by sea), collecting things, wailing on rival gangs, defending turf against rival gangs, chasing dimwits in cars, protecting VIPs and stuff you've done countless times before. It's a bit hard to avoid - a lot of the gameplay in Scarface is pretty rinse and repeat. Still, this is a vicious cycle of killing, dealing and acquisition that you'll no doubt enjoy. The driving model is particularly fun, the combat mechanics are solid, and hey, each time you go up a Reputation level you unlock more Exotics, more suppliers and more weapons, which then lets you kick just a little more butt. And look just a little bit more stylish while doing it.   Sadly though, Miami is not a particularly engaging place. Sure, it may be swampy and flat in real life, but no hills = boring! And the actual layout itself - long, thin sections of streets with inexplicable dead ends and no shortcut logic to their flow, gets repetitive and a little annoying quite quickly.   Tony's the sort of guy Ruddock would hire to 'police' Australian waters.  The visuals hold up relatively well but there's no question this game looks last gen. The fact that you can still see white seams on many of the character models and on some of the environment is a testament to that, and there's a lot of fade-in of trees and vehicles too - and not from a great distance either, but from close in. Changes in lighting conditions are also absurdly drastic - there are no subtle shifts here. That said, the expressive animations on Tony during cutscenes are great, and the game looks as good on Wii as it did on other systems.   Now, on to the Wii-specific controls that I mentioned, oh, 996 or so words ago. The implementation is flawed. The nuts and bolts of the system is that you move Tony with the Nunchuk while aiming and controlling the camera with the Wiimote. There are four sensitivity settings to choose from, each of which has a differently sized dead-spot, determining how fast you can spin the camera and how widely you can aim on screen. Sadly, we found all of the options to be slightly cumbersome in one way or another. The main complaint is that while the controls give you greater precision in aiming at enemies (plus there's a lock-on system), the flipside is that it feels clumsy moving the camera around. Sure, you can hit down on the D-pad to spin Tony 180 degrees, but even the D-pad is a little uncomfortable to get to when you spend most of your time using the trigger underneath. Thankfully, car and boat controls use the analogue stick, with the Wiimote only coming into play for manual targeting while driving. In some situations this works well, but for the most part it's just frustrating. Do the Drive-In mission early on to get a taste for just how impotent this system can be.    One word - splosion.  At the end of the day, while we appreciate the extra aiming accuracy, the Wii control system requires a little too much extra effort for too little gain. We found ourselves wishing we could just play it normally. Hardly a rousing endorsement, but the reality is that while the system works well for the most part, it's in tight clutch situations when you need precision the most that it will tend to fail you.Were left with a game that was almost-great on PS2 and Xbox, and is almost-great again on Wii. If youre a huge fan of the film though its well worth a look, and we have to say (and this goes for every version of the game)  any game that has a guy getting mauled by a tiger within ten minutes automatically gets at least one thumb up in our book. Oh, and you can swear at corpses too. Thats pretty cool, right?", "date": "Jul 17, 2007"}
