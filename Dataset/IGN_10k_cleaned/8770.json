Based on the events of the fifth Potter film -- which, from early reviews is apparently a very streamlined take on the book's complex plot machinations -- the Order of the Phoenix offers magic duels, flights with Hedwig, and lots of sneaking around Hogwarts.   Stealth is indeed a major component in the mobile Order of the Phoenix -- the game could almost be sub-titled Metal Gear Potter with all the teenage wonder wizard's shadow work. The halls of the school are regularly patrolled by prefects in search of too-curious students, so Harry and his friends must dart through the darkness to avoid being seen. If spotted, the prefect will unleash a magic volley at you. These are often hard to dodge and outrun thanks to the isometric camera (more on this shortly), so you must really watch for movement patterns and make sure you only move when the useful icons over the heads of the searchers reveal their blissful ignorance. Potter can cast spells to extinguish lanterns temporarily, which does help clear a path.   These sneaking scenes are moderate fun -- but the decision to go isometric, yet leave the movement controls assigned to 2, 4, 6, and 8 creates a bit of worrisome dissonance. You want to move diagonally to avoid being spotted or bumped into by a guard, but do you press 6 or 8 to move southeast? After a few stealth sections, I got pretty good about instinctively running around, but at first? I confess to my frustration. Also troublesome, getting stuck on small things in the shadows, such as the edges of banisters that are tough to see, especially when your being pursued.   As you dive deeper into the game, you'll deal with Death Eaters and discover the joys of Fainting Fancies. These candies knock out guards, but apparently are so good they cannot be resisted. Use the sweets to sedate guards and proceed through the grounds.   In addition to running around the grounds as Potter and his friends, you can also use Hedwig as a scout. Fly ahead with Hedwig to scope the movement patterns of the guards, but you must also keep the owl in the darkness. If spotted, the guards will zap Hedwig with a spell and send him flapping into the night.   The wizard duels are a little more casual than the more action-stealth scenes. The duels place you opposite of your opponent. Betwixt the two of you are four circles and a flailing magic wand. You must power up your magic spell by hitting OK (or 5) when the tip of your wand is over the circles. You get extra power for hitting the center of the circles and lose power if you hit OK when the wand it outside a circle. You can choose varying degrees of spell strength, from easy to very hard. The harder a spell, the more damage it does to an opponent; however, your wand is quicker and more erratic for powerful spells. After defeating an enemy, you can duel with them outside the main game. The duel mechanic is also used to cast spells in the main campaign.   EA Mobile has done a nice job recreating Hogwarts and its grounds for the smallest screen, and it's good to see actor likenesses used during dialogue sequences. But the developer has really outdone itself with the lighting effects. The colorful source lighting really makes the game pop. It also enhances the effectiveness of the shadows in the stealth scenes. This is a very, very good-looking game. And the sound -- at least on a BREW handset (I used an LG VX8300) -- is excellent. EA Mobile has secured soundtrack samples that really set the scene.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a good bit of entertainment for Potter fans -- which are legion. The game looks ace thanks to the brilliant lighting work. The magic duels are clever-casual, but I fear the sometimes tricky stealth scenes will frustrate. Getting stuck on blocks or futzing with controls can certainly deflate your experience. But as far as movie-based mobile games go, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the summer's best, respecting the source material and offering several visual treats.", "date": "Jul 6, 2007"}
