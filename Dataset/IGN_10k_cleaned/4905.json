Mighty Madden sat on top, while SEA, Acclaim, Sony, Microsoft, and Midway challenged for the crown. The same kinda scrap has hit the mobile world, with everybody from THQ Wireless to Sorrent getting ready to fire off football games every other week. The first in the push is JAMDAT, with JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 20005.   There's something to be said for being first.   Features:   All 32 NFL teams  Complete rosters  Quick Game and Season play options   JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 is nothing if not complete. Unlike many other previous football games, this one features more than just all 32 pro teams, it features every single player on the roster -- and the game shows you the player name when they make a big play. Even jersey colors, while not detailed enough to be readable, are the right color.   Many football games concentrate on providing the best offensive game possible. JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 has solid playbooks for both offensive and defensive plays, and it's easy to scroll through them using just your thumb. A simple sliding menu system allows you to scroll up and down to pick, say, a passing play. Then you can slide from left to right to choose what kind of pass you want. This is an excellent little system that we suspect will be copied in the next round of football games -- it's just too intuitive to leave alone.   But football games are about more than choosing plays -- this is a game of inches. And in a cellphone, that's pretty literal. JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 has a very tight system for running and passing. On-screen icons show which number pad key you must press to pass a ball, and a colored meter around the player shows how successful they will likely be at catching. Green is pure money while red almost guarantees an interception. You can use your phone's ~OK~ button (or its equivalent) to tackle and punt. It's nice to play a football game where you don't have to worry about eighteen-bazillion buttons.   If anything, JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 reminds us of a scaled-back console football game. The good thing is, they didn't scale back on the stuff that makes football the sport it is. Sure, there are fewer players on the field, but all of the necessary positions are covered. Is the play book as big as ESPN 2K5's? No, but it has all the required plays to not only break away and make touchdowns, but to stop a runner cold. It even has jukes.   JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 offers several play options. You can enjoy just a regular quick game, but more hardcore fans can choose between 7 or 16 game seasons. And yes, JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 saves your progress so you don't have to start all over, whether you need to take an incoming cal or pay attention in the back of the lecture hall.   JAMDAT has done a nice job scaling JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 2005 for different phones. We tested the game on a Motorola V710, but have seen it running on lesser handsets. The visuals are scaled back, but still look pretty good. On the V710, though, the game looked nice. There are good in-game sounds, and you can turn on vibration to feel tackles.JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 20005 was wise to get this game out ASAP, ahead of the field. Not only will they nab extra downloads from hungry football fans, but they set the bar for others to either measure up to or fail miserably. We've played some contenders, and can safely say there are some that will make the cut, and some that won't. Real football purists may be turned off by the corners JAMDAT cut, but casual fans that want a great football experience to go will be well-served by JAMDAT Sports' NFL Football 20005.", "date": "Aug 19, 2004"}
