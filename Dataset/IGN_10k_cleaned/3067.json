In a day when economic strategy games are recognized by the word ~tycoon~ at the end of their title, it's nice to see a new title developed along the same lines as one of the first really successful economic sims, M.U.L.E. At their most basic, these games tasked you to invest time and money in ventures that could turn a profit.   The curiously capitalized Space HoRSE is just such a game. It's a slightly new twist on M.U.L.E. which works for the game and against it. On the one hand, M.U.L.E. is a seminal achievement in gaming. On the other hand, a lot has gone on in the gaming world in the 20 years since its release. While the gameplay is still solid, we naturally expect more from games today.   The actual context for the game is pretty slight -- apart from a few suggestive cutscenes, it's all told in the first paragraph of the manual. You're part of a four-part team sent to a new planet and tasked with creating a functioning, self-sufficient colony. There is also something about pirates.   Anyway, you and three other prospectors each start with some cash and a plot of land. The types of land produce varying amounts of the game's four resources -- food, power, titanium and zirconium. But in order to collect resources, you have to buy a Holistic Robotic Slave Engineer (or HoRSE -- now I get it) to work the land for you.   There's a time limit for every turn, so you'll need to take control of your prospector and run back and forth from the warehouse to the field to manage your land. Managing this is pretty straightforward. You can use the classic joystick approach or simply hold the mouse where you'd like to run. The only real pain in the ass is that you have to drop off the HoRSEs right at the flag in the separate plots. If you're too far away, the HoRSE runs off never to return. It might seem needlessly picky (and it is) but it adds a little extra pressure to the game that's quite needed.   The warehouse sells HoRSEs and analyzes land samples for you. It also lets you put some of your own land plots up for auction and trade with other human players. If you find yourself done with your turn with extra time remaining, head to the pub where you can trade that time in for gambling winnings.   The game itself lasts only twelve turns. As you buy more land, you build more HoRSEs and trade more goods and hope that your increased profits meet or exceed your overhead. Run short on food and you'll find yourself starting next turn with less time; run out of power and your HoRSEs bring in fewer resources. If you're not harvesting titanium, you might not even have any HoRSEs to buy anyway.   The only completely useless resource is Zirconium. But although it's not used for anything directly, it fetches extremely high prices in the market place. This makes for a nice balance, as you have to have some HoRSEs support the upkeep of others with food and power.   Before you can start bringing it in you'll need to survey land for Zirconium deposits. There are three nodes on each map, each surround by rings of lesser concentrations. The AI doesn't seem to have a clue here. Within the first few turns I can usually nail two of the locations and have a good guess about the third just from watching the survey messages of other players. For some reason the AI doesn't seem to get that a light deposit next to a medium deposit leads to a big deposit.   In between the turns you'll take part in a real-time trading phase with all the other players. The AI does a whole let better here taking care to keep the demand steady while also watching for chances to undercut you. But they still miss out on the real fun of shutting another player out of a resource entirely. If you can find other humans to play with (which seems unlikely)   You see the stock that each player and the warehouse have before choosing to be a buyer or seller. The buyers and sellers are placed on opposite sides of a bidding board and by holding down the mouse buttons, you can raise or lower the price at which you're willing to sell or buy a commodity. Once the price of a buyer meets the price of a seller, you start exchanging the goods for cash.   There are a few neat things about this system. First off, it all happens in real time with the various players trying to outbid each other. The game is nicely balanced in that, if two players offer the same bid, the buy or sell is credited to the player who's lowest in the standings coming in to the turn. The less needed goods of titanium and zirconium are traded before those that you need so you can make some money off of other commodities in case you have to buy food or power.   The necessary commodities of food and power spoil between turns, making the game more about producing things efficiently than about stockpiling resources. This focus on breaking even is a nice change of pace but the game provides no benefit from this other than that it frees up more effort to harvest titanium and zirconium. And since the warehouse is usually available to buy surplus, you can usually reduce your stock with little problem.   There's also not a great deal of replay value in terms of variety. While the game randomizes things like mountain placement and zirconium availability, that central warehouse with the river running north to south just gets monotonous after a while. Have it run left to right for a change. The game definitely rewards players with some neat effects and messages between turns (about how investments in independent gaming pay off in one humorous example).   What did you think of Space HoRSE?   The production values here are on par with games from 10 or 15 years ago not only in terms of design but also in terms of graphics and sound. I respect that the game is the product of one person and, judged as that, it's remarkable that everything comes across as well as it does. But you can't pass off mediocre graphics simply as homage to a 20-year-old game. The same is true of the sound. While the game's sound and theme have a campy, nostalgic appeal, some gamers may prefer to cut the sound off altogether.   That's as good a way to sum the game up as any.  Space HoRSE is a fun game that really took me back to the days of junior high. And for an hour or so, it was really fun. But after that, the game just seemed dated. It's interesting from a standpoint of history or nostalgia to see what worked back then try to work today.  Since our expectations are so different today, you can't create the same impressions by merely duplicating a game model.Although it might be worth a shot on sale, it's not worth the $30 price tag, especially since there's a demo out that'll give you a real taste of what this one's about. For anyone who's interested in this history of games and hasn't played the original M.U.L.E. this is definitely the next best thing.", "date": "Oct 16, 2002"}
