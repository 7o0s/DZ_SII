You've played through Rune, but now what are you gonna do?  Well if you're into going head-to-head against a few other Viking-wannabes, Human Head's brand-new Rune expansion Halls of Valhalla might be just the thing to quell your Viking urges...or is it?  In case you don't know, Halls of Valhalla is the multiplay-only expansion for Rune.  The main addition to the Rune universe is two new game types.  Since Steve already described it so eloquently in his preview, and since I'm quite lazy, here's a rundown of the game types you'll find in Halls of Valhalla, directly from our preview.  The first new game type is Head-Ball. Human Head had originally intended to include something similar to this mode in the original game. Fortunately, deadline constraints kept the feature from being implemented. I say fortunately because now we get a better-developed version of the game. Head-Ball is basically a capture the flag variant with limbs and heads standing in for flags. Up to four teams will be able to compete for ownership of severed body parts. Points are scored when those body parts are thrown into hoops scattered around the level.    The Arena mode was included at the request of the gaming community. Many players wanted a more directed duel mode where they could battle their enemies in a one-on-one environment. Whoever wins the match remains in the arena to face the next challenger. A weapons rack stands outside the arena for prospective combatants to arm themselves for the coming challenge.    Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you that both games are fairly unremarkable.  Head-Ball is by far the better of the two game types.  If you read my original review of Rune, you may recall I thought that ~the game is just screaming for a 'Capture the Head' mode where you have to collect a severed head from each of your opponents and deposit it in a sacrificial urn. If any mod developers want to steal my idea, feel free...just let me know so I can play.~  Well, I got my wish!  Since points are scored for actually getting a body part into a receptacle rather than for making a kill, it adds a creative and zany twist to multiplay, and I love the concept behind the game type.  However, implementation is a different story. It is sometimes difficult to grab a severed limb after it has plopped to the ground.  More often than not I would end up grabbing the weapon of my fallen foe rather than his arm or head, which became particularly frustrating, especially since stopping to pick up anything in the game leaves yourself wide open for a good decapitation.  The Arena mode was far less appealing to me.  After you're done selecting your weapon for the fight, you have to wait in a queue until your turn is up, which can be a long wait if you're five or six challengers deep. While the idea behind Arena was kind of neat, if you want to duel one-on-one, why not just set up a server and limit it to two players rather than making me wait around until the fight is finished?  I play action games for action, not to wait around for the action.  While a few of the maps do include things to do while waiting for your turn -- like throwing axes at goblins or practicing on wooden dummies -- you know the old saying: ~The waiting is the hardest part.~  While to the victor go the spoils, I thought the fact that the winner instantly heals after every round defeated the real challenge of Arena.  A superior player is going to be able to take out a weaker challenger all day, but it would be a whole different game if the champion stayed at the same health level as when the bout ended rather than starting the next match at full health.  The biggest problem with both game types though is that, although the network code has been upgraded, it's still mired by too many lag problems that take away from the playability, especially since this is a melee combat game. While it varied from server to server, I wasn't the only one having problems as more than one person was complaining about lag on nearly every server I joined. Since most of the fighting in Rune is toe-to-toe, you have to be close to your opponent to hit him, and lag lessens your chances to effectively do that.  I was also pretty disappointed in the number of people actually playing Rune online.  Even at peak times, I usually found only about 80 Rune servers, with only a handful of those populated with more than one or two people.  Today, a week after the game's release, there were still only two Head-Ball servers up, with a combined total of seven players between both.  Arena faired better with 11 servers and 33 players, but that's still a sad online presence, especially since the only thing you get out of this expansion is more online play.   While there are 37 new environments in Halls of Valhalla (nine Arena, eight Head-Ball, and 20 Deathmatch), with few exceptions, the new arenas are unremarkable, dark, and bland.  None of them really stand out as monumental achievements in architecture, and most of the Arena maps are just that...big stone arenas with little that distinguishes them from one another.  The sixteen new character models look good, and the team has thrown in a few female characters into the fray, but they reused all of the same Ragnar animations, so none of the models have any distinguishing characteristics or moves.    The same can be said for the soundtrack in Halls of Valhalla.  Everything sounds crisp and clean, but it's just not very interesting.  The same canned sound effects from the original can be found in Halls of Valhalla, and the sound of metal-on-metal gets rather annoying after you hear it over and over and over and over.  All in all I wasn't too impressed with Halls of Valhalla.  I enjoyed the original game quite a bit, but Rune's forte was never multiplay, so I don't really understand what was behind the decision to go with a multiplayer-only expansion.  There are no new weapons, no new Rune powers, and no new single-player levels.  My biggest complaint with Halls of Valhalla is that there simply isn't enough here to justify paying for it if you own the original game, and those of you who don't already have the game won't find much here to keep you entertained.  Sure, it's a stand-alone expansion, but it's not a good stand-alone expansion.  Rune was all about the single-player experience.  Please Human Head...give me some more of that and I'll be happy.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
