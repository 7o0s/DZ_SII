Everyone knows DDR now.  It was on that one episode of King of the Hill, even.  As such, reviews like this one can cut to the chase, skipping from the boring question of ~what is it?~ to the more pertinent ~how much is there?~  In this case, the answer is ~an awful lot.~  DDRMAX is the first game in the series to appear on PlayStation 2, using all that extra disc space to pack in more than 60 songs.  Konami has also done American players the courtesy of including some extra songs, exclusive to the US release, to make up in part for the six or eight months of lag time in the localization.  One wonders, however, how much of a factor the import phenomenon is anymore, now that the game has become so popular in the United States.  It's safe to say that a much larger percentage of this game's potential user base is not an importer in comparison to earlier US DDR games, so it's a good thing that this happens to be the best US DDR yet.  Gameplay We can skip over the basics here, since you presumably already know how to play.  If you don't know how to play, there's a simple step-by-step guide over here.  Now, on to the important bits.  The song listing, aside from being much longer than any previous games in the series, seems tuned much more intelligently than earlier US releases.  Whatever the reason, this is a much more danceable lineup overall, with a focus on faster beats and fewer dogs like ~Silent Night~ and the N.M.R. back catalog.  There's no Mr. Ed Jumps the Gun, so far as I can tell, but as always, you can't have everything.  As for noteworthy options, there are now four levels of difficulty (including the absurdly tough Oni Mode) to go along with immediately-available single, versus, and double-pad play.  Edit Mode is not a new addition, but it's more flexible this time out, making it easier to design your own step patterns and routines for particular songs.  Likewise Workout Mode is not new, but it's definitely an old favorite, and worthy of inclusion through the rest of the series.  Freeze Arrows are actually new, thrown in to mix up the game proper -- borrowed from Para Para Paradise and Dance Maniax, these are steps where you have to hold on a particular button until the arrow lets up.  Otherwise, this is the DDR we know and love, or at the very least the DDR we pull out now and again just to make sure we have some sort of dexterity left in our feet.  The variety of songs dwarfs the PS2 version, especially once all the extras are unlocked, and the selection of options is similarly extensive.  Graphics Does anyone look at anything besides the arrows?  Heck, if you're really good, you don't even need to look.  Thus, one wonders whether as much attention needs to be paid to the visuals in a game like this as Konami's designers seem to think.  One can appreciate the backgrounds while someone else is playing, though, and the developers have put some extra effort forward this time.  Several songs now sport pre-rendered background animations a la Para Para, and the variety of background movies has naturally increased substantially along with the song list.  The menu interface has sharpened considerably, with high-res graphics appearing now that the series has jumped to PS2.  Navigation is still much the same as before, but the menu screens are much nicer to look at.  There are a few counter-intuitive ergonomic decisions -- it's a bit odd that one presses left and right to select a song, since the list is arranged in a vertical arc -- but nothing that develops into any kind of significant annoyance.  Sound Sounds like DDR to me.  The announcer voice has changed a little, with the addition of more quips (mainly egregious puns on or misinterpretations of the fragment ~max~), but otherwise, you could close your eyes and mistake this for any other game in the series.  Not that there's anything wrong with that -- DDR has developed an aural character that it is welcome to stick with in perpetuity.There's not much to say here, but what there is to say is almost uniformly positive.  This is far and away the best DDR compilation available on the home market, and fanatics will find it more than worth the investment.  The song-to-dollar ratio, after all, has never been better, unless you could find a copy of Konamix marked down to $20 (which, upon reflection, is likely possible).But never mind that.  DDRMAX is the one you want this season, and it should last you a good long while.  There's a 7th Mix waiting in the wings, but this is more than enough for now.", "date": "Oct 11, 2002"}
