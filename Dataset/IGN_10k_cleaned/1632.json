The game follows the releases of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 and Dave Mirra BMX for the handheld  those games were very good, but Road Champs BXS is great  as extreme games go on the portable, this is the best one yet. Features Four modes 27 courses More than 50 tricks Password save Only for Game Boy Color  I didn't come to this conclusion right off the bat  the game has a serious learning curve issue. From the get-go, you don't have access to the main game. To actually get into the competitions, you have to get through the extensive training mode that takes at least an hour to complete. While this seems pretty darn extreme, believe me  you'll be glad it's there. The game has so much complexity in its controls and stunts that you'll need the training to learn all that's in there.  The game doesn't offer full freedom like Dave Mirra does  instead, it's very similar to the structure of Tony Hawk 2 on the Game Boy Color through the use of a strict side-scrolling engine. You can break the plane and head north and south in specific locations of the arenas, but 99% of the game is in a left-to-right layout. But don't think that this hurts the game  other than some weird control issues that you have to learn, the game plays excellently. In fact, the playability increases because you don't have to worry about landing tricks at angles  the perspective is very cut-and-dry, and simple to follow. Road Champs isn't a racing game  while there are some ~get to the start to finish in the set time~ tasks, the majority of the design requires you to perform as many tricks as you can in the given time. And what a library of moves you have  there are, in total, more than 50 different moves you can pull off Road Champs. Not all tricks are available from the start  the later challenges give you access to some of the sweeter moves in the game.  Moves are pulled off by gaining enough speed by pushing right or left on the pad, and then holding either the A or B button and pushing the control pad in a specific direction when launching off a Vert ramp (quarter pipe), Fun Box (two back-to-back quarter pipes connected by a higher platform), or Spine (two quarter pipes connected back-to-back). There's no ~jump~ action, so controls are thankfully simplified so you can focus on the tricks necessary to perform. Because speed is a necessity in the game, you have a meter at the bottom . Grind tricks can only be performed if the speed meter is in the first two blocks  holding the B button down will keep your bike at grinding speed.  Each level has its own task to complete. Most of them revolve around earning a set point score before time runs out, while others involve performing different tricks. Probably the most difficult and most awkward tasks have to do with the levels that require 30+ different tricks before time runs out. It's difficult to keep track of what you've done, and most of the time it's guesswork to find the moves you haven't already pulled off. But this is the only style of level that could have been improved on...the rest are challenging and amazingly fun.  The game's graphics are absolutely gorgeous and add to the experience immensely. The character sprite is built from a library of amazingly realistic and smooth animations, each trick looking just as slick and impressive as watching a real-life BMX rider pull off the same stunts. The backgrounds are also extremely detailed using as many colors as possible. It's an excellent production all the way through.  The game is a lot of fun to play  it's just not incredibly deep. But what's been done here is excellent, offering a ton of moves and tricks in its simple perspective and complex control structure. The game's high learning curve and occasionally confusing level structure hurt the overall rating, but throwing some money towards the purchase of Road Champs BXS wouldn't be a bad move at all.", "date": "Dec 13, 2000"}
