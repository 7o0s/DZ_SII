Other football game makers added arcade elements to their sim games. Gamers that couldn't get into the strongside coverage and play action fakes found in football sims, had an easy time getting into the fast pace and simple mechanics of  Midway's arcade conversion. So what do they do for an encore? Add two more human controlled players and a play editor feature, something usually found in sims, and unleash it on the public as NFL Blitz 2000.  Features  ~Blitz Passing~ -- Each receiver assigned to a button.  Redesigned Front End -- Menus are easier to navigate and more comprehensive.  Wind -- Field goals and punts will be affected by wind.  Audibles -- Call offensive and defensive plays at the line of scrimmage  Customized Plays and Playbooks  Play Editor -- Design original plays for offense and defense  Secret Heads -- 10 new secret heads  5 New Stadiums  Punt Meter -- Player controlled punts and hang time meter  Smarter Artificial Intelligence  Updated 1999 rosters and teams, including Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans Four-Player Mode   Gameplay The bread and butter of Blitz is the super fast and super violent gameplay that was born with the great arcade game NBA Jam and expertly adapted for football by the team at Midway. The turbo charged running and passing, side laterals, vertical air attack, crushing tackles and that all-important extra curricular activity after the play is in there for 2000. It's almost a shame but the wealth of new features like the extra stadiums, wind effects and play editor still play second banana to the skull crushing gameplay that we loved in last year's game.   The offense is more or less the same with three pages of plays to choose from and similar pass patterns available. Choosing plays is a little more critical this year with the improved defensive A.I. The computer controlled teams will blitz more often on third down. Conservative play calling is out the window because there are very few out patterns in the game. There will be no nickel and diming your way down the field here. You have to be aggressive and go up top or hope that you called a play that will confound the defense so a receiver will be open right off the line.  The new four player mode is actually the best enhancement to Blitz' gameplay. You get four buddies together, choose your teams and let the insults and trash talking begin. This was one of the main knocks against the first Blitz game for the N64, which was only 2 players, and it has been properly corrected this time around. When playing with the full four players, each pair of teammates will switch off on the play calling and quarterback duties when you're on offense. So even if you have a guy who's great at playing quarterback he'll be playing as a reciever every other offensive series. That is, unless you switch controllers every time. Which isn't too far fetched because the competition in Blitz can get pretty intense.  There's the beloved ~cheating~ A.I., as we call it, that will have you cursing everyone in the room, the game, your N64, the TV and even Midway as unexplainable turnovers and boneheaded plays plague you at least three times a game. But that's part of the Blitz experience, so it shouldn't be counted as a negative. Like Jam before it, it won't be uncommon for you to win, or lose, a game on the last possession of the game. The key is to power through it with skill, perseverance and calm nerves. If you're playing 2-on-2 with friends, having two hotheads on the same team will certainly lead to self destruction. Instead, know that Blitz will eventually have to cheat in your favor. It may be once it maybe five times, but you'll get your breaks eventually. Just because you've fumbled three times in the first quarter doesn't mean you're out of the game just yet. In fact, you're just three interceptions away from being right back in it. That's how you have to look at it.   Also, be prepared for some of the wildest plays you've ever seen in your life. For example, we completed a pass to Cris Carter and had  clear shot at the end zone. Of course, breakaway speed for receivers is darn near non-existent, at least after they catch the ball, so he was caught at the 2 yard line by some tub-o-lard linemen from the Lions who forced  fumble. The screen rotates and Mr. Tubbo starts carrying the ball back the other way, when we crush him with a fired up Randall Cunningham who also forces a fumble. Here comes super speedy Randy Moss to scoop up the ball. He shakes, shimmies and catapults into the endzone for the TD. While this is exciting, it's a great way to frazzle the nerves, especially when you're playing against some friends. And we love it.  All of this is without even mentioning all of the powerups and ~Fire~ boosts that you can activate in the game. There's nothing like passing to a reciever that's one fire and watching him carry maybe one or two defenders on his back as he trudges into the endzone. It'll drive your buddies crazy when you do it to them.   The new Blitz Passing is the second biggest addition to the franchise. Some may have trouble with the directional passing that has you holding the analog stick in the direction of the leftmost, center or rightmost receiver you want. Blitz runs so fast that in the heat of the moment you might be highlighting the left guy and as you press the pass button you quickly switch to the center man and throw into double coverage. With Blitz passing the left, center and right receivers are mapped to the left, top and right C-buttons respectively. Blitz passing is live al the time, just like the conventional analog passing and doesn't have to be activated. One step is eliminated since you just snap the ball with A and hit the C button for the desired receiver. This will allow you to pull of those double and triple laterals behind the line of scrimmage with the speed and efficiency of the computer controlled teams. Very nice addition.  The play editor feature that allowed you to take your masterpieces to the arcade game of Blitz '99 is now limited to just the N64. It's expanded to allow for three pages of your own offensive plays and one page of custom defensive plays. The best part is you can practice your offensive plays against every defense in the game and work out the kinks before you run through the league with it. Of course, no play is perfect so there's a way to stop whatever spinning, juking, turboing pass route you can come up with. That's why they let you write entire playbooks. Of course a full novel of playbooks and saved Blitz 2000 season will pretty  much eat up every spot of space on your controller pak.  Sound Sound is half the battle and Blitz 2000 has a heck of an advantage here too. The grunts and moans of players as they bash and smash into each other are varied enough to notice the differences but they can get a little redundant. What we would look forward too are the little comments from the players after certain plays. Whether it's a trash talking lineman snickering ~you're getting killed out here,~ while he's pointing at you will have you fired up and begging for more at the same time. The NFL license agreement, must have included a clause that allowed for the ridicule of quarterbacks because they come off like weenies in this game. After a big sack, you'll sometimes here Steve Young whine ~come on guys, pass protection.~ Hilarious. The announcer is fairly witty too, but you will be completely familiar with his arsenal of catchphrases after the first few hours of play. We did like his one comment where he says, ~Wow, he tore his head off, well not really, but....~   Graphics This is the corner Midway cuts when they make Blitz because the blocky simply drawn players free up space on the cart that's then used for all that great speed and sound. Pushing 14 characters around a simple but pretty stadium appears to be cinch for the N64 and is a good example of what can be done on the system when you put some sharp programmers on it. If Blitz were a sim, the blocky players would be a major drawback but the extra husky muscle dudes fit right in with testosterone driven action of the game. The graphics and gameplay work hand in hand in this case and really couldn't do without each other.   The new stadiums are nice to look at for about 4 seconds as you get ready for the opening kickoff of the game, but after that you won't notice them too much. We like the new downtown stadium that always seems to come up when we play with the Browns. It's like Camden Yards except with football dimensions. The fog effects that you can select with the old 3-button combination code look like misty haze and not a sorry excuse to cheapen the look of the game.  Midway does a fine job of making sure their games are as accurate and true to the arcade original across all platforms. Some jobs are done better than others, but with Blitz 2000, the effort seems to have really paid off. While there are only a handful of additions to last years game, the four player option was an obvious call and Blitz passing is a goodie that I didn't know I wanted until I got it. It's not fair to compare Blitz 2000 to sims like Madden or QBC but I can say that it stands out among sports titles for the N64. You want fast action and yet another way to beatdown your friends? B2000 will keep you attached to the TV way past your bedtime.", "date": "Aug 19, 1999"}
