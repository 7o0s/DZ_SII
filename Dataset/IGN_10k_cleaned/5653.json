Even though this first-person shooter features slick graphics, cool weapons, a mean arsenal, and the obligatory multiplayer mode, it's the pacing that makes it so fantastic.   Nathan Frost is a futuristic soldier sworn to protect the state against its many enemies. Fortunately for him, the state has augmented its chilly grunt with an array of technologically advanced superpowers. Using these unnatural abilities and a whole load of guns, Nate kicks people's asses.   The unpretentious, no-frills storyline admirably attempts to weave together a plot about one maniacal super villain and the powerful EMP weapon he intends to use to devastate whole cities. But Nate's basic role as gun-toting point man for all things Armed Forces is plenty enough for Project: Snowblind to work. Even though we'd love to see the more in-depth characters and superlative writing / acting that Crystal D's previous Soul Reaver series was so well known for, Snowblind is pieced together with such style and tenacity that the lack of a legitimately engaging plot is practically irrelevant.   Like Allied Assault, Call of Duty, and a dozen other war games before it, Snowblind drops its protagonist in the middle of a lot of action and alongside or against dozens of enemies. Smartly, none of the AI comrades in Snowblind are controllable, which lets the player focus on preserving his own life while enjoying the bursts, rattles and blasts of warfare through a bunch of hearty missions.   Standalone missions with no real cohesion can put a hamper on even the most excellent games of this type, so Crystal Dynamics opted to highlight the aforementioned storyline with mixed results. What the company also did was tie together strings of combat with the occasional computer interaction and mildly interesting pseudo-puzzle. Rhythmic or otherwise cleverer mini-games would have created computer interactions that were more interesting, but we can hardly fault the developers for omitting these specific gameplay variations, for they might have detracted from the action and the action needed to be relentless. Thankfully, this makes Snowblind a very well-paced and frantic game.   Electro Pain Is My Game The campaign directs players through fairly linear environments bristling with heavily armed enemies. Right from the beginning, Snowblind holds on tight and never loosens its grip. Our Snowblind-flavored adrenaline rush doesn't come from particularly smart enemies necessarily, but they feel fearsome enough. Oftentimes baddies are able to home in on Nathan's exact whereabouts, letting them inexplicably chase down the player with little mercy. They even roll and seek out cover when fired at, giving the impression that at least some of them are genuinely intelligent.   What is most exciting about the combat, however, isn't the AI... it's something else. The ~cool~ comes from Snowblind's wonderful use of a variety of different enemies against wildly differing environments, combined with the occasionally overpowered piece of machinery. It's simply exciting to run down a corridor while the glass windows to your left explode from helicopter fire, the enemies to your front roll to relative safety, and the automated turrets on your back roar to the sound of alarms. And then you empty into a courtyard where a dozen of your men are entrenched on one side fending off a dozen enemies who themselves have walking death-mechs in their liege. Pretty frickin' badass stuff! A good arsenal of weapons that exhibit the rich, robust feel of a well designed first-person shooter make dealing with these foes enjoyable, though the vehicles provided (even the mech thing) work off unpredictable, floaty, and downright wonky physics.   With or without cars and mechs, the action is further highlighted by the nano-technological powers that include a slow time ability, a form of electrical shield, a better sight, and others. These all work well enough and come in handy in extreme pinches, but you won't be obliged to keep turning the slow time on and off or keep raising the electrical shield. The technological upgrades may be a distinguishing factor of the character, but they actually don't play too heavily in the game. From a negative perspective, this implies that Crystal Dynamics didn't create engaging enough power-ups, but our more generally positive look thinks the game doesn't require the use of these powers because it doesn't have to. The combat alone is engaging and designed in such a way to not require a lot of forced, superfluous power use. Basically, the gunplay alone is great so it doesn't need anything else, but the something else that's there works great if you want it to.   What makes Snowblind even more interesting and appealing are the environments. Detailed, rich, soft, and vividly colored, Snowblind creates rain soaked ghettos, lush temple gardens, and the interiors of sci-fi monstrosities with relative ease. When you consider that all of this is being done with no less than a dozen characters fighting each other on-screen, it seems quite impressive. While the character models don't always share the meticulous detail of the game's many environments, they do animate nicely. On PC these qualities seem a bit standard, however. We would have expected higher resolution textures, crisper lighting effects and generally more impressive environments (some in-game options wouldn't hurt, either).   As you progress through these nicely rendered shattered streets and crazy techno-nightmare industrial zones, you'll realize that you're constantly being pumped into progressively more interesting environments, which lets Snowblind eventually peak at its climax. When the campaign ecstasy does ultimately end, you'll at least have multiplayer to sooth your aches.   Since it's now a prerequisite, Crystal Dynamics has rounded off Snowblind with a typically comprehensive multiplayer mode that includes LAN and online play. We have more general details on that here, but we're not in a position to speak at length about its online performance with a server full of people since it's a relatively low populated game. Still, suffice to say that while it features the occasionally interesting mode (Hunter, namely), Snowblind suffers from being too generic in light of every other shooter to come along boasting identical competitive modes with few unique standouts.Snowblind epitomizes sound development. It's as well-rounded a title as we're likely to see in this current generation of gaming. But, that doesn't mean it's perfect. The solid mechanics within this neatly presented package still lack a certain degree of charm, but Snowblind more than makes up for its slight hint of the mundane with a diverse and extraordinarily well-paced sort of action. And, even in a PC market flooded by quality FPS titles, that still means something.", "date": "Apr 1, 2005"}
