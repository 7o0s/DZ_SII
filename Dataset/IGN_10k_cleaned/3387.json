Instead of flying from town to town pawning off illegal substances, your task in Sea Trader is to sail from port to port buying and selling goods in the shops. The challenge is to try and score as much gold in a set amount of time, becoming rich off of the supply and demand off of the several different cities in the world. This game's more about luck than strategy, though, as there are more random than planned elements in the gameplay. The somewhat unimpressive slideshow interface and lack of any elements that require gaming skill are a bit underwhelming, too, but even with those in place, this trading game isn't that bad of a GBA game. Features Four selectable first mates Three modes of play Cartridge save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Back before the days of FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service, the seas were the only way to get goods from far off lands. In Sea Trader: Rise of Taipan, your task is to grow your trading business and get rich off of buying and selling commodities within the different bustling city ports of China and beyond. By purchasing items at a low cost from one port, and selling them at a high price at another, you earn money. Economy 101.  But Sea Trader is a little more involved than just buying and selling. The challenge is to get the most money within the one, five, or ten-year period (the timeframe determined by the game option at the start of the adventure). At the start of the game, players take their pick of First Mate, each with his or her own trading strengths; one's better at negotiating for better price, one specializes on firepower during pirate raids. It all depends on your plan of attack in the world of economics which first mate you should choose. Some ports will offer a much, much lower price for goods than what you've paid for, so it's best holding onto your commodities until you can unload them for a high profit. The programmers did a good job making it easy to see when a situation will earn or lose money for the player.  Even though the game's all about earning the gold, players will have to spend money to make money. Their ship will need to grow in order to survive the elements. Players will have to front some cash to increase the size of the cargo hold so that they can carry more booty and sell larger amounts of commodities in less time. A larger sail will speed up the trip across the sea, shaving off a day or two between each trip. A better trained crew and more powerful cannons will make defeating and boarding pirate ships more effective. And lets not forget that the ship will take damage from shallow waters, pirate attacks, and random weather events...repairs are necessary to keep the boat afloat. Money also comes into play when buying rounds of drinks to get the bartender to tell juicy rumors of lucrative situations, or bribing customs officials to carry the less-legal, more expensive booty as well as buying maps to gain access to the other parts of the world.  The game is really for fans of games like Defender of the Crown, but even Cinemaware's GBA rendition is far more interesting because it actually involves the player beyond simply allocating funds for items with its mini-games that actually invite the gamer to take control over the situations. In Sea Trader, the only spontaneous ~action~ moment happens at sea when moving from port to port; players will encounter pirate ships and harbor guards that they'll have to get past, either by negotiation or brute force. These moments beg for cool mini-games, but all players will get are turn-based menu selections; attacks against opposing ships are determined by the computer, much like rolling the dice in a paper RPG. And though there's nothing terribly wrong with what the designers offer here, it's a missed opportunity...especially for the action-focused GBA crowd.  Don't expect to be bowled over in the game's interface, either. Though the artwork's nice in its comic book-style drawings, there's nothing going on in this game that couldn't have been done on lesser hardware. Sea Trader is really just a bunch of menus wrapped around some pretty, unanimating graphics. But even with the unimpressive presentation and distinct lack of any sort of skill or action-based sequences, Sea Trader is an involving game that gives players a sizable gaming experience...at least when it comes to how long it takes to finish a career. And it's definitely got a fair share of replay value, since the game focuses on earning high scores and awards during careers, keeping track of the statistics in the cartridge's save RAM. It's definitely possible to get lost in the ~gameplay~ of Sea Trader...just don't expect a whole lot of ~pizazz~ while you do.", "date": "Jan 23, 2003"}
