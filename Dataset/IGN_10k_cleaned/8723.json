It's awesome, a pretty powerful piece of hardware -- it delivered possibly the greatest-looking console game ever last year with Gears of War. It set you back several hundred dollars (not to mention what you paid for your HD television set so you can enjoy the 360 in crisp, widescreen glory). So what do you want to do with this sophisticated bit of machinery?  That's right, you want to play board games. Lucky for you, the Xbox Live Arcade has some good ones. The latest real-world box of cards, dice, and game pieces to be translated into 0s and 1s is Carcassonne, and it's another fine addition to the XBLA.   Carcassonne is a relatively new board game, introduced in 2000 by German music teacher Klaus-Jrgen Wrede. Gameplay revolves around the titular French fortress and pits up to five players against each other in a mass land grab. A deck of 72 tiles symbolizing different structures (castles, monasteries, roads) are drawn one-by-one at random by each player, which they then strategically place in an attempt to claim their part of the city. When the deck is gone, the player with the largest and most structures (generating the most points) wins. Such is the basic premise of Carcassonne.   The way you claim structures as your own is by placing ~followers~ on them as markers. Once a follower is on a structure it's yours and the other players can't earn points from it (unless they merge their structure with yours). In order to receive full points for a building you must complete it, otherwise you'll only be partially rewarded at the end of the game. You have but a small number of followers, though, so you can't go around marking your territory everywhere. Once a structure is completed you'll get your follower back and you can place him elsewhere.   There is plenty of depth to be discovered within the city's fortified walls. After a few rounds of play, you'll discover it usually isn't enough to focus on your own structures -- you'll need to play offensively and try to block your opponents from completing theirs. Players will find themselves debating between completing a castle or waiting for extension pieces to make it even bigger and secure more points. Or you can piggyback on your competitor's success by building your castle into theirs and earning you both points. Carcassonne is a mix of luck (based on what tiles you draw) and strategy.   You'll have to decide whether to go for small castles and quick points, or wait it out and hope to cash in with a huge fortress. The look of the game, while not technically demanding, is bright and colorful. As a round progresses, the city will soon be too big to fit on your screen. But each player has their own camera control for pan and zoom, so you don't have to miss out on any action. When you zoom out to a certain distance, the cursor will follow whichever player is taking a turn, by default. If you're really into building your territory on a far corner of the map, you might not pay any attention to what your opponents are doing. There are a lot of different approaches you can take to a game of Carcassonne, which is one of its major strengths.   A weakness, however, for this XBLA version is that there isn't much of a single-player mode. You can always take on computer opponents, but aside from a handful of achievements to be unlocked on your own there isn't any compelling reason to play by yourself. It would be nice if developers took the time to flesh out the single-player modes in these board game translations.   We were surprised to experience some lag when venturing online, as running the game should be a pretty simple affair. There was a slightly delayed response whenever we moved a tile around the board. We quickly got used to it, but it's really not something we should be seeing in casual games like this. Other than that, though, play over Xbox Live is largely enjoyable. Players' gamer photos are listed next to their tags in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, and if you have a Vision Cam connected to your 360 you can distract your enemies while you play in the nude (the way Carcassonne was meant to be played, if you ask this reviewer).   The music is a charming medieval tune -- but there's only the one ditty, so after a few plays you may find yourself turning the music down so you can add your own soundtrack (we recommend Yes). Sound effects arethere, but, really, you're not playing Carcassonne for a hi-fidelity audio experience, are you?   The real-world board game has received numerous add-ons and expansions, and one of the most popular is included in the XBLA version: The River. This subtly deceptive change to gameplay forces players to play ~river~ tiles for their first few rounds. When the last river tile is placed, you can then start building the city as normal. The effect is you plan the layout of the entire city in the first few rounds, then you're forced to adapt to this form as you continue through the game. You'll probably want to claim some territory as the river is being built, so you can place followers as it is created -- but you'll need to make sure you can finish those structures later on. There are many, many other expansions for Carcassonne, and hopefully Sierra will be releasing some of them as downloadable content down the line.That Carcassonne is a great game was never in question -- it's one of the most successful board games in recent years.  The question was whether or not an Xbox Live Arcade version would retain what made the real-world game fun, and the answer is ~indeed.~  There are no pieces to set up and lose, you can play against people all over the world, and at $10 it costs less than half of the retail version.  A case could be made that this is a much better value than the physical game.  In fact, you should probably just burn all your board games, because before long there's bound to be a great version of each one on XBLA.", "date": "Jun 29, 2007"}
