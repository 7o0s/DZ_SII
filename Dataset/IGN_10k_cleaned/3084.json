In the football arena alone, we've had our choice of Madden 2003, Sega's NFL 2K3, and even Midway's latest over-the-top Blitz entry.  But what self-respecting videogame console could do without Left Field Production's brand-new, hard-hitting Backyard Football title?  Apparently those of both Sony and Microsoft, as this little package of pigskin whoop-ass is exclusive to the Cube for some mysterious reason.  Please note the sarcasm.  Apparently the stereotypical ~kiddy~ image slapped onto the Cube is more difficult to shake than we older fans would like to admit, and games such as this recent Backyard Football title certainly do little to dispel the myth.  Despite being a former Nintendo second-party developer, it's no surprise to see Left Field's first non-exclusive title selling on the Cube market only, as there's no chance in hell it would sell otherwise.  Publisher Infogrames is doing the relatively smart thing and keeping this Backyard Football experiment strictly on Nintendo turf in the hopes of tapping an undiscovered market of younger sports gamers -- or simply those with a soft spot in their hearts for cute, cuddly, pre-teen quarterbacks.  Interested? FeaturesFully licensed NFL teams and playersUses 6 memory card blocks1-2 players simultaneous~Ages 7 & up~...or so the box saysSupports progressive scan and Dolby Pro Logic surround soundGameplay It's okay to admit that you like Backyard Football.  After all, if a game goes out of its way to include fully-licensed NFL teams and players, there must be something worth liking within its shiny cellophane interior.  Then again -- this is some sort of sick, time-warped NFL experience, where our favorite all-star players have been shrunk to below midget height with giant, egg-shaped heads and reverted to the intellect of remedial grade school punks.  The style is very cartoonish, childish, and should greatly appeal to those who giggle with delight every time CBS reruns the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving special.  Hitting the power button will kick players into a polished set of menus, where those unfamiliar with this national obsession known as ~football~ can choose to fire up the tutorial mode and get a grip on basic concepts such as ~touchdowns~ and ~snapping the ball.~  If you had any lingering doubts as to whether or not this game was aimed at the little ones, then you may now put them to rest.  This tutorial is extremely basic and clearly targeted at those who have no prior experience with the sport.  It teaches players everything from how to run the ball to the responsibilities of a cornerback.  Clearly, some effort went into this mode, as there's plenty of mildly comical (albeit quickly paced) voice acting throughout, and gamers fond of the title might actually learn a thing or two.  Once you feel confident enough to shed the Pampers and hit the field (be it via either quick play or season mode), experienced NFL gamers will find an interesting variation on the typical pre-game features.  First, you'll pick your NFL team. But unlike other NFL games, you're not really picking your NFL team -- just the logo and team colors.  You won't find anything else to do with the team associated with your choice.  No team-specific players, rosters, coaches, and certainly no team-specific cheerleaders.  But that's not such a big deal, honestly, since this game isn't truly about replicating the NFL experience so much as just having a good ol' fashioned backyard brawl.  After picking your team, the next step is to pick seven kids to join your roster.  Think kindergarten playground, as you'll step through a wide selection of kids eager to play, read their stats, and even listen to tons of rather comical audio clips as they pip and squeak about themselves.  Credit must be given to Left Field for filling in the details wherever it could, and this added attention to quality really does boost the appeal of its already colorful presentation.  During this team selection process, you'll also find the authentic NFL players in their similarly rendered egghead, childish forms.  So players can choose to stack their decks with Terrell Davis, Donovan McNabb, and good ol' Jimmy Bubblebritches: the wheelchair kid next door, who, oddly enough, outranks both McNabb and Davis combined.  Whatever. Pink helmet boy is about to bring the hurt to little Sally.Once you're ready to hit the field, the simple and almost childish nature of the title really shows through with its fun yet bare bones gameplay.  The game is limited to five-on-five players at a time, with 2 extra kids hanging out on the sidelines, just waiting for their turn in the huddle.  There are no refs here, so penalties are right out the window -- they're just not allowed or even possible.  You can even choose to disarm other normal features such as the play clock, thus making the game even more kid friendly.  Play selection is similar to the Madden series, with a button assigned for each of three different play choices.  Scrolling up and down reveals different types of plays, but in doing so, the glaring lack of gameplay depth is obvious, with only a meager 20 or so plays to choose from on the list. You'll find such classic plays as the ~Marshmallow,~ ~Omelet,~ and even the ~Cree-Pee Zone~ defensive set.  For those serious football fans who were still considering the title up until this point, you might as well forget about it now.  But for the younger crowd who might feel overwhelmed with the sport, this focused playbook will be a perfect fit.  The strategic importance of each play is actually close to nil.  You're going to either run the ball or pass the ball, blitz defense or pass defense, and the end result in either case is pretty much the same: lots of huffing, puffing, and Peanuts-esque grunting as these Charmin-packed tykes gently knock each other to the turf. The action is really far from exciting and is even borderline repetitive.  Simplified controls let you juke, stiff arm, and hurdle, but ultimately the kids control like a flock of overweight penguins.  If you're still remotely interested in this game, then there's a good chance that you are indeed younger than the ~ages 7 & up~ label affixed to the back of the box.  But it must be said that despite its obvious appeal to the younger and softer sports fans in the crowd, Backyard Football doesn't exactly skimp on the kind of details that the rest of us have grown to expect in a football game, such as fully controllable replays, player stats, a healthy variety of gameplay modes, and -- yes -- even real-time reflections on helmets.  The game even runs in progressive scan mode and features Dolby Pro Logic surround sound.  It's this attention to detail and presentation in some areas that will eventually tempt some Cube owners into giving Backyard a curious rental, but its extremely cute and simple gameplay mixed with otherwise bland visuals will only hook the more forgiving and generally younger ballers in the end. Graphics Left Field artists have crafted a certain style with Backyard Football that is truthfully quite charming.  You'd have to be a soulless bastard to not find some small amount of joy in these innocent, comically deformed kids and their football hijinks.  But despite the pleasing character designs, the rest of the visual package ranges from uncomfortable to eyesore.  Unlike its previous GameCube sports offering NBA Courtside 2002, this less-realistic venture doesn't have the same satisfying animations or texture work.  For example, each player will leave a footprint wherever they waddle, but each also appears very artificially stamped onto a flat, blurry field texture and then perfectly fades away, leaving an odd trail of splotches behind each of the ten on-field kids.  At first these details might please your mind's eye simply with their inclusion, but once you inspect them closer, you'll be helplessly distracted by their technical flaws from that point forward.  Player models are average, but backgrounds and environments are rather bland in their intentional cartoon style, despite the diverse selection of stadiums available.  As mentioned once or twice, this game will be best loved by children who are quicker to forgive such graphical blemishes.  But on the other hand, this game also supports progressive scan -- a feature we're certainly thrilled to see included, all the while knowing that the target audience will be impervious to its added benefits. Sound The NFL is known for its intense, booming atmosphere and roaring stadiums packed with bloodthirsty fans.  This game, however, is known for being on the opposite end of the adrenaline spectrum.  You'll hear 8 year-old children squeaking things such as, ~One Mississippi, two Mississippi...~ or, ~Yeah! Hehe, haha, I like to play football.~  Quite exhilarating.  But as mentioned, the game also supports Dolby Pro Logic surround sound -- as all games should.  While this inclusion certainly doesn't hurt the title, in this case, it doesn't do much to add to the feeling that you're playing an exciting game of football -- backyard, NFL, or otherwise. Some games have a certain appeal, regardless of how ~kiddy~ they might be, that hooks gamers of all ages with timeless gameplay fundamentals and unique, unparalleled charm.  Backyard Football is not one of these games.Left Field Productions has returned to the GameCube with a solid title for football-loving children, but as it ranks into to Cube videogame library, the overall production is a slightly less-than-average affair.  The neat-o character design doesn't make up for the blah textures and overly simple (to the point of boring) gameplay.  Fortunately, enough details have been poured into the framework of this game (such as a Season mode, detailed character stats, replays, options, voices, etc.) that those kids who do enjoy the gameplay will be quite happy with the rest of the game as well.  However, for the rest of us who might be over the age of 12 or are already enjoying one of the deeper football experiences currently available on the Cube, this one isn't remotely interesting enough.  Parents of a football-loving child might get lucky sticking this one under the tree this holiday season, but we can't promise that they'll stick with it past New Year's.", "date": "Oct 21, 2002"}
