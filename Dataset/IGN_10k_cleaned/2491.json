The company's arcade legacy stands on its own, and with series such as Ridge Racer, Suzuka 8 Hours, and Moto GP, the company's blend of arcade-style racing with unforgettable graphics and sound look to keep Namco at the top.   Originally based on the arcade game 500 GP, MotoGP2-- the sequel to the launch title of the same name -- brings racing fans more instantly satisfying motorcycle racing with very familiar assets. MotoGP2 maintains the elegant balance of arcade-style racing enhanced by simulation techniques and realistic driving lines, and blends in higher AI opponent abilities, upgraded graphics, and well, the same rather annoying techno music.   Right now the PlayStation 2 market for motorcycle racers is essentially empty, consisting of MotoGP, MotoGP2 and Extreme-G3, the latter of which is so different from Namco's licensed arcade-sim balance, it's not quite fair to compare. It's hard to go wrong with Namco's latest effort, given such slim competition. If you're a sucker for good graphics, and you were disappointed by the first MotoGP's flickering and aliasing dilemmas, then you're in for a real treat.  But be aware that MotoGP2 is more like an add-on to the original, with slight tweaks in every category, but retaining the design, feel, and balance of the first.   Gameplay Based on the real, worldwide motorcycle racing events and fully licensed with a slew of up-to-date real teams and bike manufacturers, MotoGP2provides racers with an authentic racing environment. The choice of more than a dozen real life riders and teams and real life re-creations of their bikes certainly makes this feel up to snuff. While you'll see a lot of signage, the names of racers are a little toned down this time around. Thankfully, Namco deleted the pop-up signs with the names of racers above their heads when you drive close, a feature that was nice but in hindsight was extremely dorky.   Just like in Moto GP, players can get to grips with several modes from the get-go, including Arcade (an instant race), Season (a full, 15-course career), Competition (A-to-B mini challenges), Time Trial, and VS, the last of which are self-explanatory. Players have a huge selection of racers from which to select, replete with various standings, teams, and highly tuned 500 cc bikes. Before starting players can tweak the bikes' handling, suspension, brakes, acceleration and whatnot with a simple horizontal barometer, nicely detailed with text explaining what the results of the changes mean.   The real meat-and-potatoes of the game is the Season mode, which offers the longest and most challenging aspect of the game. Just like in MotoGP1, players start Season with a ranking, a team, and a specific bike, which cannot be changed during the season. The same choices from MotoGP1 are available this time around, and they enable players to take a free run, a qualifying run, and then to go for the real race. The racers with the best times place accordingly in the pack. Racers score points for placement, and the accumulation of their total points for the whole season determine how well they performed. If you place in the top three racers, you will be asked to join that team, in which case you can ride a second and a third season, etc. It's standard stuff.   A few tweaks have changed the Season mode, however, and as a result the game is more challenging than in the previous iteration. For starters, the game enables players to choose how many laps they would like to race, and this time around, the game doesn't offer the choice of three laps, instead offering two, or five. After having played MotoGP1 again for several hours, I noticed how crucial the third lap actually is. It's the difference between grabbing first and fifth place. In a two-lap race, the window for mistakes is limited to nil, and so the races are simply harder.   Second, the AI racers are simply better drivers this time around. The leader is usually far out in front o the pack and tougher to catch, while the rest of the contestants aren't just mere fodder as they were before, they're gearing to win. The ramped up AI racers start off faster, stay in the race longer, and come back from being passed more often. The racing is tougher all around in MotoGP 2 and surely Namco felt that this would increase the length of playtime. It does, but not by any new twist or deviation from the norm. It's just harder now.   Other than that, the racing itself is almost exactly like what players experienced in MotoGP1. The smooth animation and 60 fps production results in a visually tantalizing game, but more importantly it's a very fast one. Racers reach speeds of up to 160-180 mph, and the sense of speed and the rate of acceleration for each bike, is excellent. There's no doubt in my mind that fans of very fast racing experiences will love this blistering sense of speed in MotoGP2.   Namco has managed to create a smooth blend of arcade racing in this game, while still requiring players to hone concrete skills in order to succeed. The racing fast part is easy, but taking the turns right with a combination of timed brakes and acceleration plays out in a matter of milliseconds, and transforms the game from Namco's old Suzuka 8 Hours to more of a Gran Turismo or sim-style motorcycle games. Furthermore, learning the courses and the lines on each set of curves is crucial to improving and succeeding. Since the game's input is so fundamental, with just the basic steer, accelerate and brake functions, mastering the turns with precision and perfect timing is crucial, and leans more toward simulation riding.   But that's about as far as the simulation aspects go. Riders won't fall from their bikes by making silly mistakes, or losing control accidentally the way it happens in real life. Bikes will pull wheelies with jolting starts, but it's nearly impossible to lose control during these events. Also the rear wheel will slip during tight turns at high speeds, but never enough to force abandoning the bike. Unless you actually crash head-on into another racer, or smash into a wall, losing control is not an issue.   It should be noted that the Challenge mode serves as a meaty side dish to the Career mode, reminding me of good challenging fun in winning Gran Turismo's license tests. There are more than 50 of them, and they reward you with everything from little pictures to more hefty treasures, which I won't spoil for you here. They're short, tantalizing, and addictive.   Graphics Several areas of MotoGP2 deserve credit in the visuals department, many of which were mentioned in the MotoGP1. The game creates a dynamic replay effect from selecting a bevy of positions, some showing off focus effects, others showing the game from the first-person perspective, and still another camera effect that always wins me over. This camera is positioned low to the ground, about knee high, and whenever a bike or bikes pass by it sways back and forth from the momentum of the wind. The replay set overall is just incredible.   The first game's aliasing and flickering problems have been dealt with like a mighty backhand in this second version, leaving the game even better to look at from all perspectives. A tiny bit of clicker is all that remains, and you have to search it out in order to complain about it. As with the first title, there is no pop-up at all and the large courses and particular items scattered across them show up nice and neat. Even things such as opponents appearing on the screen with a smoother LOD transition rather than poking into sight like before have improved.   The bikes and riders themselves are more detailed than before, which is saying something. The images and logos on the bikers' clothes, the particulars about their bikes, such as the engines themselves, and the tracks are all highly detailed and excellent looking.   Sound  When it comes to the music on MotoGP1, I have to agree with my former associate Dave Z, the music in the first game stank. And I convinced myself after playing through MotoGP1 again that the music in 2 was far better. But then I listened to it again. Wow, is this music silly. It's, overly busy, spastic, and hurts the ears. It sounds as if a junior music designer with about eight cups of coffee in his gullet threw a dozen tracks into a Cuisinart and forgot to check what the end result tasted like. No restaurant would serve this stuff.   As for the sound effects, they score much better. The bikes don't sound that much different from one another, but the screeching tires, the roaring crowd, and the whizzing effect of passing another rider have powerful effects. The sounds effects are all good stuff. In the end, MotoGP2 is very much a redo of MotoGP1. The graphics were turned up a notch, the AI is fiercer and the fine tweaking of the bikes themselves is subtle enough to miss if you haven't played the first, but it's there nonetheless. The Namco style of motorcycle racing still grows on me today, however, and I always enjoy playing Namco's next iteration, as I did MotoGP2. The game is solid in every aspect, graphics, control, track selection, and the sense of speed. There are enough modes to satisfy most folks, and the Challenge mode is more fun than it should be. I liked MotoGP2 enough, but I wasn't crazy about it. It feels like an add-on pack rather than a sequel, and I guess the only way I would seriously consider buying this is if I were a diehard motorcycle fan who absolutely adored the first.", "date": "Feb 19, 2002"}
