One is ~Built for Mac~ and the second is ~Mac Exclusive~. Bugdom 2 is both of those things, but is it good enough to make people go out and buy a Mac just to play it?   Hardly a fair question in all respects, but one that we all inevitably bring up when facing an exclusive title for our platform. For the sake of those here that are sick of the eternal query, this review will focus on the game it's self. Not the ability to save or rebirth gaming on the Mac.    Bugdom 2 is a sequel to Bugdom, developed by Pangea Studios. Most of us first saw Bugdom with a Mac purchase or running in store demo units. It was packaged along with Nanosaur as an entertainment pack for a good bit of the G3 iMac and Sawtooth G4 family. A gross improvement over the Windows offering of Solitaire and other obscure, useless, pixel pushers.   Now in 2002 the game returns, this time replacing the Fly with a Grasshopper and refining the gameplay a good bit along the way.    Presentation:   The story goes a little something like this.   It has been three years since Rollie McFly rid the Bugdom of the evil King Thorax and his minions, but the Bugdom can still be dangerous place as our new hero Skip is about to find out. While on his way to visit his family on the far side of the Bugdom, a Bully Bee swooped down and stole Skip's knapsack. Your job as Skip is to track down the Bully Bee and get your knapsack back. The chase takes place mostly in and around a house.    You will make new friends in the Bugdom who will help you through each area. Keep an eye out for Sam the Snail and Sally the Chipmunk. Sam will usually make you prove your worthiness before he will help you, but Sally is just interested in gathering acorns, so be sure to brings lots of those to her. Additionally, the same Buddy Bugs that helped Rollie McFly defeat King Thorax will help you defeat most mean enemy bugs that you encounter.   There's a part of this that they left out. Sally the Chipmunk is the most mentally challenged creature the woods have ever seen! This two brain celled patch of fur makes the lint out of a 500 pound man's gut look cultured and genius! Dig this: The chick seems to always have tons of keys. Keys, as we all know, come from dungeons crowded with demons and slimes. There's apparently no problem for her to brave the depths for metal keys she'll never use, but when it comes to feeding herself, She's at a total loss. She'll ask you to go find acorns in trade for keys.. Even when honestly, there's an acorn 3 feet in front of her! Course, Skip's no white coat himself. He goes on her quests to open gates made of leaves. Grasshoppers eat leaves right?   OK, enough of that! Bugdom is very focused on it's user group, the kids of Mac users. In that respect is excels gorgeously. The presentation is very sharp and complete. Even the life bar and inventory are made to blend into the theme, showing your stats as berries on a leaf. While you won't confuse this title with Ghost Recon anytime soon, it's refreshing to see a pure and innocent (Except for Sally) game.   Graphics:   The graphics of Bugdom are very nice considering the range of platforms it's made to accommodate. Compatible all the way back to a 266 mhz G3 iMac, Bugdom uses the stock ATI cards very respectably. Those of you with 1 ghz, iBooks or the related DV line will also find the game can push your systems too. Bugdom's large cartoon worlds are nice on the eyes and allow a lot of exploration beyond the original. My favorite areas took place inside a human house and illustrated a very nice sense of scale. Another treat is the ant raid of a human picnic. Textures seem only on par at times, yet also shine at others. There are areas that could use a little more detail such as the early yard areas, yet on the flip side, a lot of love was seemingly given to the later areas, especially to water, brick and glass effects.    On a whole the game is very nice looking and lends it's self to an era we once saw on the N64 but not so much anymore.   Sound:   There's not a lot to say about the sound department. The effects are expected and suitable but nothing out of the ordinary. The music goes in the same category, only at rare times going to downright distracting. The only real gripe in the sound area is the voice acting. Sally the Chipmunk no doubt hails from the land of rebel flags and six packs. If I were to actually have to make a whole conversation with the creature, I'd no doubt be trying to crush my head in a vice only minutes after ~Hello!~    Gameplay:   Gameplay is platforming goodness! Skip is by far better than Rollie McFly as the lead of the game. He has the ability to do large jumps, wing assisted glides, kicks and acorn fetching.   I said I'd give Sally a break, but I have to go back into her for this area. You have to get Sally a LOT of acorns. When she's not crying for tree fetus, the snail wants favors. When both Sally and the snail are happy, you often come across this white rat that must have escaped from a lab where they were testing the effects of drano injections to the brain, because he is ALWAYS trapped in a rattrap. You free him and ten seconds later you come across him trapped again. This guy's tail has been in that trap so long you'd think he'd evolve to know that treats on a wooden and metal contraption are BAD. I think he may be Sally's cousin or some sort of relation.   On a whole, the gameplay is varied and fun. Different areas bring different elements. Coke cans that shoot you into the air, drain pipes that are surf able, even model car sets to outrun and dodge.    Control can defiantly be a problem. You can use the mouse for movement and looking or a mouse and keyboard combo. Problem is, some areas present challenges that make the control issues come to light and irritate you until completion. Often the control is just too loose for the situation. An example would be the snail's scarecrow. He has it all ready but the cherry head that he asks you to put on top of it for him. Jumping too far or little sends you on the ground. Actually landing on it is hard and even then, dropping the head in the EXACT spot needed is near impossible in less than ten tries. In most situations, the loose feeling of the controls is bearable, but these certain areas and challenges can turn your opinion if you stay stuck too long.   Lasting Appeal:   The game has what it takes to make it for a long while. A few of the reasons are givens though. It is the only new triple A children's title for the Mac, it's compatible from genesis to revelation and available for a very affordable price. Bugdom 2 is a very stand up title and easily beats the recent Disney Mac titles.   Overall:   Overall it's a very complete adventure that shines in both its graphical prowess and it's addictive gameplay. Young Mac gamers would do well to pick this up online before they try other titles. Everything else is a decided second.", "date": "Nov 19, 2002"}
