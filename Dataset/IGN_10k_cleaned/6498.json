Players still used both joysticks for movement and shooting, but the graphics and presentation has been greatly updated. In addition, players found a variety of weapon upgrades and inane power ups like shiny VCRs and brand new toasters that popped up on the play screen. It was fast, fun and full of a decent amount of gore at the time, at least when you were fighting the human enemies.   Now the game is out again on the Xbox Live Arcade, and it's pretty much the exact same thing. The game is presented with a very minimal type of plot. You're basically a contestant in the worst game show on the planet. It's not a bad show because it's got poor production values or a dearth of large-chested women, but rather it's a bad show because it puts you in situations where your life is constantly in peril. The game progresses in a stage-by-stage and level-by-level fashion. Each level consists of a series of connected rooms. In each room you enter you'll be accosted by gigantic groups of enemies from door in the top, bottom and sides. Once you finally vanquish the seemingly endless waves of enemies that fly at you in each room you'll be given the chance to choose which door to exit through. Each path leads to different challenges, though it consistently involves killing tons of jerks. At the end of each stage, expect a boss fight with some sort of hideously mutated entity.   The single player mode in this game is tough. Really freaking tough. If playing by yourself you've got the option to just constantly continue, so you may want to stay away from that one. Playing co-operatively on your Xbox 360 will give you unlimited continues as well, so for the biggest challenge you'll want to take the game online. On Xbox Live you'll need to keep one player alive at all times in order to keep continuing through the game, otherwise it's game over and you get tossed back to the lobby screen.   VCRs. The wave of the future. Graphically the game looks just like it did in the arcade. They added some new menus like the ones you'll find in Joust and Gauntlet, but no other real visual enhancements. Of course, to any Smash TV fans, this doesn't matter at all. The game offers Arcade, Xbox Live support, Leaderboards and Achievements, all of which help to expand the game beyond the original arcade release. Whether or not you'll agree with some of the Achievment criteria is another issue. For instance, one of them requires you to beat the entire game without continuing. Seriously, that has got to be impossible. This game was designed specifically for you to lose, so unless you have a supernatural level of spatial awareness, you're not completing that one. Other than that you'll find some more standard Achievements like beating a certain boss or getting through each of the three levels.   If you liked Smash TV before, you're going to like it here since it hasn't really changed. You'll get expanded gameplay through Xbox Live and the ability to check online leaderboards. The infinite continues take away from the challenge of playing the game by yourself or with a friend on your own Xbox 360 console, but at least there's a modifier that reduces your score the more you continue. If reminding yourself of the days of games when you were hanging out in bowling alleys and getting pizza grease all over arcade joysticks is what you're looking for, then this is your game.", "date": "Dec 9, 2005"}
