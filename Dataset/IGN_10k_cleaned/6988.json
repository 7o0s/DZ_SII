Highly-detailed characters, running around giant environments, and executing brilliant-looking mid-air attacks straight out of a martial arts movie? Sounded (and looked) good to me.  Now the final product is in my PlayStation, and while it certainly has a lot of visual sparkle (and a lot of characters  12 in all), it really hasn't lived up to my expectations of a breath of fresh air in the quickly stagnating genre. Despite its sharp looks, admittedly unique gameplay, and many modes therein (story, versus, endurance, team, time trial) it came up seriously lacking in the fun department. Gameplay  The premise is something of a cross between a traditional fighting game and ~paper, rock, scissors,~ where you've got three close in attacks at your disposal (regular, stronger, and strongest), three long-range ~magic attacks,~ and the ability to dash attack, block magic (and standard) attacks, and dash out of the way of danger while punching. All the while, running around fully 3D environments which featured staircases to climb and walls to hide behind.  When you first start playing, it truly seems like a vast departure from your run-of-the-mill fighting game  and it is. But you soon start to realize that, beyond the base strategy of producing the correct move to counteract what your opponent is throwing at you (shield against long-range magic, dash attack against standard attack, etc.), there's really nothing that keeps any one fight from seeming exactly like the next, not even the characters. That's because, beyond their individual cosmetic differences, they're essentially the same. Even worse, while a couple of the game's stages are fairly well-designed, with a good amount of walls to hide behind and the like, a majority of them are simply dull.   The various gameplay modes don't do anything to counteract this, and even the two-player match becomes all-too-repetitive after an evening's play. As for the story mode, while it has some good-looking story sequences, it's essentially just the same old battles broken up by sometimes lengthy, non-interactive character dialog. Graphics  Like I said earlier, the characters are very well detailed. They also move convincingly. And though sparse design-wise, the environments move nice and smoothly. Add to this great magic effects and CG sequences, and there really aren't a lot of complaints to express about this area of the game. It's not the best-looking fighter, but its visuals are more than adequate. Sound   Here's where the game becomes a really mixed bag. I liked the music and sound effects just fine, but the voice acting is simply horrendous. As Peer at IGN64 said while I was playing: ~was that recorded in someone's bathroom?~ That pretty much sums up the recording quality, and the actors themselves didn't exactly sound, well, like actors. Overall Destrega certainly had enough promise, and maybe if the characters had turned out being a bit more individual, and the stages themselves more exciting, it could have held some promise. As it stands, however, it's definitely ~different,~ but certainly not solid enough to offer competition for most of the PlayStation's mammoth fighting catalog. I've played a lot of fighting games in my life, and I really was hopeful that Destrega could break the mold in just the right ways. It broke the mold, but the way it re-arranged the pieces simply doesn't fit. Overall, it's a game thats good and bad qualities run neck-and-neck, and that's why I've had to give it a purely middle-of-the-road rating.", "date": "Feb 10, 1999"}
