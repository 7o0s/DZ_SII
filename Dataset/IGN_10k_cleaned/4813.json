Whenever I delve into an original title that tries something new I get happy and excited, obviously giving a game a leg up come review time. Every now and again, I come across a title so original and new that it excites me while confusing and frightening me as well. Such is the case with Perimeter from Russian developer KD Labs. It takes the real-time strategy genre and augments it with nano-technology into a form unlike any strategy game I can really think of, aside from a completely vague and strange way to Moonbase Commander. Perimeter manages to offer some very intriguing ideas that somehow only seem to get more confused by a strange story with no antagonists worth caring about. Still, at times, the actual gameplay definitely creates an interesting atmosphere. Too bad these times are accompanied by just as many frustrating and/or boring ones.   Perimeter takes place outside of our universe and inside a chain of dimensional worlds that a race of people are using to reach a distant destination which Spirits, a race of hyper-intelligent beings, have told them will be their Eden. It's confusing where these people came from or where exactly it is they're going. In that way, the story feels a bit disjointed although it does start to make a bit more sense as the political make-up between the story's main players becomes apparent. Centuries ago, the human race set off on a journey to find a new home with the guidance of these Spirits. Nine gigantic city ships called Frames set off one at a time to try and find their way to salvation. During the course of the game, political fractures become apparent as some of the Frames decide the Spirits have misled them.   It's hard to tell who to root for here. The Exodus faction is akin to a mass of religious zealots trying to force everyone to believe their way. The Empire faction sits in the middle, deciding to stay in the chain and force all other Frames to conform to their new rule of law or be destroyed. Finally, the Harkback faction heads back towards the beginning of the chain to find answers to their origin and home world. Each of them are creepy and disturbed in their own little way.     I suppose it doesn't matter too much as finding the humanity in any of these factions is difficult. This isn't just because of their strange visages and alien technology (that's actually the cool part), but because the campaign switches so frequently back and forth between each of the factions that you begin to feel fractured in your allegiance. Even in StarCraft, also with three very different factions, I felt rooted in each of the campaigns and wanted to help each of those races, due partly to characters a person could care about, which Perimeter is devoid of. In this case, I just didn't really care who won, aside from personal preference for ideology.   Each of the levels of the game takes place on one of the strange dimensional chain worlds. Each of these worlds is represented by a plot of land surrounded by an energy mass which can be tapped into for energy by leveling the landscape to a zero plane. Not only does it look good in this fully 3D environment, but strategy and gameplay is largely focused around this idea. Buildings all have to be placed on zero level. This basic premise makes base building the bigger and more important idea driving strategy. Military units certainly play an interesting role, but it's the base the wins the day. You'll have to extend your base to gain more surface to gain more energy and defend that area from the alien scourge and other Frames alike.     In order to place extra buildings such as labs or factories, you'll have to have space to fit them on areas covered by an energy extractor. All of these extractors have to be linked back to the Frame you're controlling in each particular scenario creating a web of power with which to run your base. In desperate situations, an energy perimeter can be raised around the entire base or specific parts for defense. This drains a massive amount of energy however so it's not something that can be used for long.   If one link in the energy chain that connects everything to a Frame gets destroyed, all of the buildings and extractors no longer linked to your Frame will power down. Any unpowered buildings on the map become neutral and can be taken by any Frame on the map. All they have to do is link their network to those buildings in order to capture them, which can create a serious swing in the balance of power. This aspect alone is terrific in skirmish and multiplayer as well being a very integral part of succeeding in campaign scenarios. You'll have to balance building, terraforming, and attacking to be successful, which ranges greatly in difficulty. But expanding your base to complete objectives is often the challenge and can be both fun and frustrating.   Trying to keep you from your goals will be both environment and other Frame factions. The chain worlds somehow tap into the psyche of all of the people traveling there. Each of the worlds is designed with this thought in mind and allowed the artists to get very creative with the design. You'll see faces, pyramids, writing, numbers, and other complicated designs making up each of the worlds. They look beautiful enough that it's almost a shame that you'll have to flatten them for gameplay.     Unfortunately, some of these worlds also take the negative thoughts of each Frame creating monsters called the Scourge that are set on destroying invaders. Not only will these beasts attack your base and Frame but will affect the ground as well with earthquakes and ground attacks that leave your perfect plane of energy uneven, leaving your terraformers with the job of fixing the blemishes. This is a cool idea, but turned out to be annoying as hell.   There were several scenarios which quickly became tedious simply because they weren't challenging so much as long and methodically boring. The pace at which expansion is possible is significantly slowed by the need for your terraformers to travel halfway across the map to fix a mistake in the terrain. In none of them was I in danger of losing at any point. The lack of the ability to assign locations to individual terraformers is largely the case of this frustration.   When facing another hostile Frame, your strategies will quickly have to change and are much more interesting than those missions played against the scourge. Oftentimes, you'll actually be charged with escaping into a new world via a portal and not actually forcefully engaging the enemy. These missions can be challenging to the extreme, especially when unfamiliar with the options at your disposal. For instance, near the beginning of the game is an escape mission where you begin with basically nothing while the enemy has several technologies including howitzer guns that will bombard your energy extractors. I had no idea that I wasn't really supposed to defend myself but instead just made a mad dash to create as many energy extractors as possible to flee the world. Many of the missions give you absolutely no clue as what you should be doing and will require much trial and error.   At the same time, this game really does allow for some mistakes. If an enemy attacks and does some damage, it's usually possible to get some defenses up to beat them back and then rebuild quickly enough to have suitable defenses waiting. The nature of the game doesn't allow for choke point defense however. Any unit can travel up and over even the steepest mountain. The computer is pretty smart about seeking out the weak defensive points and exploiting them as well as adapting to your own attacks and maneuvers.    Military adaptation is an important facet of assaulting enemy locations as well and is handled creatively with nano-technological units. Three basic robotic units can be created from robotic factory buildings. From there, these units can be combined into bigger and better units depending on the technology you've researched. For instance, 1 soldier, 12 officers and 7 technicians can combine to make one Leamo assault tank. The idea is great, but having the exact number of basic units to make a certain number of advanced units is sometimes annoying to calculate on the fly given the odd numbers of units needed to create them. You'll always have a couple of extras just hanging out doing nothing but taking up space.   Complicating things more is that units are broken up into one of five groups depending on how many Command Centers you've built. Trading numbers of basic units between the groups seems to be impossible meaning you'll have extras in each of the groups taking up space you need because of the unit cap.   Of course, that unit cap is entirely necessary as the game doesn't really run particularly well after so many units and buildings are on screen. Thanks to the deformable terrain, there are enough polygons on screen to choke an Alienware ALX. At times the game slows to a chug even on a 3.0Ghz Pentium 4 with 1Ghz of RAM and a GeForce Ultra 5900. Thankfully, this doesn't seem to hurt gameplay for the most part, even if it does hurt the overall presentation.    Perimeter is an excellent experiment that succeeded in a lot of areas. Given a little more attention to story and character in the campaign along with less of the long and dull missions the single player portion of the game could have been excellent. It's certainly a very confusing premise that's hard to explain and these problems don't make it an easier. The strange rollercoaster ride of difficulty will confound and surprise many people as missions are never a consistent level of challenge.While much of the interface will be familiar to most RTS veterans, there are enough differences that the lack of in game help with unit types and abilities will take some time to get used to.Graphically, Perimeter does some brilliant work with their environments, even if their buildings and units are fairly rudimentary by today's standards. Unfortunately, the deformable terrain and number of objects on screen will give your computer a workout, even on some of the lower settings.Multiplayer certainly adds some fun with a new way to look at strategy and emphasis on base building. Players will definitely have fun with discovering new tricks for each of the maps and developing strategies for each of the different factions and their ultimate weapons and units.Perimeter will stand out in my memory for its originality, but falls a little short of my wholehearted recommendation. If the premise appeals to you, I'd recommend giving it a try, but if the weird technology and heavy emphasis on base building doesn't appeal to you, you'd probably do well to listen to your instincts. I'd also recommend checking out both the single player demo and multiplayer demo for yourself.", "date": "Jun 30, 2004"}
