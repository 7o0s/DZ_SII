One of our more extreme readers even went so far as to send us a very threatening singing telegram. Give us a break; it takes a while to get through this game. I've been doing nothing since Monday but playing this game. The IGN nurse was kind enough to hook me up to a nutrient drip and give me a bedpan so I could work non-stop. When they allow me to close my eyes (5 minutes every hour, just for health reasons), all I can see are infantry units being crushed by harvesters. I even dreamt about the game last night. Trust me, I want the review done even more than you. Well, here it is, you $&@*s!  Let's put it right up front. It's a great game. Happy now? Okay, calm down. That's right...breathe. Want to read it again? Alright...it's a great game. Feel the old heart rate slowing down? Good. Now we can get down to specifics. It's been four years since the last major release in the C&C universe. In the interim we've had to content ourselves with smaller mission packs and add-ons. Believe me when I say that I've suffered the C&C withdrawals too. Dune II was one of the first computer games that I got hooked on and I've been a fan ever since.  Now that I've gone on record saying that the game is good, let's get to the ambiguous part. There's sort of an ethical debate going on here at IGN this week. And it's not limited to the PC staff. Tiberian Sun is good mostly because it's a lot like the other games in the series. Do you hold that against them? The first C&C game did a lot to make RTS a profitable, powerful genre. It's no small wonder that the folks at Westwood would be hesitant to monkey around with the design. The problem is, they're not showing us anything we haven't seen before. And in the meantime, games like Starcraft and Total Annihilation have done a lot to draw our attention away from the C&C franchise.  Like the previous games, this one is solid in terms of utility. Apart from some minor issues, I was pleased. The interface is the same. You've got the sidebar with all the production hinkfo and the radar screen on the right. Commands on the map are handled with the mouse and a very practical system of hotkeys. You can set map points as hot keys so you can zoom to important locations. There's also an option where you can go the current event--~our base is under attack,~ etc. The waypoint function is one of the smartest and most flexible I've come across in a RTS game. And you can turn off individual structures if you're running short on power. And there's a production queue for units. It's only got 5 spaces, but it sure makes things easier. A similar function for structure production would be nice.  Now for the minor issues. We seemed to have problems in placing component towers. The logic behind where a tower can and cannot be placed eludes me. And I've been playing the game the whole week. There's also no way to order your units to attack while holding their position. Too often the enemy would retreat and draw my units into an ambush. This isn't so much of a problem if you're only fighting one battle, but it can really screw you if your attention is focused elsewhere.  The game has also had a very minor facelift. You'll mostly be impressed with the new look of the terrain. Craters are formed from explosions. There are also numerous ~neutral~ structures around and even a few modestly sized cities. The cities add ambushes to the tactical palette of the game. There are also bridges which can be destroyed and repaired. I think the game relies a little too heavily on bridges; there are quite a few in each mission. One cool addition is the ability to destroy bridges while units are on them. Oh, that's too bad...bye-bye!  The units are still rendered in sprites. The decision to stay 2D on the map is probably the result, not only of cost and time, but also remaining faithful to the C&C pattern. While it's unfortunate, Tiberian Sun compensates by using a voxel rendering for the vehicles. This gives the appearance of 3D (especially when going up hills), but it looks awkward in places. The smoke and spark effects on the damaged vehicles is a nice touch, but the smoke sometimes obscures the unit's health bar. That's just sloppy.  The GDI units are certainly more sci-fi based than before. Light infantry carry pulse rifles and grenadiers carry sophisticated disk shaped grenades. You even get infantry equipped with jump jets. These guys are really cool. Their speed and freedom of movement make them a potent attacking force. Just keep 'em away from the SAMs. You also get the requisite medics and engineers. The APCs you use to carry these guys around is capable of travelling on water and land, making amphibious assaults not only practical, but downright irresistible in some of the later missions.  On the armor side, things have changed, too. GDI has switched to a powered armor suits instead of tanks. The Wolverine is the smallest and fastest of these. Use them for quick strikes against Nod infantry. For the heavy work, you'll rely on the Titans. These were the mainstay of my force all through the game. They're cheap, relatively, and oh so strong. Best of all, their range beats just about anything else you're liable to run into. The big daddy of the armor is the Mammoth Mk. II. It's nearly indestructible and carries two rail guns and its own anti-aircraft missiles. Trouble is, you can only have one of these babies at a time.  There are two other units that sort of fit in the armor category. First is the Disruptor, which bears a strange resemblance to the Sonic Tanks from Dune II. More interesting, and useful in my opinion, is the MLRS--a hover tank equipped with long range missiles. It can travel very fast over land and sea and shoot down ground and air targets. That reminds me--you also get the standard Orca fighters, bombers and carryalls. Overall I found these to be ineffective due to the logistical headache involved in keeping them armed and in the air.  One of the best things about C&C is that the opposing units weren't identical. The same holds true for Tiberian Sun. The Nod units are analogous to the GDI units, but each has unique characteristics. Overall, GDI is slow and powerful, while Nod is fast and sneaky. This is bound to attract a variety of players to the game. I, myself, am a brute force man. Just get me a wall of heavy units and I will sweep all before me. It's all about concentration. But that's not for everybody. Some people have an undeveloped sense of sportsmanship and would prefer to hit a guy when he's not looking. Zu jedem sein Selbst, as Peer says...at least, I think it's Peer. It certainly wasn't me.  Back to the Nod units. They've got light infantry too. They also have rocket armed infantry. Best of all though are the cyborg soldiers. You can blow them in half and their torso keeps fighting. It's cute in an unwholesome, gory sort of way. Nod also has engineers and the awesomely powerful cyborg commando. Remember mission 6 from the original? It's a little like that. Nod, too, has an APC, but theirs can tunnel below the surface of the earth.  Nod has opted to maintain its reliance on traditional tanks. The Tick tank is a lot like the Siege tank from Starcraft. It digs into the ground and becomes a sort of super-turret. The Stealth tank does just what you'd think it would. There's also an artillery unit and the ubiquitous attack cycle. By far the most deadly of the Nod units is the Devil's Tongue. Armed with a flamethrower and the ability to burrow beneath the ground, this tank is an infantryman's worst nightmare.  So those are some of the Nod and GDI units. Is that it? Nope. There's a new group in the story--the Forgotten. These are humans with a genetically developed Tiberium sickness. Their skin begins to sprout crystals...eww. These mutants are sort of like spoilers in the fray, but both GDI and Nod have access to some of their units. The Mutant Hijacker can gain control of enemy vehicles the same way an engineer can secure enemy buildings. The Ghoststalker is an incredibly powerful soldier. He has a railgun that slices through almost any target and a C4 charge with which he can instantly destroy any buildings. All Forgotten units can heal while standing in a field of Tiberium. Where have we seen this before? Oh right, Dune II.  There's even a new type of Tiberium here. It's blue. But there's more to it than that. Blue Tiberium is more valuable than the green variety. It's also highly volatile. Gunfights in a field of Blue Tiberium are a risky proposition as the combat may ignite the stuff. Ka-blooey! In terms of other changes, there are none. You've still got harvesters and refineries and silos. The rest of the economic model in the game is as solid as it ever was.  The structures are pretty much the same as in the previous iteration. There are two changes to note. Each side has received its own powerful defensive structure. For the GDI, this takes the form of Firestorm walls. These are built like regular walls, but require a special generator to power them. When turned on, the Firestorm wall is impenetrable to all attacks. The catch? Well, it only lasts for a short time before it needs to be recharged. The Nod have a stealth generator that renders everything under a wide umbrella totally invisible. Units and structures only become visible again while firing.  The enemy AI is pretty savvy but it hasn't done anything to surprise me yet. It's not too hard to outthink in certain situations if you know how it operates. I have yet to see it defending a harvester. Therein lies your success. I also haven't seen too many occasions where an enemy vehicle made a concerted effort to crush my infantry. I don't know why. I do it all the time to him. The AI seems to regard structures as higher priority targets than units. Your engineers can use this to draw attention away from you attacking force.   The campaigns are great. Each side has twelve missions with seven alternate or optional missions. While it's not a branching campaign structure, you do have a little flexibility here. I would suggest that you play all the missions, including optional ones. They make the other missions easier. Plus you get more bang for the buck. The missions rely too heavily on the ~kill everything~ idea which can really irritate you if you have to spend 5 minutes exploring the map to find that last damned infantryman. The few missions that involve not killing everything are very enjoyable. In one you've got to rescue a scientist, in another you just have to destroy a dam. Rest assured that there's still a lot of fighting, but combat isn't an end unto itself in these missions. I wish there'd been more.  As with most of the Westwood games, this one doesn't disappoint in terms of story. Although the acting is a little awkward at times, the story is genuinely engaging and helps to tie the whole campaign together. I won't give it away except to say that all your old favorites are back--Gen. Solomon, McNeil and, everyone's favorite bad guy, Kane. That's right, he's back. If I spoiled that for you, I assume you would have figured it out on your own or you wouldn't have read this far. You'd probably scroll right down to the scores and then go back to playing with shiny things. The story involves a Forgotten scientist, a strange alien spacecraft and a mysterious device called the Tacitus.  So to get back to the ethical question raised above, Tiberian Sun doesn't offer the same level of excitement that the first games did, but I tend to think that's an unfair standard. Until, of course, I consider the huge hibernation period for this series. For such a long wait, you'd think they would have done more to shift the direction of the genre. Don't get me wrong; Tiberian Sun is a great game but it's nothing you haven't seen before. And Westwood doesn't enjoy the exclusivity it enjoyed a few years ago, before the release of other successful RTS games.  Westwood has created a unique problem for themselves. They popularized the genre that so many other titles have seemed to take over. We were hoping that Tiberian Sun would help to reorient strategy games in a new direction. It's hard to judge a game in a vacuum (and noisy too), but it's also unfair to compare a game to the memory of past games or the anticipation of future ones. When it comes right down to it, Tiberian Sun delivers phenomenal gameplay within an exciting context and that's more than enough for me.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Sep 4, 1999"}
