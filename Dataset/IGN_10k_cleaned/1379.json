The Street Fighter EX series, Capcom's and Arika's slight side venture into the 3D environment, hasn't always put forth the best side of Street Fighter. With a great first effort on PlayStation, followed by a rather lackluster secondary effort on the same console, it's hung in there. But here in the next generation of consoles, Street Fighter EX3 comes with little fanfare. It's mixed bag of good multiplayer action and a few luscious special effects, but uninspired basic combat coupled with stiff controls. It's certainly not the best of the series.   Gameplay By now  the year 2000  players ought to know a few things about Street Fighter. Ken and Ryu rule the roost; everybody else is secondary. Secondly, the moves will never truly change in SF. Third, you can always come back to Street Fighter and pull off a Dragon Punch or Fireball, and it will make you happy. Those are guaranteed Street Fighter qualities. I also must admit that in my own humble opinion, the 2D versions still beat out the three dimensional versions in look, feel, and playability. So, having laid down those weird opinions, let's get to Street Fighter EX3.   In a nutshell, EX3 is 3D Street Fighter with tag team combat and multiplayer capabilities. The game uses some of the PlayStation 2's massive polygonal power, but rarely ever scratches the surface. Even though it's probably the best looking of the three in the series, EX3 simply feels rushed, uninspired, and downright mediocre.   The gameplay modes provide a little bit of variety. Players can get straight into the meat of things with Original mode. Pick a character and as you defeat one after another, you have the choice of adding them into your posse, or staying single. After defeating the final tag-team duo, you face off with a boss, and if you defeat him, that particular character opens up in the menu screen.   Arena mode pits your chose character against three others in a battle of sheer lasting power. It's one against three, and it's not easy. But, for those hardcore players who want a challenge, the middle and later levels in Arena will suite your tastes just perfectly. The game also features Character Edit mode, Training, and a reasonable Options mode. And the tag team function is just that, functional, it's not terribly speedy, nor is it slow. There are many more fighters with better tag systems than this.  Still, the game certainly doesn't skimp on replay value. There are at least nine characters to open up through Original mode, and 16 with which to start. The instantly selectable characters feature: Zengief, Doctrine Dark, Skullomania, Vega, Ryu, Sakura, Hokuto, Nanase, Jack, Ace, Guile, Chun Li, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, and Sharon. As you continue, players open up characters such as Sagat, M. Bison, and many other familiar faces.   A few interesting additions have been weaved into the combat system. There is the Momentary Combo, which enables combinations to be started, switched, and restarted, a lot like the Super Cancel. There's the Hard Attack (replacing the Guard Break), the ability to trade attack power for life, and the special Tag Team or Double combo, in which teamed characters attack simultaneously in a scripted animation scene. And there is a Stun move, which temporarily bedazzles the opposition, and can lead into a beautiful setup.   Following in the footsteps of its launch cousin, several key issues have been addressed. First, the frame rates have been sped up. Given that Street Fighter has always been game grounded in speedy characters and fast reaction times, this needed change has indeed improved the game. Second, players can call up a special command list during gameplay that displays all of your character moves. Third, in the Arena mode in Multiplay, characters can select CPU-controlled characters as well as human-controlled characters. Fourth, players can choose a Random Select option when choosing characters, so now they can select a random CPU selected character for both the opponent and their own player.   Graphics Although players might be instantly dazzled with the size and look of the Street Fighter characters, once you take a good look at them, the honeymoon quickly ends. Simple shaded characters that depend on boxy frames and bright colors simply don't do the imaginative, former 2D characters any justice. Unlike games such as Midway's Ready to Rumble: Round 2, which smoothens out connections using soft skin techniques, all of the SF characters look unrealistic and primitive in comparison. They look like really nice PlayStation characters, but nothing like the characters other next generation games offer, such as Soul Calibur, Tekken Tag Tournament, or Dead or Alive 2: Hardcore.   As for the backgrounds, these are disappointing, too. Little detail, and basic, unimaginative design shows off nothing more than the fact that Capcom hasn't even scratched the surface of the PS2, nor has it really delivered a product that's worthy of its best efforts. Heck, you can still see flickering in the background.   Perhaps the most appealing aspect of the game's graphics is two-fold. Old school fans will love the menu character shots of each character, and while that's not much to gawk at, I couldn't make the point clearer. Second, and definitely more pleasing, is the use of a spectacular particle engine, and lots and lots of light effects.   Lastly and to end on an up note, Street Fighter EX3 loads up real quickly. It takes about 10 seconds to go from the menu to the game itself, and compared to many other games available, it's damn fast.   Sound What can I say here that will shock or amaze you? The sound effects and music in Street Fighter EX3 will not bend your mind, nor will they put you to sleep. Some familiar tunes are weaved into the in-game battles. Strangely enough, the voice acting sounds different than other Street Fighter games. Although it may just be me, these voice actors are slightly off, too. All in all, Street Fighter EX3 keeps the tradition going, but not at its peak. While the framerates have been sped up, what keeps this game from really standing out is a litany of little things. Character response time isn't great. Even with the power of the PS2, it seems that the response time in a game such as Street Fighter Alpha 3 is better. The characters are all stiff and mechanical in movement. With the increased technical features of the PS2, most people would conclude that lighting quick movements and blindingly fast attacks would make this Street Fighter the best in the EX3 series. But that's far from the case. The character design and overall level of detail leaves much to be desired, too. In the end, SFEX3 is a middle of the road fighter that lacks pizzazz and inspiration.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
