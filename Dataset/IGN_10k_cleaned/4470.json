Everyone who had an Atari 2600 had a copy of Pitfall! because it was something entirely unique; platformers weren't considered a cliche in the market yet, and while it wasn't exclusively responsible for the rise of the Super Mario Bros. design, David Crane's design at least got to market before the genre really took off during the 8-bit system days of the mid-80s. And because of the lingering trademark in the minds of the retrogamer, every system generation Activision blows off the dust of its namesake to create a new game in the Pitfall franchise. Pitfall: The Lost Expedition for the Game Boy Advance is a design that's based entirely around the release on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, but developed as its own game with its own gameplay focus. The result, at least for the GBA version, is a solid effort with a good variety of level design, but its direction is hindered by some unfair and awkward elements due to poor choices in structure.  It's not really made clear if the Pitfall Harry character in Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is actually the same Pitfall Harry from the 2600 days, or if he's his son like in the Super NES/Genesis update, or if he's just some Joe Schmo that just happens to have the same name and nickname as the explorer. Whatever the case, this explorer's the same as the one in the 3D console adventure. That version's design and development was handled by Edge of Reality, but for the portable rendition Activision went to Australian developer Torus Games, studio responsible for Minority Report and Doom II for the publisher. The Game Boy Advance version doesn't offer much in the way of game design innovation, but it is a good, challenging package that moves from side-scrolling platformer, to overhead exploration, to old-school minigame challenges.   Most of the game takes place in the side-scroll, and all of these designs involve simply getting from start to finish as unscathed as possible. How? By jumping platforms, swinging and climbing vines, and eliminating the jungle threats by tossing around an endless supply of rocks from a sling, of course. Along the way it's a good idea to snag these weird hourglass-looking icons, since their importance comes into play several levels later; every ten of these icons nets a new offensive attack, and while they're not necessary in completing the game or getting through the different platform layouts, they do help when they're acquired. But these hourglass icons are the only encouragement in exploring beyond the linear fashion of the level designs; there are seemingly no other rewards in straying from the set path, and the game doesn't even keep track of any sort of score for the player.  These side-scrolling levels could definitely have been designed a lot better than they had. The decision to have Harry absolutely massive on-screen might have been done for graphic purposes, because he and the jungle natives do have detailed animation in all of his moves. But being so close to the hero means that there's not much viewing area around him, and there are many, many, many situations where players must perform ~leaps of faith~ because the screen cuts off the rest of the surroundings. Vine swinging in particular is a tricky affair because players are required to leap from one vine to another, but the next vine many times swings off-screen because of the angle it's been drawn. The  The developers try to give players control over the camera to scroll it beyond the standard view while standing still, but it takes a good three seconds for it to trigger...and by that time they might get nailed by an enemy from behind. The vine's collision detection could have also used a tweak or two because Pitfall will oftentimes pass through it without grabbing, a very frustrating occurance.  But even with the issues of the side-scrolling, the game definitely isn't all that bad; it seems like a real cakewalk at the beginning, but the level designs do get to be an incredible beast towards the end. The game's infinite lives comes in handy here, because gamers can try different ways of getting through particularly nasty areas without the annoyance of being penalized a life in reserve.   The secondary levels come in the form of a top-down exploration design where players must locate two lost explorers and the temple to advance into the next part of the game. These levels aren't exactly a tough challenge, but they extend the game's length; each of the five different areas gets increasingly bigger and more maze-like, and it's here where players can earn those previously mentioned extra moves. Each world also features a single mini-game challenge that's based around an old-school game design; one's based around a vertical shooter design like Raiden, others seem lifted out of that classic Atari arcade game Toobin'. The favorite, though, is a satisfyingly tough Frogger-type design where players bounce on a pogo-stick across a river of logs, lilipads, and alligator. It's definitely one of those ~just one more time~ type of challenges.  The overall game design admittedly could be attributed to any character...pop out the Harry sprite and put someone else in there, and it's a whole different franchise. But the developers worked as much ~Pitfall-isms~ into the game, and it really shows that these guys are familiar with the brand. Along with the vine-swinging, you'll find a lot of old-school references: scorpions, rolling logs, and snapping alligator heads from the original Pitfall, and electric eels, poisonous toads, and swooping bats from Pitfall II. There's even a talking jaguar named Quick Claw...a reference to the character from the 80s cartoon and his appearance in Pitfall II. It doesn't look like the 2600 games are in the package, though, so players who want the original experience might want to hit up Aspyr's excellent Activision Anthology compilation for the true Pitfall games. Torus' Pitfall game attempts to improve on what Activision tried on the Super NES and Genesis a decade ago (and what Majesco ported to the GBA for a launch title) in Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure. There are far more references to the Pitfall brand, and a lot more variety in gameplay in Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, but the majority of the game's development revolves around a slightly flawed side-scrolling design that needed a bit of tweaking before it shipped. Other than that issue, Pitfall Harry's latest adventure is a fun, lengthy, if just a little generic one on the handheld.", "date": "Feb 19, 2004"}
