{"name": "Cossacks Gold", "name_review": "Cossacks: European Wars", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/17/cossacks-european-wars", "text": "To suggest that the majority of PC games developed in Europe (UK excluded) are simply clones of successful games developed in North America is to invite criticism. But consider the gameplay of recent imports, such as Hidden & Dangerous, Serious Sam, Earth 2150, America or Sea Dogs, and you might find it hard to disagree. That doesn't imply for a moment that there is any lack of originality in these titles, as each of the aforementioned games improves upon their inspirational subject matter in unique and largely positive ways. Cut from this same cloth is Strategy First's Cossacks; developed in the Ukraine by a little recognized company called GSC Game World  in case you were keeping notes.   A host of online and print previews have generally dismissed Cossacks a derivative knock-off of the Ensemble Studios real-time strategy classic. At first glance the graphics and early gameplay fully support that assertion. But closer inspection of the units, their upgrades, the undulating terrain and the overall scale of the gameplay reveal a game of impressive depth and interesting potential. But, and there's always a ~but~, a number of poor design decisions detract from the playability of the single player modes.   In contrast to AOE, Cossacks models a much smaller slice of history, specifically that of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This was a time of firearms and massive unit formations where tactics and posturing ruled the battlefield, rather than disorganized infantry rushes. Cossacks provides powerful line, column and box formations led by officer units, which provide considerable defensive benefits when combined with a ~hold ground~ command. The abridged timeline doesn't seem to have affected the technology upgrades however, which number more than 300 military and civilian varieties.    There are 16 nations present in Cossacks: Austria, Algeria, England, France, Netherlands, Piemonte, Portugal, Prussia, Poland, Russia, Saxony, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and Venice. Though just a personal preference, this is a much more interesting set of countries than those of the AOE series; I can't remember the last time I met someone whose family heritage was Byzantine or Phoenician  course, maybe I just wasn't asking the right questions. However, the differences in the Cossacks nations are primarily aesthetic; each bears a distinctive architecture (as opposed to the 4 primary styles of AOE), some are very visually impressive. Every nation has several unique units  none are particularly overwhelming, but they do provide some good variety.    Cossacks has a number of single and multiplayer game modes. There are 4 comprehensive campaigns, including a retelling of the thirty-years war that embroiled much of Europe from 1618 to 1648. Each campaign is comprised of scripted scenarios, which are objective-based and told in a text-narrative fashion. There are also ten ~what if~ stand-alone scenarios. A highly configurable random map generator allows you to select from 2 to 7 countries in free-form gameplay. The campaigns, while interesting, are sort of tedious and not nearly as much fun as the random map mode.    The initial gameplay, as mentioned earlier, is remarkably similar to AOE. Provided a small number of peasants you must construct basic buildings, mine resources and provide sustenance by growing crops  there are no sheep or wild boar to hunt. In addition to the standard gold, wood and stone resources, iron and coal must also be obtained. This could have made the economic model more complex, but the designers have dumbed things down by making all of the resources unlimited; for example, farmers will never have to reseed farmland. Once you've constructed a market any single resource may be traded for another  it is even possible to trade gold for gold or food for food, but you'll take a loss (Der!). Unless you are exceedingly stupid and fail to assign enough peasants to their trades the materials should flow in at a dizzying rate. The housing threshold is also quite high, such that I could queue up hundreds of units and peasants without having to construct more than a handful of houses. Ultimately, this all boils down to an exercise of choosing the right ratio of workers to construction needs. Once all of the necessary buildings are erected there is little to do but monitor for the next tech upgrade.       However, the real selling point of Cossacks is the opportunity to stage massive combat situations where up to 8,000 troops can be present on the battlefield at once. In practice, it is very impressive to mount a battle of musketeers marching in line behind a leading troop of pikeman. Exchanges of gunfire are very cool, especially when a howitzer or cannon is involved, troops can fall by the dozens at times and most encounters are short affairs. The terrain is 3D, creating pinch points and defiles that can be exploited to great extent. Catching cavalry in a valley, with rifle companies on the opposing ridges can result in lethal crossfire. Because the units are composed of rendered animations, rather than sprites, Cossacks has an exceptional tabletop miniatures feel to it.   While it is exciting to combat the enemy it is often quite hard to field enough soldiers at one time to create the really interesting sized battles. The problem is that the AI in the single player game will probe you endlessly with mounted units. Any combat unit may convert a non-combat unit or artillery piece simply by moving in close proximity. You must therefore scatter troops within your compound and set them to hold their ground. Otherwise, they will give chase to the enemy, which is often a ruse so that a second cavalry squad can follow behind and capture your people and burn your buildings. But since 17th century firearm units cannot defend themselves in close melee you have yourself a classic Catch 22. It is sad that a single horse unit can ride unabated through your city and capture it entirely. Consequently, you must hurry to construct walls and towers, the latter take forever to construct and aren't very efficient at killing fast moving units. The irony of walls is that, once built, they sap your wood or stone stores at an unbelievable rate. I suppose this is to model the fact that such battlements require high maintenance, but it is just annoying and can be impossible to overcome when the demand is great.  The graphics in Cossacks are consistent with those of AOE, which is to say that they are attractive and will run on relatively low-end hardware; but they won't challenge Tribes 2 anytime soon. The resolution is selectable from 800 x 600 to a whopping 1600 x 1200. Hotkeys allow you to turn buildings translucent  a lifesaver to locate stragglers and orphaned soldiers. Another novel twist is the hotkey for identifying impassable terrain. This is a big help in predicting choke points and determining where to construct walls.  Cossacks, for all of its depth of units, technologies and countries is actually quite accessible to the inexperienced gamer. A very comprehensive HTML-based encyclopedia is available offline that provides detail in both historical reference and gameplay strategies. There is also a tutorial campaign available that covers most every facet of gameplay, but is presented in a manner that allows you to easily skip about and play or replay any part at any time. A lot of North American game companies could learn something from this.    The biggest drawbacks to Cossacks are pacing and AI. Lesser combat units can be churned out with great speed, while artillery and firearm units take forever  though upgrades can balance this out later on. Some of the mounted units move ridiculously fast and can circle your leg units with far too much ease. The balance seems to be way off. But the infallible AI makes these matters even more pronounced. Using a cheat to turn off the fog of war I was able to observe the AI construct their cities and amass their armies. It is clear that no human can possibly keep up with the incredibly high-speed decision-making of the CPU. The AI doesn't necessarily cheat, but the split-second a peasant is freed from one duty he is immediately assigned another, such that downtime is nonexistent for the CPU. This wouldn't be so bad if you could pause to issue orders to your own people. But that little feature, so common to this genre these days, was omitted. Consequently, human players will not be able to multitask at the same rate as a computer opponent and will always be in the hole. Woe is the player that selects multiple AI opponents, as they gang up on the human player 100% of the time. Since there is no diplomacy model or a means of selecting teams in the mission selection menu anything greater than a one-on-one battle is excruciating.   Cossacks has every potential to be a classic historical RTS. The units are diverse and the potential for huge battles is compelling, but I'll be damned if I can get to that point in solo play. Multiplayer is excellent, however, since cease-fire agreements can be made via chat; such as until you reach a certain point, say two hours of gameplay or the first person to reach the 18th century. Had the developers only implemented a ~give orders while paused~ mode, solo gameplay could be salvaged. Frankly, Cossacks would have been much more fun as just a battle simulator (like Sid Meier's Gettysburg games). The economic game seems arbitrary and really could have been dropped; perhaps in lieu of granting prestige points for unit selection (like in the Panzer General games). Cossacks is flying off the shelves in Europe as of this writing, but the North American audience is not likely to warm to such frustrating gameplay. With luck, a patch will correct these shortcomings; otherwise it is probably better to hold out for Empire Earth, which is being developed in New England  in case you're still keeping notes.  -- David Kozlowski      Want to share your opinions with the world?
