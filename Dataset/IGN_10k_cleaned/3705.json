Though this demo game was called Star Giants, it was clear that the team based its design upon the classic Wing Commander PC game; and several months later, the project evolved into what's been officially released by DSI Games as Wing Commander: Prophecy, a Game Boy Advance conversion of the sequel/spinoff released on the PC back in 1997. The team did everything it could to squash the entire PC presentation into a far less roomy GBA cartridge, which is impressive in its own right. But due to the handheld's system's graphic, sound, and control limitations, the game doesn't come off quite as smoothly on the Game Boy Advance. Features 48 missions Cartridge save (four slots) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Wing Commander Prophecy marks the first time Raylight Studios' BlueRoses 3D engine has been used in a retail Game Boy Advance game, and Prophecy's game design makes for a perfect first time out for the technology. The game engine only has to render a few ships or objects at a time, and doesn't have to worry about modeling any terrain since the game's set in the void of outer space. Since the graphics are cut to a minimum, the combat stays at a relatively quick pace, which keeps the energy level of the gameplay high. There are nearly fifty missions in Wing Commander Prophecy, which should keep space combat folks occupied for a good amount of time.  But it's the lack of buttons on the Game Boy Advance, as well as the limited cartridge media, that makes this port far less complete than the original PC design. As fluid and as solid as the space combat in Wing Commander Prophecy is, the player's controls are restricted due to fewer buttons on the system, and even though the developers ~share~ buttons for multiple function, the developers still had to restrict abilities during combat; they cannot look around them to catch an enemy on their tail, for example, and if there are multiple targets in sight players cannot switch between them manually. And though we can certainly see why there were omissions in control, some decisions in control could have been altered to give the player more functions; if the Afterburner function was moved off the L + R function and instead placed on an R button double-tap, the L + R function could have been used for a ~look around~ when used with the D-pad. Instead, players pretty much have to wait for the enemy to take a shot on the rear of the ship to know when a bogey's on the six.  And since the game's controls and space combat are a little on the complex side, it's a real shame that the developers didn't include any sort of training mission so that players can simply fly around freely without worry of getting killed. Even the original Wing Commander featured a training machine in the rec room that could be played for high scores. Something like that needed to be added to Wing Commander Prophecy, since there's a good chance that players will die in the first mission...and since they can't save their game until after the first mission's over, these players will have to go through the introduction again. That bit's a minor complaint; but the trainer? Major.  The game's 32-megabit cartridge means that there's not a whole lot of room for the cutscenes and storyline. The original PC game featured scripted and filmed video sequences placed on several CD-ROMs. Those video sequences have been reduced on the GBA to simple still-screens of the actors, and text boxes for the dialogue. The dialogue is incredibly wordy and in many places it's just stupid small-talk between the different characters on the ship; and since the ~actions~ of the characters aren't scripted like the dialogue, (like sitting down, standing up, pacing about, entering a room), it seems even more out of place when everything's just ~spoken~ with talking heads. Some conversations just go on far too long; luckily hitting the start button will skip it right to the next point in the game. Unfortunately, that means the story's missed...and it's a pretty involved plot. It's a messy Catch 22. But for those who just want to get in and kick some tail, the game features a really decent four player link-up option, but like the lack of a trainer mission, this mode would have been great as a single player option.  The wordy dialogue is a bit of a drag for those expecting to just jump right in and kick some Kilrathi tail, and the ~missing~ training missions hurt the overall presentation. The space combat features an impressive and fast 3D engine on the GBA, but it lacks a bit in control; it's a lot of fun once you work through the limitations, though. Overall, the port of the GBA game is a commendable job, especially with what the developer had to work with to get the game to move from PC to handheld.", "date": "Jun 9, 2003"}
