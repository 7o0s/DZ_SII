Pack lots of mind-numbingly  clich storyline around tiny tidbits of clumsy action and the result is a boring title that still has the balls to ask you to wait around for Vol. 2. With just over one hour of real action in a game that takes 6-8 hours to finish, this is one only for the hardcore... and even they should avoid it. The plot follows a kid with the tragically unfortunate name of Sumner Sturgeon who's a new entry in a futuristic military unit where he gets to pilot LFOs -- massive robots that use weapons and melee attacks. Sumner's LFO progression is pretty obvious. He'll get more weapons, armor, and other upgrades as time goes on. Sadly, his personal progression can be seen a mile away as well. He meets a girl in school, makes friends, gets sad as the girl leaves, and spends the rest of the game doing good for others while trying to find the girl.   The plot would be bearable if it was original or well done, but it isn't. This is junior high soap opera stuff that gets old fast even though it takes forever to play out. It doesn't help that the plot switches back and forth from being done with voice-acting or with text boxes for each character. The lead character is also a complete dud who talks like a fool and can't even recognize the girl he loves when she dyes her hair a different color. It all helps to make you wonder why the hell you're wasting your time and where the action is. The best part of the game is when Sumner stops talking about the LFOs and actually gets in one to do some damage. This takes a while because there's no exploration when piloting; all of the moving around takes place in the several cutscenes. This means that the battles take place in different arenas and they're all pathetically easy to win. Circling around and launching missiles takes care of almost everyone. When that gets old you can swoop in and mash on the melee button. It's almost decent, but the action is never fun. This is a world where strategies don't belong. The battle's biggest appeal is that they're better than the rest of the game. Sumner occasionally walks around and takes on other humans with weapons and his fists. These parts feel like Eureka Seven is trying to simulate what it would be like if Sumner's was suffering from a permanent a dizzy spell -- as the controls make accurate fighting nearly impossible. The hoverboard races and battles suffer from similar problems. Its controls are so clumsy that it's a wonder anyone gets anywhere. In one race you can see two other racers who never leave the starting gate. As for the battles, they may look cool, but success is simply a matter of button-mashing.After half a dozen hours of nonsense, Sumner finally gets a kick-ass LFO to pilot and do some serious damage with. Unfortunately, the game ends after only one battle and asks you to wait until next time. Why? Is the gameplay suddenly going to get smoking hot? Will there be a bigger dose of action? Will the writing improve? The answer to all of these questions is likely ~yes,~ but only because the only possible direction from here is up. If you want to watch an interesting anime, watch an anime and if you want to play a fun game, find one of those. But don't think for a minute that either of those two things happens here.", "date": "Oct 18, 2006"}
