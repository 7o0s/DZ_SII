Starting with NFL Blitz, and following with games such as Hydro Thunder, and now the sequel to Ready to Rumble, gamers get to revel in hilarious, light-hearted sports and action games that are easy to pick up and play, and filled with extras, bonuses, and secrets.   Ready to Rumble is a perfect example of Midway's arcade abilities. It's also the exact reason that games like these have a two-year lifespan -- at most. People will buy this kind of game maybe twice before they realize that along with light, arcade play there is always no gameplay depth. Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a solid sequel to last year's game, with lots of improvements, and changes made to better the gameplay, but it hasn't really changed that equation a bit.   The downside for the PlayStation version is that it's not nearly as quick, responsive, good looking, or as finely polished as the Dreamcast of PlayStation 2 versions. It's so inferior to both that it's the difference is startling.   Gameplay Ready to Rumble made its debut on N64 and Dreamcast last year, followed by the PlayStation version. For anyone familiar with Round 1, Round 2 plays exactly like the first. Players have low and high punches, lefts and rights, and they can attack with combinations, and flurries, once they spell out the word RUMBLE. Just like last year, to spell out RUMBLE, players need to land serious blows to the opponent. In this version, players are given a few new treats that round off many of last year's flaw-riddled game. To start, players earn three levels of RUMBLE, each one setting off a different flurry. The third time you spell it, the letters turn white and once you connect with the opponent, he or she will literally fly out of the ring, summersaulting into the stands.   Of course, one of the game's most entertaining qualities is the lineup of characters, and most of last year's characters have returned. There are also nearly 30 characters in all, a hefty addition to last year's roster. First time favorites such as Rocket Sanchez, Lulu Valentine, Afro Thunder, Jet ~Iron~ Chin, Mama Tua, Boris ~The Bear~ Knockimov, and almost all of the others are here. They look...similar, but they more look like strangely deformed versions of their next generation cousins. Mouths are out of whack, their skins look like they've been through third-degree fires, and they just don't...look all that...cohesive.   What makes this version so mainstream friendly, so very celebrity cool, so funky fresh, is the inclusion of real live celebrities. Back from Wonderland is the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, along with the NBA's current MVP and the Lakers' star center, Shaquille O'Neal. Both appear as opponents in the ring, and eventually become playable characters, once you have unlocked them. I gotta tell you, playing as Michael Jackson is both very weird and strangely satisfying. It's just stupid fun to hear him yell, ~Rumble!~  cause he has such a high, kiddy, girly voice. It's also goofy fun to see him perform his trademark moves  and the moonwalk  when he's finished a fight. Oh yeah, his white glove? It's there, wrapped around the glove.   Shaq is cool, too, and I am an old Laker's fan, so it's neat to have him in the game, but he doesn't translate that well into a videogame character. I mean, I'm not sure if he just doesn't have strong enough facial characteristics, or what, but he doesn't look a whole lot Shaq. In any case, whether he looks like himself or not, one thing is for sure  he's extremely powerful, has some deadly combos, and he has a long, long reach. Hey, hey, Midway isn't dumb! Shaq has to be the man. After all, he's the NBA league MVP (and he's 300-plus pounds).    There are also certain political figures who appear, and let's see, they happen to live in the white house...Hmmm... Also, I have to throw this in because of the sheer hilarity of it all  the new Canadian character -- Freak E. Deke? He's a stroke genius. I love that freak. This is what makes Ready to Rumble so endearing  its funny, loveable, ridiculous characters.   Most of the loose ends appear to have been sewed up in Round 2. Taking note of last year's incredibly easy Exhibition mode, in which you could bet the house and 99% of the time win all of the money, or in Training mode, wherein you could simply cheat by choosing automatic, or in Career mode, in which you could win by simply fighting with the same few punches over and over again, Midway has made a few changes. First, if you choose to have a Career, you land a gym named after yourself, and you get to train in it. In this mode, players follow a schedule of Championship and Exhibition fights, each staggered throughout months in the year, so that they must train in between the fights to build up their vitals. Players build up aspects such as strength, endurance, power, speed, etc., to contend against the more powerful opponents. But if you loose more than three championship fights, you loose the gym and have to start all over again.   Other worthwhile modes include Arcade and Tournament. Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a classic example of a good, light, arcade game that is now more well rounded than ever before. It's fun for a few hours, and maybe a few days, depending on your experience with videogames. This game is sure to draw in the newcomers, casual gamers, and the families, but it's not going to quell the thirst of the experienced vet.   After having played the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast versions of the game, however, you really won't want to play either the Nintendo or the PlayStation versions. The PlayStation version suffers from several problems, including slow response time, a slightly out-of-synch sound system that's really quite surreal when a character starts his or her rumble, and some really weird glitches. The foremost glitch is the totally random introduction into a boxing match that's in progress of a character who's not even in the fight. While that doesn't effect gameplay, it's damn weird.   I noticed instantly that even in the medium mode, the balance between characters is uneven. I got whooped in the first round -- I never get whooped in the first round against the computer! What effects the fighting so much is the slow response, because quicker characters just don't have that same action as in the PS2 and Dreamcast versions. Last, but not least, one of the worst aspects of the game, after numerous attempts, is that tripping the Rumble combos is difficult at best. After repeatedly pressing the four shoulder buttons simultaneously I enacted rumble about 10% of the time, and then got walloped because I was just sitting there like a duck. This is one of the most crucial parts of the game, and it shouldn't be hard to pull off at all. It was so discouraging that I stopped trying it altogether. Shame shame!  Graphics The first game looked great, and the PlayStation version looks better than the last PlayStation version. The textures are more defined, and the facial animations are pretty well synched up most of the time, but they aren't all that consistent. Several of the facial characteristics look pretty awkward, in fact, and the texture skins don't work that well on this version. Many of the fine details are just muddied up, It's partly due to the restrictive RAM and resolution of the PS, and that can't be helped. But the result is that many of the characters look like they have suffered through terrible fires and explosions and their skins have been reconstructed through surgery. Not good, kids, not good at all.   Another interesting graphic feature is the opening movie. While the actual movies in the game are crude and unsightly, the opening movie in Round 2 is cool, a creatively designed collage of fighters, selected scenes, and quick takes. Much like the feeling created by the PS's WWF in Attitude, Round 2 creates a strong feeling with its first movie.   Sound ~Let's get ready to rumble!~ -- The opening song is still as catchy as ever, although it's definitely overused. And Michael Buffer once again appears in each round to give you his officially overused and overly expensive line. He also appears as an opponent monster character in one of the levels, and it's quite cool to see him transform and play. You just have to beat the Arcade mode to find out just how he looks.   As in the first game, the voices for each character in Round 2 are almost always funny, appropriate and tailored to the peculiarity of that character. The new cowboy character sounds strangely familiar to anyone who knows Andrew Hoolan (former Midway employee who rocked the house), Freak E. Deke is a scream, and Afro Thunder is as over the top as ever (~It's time to dance, it's time to dance!~). The punching and knockout sounds are also wonderfully exaggerated and likeable, too. Overall, the sound department gets high scores all around. Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a nice sequel to the first game, and it's fun to play for about four hours. Once you have played through it with a bunch of characters, though, you really don't need to play it again. This one is strictly for newbies and casual gamers.  For those folks who want a really fun party-style game in the vein of arcade boxing, Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 is a great game to own. It's got more multiplayer game modes than before, and it's a little deeper and provides a whole new crew of boxers who are simply funny to watch and listen to. I especially enjoy listening to their opening speeches and their taunts. The addition of celebrities Shaq, Michael Jackson, Mr. President and the First Lady is quite astonishing to see and play. However, if you own more than system, such as a PlayStation 2 or a Dreamcast, I recommend those versions over this one, hands-down. The look is totally different but the gameplay is simply better on those versions. They are quicker, more balanced, and they are more polished. If you own a PS and a N64, you're kind of out of luck, but of the two, I would recommend the PS version. It's a little faster and since there isn't a four-player mode in the N64 version, there's no need to get the N64 version. Overall, R2R2 is a decent game, it certainly has its place. It's not deep, but it provides lots of extras and lots of light-hearted fun.", "date": "Nov 18, 2000"}
