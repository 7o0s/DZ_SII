Surviving Hollywood follows the basic conventions of the previous Surviving games, but the new story and objectives are different enough that any gamer currently enjoying the Surviving High School games won;t feel double-dipped by downloading Hollywood.   Surviving Hollywood chronicles the tale of an aspiring actor arriving in Los Angeles with a heart full of hope and a head full of determination. You have only a month to break into the industry, so as soon as you step off the bus, it's time to beat the streets and get your career on the road. Needless to say, Surviving Hollywood isn't exactly realistic. One month to break into Hollywood? No casting couch? No mention of falling into the wrong crowd out in Chatsworth and ending up on the set of a movie that daddy wouldn't necessarily be proud of?   But, then again, Centerscore is selling a game here, not schadenfreude.   So, instead of worrying about the darker side of Hollywood dreams, you need to go out and find jobs from a community board so you can pay rent, buy your 8 x 10s, and landing auditions. Showing up to work and appointments on time is a big deal in game, so you must successfully manage your in-game schedule. Mercifully, Surviving Hollywood offers an intuitive sked for hitting your marks as needed.   You must also take care of yourself, too -- this is Hollywood, after all. If you don't look good, you can't expect fame and fortune to float your way. Your body shape and face must be taken care of, so be sure to hit the gym and beauty shops. Getting trimmed, plucked, and toned is as important as keeping your stress in check, which is boosted through work and general career malaise. You can reduce stress by going out, but that's when you meet goofball characters like -- my favorite -- The Jeff. Everybody knows a dude like this; with all due gravity, he refers to himself in the third-person and throws a ~the~ in front of his moniker.   That kind of ~The Jeff~ humor permeates the entire game, making Surviving Hollywood an enjoyable read as well as play. The writer deserves solid kudos -- this is sharp, but good-natured stuff. The airy nature of the game is infectious. I kept playing just out of curiosity over what would possibly come next in my Hollywood quest. What goofball lurked around the next corner?   The minigames are the weakest part of the formula. I understand the need to go really casual to appeal to a broad audience, but with a decent twitch on your thumb, you can breeze through most challenges.   Like the Surviving High School series, Centerscore plans to have downloadable content available for Surviving Hollywood in the future. Episodic content is a big part of the company vision, so you can sincerely expect to see this stuff delivered, not just promised.  Surviving Hollywood is a great production from start to end -- the pacing and smart writing will keep you hooked. Juggling all of your tasks may sound daunting at first, but the game never overwhelms you. My only complaint is that the minigames are a little too easy-peasy, but I understand the need to go ultra-cas for the audience. If you dig the Surviving High School games (and apparently a lot of people do) or just want a breezy adventure game, this is a fun download.", "date": "Aug 3, 2007"}
