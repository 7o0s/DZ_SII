Just ask the Hori family, whose members have been toiling away in mines on one sort or another since Dig Dug first debuted in arcades in 1982. In the Dig Dug universe, Mr. Dug is actually miner Taizo Hori, father of Susumu Hori, who carries on the family business in the Mr. Driller series of games.   If you weren't aware that there is actually a Dig Dug universe, then this is probably your first encounter with Mr. Driller, and that's unfortunate, seeing as the Xbox Live Arcade installment, Mr. Driller Online is a lukewarm introduction to the game. That's not to say that the basic bones of the game aren't here. They are, but they're wrapped in a lackluster -- and in some places broken -- skin.   Mr. Driller Online is an arcade-style puzzle game in which Susumu and friends use their pointy powers to smash colored blocks for points and pleasure. Break a cube that's part of a chain of four or more like-colored blocks and you'll break them all, a familiar puzzler convention that allows for combos, chains and some hairy moments.   Drilling is my business and business is good.   Your goal is to break blocks, grab special items and drill to the bottom of the level, racking up as many points as possible along the way. It's a simple concept that grows ever more complex as you make your way deeper and deeper underground. Make the wrong decision and 30 rows of pastel madness will crush you to death. Make all the right moves, and you'll unleash waves of satisfying combos.    All this must be accomplished while breathing, of course, which is tough to do underground. That's why you'll have to collect precious air capsules along the way to keep your oxygen level at 100 percent. When it drops to zero, you're dead. There are five main levels to choose from, each with increasing difficulty, and there are also five additional ~quest~ levels that place restrictions on you (time limits, air capsule collection caps, etc.).    The menu screen, widescreen borders, basic single-player functionality and music in Mr. Driller Online are very nicely done. The rest ranges from disappointing to horrendous. At the disappointing end of the spectrum lies Mr. Driller Online's gameplay field. Although the sides of the screen are bright and sharp, the center of the screen, where the action takes place, is dull and washed-out. If you were looking for a high-definition Mr. Driller experience (you know who you are), this ain't it.    But where Mr. Driller Online truly fails is in its multiplayer functionality which, for all intents and purposes, does not exist. I tried joining and hosting both Player and Ranked matches, both Quick and Custom all day long and experienced game-breaking lag each and every time. My character would sit, frozen, at the top of the screen as I tried unsuccessfully to drill. Occasionally, he would stutter and shake as if possessed, only to stop again, motionless while my oxygen ticked away.   Yep. Choose that one.   The last time I tested the online multiplayer, it froze my Xbox 360 completely, forcing me to shut the system off and restart. Needless to say, I didn't make another attempt.   Three IGN editors tried to go online with Mr. Driller from three separate locations with three separate machines and had the exact same debilitating lag each and every time. In addition to the lag problems, online matchmaking seemed to be broken as well, as none of us were able to invite one another to games or accept game invitations from one another.   For any Xbox Live Arcade game, these kinds of network problems would be terribly frustrating, but for a game with the word ~online~ in the title, it's just plain unacceptable. We checked with Microsoft to see if a patch was on the way for Mr. Driller Online and were told the company would check on the issue. By the end of the day, we hadn't received a reply.    As of this writing, Mr. Driller Online not only has no online function, it also has no multiplayer function at all because the game doesn't support local play. So if you download the game today, you'll get a slightly blah version of an old arcade puzzler that you can only play alone, weeping over what could have been.   There are so many good XBLA puzzle games with functional online components that it's impossible for me to recommend downloading Mr. Driller Online at this point. Mr. Driller Online was billed as an online multiplayer version of an oldie but goodie. It doesnt fit that description, and I've rated it accordingly. If an eventual patch fixes the multiplayer, then we could have a solid all-around experience on our hands. Until then, only spend your points if you're an eccentric Dig Dug collector who doesnt mind lazy presentation.", "date": "Apr 2, 2008"}
