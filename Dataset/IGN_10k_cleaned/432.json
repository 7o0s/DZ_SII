The better news is that Michael Jordan is making his triumphant return to videogames and we couldn't be happier. The bad news is, for all of the features and improvements thrown into NBA Live 2000, the game has a few problems with frame rates that dampen all of the cool new stuff. The game boils down to a mixture of pluses and minuses. Whatever grabs your attention most will determine your opinion of the game. The stuff that grabbed our attention affected our opinions and you can read about below.  The Facts   Enhanced Pro-Action artificial intelligence will have players acting and reacting with more basketball sense. EA Sports claims NBA Live 2000 will be the first game to have facial animations that match a player's shouts and yells. New 3D polygon players with real time lighting. An N64 exclusive arcade mode with all new special effects.  All new transition scenes for fouls, injuries and free throws. New camera angles deliver the NBA attitude with TV-style cut scenes. Play one-on-one games against NBA players on an outdoor court. Original game soundtrack featuring funk, hip-hop and blues mixes. New on-the-court sounds from players, coaches and fans. Multiple season mode with General Manager feature. Game engine suggests legitimate player trades during season modes. Official NBA license. 1999 player and team statistics. Rumble Pak compatible.   Gameplay Improved artificial intelligence is always the most important new feature to any series of sports games, especially when you're talking about a hoop game. We wanted Live 2000 to challenge us to the point where we'd have to use all of our wits to succeed in this game whether we're playing alone or against some friends. Even when you notch up the difficulty to the toughest of the four settings, you're not challenged to find a weakness in a defense or how to stop an offense. You're challenged to overcome your team's inability to handle the ball, connect on a simple pass or hit a high percentage shot. You're challenged to somehow stay in the game while the computer controlled opponent hits 80 percent of its shots.   While the artificial intelligence in Live 2000 isn't as sophisticated as we'd like it to be, there is some kind of challenge to the game and that's better than none. We're used to the ~cheating~ A.I. where you can't do anything right while the computer plays the game perfectly, but it's jus something we'd expect from an NBA JAM type of arcade game rather than a title that's supposed to be the best five on five sim on the console.   The one on one mode is actually a wonderful addition and such an obvious idea that it made us wonder why someone didn't think of it sooner. Beyond just the nostalgia appeal, the one-on-one mode, where you can unlock Michael Jordan, is a great way to refine your individual hoop skills because you'll need them in the five on five games. If you do manage to beat Jordan, you will have sufficiently mastered at least a couple of offensive and defensive techniques because he's the toughest challenge in the game. Each player gets a numerical rating for their overall skills and Jordan, the best player in the game, gets an 88. The marquee players in the NBA are mostly in the 80s but even if someone like Tim Duncan, an 82, goes against Jordan it won't be as close you'd think. Duncan's taller, has better post moves and is one of the best players in the game but you still will have to be very good to get by Jordan.  What happens when you beat Jordan? First you'll put the controller down and step back from your N64 with a grin of triumph on your face. Then, after you've done your victory dance and celebration,  you'll be able to select Jordan from the list of free agent players available in the Season and Exhibition modes. You could rebuild the Bulls championship team if you wanted to but you'll have to do so without Dennis Rodman, Craig Hodges and Bill Paxson. You can actually assign Jordan to whatever team you'd like and live out all kinds of ~what if~ NBA fantasies.  The three point shootout mode is a nice change of pace and give you a chance to refine your jump shooting skills, which can of course be applied to the regular five on five sim mode. You can setup a real life All-Star competition with players being eliminated and moving on to championship rounds, or you can just go head to head against any player in the NBA. The trick here is to master you B button timing because touch on the ball is the only requirement here. You want to release your shot at the top of your jump but the best three point shooters will give you a little leeway.   As we said, the A.I. of Live 2000 just isn't as complex as what we've come to expect from other EA Sports titles like the Madden NFL games. However to compensate for this lack of sophistication, Live has given us options in the one-one-one modes and the three point shoot out modes to refine the skills we'll need to succeed against the A.I. that is in the game. Breaking down individual defenders and being able to nail that jumpshot whenever you need it is exactly what you'll need to rely on if you're going to overcome the hardnosed defenders.   Graphics This is the biggest drawback to Live 2000. The runs at a consistent framerate, but it's a very choppy and well below the 30 frames per second we expect from the N64. Also the player models themselves look very stylized and abstract, but not very appealing.   There's no difference between the framerate in the five on five modes and the one-on-one modes. The player models in the one-on-one mode are bigger but considering there's only two guys on the court at one time, we expected them to move a lot smoother. This is the case in Acclaim's NBA Jam 2000, but for Live your guys move more or less the same way, it's just easier to see because they're bigger.  The players themselves have the same angular, abstract look that many of EA's crop of '2000' games have, but for some reason it's especially disturbing in a basketball game. Jordan looks like Jordan, but mainly because he's bald and wearing number 23. The flat, sprites that make up the players in the game just seem really simply done. This is normally okay since it will result in a faster game but there's no excuse to have simple looking players and still have choppy framerates.  The cut scenes within the game, usually replays and free throw sequences, might have been better left  on the drawing board. The speed on these cut scenes and replays may actually drop to the single digits and are painful to watch. Since these scenes are supposed to be the personality of the game and give us that NBA vibe that EA Sports is always telling us is ~in the game,~ you'd think they would've been given more attention. Flipbooks with little stick figures on them can be more engaging than these cut scenes that reveal the horrible crowd texture and blurry backgrounds.  The Big Ticket, Kevin Garnett, did most of the motion capture modeling for the game's animations, but the game's slow framerates and unimpressive player models really get in the way of enjoying the custom animations. In fact, the only time where you'll be able to really appreciate any of the mo-capped animation is on celebrations after big plays. Fist pumping and raising of the hands over the head are great little additions that bring home the attitude of the NBA, but surely they're not worth bringing in Minnesota's franchise player to capture.  Sound A real strength of the game. The noise of the crowd is always important in a sports game and Live 2000 has some great fans in those stands, even if they do look a little like ugly wallpaper. They sound great and work well with the sneaker and ball sound effects and the game announcer.   The background music is a real treat but it would be easy for us to see how people who are against hip-hop would be irritated by the constant beatboxing and sound effects. We happen to be fans of The Roots and Rahzel's one-man-sound-system skills are all you get and all you'll need in this game.. In their efforts to connect the 'urban-ness' of the NBA to their videogame, EA Sports managed to nab one of the most talented artists around and apply some originality to their game. The credibility that comes with associating a known artist with a videogame is nothing to be overlooked, and we haven't.    Live 2000 is a nice effort to improve on a familiar franchise but the game suffers because of its choppiness. None of the great additions like Jordan, the one-one-mode, the three point shoot out or new face mapping have the same impact when the gameplay itself isn't enjoyable because your eyes can't stay focused. Also all of the great features that were included in the PSX version of the game and left out of the N64 version don't help either. The teams of NBA greats would've been a great bonus to have in our version of the game. Perhaps the N64's base audience can't appreciate such a feature, but if EA Sports isn't going to give it to them, then there should certainly be enough in the version we do get to keep us interested. There is, but there's just too much visual static that gets in the way", "date": "Nov 20, 1999"}
