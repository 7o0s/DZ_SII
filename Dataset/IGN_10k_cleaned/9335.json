Unfortunately, this XBLA remake serves as a reminder that games really have been getting better over the years.   Speedball 2 originally appeared on computers in 1990.  I give developer Bitmap Brothers props for creating a new ~sport~ with their game, but the mechanics boil down to a lot of button mashing and frustration.  There are three ways to score points: throw the ball into your opponent's goal, hit one of numerous targets set around the arena, or injure a member of the opposing team to the point they are removed from the game.  There are also power-ups waiting to be picked up and teleport holes that will transport the ball from one end of the court to the other.  It's difficult to take advantage of all these options, though, especially for the new Speedball player.   The AI is pretty unforgiving at first.  Whatever you're attempting to pull off, a computer-controlled player is bound to barrel over you and steal the ball.  Adding to the frustration is the fact that, while the court is rather large, the camera is zoomed-in to a small portion of it.  As the ball is tossed around the area, the camera will zip across to follow, and then it takes a moment to figure out which player you're now controlling.  You can't select which team mate to command -- the game automatically assigns the player closest to the ball to you.  It doesn't help that all your teammates look alike.  In fact, while you can play a Speedball tournament or cup against many teams in single-player, you're always the blue team and your opponent is always the red team.   Speedball is more fun played against a human opponent.  But even then, gameplay boils down to a lot of button mashing.  I'm not saying button mashing can't be fun, but the thrill is usually short-lived.  Unfortunately, as with several recent XBLA releases, the online multiplayer arenas are a virtual ghost town at present.   In between matches you can spend money earned from wins and collected off the floor during a game (?) to upgrade your team members' stats.  The length at which you can customize your team is surprising, and is a welcome addition that adds a little depth to what is otherwise a pretty shallow game.   You'll probably want to kick it old school with the graphics in Speedball 2. Like many classic games on XBLA, Speedball 2 includes an ~enhanced graphics~ mode.  And, like many classic games on XBLA, this feature stretches the definition of ~enhanced.~  The people most likely to get into this game are the ones that played it back in the day, and they'll probably appreciate the nostalgia factor of the original graphics.  The enhanced images are more generic and lack the personality of the old school sprites.Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is not terrible, by any means.  It's a faithful translation of a classic game that many gamers have fond memories of playing.  The gameplay hasn't aged well, though, leaving most of the game's appeal to fans of the original.  If you are one of those said fans, ten dollars isn't a bad price for a trip down memory lane.  If you never played Speedball 2 before, though, it may be all too apparent why you missed it the first time around.", "date": "Oct 26, 2007"}
