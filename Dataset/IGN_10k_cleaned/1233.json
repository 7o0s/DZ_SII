Both series include lush 2D art, bold character designs, and a strong reliance on the quarter-circle-forward ~Ha-do-ken~ style of special moves. In recent years,  Capcom and SNK seem to have been taking friendly pot-shots at each other, including sneaky references and in-jokes (the least subtle of which is the character of Dan, intended as a shameless ripoff of SNK's ponytailed male protagonists). But the possibility of both companies teaming up to create a Fighters Megamix of the 2D variety? Ha! Perish the thought.  Obviously, it came as an enormous shock when Capcom announced that it would be teaming up with SNK to create a handheld Versus game for the Neo-Geo Pocket Color. This would pave the way for a brand-spankin' new, NAOMI-based brawler that would finally answer the oft-asked question: if Ryu and Terry Bogard got in a fight, who would win? Capcom vs. SNK: Match of the Millennium came out just in time for Christmas last year, delighting NGPC fans with the best handheld fighting game  ever. With tons of hidden characters and mini-games galore, the pint-sized brawler could only make us wonder what the rival companies would put out for the full-fledged console release. And now that the final version is now happily spinning in our Dreamcasts, it's time to pass down the final verdict: good, but not earth-shattering. While it isn't the DC-based equivalent to the godly smattering of gaming that was Match of the Millennium, Capcom vs. SNK delivers exactly what the kids want: each company's top roster taking on the other in a decent  and kinda pretty  2D fighting game.  The game's roster is loaded. From the get-go, you're given access to fifteen fighters from each side, representing the cream of the crop from Street Fighter, The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, and even Samurai Shodown. In order to cater to fans of both series, the game allows you to select from two different ~Grooves~ at character select, signaling minor adjustments in gameplay styles and charge attacks. Not only that, but the plot changes depending on which Groove you select -- the Capcom fighters wind up butting heads with M. Bison, whose evil plans involve harvesting psycho power to create the ultimate fighter. On the other hand, the SNK boys meet up with Geese Howard, who exists for the sole purpose of getting his ass kicked and falling off a building (just like every other game he's appeared in).  The typical six-button control scheme has been cut down to four buttons (eliminating the medium-power attacks), with charging and blocking occurring when you hold two buttons at once. The controls feel adequate and responsive (as always), and I suspect that the game was built on the core Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine in order to save time  some of the 3D effects and option screens bear suspicious resemblance to this year's other over-the-top brawler. Unfortunately, a lot of SNK fans will be crying foul regarding the ~dumbing down~ of some characters  a lot of The King of Fighters' moves have been given the axe, meaning that you may not be able to dish out the smack anymore with your perfectly-honed Iori skills.   Capcom vs. SNK takes a dangerous step forward in gameplay balance, by adopting a questionable ~ratio~ system. At the character select stage, you're given four ~Blocks~ for characters  average characters take two blocks, bosses take three, and most of the girls wind up with one. This means that anyone who's really good with the level-one characters will be mildly irritated, since their favorite characters are critically weakened from the get-go. Theoretically, this means that a team consisting of Sakura, Dhalsim, Blanka, and Benimaru are equal to a team made up of only Evil Ryu.  Graphically, the game is a mix of good and bad. The backgrounds are high-resolution 2D bitmaps with decent amounts of background animation  you'll spot Jubei from Samurai Shodown drinking coffee outside the game center, and you'll giggle madly as an under-construction dojo crumbles around you during a fight. All of the SNK crowd (and half of the Capcom guys) have been redrawn, and look much cleaner than the fishy-looking sprites in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 -- yet I cringe whenever I see the blobby mess of pixels that are Morrigan and Sakura. And all the characters are still stuck in low-res, running at a pixel-doubled 320x240 resolution, on top of 640x480 backdrops. Damn.  To make up for this deficiency, the game's presentation goes to eleven. The menus are of the super-hyperactive-spinny-3D variety, and the soundtrack? Gads! Capcom has finally broken away from the crap-sounding Q-sound disco guitars, and cut some top-notch industrial tracks. Too bad the ~Final Fight~ song is gonna get axed in the domestic version, since saying ~Motherf___er~ in the USA is a very big no-no.  And if you're truly hardcore, you'll be playing this one for a long time. As you play the game, a GPS at the bottom of the screen tracks your performance, and tallies up ~Secret Points.~ Once you acquire enough of these, you can start unlocking all seventy-seven options in Secret Mode, which grant you everything from new characters (such as Evil Iori and Evil Ryu) to EX versions of your favorite brawlers. And if you've been playing ~Olympic Mode~ in the NGPC version of Match of the Millenium, you'll be able to trade in those points with a link cable! Tres cool!  But wait  that's not all! There's also a full-featured color edit mode, where you can tweak the RGB values of each character's 16-color palette. Now you can give Zangief green hair and purple briefs, or edit the color of Sakura's underwear... um, not that we'd think of doing that. And there are plenty of undocumented mini-cutscenes that appear when rival characters meet each other (try pairing up Terry and Ken, or Yuri and Sakura).  Obviously, the game's got a lot going for it  but we can't help but notice several glaring omissions in the character roster. Where'd the dapper, mulleted Andy Bogard get to? What about the deadly submission grappler Blue Mary? How can a game be complete without the Super-Taunting, totally worthless Dan? And, dammit, where the hell is Duck King, anyway? Sure, the inclusion of Nakoruru from Samurai Shodown is beyond cool  but don't forget that the mighty Haohmaru is still stuck living in the NGPC version. And if they wanted to get really obscure, they shoulda thrown in a few characters from Breakers, too...  Ah well  there's always next year. And even with the lack of several favorite characters, Capcom vs. SNK has more than enough solid gameplay, hidden goodies, and sneaky in-jokes to please the most jaded of fighting game fans. The fact like a game like this could even get made is an accomplishment in itself  and we can only hope that the dying ashes of SNK can be rekindled into a beautiful new Versus franchise, with liberty and jugs of whoop-ass for all.  -- Colin ~Real-life Brazilian Jujitsu Turtler~ Williamson, IGN", "date": "Sep 12, 2000"}
