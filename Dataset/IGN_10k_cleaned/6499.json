Deal with it. Or don't, especially since EA Sports just released the first NCAA basketball title of the season. March Madness '99 is the next in the EA Sports college basketball franchise, and like last year's version it s not only is a decent game of hoops, but it also injects the energy that only die-hard (and drunken) students can offer.The momentum meter is back, a feature that was touched upon last year and brought back for '99. Teams that are hot get on a streak, while reducing team's abilities if they duff around the court. There are also new offensive and defensive plays if you're into the strategy of the sport, but if you just want to jump in and play there's an arcade mode as well.With the NCAA license, only the team names can be used  players are accurately represented as they are in the season (or should be), but only as a number on the jersey and the position they play. Courts are rendered as accurately as possible, emblazoned with the school logo and colors  and that's what gives this game its own flavor. This game drips with school spirit with chants and team fight songs...and if you want college stats, this game's got them in spades. For college alumni and die-hard followers of the NCAA basketball circuit, there's a ~Dynasty Mode~ that will give you the ability to recruit and manage a team through seasons of play. And, of course, there's the familiar bracket during tournament play. And yes, there are 16 women's basketball teams in here, too. What is a basketball fan supposed to do these days? With professional basketball just about to miss an entire season and women's basketball only warming the plate, it's either time to hit the hoops yourself or play some videogame madness. (Our bet is that most of you would choose the latter.) EA's 99 version of March Madness returns with a superb set of gaming aspects bound to impress hoops fans. It's a little faster, is revved up with better frame rates, and has a handful of new modes from which to choose. What I like is that the women's mode from last year's game is in this game. I don't play it, but I like the fact that it's there. (Maybe I'll get my wife to play, heh, what an easy win!) But even better in this version is its all-around sense of fun. Now you've got the arcade mode, practice, the three-point shootout, and EA's Dynasty mode, for long-term players who like to trade and manage their teams, and sleeker, new animation sequences. The animations include cross-overs, lean-ins and other slick looking moves, and EA's added a completely new set of dunks, 10 in all.Last year's iteration was a great piece of work, and only the frame rate needed serious alteration. And with most sports games, the newest version gets a face-lift. While this is true here, the new animations and better sense of motion were truly improved. Balls coming off the hoop move like the real thing, quickly onto the ground, hanging high with accurate gravity, and slipping cleanly through on swishes. EA's powerhouse sports development team orchestrated a great new version of March Madness that all hoops fans are going to enjoy.", "date": "Jan 6, 1999"}
