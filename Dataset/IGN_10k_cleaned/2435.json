For all of you who were looking for the next Final Fantasy Tactics, I'm here to tell you there are some similarities, but once you start playing Atlus and MaxFive's Hoshigami, you'll realize the world you're in is completely different.  The story takes place in a world known as Mardias.  You play Fazz, a young mercenary for hire, who has been destined in the ancient writings that he is to save the world. (Heard it, seen it, did it.)  Along the way he meets different people and forms his rag-tag band of heroes to defeat Fernandes, an evil king bent on ruling all of Mardias.   Gameplay At first glance, Hoshigami really looks like Final Fantasy Tactics (FFT).  Not only does it look like FFT, but the multiple menu system makes Hoshigami feel like Square's strategy game.  But taking a second look makes you realize how different the two games truly are.   Let's start with what I like about the game.  The RAP system (Ready-for-Action-Point) is very good.  It determines how far you can move, how many attacks you can make, the number of items you can use, and how many spells you can cast.  Each action you make takes RAP.  As you choose your action, the RAP meter fills, thus moving farther takes more RAP.  Leveling up your character increases your agility, which in turn decreases how much RAP each action takes.    Coinfeign The spell system in this game is unique and interesting.  Spells require you to purchase and equip Coinfeigns.  Coinfeigns are a spirit's spell sealed into strange coins -- tossing the coin into the air releases the spell.  Hoshigami like most RPG and other fantasy games, has funky names for all of the spells.  Zel is the 1st level wind spell, Blistu is the ice spell, and Cure is... well, cure.  Engraving Coinfeigns at shops in town upgrades the spell.  Shops sell Coinfeigns and seals, which are needed in the engraving process.  You are given the option to engrave one or two seals to your Coinfeign.  The reason you would engrave two seals at once is that sometimes, just sometimes you're a mutation might occur, raising the level of the spell or causing the level of the coin to drop.   Sucks huh?  Different seals cause different attributes to rise and fall on your Coinfeign.  The attributes are range, spell points, casting cost, area effect, damage, RAP cost, and Success Rate.    I also liked the different characters in the game.  I always like it when there are characters to meet and recruit into your party.  To date, Suikoden is one of my favorite RPG's for this reason alone.  Granted, Hoshigami doesn't have 108 characters to collect, but the few that you can get make the game more interesting.  I always find myself hitting reset after talking to some girl, choosing different responses to her questions, then not getting her.  Sure, I wouldn't use her in the battles, but it was cool to get her nonetheless.  ~Come on honey, after the battle we can go back to my place.  Boom-chick-a-wow-wow!~   Deity  Each character in Hoshigami has a Deity that allows him or her to gain different skills.  There are a total of six different Deities: Amu, Ema, Sonova, Zeneth, Gote, and Kashis.  Depending on what Deity you worship, changes in your character abilities occur.  For example, Ema gives you more Coinfeign slots and higher Coinfeign damage and defense, which makes a good mage, and Sonova increases your hit percentage and damage, good fighter material.    Changing a character's Deity requires you to go to the temple in town.  It is here where you gain skills for your character.  Skills such as Counter 10% and DEV  +10%. To gain more skills you must first gain DEV.  DEV is gained in battle when you damage or kill enemy characters.  It is also gained when you successfully cast spells or use items.  Accomplishing these actions grants you EXP, for your character's level, and DEV, for your character's DEV level.  Each time you go up a DEV level, you must return to the temple to unlock and equip your new skill.   The other neat feature was depending on what Deity your enemy is, determines whether the damage you deal increases or not.  Casting spells as Ema onto a Sonova causes the most damage to occur.  SONOVA BEACH! [Editor's note: you're on the street after one more of those, Mark]   Battle  The battle system is both good and bad.  It's good in the sense that it works.  First move your character into position, attack, and choose the direction he will defend.  The problem is that it's not that simple.  Every spell you cast, every move you make, and every breath you take...sorry, asks you to confirm your actions. Now, this isn't that bad the first time through, but the game becomes very tedious very fast.  Let me give you an example:   These are your basic actions for one character during his turn:   Move. Select square where you want to move. Are you sure? Yes. Attack. Select enemy you want to attack. Are you sure? Um. Yes. End. Defend or Standby? Defend. Are you sure? Yes. Stop asking me! Choose direction. Face forward. Are you sure? Yes, you stupid game, 1000 times yes!!  Now, picture to yourself doing that for six more characters, several more rounds, before you beat the level...ugh.  But wait there's more.    Session Mode Combo  Another cool, but weak feature is the session mode combo.  The session mode combo allows you to steal items from enemies.  And I love gaffing items from the enemy, by far it's my favorite skill in any RPG.  But Hoshigami's system is flawed in a big way.  Let me explain.    There are two steps to using the session mode combo.  The first step is to use the shoot attack.  When choosing the attack action, a bar will appear with a moving meter.  Hitting the button at the precise time will cause a critical attack resulting in more damage.  Hitting it at the wrong time can result in you inflicting one point of damage.  If triangle is pressed while in this mode, the small critical attack bar at the end of the meter will change into a long shoot bar located in the middle.  Getting the correct timing will cause your character to push the enemy about two squares away from you.    Now comes the second step of the session mode combo.  This requires one of your other characters to be in session mode.  Instead of choosing defend when you end your turn, select session.  When you shoot your enemy into this character, he in turn will shoot the enemy two squares away from him in the direction he is facing.  Setting up characters in a pattern could chain some mean combos resulting in big damage.    Annoying Things About Hoshigami  So you're thinking to yourself, ~Damn!  Session mode's gonna rock!  Why the hell would I choose defend?~  Well, my ignorant friend, I'll tell you.  If the enemy hits your character while he's in session mode he will take double damage and be knocked out of session mode, thus ruining your great combo that took you 30 minutes to set up.  Another really poor feature is the only character that gets experience is the one who begins the combo, and the only items you can steal are items on that enemy's person.  And you will find the items found on that character are usually the same stinking weapons and armor you already have or items far inferior for your taste.   The enemy will always take your highest level character and match his level when you start the battle.  ALWAYS.  So, it doesn't matter how many hours you spend in the training towers to level up your characters, they will always match you.  I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like the best idea.  You just spent hours to build up your character and all of your hard work is rewarded with your enemies being the same level as you.  The best thing that you can do that I found was to level up all of your characters equally so the playing field is equal.  Now, sometimes there's going to be a boss character.  And most definitely he will always be one level higher than everyone else. Fun!   When your character dies, that's it, he's dead.  No revival, no finish the battle and he's back with one hit point, no going to the temple and paying a butt-load of money to get him back.  There is, however, a place to recruit new generic party members at each town.  The problem is that they all start at level one.  So you can imagine how frustrating it is when you're in the midst of battle and some punk kills your guy, who you've been working on for 20 hours just to get to level 10.  RESET!   So I called up Atlus about the revival situation, mainly because I was sick and tired of being on the same level for 6 days, nothing increasing in level except for the hate I was feeling for Hoshigami.  Atlus informed me that towards the end of the game you will have access to Coinfeigns that revive your characters, but good luck in reaching that point without reviving.  I was never able to find these so called ~Revival Coinfeigns~ and I don't see how you're supposed to reach the end of the game without the ability to revive.  It's a catch-22 if you ask me: you need to reach the end of the game to revive, but you can't get to the end of the game without reviving.   The enemies' AI is crazy good.  The enemy works on the same RAP system you do and that's good because if they didn't you'd swear they're cheating.  We'll start off with the light stuff.  You've been pounding on this enemy fighter and he's one more hit from dying and a mage walks up and heals him.  And the only reason you kept him alive was to give one of your lower characters the experience.  Annoying, but not that bad you say?  Oh, I'm just warming up.    Let's focus in on that Mage while we're at it.  Not only is he healing his buddies, but for some reason he knows who the character is who's weakest against magic.  So on his next turn while you're fighting off his 20 buddies with your 7 guys, that bastard mage zorches your character with the lowest magical defense who just happens to be the strongest fighter.  Sucks, doesn't it? RESET!   Now I'm not done with the enemies with crazy good AI, oh no.  So you continue to play making sure to focus your attack on one guy so he dies, and you keep your best fighter in the rear when coming across Mages, good.  But one thing you hadn't counted on is just around the corner.  Normally when enemies attack you they make sure to leave a little RAP left on the meter so their next turn comes around faster. That usually means the enemy attacks twice at most.  You finish your turn facing the enemy.  It's the enemy's turn now and smacks your character for a third of his hit points, not too bad.  His second attack leaves you with 15 hit points.  Whew, that was close, now he'll just end his turn and you can heal, right?  WHAM!  Your guy is dead!  WHAT?  If the enemy knows he can kill you, it doesn't matter if the RAP meter flows over, that punk is going to shank you!  RESET!   There is no in-battle save.  I know there are a lot of strategy games out there that doesn't have this option, but with all of the things I hate about Hoshigami that I just pointed out, I really think this game needed an in-battle save.  If I had the ability to in-battle save in Hoshigami, I would've had a lot more fun, because as it stands there was no fun to be had in this game.  I would find myself at points in battle where I felt, the enemy just got a lucky hit.  And that lucky hit occurred while I was one and a half hours into the battle.  RESET!   Towns Towns and the world map are pretty much identical to those in FFT.  There's your basic Weapons/Armor Shop, Item Shop, Coinfeign Shop, Recruitment Office, and the Temple.  The one disappointment I had with buying weapons was that in FFT there was an option to buy the best weapons for each of your characters.  In Hoshigami this option is not available.  Also there is no in-shop option to equip the items just purchased.  So I found myself buying new weapons and armor, going back to the world map, and tediously navigate through the many menus just to equip all of the new weapons I had recently acquired.    The Item Shop is as it sounds, an item shop.  You can purchase items to heal, cure, and fix status ailments in battle.  At the Coinfeign Shop you can purchase Coinfeigns, seals, and engrave seals to you Coinfeigns.  The Recruitment Office is where you recruit generic party members.  And the Temple is where you can change your Deity and acquire new skills.   Graphics The graphics are what made me want to play this game.  They're probably what made you want to play this game.  I'd be flipping through magazines, see the ad for Hoshigami, stop and think ~Wow, second coming of Final Fantasy Tactics?  Hell yeah!~  The art in the game is exceptional.  The character designs are beautiful, a sort of Anime/Fantasy style.  So what if the battle sequences are almost identical to Final Fantasy Tactics, the graphics are great.  I love seeing those cute little Super Deformed guys running around smashing each other or jumping around like idiots.  It's so funny.  But I think that's what makes the game great.    Sound  I actually liked the music in Hoshigami.  It plays this quaint pleasant tune that changes depending on if you're at the town, world map, or talking to various people.  However the problem do I have with the music, lies in the battle sequences.  It's pretty good, for about the first minute or so, then it becomes this repetitive noise I was forced to mute.  Now it wouldn't be so bad if battles were quick and you didn't have to listen to this music for that long, but they aren't.  I'd say battles take up about 75-85% of the time played in this game.  Now try to picture fighting that battle and constantly having to RESET because some punk zorched your fighter one hour into the battle.  Now try to picture yourself taking a sledgehammer to Hoshigami.  Feel better?  Good.  Let's continue.    The End (Read on if you wish to know what the ending's like.)  When I finished the game, and yes I did continue to the bitter end, I was met with an ending that was so poor it could only be expected because it was Hoshigami of course.  It basically showed the characters in your party after you ended the war.  The multiple endings that Hoshigami boasts, lies within who, you recruit into your party.  And I'm talking about the characters who have a hand in the story, not the ones you can buy in town. The ending was totally not worth the effort you put into the game.  Just scenes of your friends wondering where you are and going on with their own little lives in their Super Deformed 3D world.  I was hoping for some grand Anime 15 minute long sequences with voices and cool music... but no.  Hoshigami gives no love.", "date": "Jan 23, 2002"}
