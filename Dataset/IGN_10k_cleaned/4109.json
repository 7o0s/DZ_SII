When I first played this game, it was like a sledgehammer came down and smashed everything on screen to bits. Everything from the whiz of smoking arrows to the seemingly infinite particles bursting in air to the furious roar of Tree-ents tearing Saruman's damn down, to the omnipresent score ratcheting the tension of the moment to a higher level. When you finish the first level of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, your ears will ring, your eyes will flash and you'll want more.    Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, EA's second console venture using the license based on the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings, ramps up every aspect -- the gameplay, visuals, and sound -- and drives it home with an impressive punch. The hack-and-slash action game is still very much just that, a twitchy combo-fest derived from arcade sensibilities, but now it's surrounded by a superior level of production quality that cannot be mistaken, it's got co-op, and it's filled with interactive backgrounds and newly playable characters.    Gameplay  EA listened to its critics and delivered what they asked for with Return of the King. If last year's romp gave players the genuinely first respectable Tolkien experience in game form, this year's game cranks the volumedare we say, to 11? Good God. But that IS what's happening here. The newly added features -- from the co-op play to the interactive backgrounds to the addition of more playable characters -- make it happen. And for PS2 gamers, Return of the King is playable online with USB headset support.    Following the formula set forth in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the first two levels of Return of the King are set in the previous movie. To set matters straight (for the fans, of course), players start off playing as the newly whitened wizard Gandalf in last stage of the Battle of Helm's Deep. The invisible tutorial reminds players of the simple move set (Quick and Fierce Attacks, Parry, fire an arrow or flaming pigeon of Umothali (just kidding)), as well as new possibilities, such as climbing ropes, interacting with catapults or hurling spears.

Read Our Head-to-Head Now Watch the Video Review | Get the Guide  From there, the game changes from last year's linear effort into a three-tined pitch fork of doom. Following the three-part narrative of the book, the game offers players the chance to play through the Path of the Wizard (the newly playable Gandalf), The Path of the King (the old trio, Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli), or The Paths of the Hobbits (as Sam, and later as Frodo). Each set of levels is designed differently, with nooks and crannies designed to take advantage of those particular characters -- and, of course, to tell the story as it's portrayed by the movie. Liberties ARE taken with regards to the storyline and, I can now point out, by the movie. I won't spoil anything for you, but to be fair there, there isn't too much revealed in the way of shocking film footage in this game. It's GOOD footage -- and very well edited this year, mind you -- but I'll get back to that later. The point is, the pitch fork does split and each of the 13 levels must be completed to play the final connecting level, from which each of the branches lead.     ROTK is designed so players can take any path and start or stop with any of the characters after each level and, if they so choose, switch to another path. For instance: Start as Gandalf and play through two levels, then switch to Sam and play as three levels. Then maybe play as Aragorn for a level, and switch back to Gandalf. But it appears to me that the game is subtly designed to play from left to right -- i.e. from Gandalf to Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli to the Hobbits. Reason being is that Gandalf is more powerful from the get-go than Sam (who's a surprisingly burly and deep character as later revealed). It's not a bad thing for the designers to want you to secretly play from left to right, but it sure helps to know this beforehand.   Fellowship points add another fold to the Devil My Cry-style character-building process. In The Two Towers, players could only build up their own individual character, but here, players can select to delegate those points to themselves or to the Fellowship. Fellowship points are global, so by buying them, each of the five playable characters gets the newly bought move. It's like paying things forward, and it works.    The menu system and the Skill and Experience meters are more eloquently designed and better explained than before. To gain points and the best grade possible (Fair, Good, Excellent, Perfect), players increase their rate of and quality of attacks, without taking hits from enemies. This is basically done by hacking and slashing, let's be honest, but honed, learned hacking and slashing. For example, you can Quick Attack oncoming enemies without taking a hit to increase your circular meter to full, or you can parry a flurry of arrows to achieve the same status. When full, the reward is Perfect mode, the highest rank, which only lasts for a few seconds, but provides instant kills on enemies and helps score major points.    The characters from the previous game, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn, are familiar in look and feel. Each has the same weapon as before (long knives, axe and sword, respectively), and all have projectile attacks. Gandalf has a staff, sword and magic projectiles, and Sam has Sting, throwing knives and the One Ring. Gandalf is quite nimble for an old wizard while Sam (and later, Frodo) are less powerful, but their characters are amazingly warrior-esque after being built up.    One of the newer bonuses that players can buy is a shield of invincibility, or for Sam and Frodo, invisibility. This power grants a short period of advantage, be it invulnerability or invisibility, to get through a tough situation. On the other hand, some moves aren't so neat. Balrog's Revenge is an excellent move, but it takes perfect timing, which is difficult to master when six Uruk-Hai's, four orcs and two goblins surround your ass, all champing at the bit to slaughter you. But patience and survival skills do reward players with killer later-level moves worth using the second time around.   A handful of moves are harder and more frustrating to pull off in the midst of battle, therefore becoming less useful or downright frustrating. Holding a fierce attack for long periods of time is usually a bad idea, as there is always a swarm of orcs at hand. Likewise, triggering the invincibility move is also far more dangerous to pull off for the same reason. Also, while it makes sense to dole out the cool, longer combos later in the game, the early levels don't give players much to work with at first. The first few levels are basically filled with downright basic, boring attacks. It takes a while for the cool combo depth to kick in.   On the same subject, the level interactivity is both welcome - because it helps to better round out the game -- and in some cases, not very useful. For instance, picking up spears is slow and often results in your injury. While the use of catapults and ballistas is quick and always effective. I quickly found that in the same time I could pick up a spear and target an enemy, I could just as easily strike them asunder.      Level Design and Cameras  The multiple priority level design should be familiar, but the team's attention to extras and to many details show how each level breaks free, if just for a little bit, from its cookie cutter origin. There are defend levels, follow the path levels, and some curiously unique adventure levels (Sam's Escape from Osgiliath comes to mind), but almost all are well done. Each level is created to pull you in several directions at once so that you must constantly be aware of at least two or more enemy threats simultaneously.    Whereas Gandalf's Minas Tirith Top of the Wall level reminds one of Helm's Deep: The Deeping Wall (since players constantly must kick down ladders), newly added features find Gandalf fighting off four huge Siege Towers that pour orcs onto the wall. In the King's Path, the Pelennor Fields is an awesome landscape of never-ending orcs, goblins and Uruk-Hai's. You can attack the Troll guarding the main gate (or boil him with burning fluid later), or fight to build up points. But the main goal is to get to four catapults (surrounded by enemies) to knock down a giant tower, which then creates a path onto the wall.     A majority of the levels are still linear and path-driven in design, but in them there are usually more choices or individualistic gameplay elements at work. For instance, in Gandalf's Road to Isengard, he passes through a splitting trail which leads to a stomping ground of angry Tree-ents. In this battle, the white wizard must stay clear of the circling Ents while tallying up a sum of enemies before a path opens up.  It's SO COOL to see Tree-ents in the game!   Several levels are intelligently and creatively designed, and many are filled with scores of sub-bosses and bosses (the King of the Dead, Gorbag, Shelob and more). For instance, The Black Gate level (the Path of the King) is very difficult but never cheap. The first part of it is a totally enjoyable one-on-one fight to the death with Aragorn and Gorbag, Sauran's chief ~publicist.~ It feels most excellent beating this fraud to a pulp. Shelob's Lair is filled a tangle of paths and dark surprises. And even the final level is different than anything else in the game.    Some levels, however, feel less balanced than others. For instance, I must have played the second level of The Path of the King (King of the Dead) 20-plus times, screaming and kicking all the way. (Bit of a spoiler for newbies to the story here.) In the first part, your character fights the King of the Dead, and the boss fight is relatively easy; beatable in one or maybe two tries. The second section of the level is ridiculously hard, even on Medium difficulty.    Your character must run into the camera while avoiding falling boulders (similar to a Crash Bandicoot boulder level, except no jumping) and then fight a horde of enemies to open up a new section. All of this with a timer. If you succeed, another bigger set of enemies awaits you. If you fail -- and you will, many, many times -- the curtain of falling rocks grinds you into the ground. Go too fast and you're hit by falling rocks. You move too slow, and you're showered by death. If you pull it off just right, you have to contend with several sub-bosses and do so in quick order. By the final set of enemies, you must pull off a perfect set of attacks as fast as possible to avoid being crushed. This level seems far more like a final level than a second level, if I've ever seen it. It's one level I really don't ever want to play again, which is not such a good feeling, considering how positive I feel about the rest of the game. Similarly, the Shelob's boss level will take several attempts and some parts feel a little cheap.    Just like in the first EA game, the ~cinematic~ camera does a good job of showing just exactly what is meant to be shown, but nothing more. Oftentimes, it does so at the player's expense. There are countless examples, but in Gandalf's final level (Courtyard), Aragorn's second level (The King of the Dead), Sam's last level (Citith Ungol) or in even in Shelob's Lair, the camera is either too close, in front of the player, so he's walking into it, or it's too low. EA has made many larger enemies transparent so that players can see through them, and some of the time this takes care of the problem of obstruction. But not all. Many times your character is surrounded by enemies and you cannot even see him -- which ways he is facing, fighting or swinging. In other cases, enemies attack you from off-screen. Or if you move off screen to attack them, you're hammered by an enemy you simply cannot possibly see. The camera is either to low, or it's too close. Most of the time it functions well and you're not aware of it, but in these other situations, I just wished I could see what was happening.     No doubt, EA has done an excellent job at filling the screen with more enemies than last year's version. It's certainly impressive. Of all three versions, however, the PS2 version takes the biggest hit, framerate wise, but it doesn't happen badly enough to ever make one wince.   Just like The Two Towers, Return of the King offers excellent long-term value. You'll probably finish a game with characters leveled up to say seven or level eight. But you'll definitely want to return to buy all of the weapons, and to max out each character at level 10. The game is just addictive that way. The Co-op play adds an immense value to the game's already good replay value. While the framerate gets rough in Co-op mode, and the characters loose detail and become quite small, the play is nonetheless superb (it's not split screen). It's what this game was designed to be. Cameras swing out wide in larger arenas so players can head in different directions, but for the most part the co-op play is well worth its weight in scooties.     Graphics  Visually, Return of the King is a major improvement on every level on all platforms (except the PC, of course, which didn't have The Two Tower in the first place). While the ports on Xbox and Cube had some technical issues last year, this year's versions are clean and crisp, ornate in detail and by all accounts, beautiful.    Beauty, I should stress, comes in various colors. The character models are, right away, notably improved. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, Sam and Frodo are far more detailed than before, showing more ornate-looking clothes, armor and the like, while their respective character models give them all realistic form. The secret characters look decent. In fact, they're easier to recognize by face alone, including Gimli, who has made a spectacular comeback after his hellacious debut (on Two Towers). The character models on the opposing side also continue their winning ways. The horrid messed up evil that is an orc's, goblin's or Uruk-Hai's face is captured beautifully (if you're in to that kind of thing) with more details poured into their eyes, noses and facial forms.   What's more, all of the characters are actually motion-captured, so they move with respectable realism. You can see and feel it while playing. A Uruk-Hai will come running to swing and attack, and you can see a rhythm in its movements. Likewise, little extras have been captured too, such as the limp of the stunt double who played Gimli. He's even a little pigeon toed (and it's noticeable).    The large backgrounds are doubled in size and in details this year, and because the environments are so closely controlled by the camera, there is no pop or fade in. The artwork is just fabulous. Trees show natural curves and wind their way into paths, skies are luminous and the architecture is keenly accurate. Without a doubt, EA's particle and light team have done an exquisite job at capturing all sorts of explosive fun. If it's not flaming arrows leaving trails of smoke behind them, it's Gandalf's blue-burning staff or a Tree-end catching on fire with life-like force. And in the big arena levels, where there are dozens upon dozens of characters on screen. Finally, the high quality look of the flying, exploding bits in every single level are just plain overwhelming. Lastly, for Xbox owners, you can watch it with Progressive Scan.    Sound  Starting up this game is a little like having deja vu. For a split-second when you see the THX symbol appear on screen, there is this weird feeling the videogame you've turned on is actually a movie. It's not, but it's cool. That THX has certified this game almost makes the sound better by that fact alone.    But it's darn hard to miss the game's amazing score, voice work and sound effects even if you don't know what to listen for. The voices of the real actors accompany movie scenes or were re-recorded specifically for this game, so everything sounds authentic to the movies. In fact, Ian McKellen's voice was fully recorded so that he could narrate it.   The only questionable aspect of the voices is the obvious nature of their content. When the trio of characters (Aragorn and friends) walks into the smokey channels of the Paths of the Dead, Legolas says, ~The mists swirl here.~ That's like being in the desert and saying it's hot and sunny. And I wonder when people are going to realize the saying, ~I have a bad feeling about this,~ is 25 years too old? Well, Gimli says it here, in case you hadn't watched Star Wars a million times already.    Other than those little areas (and some areas that needed voice synching, such as in the King of the Dead), the sound effects are just plain overwhelming. The sound is a major reason why this game has such a tremendous affect. The booming sound of explosions, screaming orcs and siege towers, or of hundreds of people fleeing in fright at the sight of an attacking mob of orcs sinks in deep. The score is majestic and flows with force and verve, and Howard Shore's work resonates with perfect pitch. EA did a remarkable job with the sound in every way.    Technically, the GameCube and PS2 versions support Dolby Pro Logic II (which apparently is automatically turned on), the Xbox has Dolby 5.1, while the PC supports Dolby Digital. And for those of you who missed it earlier in the review, the PS2 online portion supports a USB headset. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is, indeed, a modern day Golden Axe, but ratcheted up to massive levels of production. With excellent sound, graphics, and theatrical work bolstering it, Return of the King is a hardcore gamers' game with tremendous mass market appeal. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's just what old school gamers have been yammering about for years. (~Man, remember when we used to play BLANKITY BLANK in the arcades? That was awesome.~)Personally, the online play is a great added bonus, and in itself is a huge and impressive feature, but it's not quite as impressive as a competitive mode would be. It's neat (and I'll be playing more of it), but it's not as deep, or perhaps as long-lasting, as something of a more competitive nature, say, such as Tony Hawk's Underground or SOCOM II. The co-op mode adds an enormous amount of replay value and is sure to put this game under millions of Christmas trees this December.But Return of the King is more than just a good hack and slash. It's one of the best. The feature set is excellent and well worth your money: Six initially playable characters (nine in all), 13 levels, which can be played with all of the characters; good graphics, and an excellent score and superb sound effects. It's got tons of replay value too with secret characters, bonus game concept art, video interviews, and extra games to fiddle around with.", "date": "Nov 4, 2003"}
