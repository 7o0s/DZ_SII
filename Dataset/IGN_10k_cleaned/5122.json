While many thrill to the challenge of outflying enemy aces or skillfully dropping 1,000 pound bombs on an enemy railyard, others prefer the excitement of solo flight where getting the bird into and keeping it in the air are the real challenges. And while I tend to fall into the former category more often than the latter, I still feel a rush simply managing the controls of these planes. While it's not as obviously stimulating as being shot at, it has challenges and rewards all its own. To paraphrase that great 20th century aviator Milhouse van Houten: ~Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the PC sim pilot.~  Sim fans can once again put that statement to a test with Wings of Power, the latest add-on for the leading civilian flight simulator, Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2004. Modeled using what the developer calls ~absolute realism,~ the new game lets players take to the virtual skies in a number of World War 2 era planes, from the ubiquitous B-17 Flying Fortress to the more obscure He162 Salamander.  Absolute realism differs from most flight sim modeling in that it simulates performance across a range of conditions using a variety of criteria. Planes are complex machines that depend on the interaction of several different factors to determine their performance. Things like weight, fuel mixture and even external considerations like air pressure and wind can have a profound effect on how well they fly. A slight change in any of those factors will affect a plane's stall speed, for instance.  One thing that sets Wings of Power apart is that the values and relationships have all been tweaked and balanced using only the aircraft's original training manual and interviews with hands-on pilots. While I've never actually flown a real B-17, the values as they're presented here seem extremely convincing and have been hand-tested across a variety of conditions.   You'll be in charge of managing all of the systems on board and you may find you'll have to adjust your flying technique to match the new realism settings. Takeoffs at least than full power (without WEP) and shallower, slower landings are just two of the changes that full realism requires. Though the game allows you control of nearly every aspect of your airplane, it still adheres to the convenience of a linked turbocharger and throttle lever. For those who don't know, turbochargers on these planes could be set independently to allow a plane's engines to compensate for the thinner air at higher altitudes by compressing air as it's forced into the engine. This gives you better performance at higher altitudes.   The manual walks you through all of these features very well, even going so far as to reproduce pages from the original flight manuals. You can get a view of the fuel consumption rates relative to altitude or the load factors for various angles of bank. A small section introduces the concepts behind the C-1 and Sperry autopilot systems.  The list of planes is impressive. Not only will you get to fly the amazingly sexy B-17 (in both F and G models no less); you'll also have the chance to take to the skies in the massive B-29a Super Fortress and three versions of the B-24 Liberator, including the Navy model, the PB4Y-2 Privateer. The British are represented with the Lancaster B Mk III medium-level bomber. The Germans have three planes in the game, all jets. The He162 Salamander and the FW Ta183 Huckebein are supplemented by the addition of the War's only operational jet bomber, the Arado AR 234 B Blitz. All these planes are available in a single folder within the MSFS 2004 menus making selection a breeze.  The planes look phenomenal inside and out. Though it takes a second for the textures to be drawn in, the exterior views are highly detailed even at extremely close ranges. Individual rivets, uniforms on the men in the gunner positions, nose art -- all these touches make the planes seem remarkably lifelike. Effects like jet engine contrails and clouds of dust as you rumble down the runway add to the realism of it all.      Cockpits are also fantastic in both 2D and 3D versions. You can pan your view around the entire cockpit and get a good long look at each of the controls and dials present in your plane. Even if you zoom all the way in and get real close to the instrument panel, you'll still see plenty of crisp details.  Sadly, there's still no model for your co-pilots. He's clearly visible in the exterior views but, once you look right from inside the plane, he's not there at all. And though control surfaces move, there are no hands or feet present when you look down in your cockpit. It's strange that the manual states that the game now has explosions for ground collisions but none seem to be present in the game. Similarly there's no model deformation for overstress crashes.  The sounds in the game are fantastic as well, even if they are just limited to variations on the roar of your engines. You can get a real sense of your speed just by listening to the changes in your engine. The sound even differs depending on whether you're in the cockpit or viewing the plane from outside.  As I said before, the absence of bullets or bombs means that you have to find your own ~fun~ in this title. For some, the fun is merely taking to the skies in these beauties and seeing how they handle. Others get their kicks from a slavish adherence to the procedures of flight, from managing communications to moving planes from airfield to airfield. I myself have slightly more eccentric goals in mind. Trying to manage a successful belly landing in a fully-loaded B-29 is a hell of a goal to achieve. So too is trying to fly a B-17 at full power underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.   I had hoped that the variety of missions included with Wings of Power would at least offer some inventive challenges. The few test flights for the planes are an interesting novelty but beyond those, you're pretty much limited to straight repositioning flights, moving planes from airfield to airfield. There are a handful of historic missions you can fly here but, without the pressure of enemy interceptors, flak or even an ordinance drop, they play like uneventful air patrols. Like the series that it's based on, this game was designed with a very particular audience in mind. The good news is that that audience will absolutely love the attention to detail and the phenomenal level of accuracy in the plane and flight modeling. Fans of more action-oriented sims will appreciate the work that's gone into the title, even if they're left scratching their heads wondering why the trigger on their joystick is mapped to ~brake~ rather than ~fire.~For me, part of what makes planes like the B-17 so intriguing is the combat environment they served in and it's sometimes hard to form an image of the B-17 that doesn't include anti-aircraft blossoms and Messerschmitts tearing through the clouds. Stripped of these external associations, Wings of Power seemed a little sterile to me at first, but it's given me more appreciation for the planes themselves. Eventually I'd like to see this work put in a more historical, combat-oriented context (like Shockwave's excellent Firepower) but, until then, Wings of Power will continue to remind me that the act of flying is, by itself, one of the most exciting experiences around.", "date": "Oct 13, 2004"}
