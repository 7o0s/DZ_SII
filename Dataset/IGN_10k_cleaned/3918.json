This isn't the first game of its sort we've seen on this side of the pond. After all, there was an offering on the Genesis in the 90's and EA Sports Rugby in 2001. But Rugby 2004, with fast-paced action, tons of licensed teams and players, lots of different tournaments modes, and the momentum of the World Cup behind it, is the best rugby game we've seen yet.   Although not the most visually impressive EA Sports title, and lacking a few features we'd like to see, Rugby 2004 is a game that fans of Madden and FIFA can pick up and enjoy, even if it takes a couple of sessions to fully grasp.   Gameplay  Rugby 2004 is fun. It's fun if you're a newbie, and fun after you know a little bit about the sport. Although I played a bit of both of EA's other rugby efforts, I didn't understand the sport at all outside of the video games. But since then, I've managed to see quite a few matches through the beauty of cable television, and now have a greater appreciation for the ins and outs of the sport. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a naive Yank... but I have that little bit of knowledge that makes me dangerous. I bring this up because I played the game both before I watched the matches and after, and I like it on both sides of the equation. Rugby as a sport seems hard to translate to a video game, but EA has done a good job of capturing the overall flavor.     The last rugby game that came out in the US focused mainly on the less exciting elements of rugby. There was lots of scrumming, rucking and so forth, and a lot less open-field play. To match what's going on in the sport these days--namely lots of motion and lots of tackling--the engine has been transformed. Now the emphasis is on movement. There are a lot more big runs, big hits and big plays in general, and that makes for a more exciting video game.   Since the sport of rugby involves so many players, and so much chaotic activity, it's difficult to get the mehcanics of pack play down. But EA has done a great job of simulating play around the ball, especially on offense. Players pile on, fight for leverage and the ball, and generally do all the things rugby athletes are supposed to. The interface for getting the ball out is simple to manage, although many times it seems like turnovers are completely random. This may be more a function of the sport than the video game... after all, what kind of wacky contest makes a team kick off after they've been scored on?    Flow of play is decent, although it can bog down when the opposition gets in a phase, and is trying to get the ball out. It would be nice to see a little quicker decision-making on the part of the defensive AI, simply to keep the game flowing. It would also be good if phase play were a tad more realistic: players picking the ball out of the heap and driving straight ahead, rather than swinging the ball out as much as they do. All of the other standard rugby controls work well. Pitching the ball down the line is probably the most fulfilling thing you can do, outside of kicking a thundering drop goal.   For the most part, the basics are easy to learn, even though the rules of the game might be foreign. It's the other stuff that should be addressed: the lineouts, penalties, scrum play and set pieces. We were hoping for a decent training mode this time around, in order to learn more about not only how the video game works, but how the sport works, too. But the game is a bit of a let-down in the training department. For instance, a lineout is explained, but the reason behind it is not. Not only that, but once the training for the lineout begins, it is only half explained. The instructor tells you how to throw, but not how to catch. The same is true of the scrum instructions. The game explains the controls, but does not do a good job of telling you when you're doing something right. These half-measures are frustrating, and may leave you feeling less prepared for the game after training than before it.   With all of the complex set plays and runs in this game, a detailed training mode is completely necessary, especially when you're shipping in a country that has almost no exposure to the sport. This game makes it difficult to learn everything one wants to about rugby. One might argue that it isn't a video game's place to educate about a sport, but I learned nearly everything I wanted to about the basics of hockey from NHL on the Genesis. If anything, a game like this needs to look at itself as ambassador of good will, bringing interested parties to the sport rather than befuddling them further when they arrive. Maybe I'm being over-dramatic with the previous statement, but at the very least Rugby 2004 should take a page out of Madden or ESPN NFL's book and provide a solid understanding of the sport's basics. With a little more fleshing out, this game could reach a much, much broader audience than it does.    Other smaller things are equally frustrating. For instance, there is no place within the game to get a rundown of the controls. This should easily be in the pause menu... but we couldn't find an explanation anywhere. In a game like this, where the sport is foreign, this is a big no-no. If I can't use the training effectively, and can't learn on my own when playing, then there is a serious deficiency.   EA Sports has set the bar high in the feature department; so high, in fact, that it seems detrimental when a game ships without EA Sports Bio, online play and other like features. Currently, playing Rugby 2004 is like going to Thanksgiving dinner and being given a plateful of delicious turkey... but only a plateful of delicious turkey. What I'm saying is that we all want cranberries, mashed potatoes, gravy, dinner rolls and Jell-O, too.   Well, maybe there is some gravy. After all, the game does keep some impressive user stats, and there is a challenge feature that allows you to mark progress in the game by completing specific goals. There's even a trophy room where you can display your hard-earned championship loot. Touches like this help reel in some of the problems, and make the game all that much more enjoyable.   Graphics  While Rugby 2004 is a graphical improvement over the previous game on the PS2, it doesn't come close to the visual bravado of its other EA counterparts. Where EA Sports Rugby looked decidedly first generation, this offering is a little better, but still not up to par.   The player models still kind of polygonal, and honestly, a little odd. The heads are too big and the legs too short, for starters. What's more, all of the models look very similar. It's nice to see that variations in equipment (headgear, etc.) have been made, but more size and body shape differentiation would be nice.   Face textures could use some help as well. While there are a few players that are vaguely recognizable (from the limited number of players that make frequent appearances on US TV--namely the All Blacks), too many others seem to be cookie cutter replicants.   On the animation side of things, there is some nice tackling, and scrums look decent, but there are some very twitchy, glitchy elements at play here. The running animation is too herky-jerky, and often you'll see several players running with exactly the same motion, which is somewhat jarring when you're used to seeing games like Madden, where so much different movement is going on at once. In addition, if players get hung up on one another en route to another destination, they will often twitch and ~bug out,~ creating a rather strange and utterly unrealistic visual effect.   Luckily, there are lots of camera choices. The default setting is a side view, which is what you'll see if you watch a rugby match on TV. This gives a good view of the dynamic play as the ball is heaved down the line, and is definitely the better view to see close-up line play. Big-time Madden fans will want to switch to the Classic camera, which takes a behind-the-line approach to the action. This is the camera we prefer, as it allows you to judge depth and distance, and is crucial when lining up drop goals.   Still, both modes need sliders to be able to adjust how close the camera is to the onfield action. While it's nice to see the entire spread of the field, sometimes it might be nice to get close to the line and see the action in the trenches.   Sound  There isn't a whole lot to say about the sound. The commentary is fairly unobtrusive, although it does get a bit repetitive after awhile. There's also the old problem of uneven speaking tones when team and player names are inserted into phrases. Still, it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game. The crowds sound decent, as do the sounds of the game. The menu music is also decent, but unremarkable.You'll have fun with this game, despite its shortcomings. Sure, the graphics aren't top-notch, and there are some missing elements, but the bottom line is that fans of rugby will look past the little things and rejoice that the game provides an exciting and mostly realistic representation of the sport. Other curious parties might want to explore it as well, at least with a rental. If you choose to invest a little time learning the sport, and then pick this up, it will definitely hold your interest. It's the perfect game to toss in right after you get done watching some Fox Sports World, or come back to the dorm after a college match.", "date": "Sep 18, 2003"}
