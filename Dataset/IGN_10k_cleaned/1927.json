{"name": "Tropico", "name_review": "Tropico", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/04/tropico", "text": "There's a certain crowd of gamers that just live for city management games such as SimCity, Pharaoh and the like. They like the resource management, they like the economics and they like the city planning, but what about the politics? Up until now, there have been very few games that took a deep look at the challenges of dealing with people that often want very different things. Now, PopTop Software and Gathering of Developers have released a little game called Tropico that should give gamers a chance to test their ability to juggle a ton of different political agendas at once while keeping money in the treasury and fulfilling the peoples' general needs. You see, Tropico takes you on a ride where you get to set yourself in the position of the new leader of a small island nation in the 50's. This game isn't just about how well you can build your city up, but whether or not you can manage to survive the political tension and stay in office for the entirety of the game.  And that proposition isn't the easiest thing in the world. Tropico is a challenging game that will really have you thinking about how to approach problems you have with your budding island nation. I can tell you right now that declaring martial law and fixing all of the elections is not a good way to go about things. Pretty much every faction on your island will take exception to that and there are a lot of factions you'll have to keep appeased. But don't worry, there are a lot of different ways to deal with those threats.  There are two different game types that should provide plenty of entertainment even with the lack of a scenario editor. The first of these are the pre-made scenarios that will challenge you to deliver on specific goals such as creating 2,000,000 in revenue from cigars in fifty years. They range in difficulty even though I noticed that the lowest difficulty rating on the scenarios was ~moderate~ and the highest was ~ridiculous.~ These are fairly interesting scenarios that will definitely cause you to move in certain directions, especially since your dictator stats are pre-made as well even though some scripted events might have made things a little more interesting. The second style of game is the random map mode, which should provide plenty of hours of entertainment. In this option you can choose the size of your island, population, vegetation and mineral density, water coverage, economic toughness, and so on. All of these change the little difficulty rating at the bottom of the screen so you can see before hand what kind of challenge you'll be getting into. You can also choose what objective you can go after here, which basically means that the game will score you in different areas. Objectives include having a really strong economy, making people as happy as possible and putting as much money in your Swiss bank account as you can.  Once you've decided what you want to play, you'll jump into the dictator creation screen, which is just really great. You'll have to choose how you were placed in power, what your personal background was, your positive attributes and your flaws. All of these will have an effect on what your subjects think of you. This will allow you to have very different games, as you'll need to appease different people and come up with different solutions.  Tropico starts out like almost every other city building game you can think of. You start with some money and a few basic necessary buildings. In the case of Tropico you'll get things such as your palace, a construction yard, a teamsters office, a couple of farms, and a small beginning population. From here you'll quickly need to build some housing for your people so the communists don't yell at you, a church so the religious faction won't yell at you, a school so the intellectuals don't yell at you, hire some soldiers so the militarists don't yell at you, start private enterprises so the capitalists don't yell at you, and try not to cut down to many trees and pollute the air too much so the environmentalists don't yell at you. And even when you do all of that, some of them are still likely to yell at you just for the sake of yelling. But that's the way that life works, the more you give people, the more likely they are to complain about things not being better.   And that is exactly where Tropico's strength really lies. Once you've been in the game for a couple of game years, and you've got a little infrastructure up and running, you'll start having to pay a lot more attention to the political side of things which will quickly start determining what you build first. You may be a dictator on the island, but if you look through recent history, there are very few dictators that manage to last a long time in the business, Castro being a notable exception. To keep the people pleased, you'll first need to worry about the various factions and what they're thinking. To this extent, there is a rather extensive almanac that will give you a ton of information on the various factions, what the people are unhappy about, what exports make the most money, what age groups there are, etc... Besides having faction loyalties, citizens also have their own agendas like needing food, medical attention, and entertainment. At anytime, you can click on any citizen of your island and get detailed info on where he or she works, who's in their family, how old they are, what they are happy and unhappy about and plenty more.  Of course, you don't have to keep everyone happy and be the nice little leader that everyone with a utopian dream thinks should be in power. It's totally up to you how you run your island which really gave me a sense of freedom, because you really can be successful using different styles, some are just way harder than others. You can even run it with military might, and though some may not like it, they'll be a lot less likely to oppose you if there's a well paid and loyal military backing your decisions. There are trade offs in everything however and you'll find that your citizens don't work as well under military rule. Anyway you decide to rule your island, there are a few things you'll always need to worry about.  The biggest of these concerns is keeping money flowing into your treasury. If you don't have money, you can't build things and more importantly you can't pay your military. They don't really like that too much. But there are quite a few ways to keep the money flowing into your coffers. These options largely depend on the layout of your island and what kinds of natural resources are available to you. There are, of course, crops such as sugar, tobacco and coffee as well as mines, which will be your initial sources of income. But soon, you'll need to dig into areas that will really let you swim around in Scrooge's money bin. To do this, you'll need to spend some time building up some capitalist ventures such as tourism or industry, which is the cash cow of the game. Start selling cigars from the tobacco you grew, or canned coffee, or jewelry, and you'll eventually be swimming in money. That, of course, is when you start skimming off the top. You do plan on retiring one day don't you? So just build a bank and set it to move little bits of money to your Swiss account and you'll be set for life.  You can embezzle money through the use of an edict. These are basically presidential proclamations that range from trade agreements to declaring martial law. Some are there to be broad reaching while others are very situation driven. For example, if you are up for election and find out that you are losing, you could throw your opponent in jail, lower taxes at a big expense to your treasury, or maybe even throw a Mardi Gras to get people's spirits up and keep them enamored with you.   As with every game, there are flaws however. Such as factions not noticing that you're in the middle of building something they're asking for. I would have liked it if there was a trade off where factions were a bit mollified when they see you're building what they want. You have already spent the money after all. Your ability to set up an organized town is a bit strained as well. The elevation problem means that your workers could have a hell of a time building a structure, as they have to level the area first. It took me 30 years to build an airport on one of my islands, which is more than a pain in the ass than its worth. And I couldn't find a way to rotate buildings except for a few key buildings that had to have different orientations because they were on the beach. Some slowdown did occur as well when the islands started teeming with people.  All of these things add up to a really in depth and entertaining experience that anyone with an iota of interest in city building games should really enjoy. There is a ton of personality and humor in the game to go along with the great political simulation that hasn't really been done to this extent before. It may not be a perfect game, but it's certainly worth the money if you're a sim strategy buff. I had a whole lot of fun and hope to have more in my spare time.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
