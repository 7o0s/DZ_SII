Los Angeles has been jolted by a major earthquake, leaving the city in shambles.  Crime runs rampant in the aftermath and the streets are swarming with mutants, street gangs, and waked-out drug lords.  Hmmm ... sounds kinda like LA in 1998 doesn't it?   In response to the felonious frenzy, the LAPD develops the ultimate crime-fighting mechanized unit: the X-1 Alpha.  One part hovercar and one part ED-209 from RoboCop, the X-1 Alpha has enough firepower to take down entire city blocks.  Included in the X-1's arsenal are such futuristic goodies as the gattling laser, hyper velocity rockets, and a shockwave generator.  As mentioned earlier, the X-1 can transform from a robotic walker into a hovercar, which can travel faster than the mechanized weapons platform and can also maneuver over water.   Future Cop features two types of gameplay.  There's a single player mode where you are given certain objectives to complete within a few zones in LA, like Zuma Beach, the La Brea Tar Pits, and Griffith Park.  These missions generally involve taking out a number of turrets, tanks, and infantry with your ultimate goal being to neutralize a crimelord (read: blow into tiny bits).  You'll be guided through each level by your partner ... who just happens to be conveniently located back at HQ out of harm's way.  She'll tell you when the air units are overhead, she'll let you know when the gates that block the enemy tanks are opening, she'll give you a shout out when the odds are against you ... all you have to do is blow the crap out of everything on the screen.  Multiple camera angles allow you to control the action from a variety of different views.  It's handy to keep zoomed out when battling multiple flying targets, but when you're surrounded by infantry the close-up view gives you the perfect angle to turn hoodlums into a bloody pulp.  With only eight single player missions, you might think that Future Cop would be over fairly quickly.  However, the levels themselves are huge and as you get further in the game the difficulty level increases at an exponential rate.  It will take a while to finish the single player game and, even after you have finished it, the multiplay base defense mode should keep you busy for quite a while.  OK ... the constant carnage does get a little repetitive, but the missions are actually well designed and I never got bored with the game, even after having to play some of the missions over because I didn't complete them the first time around.  Future Cop also includes a multiplayer mode where you'll defend your base against a rival Sky Captain.  The more enemy troops and cannons you destroy, the more points you get.  The more points you get, the more tanks and planes you can build.  Get it?  Good!  It's a lot like Herzog Zwei (anybody out there remember that old Genesis game?) and it's hella fun against a human opponent.  Overall, Future Cop is a simple yet entertaining game.  Sure, it's nothing but a console shooter, but it's the little touches in Future Cop that really make it interesting and even humorous at times (if you do get the game be sure to check out the credits ... the X-1 Alpha busts a pretty good Cabbage Patch).  The screams, the explosions, the lighting effects, and the smoke trails from the weapons all intertwine to bring what would otherwise be a fairly mediocre game into the realms of originality and pure, unadulterated fun.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Dec 15, 1998"}
