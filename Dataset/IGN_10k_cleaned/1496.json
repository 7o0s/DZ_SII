The game was easily one of the worst designed fighters ever made, and it could be completed simply by tapping one button. After experiencing this game, we've been afraid for the second X-Men game from the company, X-Men Mutant Wars. And after playing the game for an hour (since that's how long it takes to complete the game), we're disappointed but certainly not wowed by bad quality  the game's got some clunky issues throughout its design, and despite being a quick hour fix, there's a tiny bit of challenge to keep players occupied after the game's over. Features  Two modes of play  Five X-Men characters to control Password save Only for Game Boy Color    Where Mutant Academy filled the one-on-one fighting genre (like Street Fighter Alpha), Mutant Wars is a side-scrolling beat-em-up along the lines of the classic Final Fight or, dare we say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer in comparison to other Game Boy Color games. These beat-em-ups have always been a mindless design, and Mutant Wars definitely doesn't really offer anything new, and has a serious ~acceptance~ curve early on  the controls lean on the clunky side, but give it a few thwacks around the mutant-filled streets and it'll get a bit easier.  In the game, you control an arsenal of X-Men  Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Gambit, and Cyclops. You start with Wolverine, but you can freely switch between any of these characters by holding the select button down and pushing in one of four directions on the D-pad  this is an element that's somewhat important, since you have to keep an eye on your mutant powers. See, each mutant is limited in their attacks, and they're all based on their mutant abilities  stupidly, most of these characters don't have any basic attacks like kicks and punches, so you have to take what the characters offer. Wolverine's the real star of the show, since he's the only character with a ton of secret moves. Cyclops must shoot enemies with his eyebeams, and Storm has to take out bad guys with tornado projectile. Problem is, with each attack you deplete your mutant powers, and once they're gone you won't be able to attack regularly  that's where switching out characters comes in, since idle X-Men rest and regain their powers back. If a hero loses his hitpoints, he jumps out until the level's complete or you lose the round  and once you lose all X-men, the game's over.  In explanation, the game's got a lot to offer. In practice, though, the game lacks.  The game really is mindless, since you honestly don't have to sit around beating up the onslaught of enemy characters  double tapping the controller in a direction makes the character run, and you can theoretically jump over most bad guys. There are only a couple reasons why you want to kill off a few  if you find yourself trapped, or if you need to replenish your health (since most enemies offer heart icons after they bite the big one). To ease up on the mindlessness, the designers threw in an exploration element  you can't complete a level without finding a ~hidden~ key.  The only real challenge is in the game's boss levels  at the end of each round, you're faced with an enemy mutant (or a machine gone berzerk) to defeat. These are the only characters that require any true technique to defeat, and you'll find yourself dying more from the boss battles than from the actual game's levels.   The game's over in literally an hour thanks to the infinite continues through the use of the password system. While this definitely tarnishes the game, the developers offer a pretty cool Battle mode where you have to get as far into the boss battles as possible with the original five X-men  you don't get back lost X-men in this mode, so this is the game's true challenge.  X-Men Mutant Wars is a notch above X-Men Mutant Academy, but it's still a ~bleah~ game  it's not bad... it's just not a decent Game Boy Color title. The graphics are colorful with large sprites and a variety of enemy characters to fight... but in terms of gameplay elements, this title lacks. The Battle mode adds a bit more replay value to the normal game, but it's not nearly enough to justify a purchase recommendation.", "date": "Nov 17, 2000"}
