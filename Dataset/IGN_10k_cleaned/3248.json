It has a long history of developing impressive simulations for the PC including F/A-18 Super Hornet and Apache. It nearly brought F/A-18 Super Hornet to the Nintendo 64, but the project was cancelled for unknown reasons. So then, Top Gun is its first work on home consoles, and Digital Integration has swayed from its simulation roots to create a more fast-paced, accessible flight game. Sadly, whatever vision it had for Top Gun: Combat Zones has been lost in a blur of dull simulation and lackluster combat. It doesn't even have a two-player mode to fall back on. Is Top Gun: Combat Zones even worth looking into then? Yes, because it is currently the only flight simulator on GameCube.  The Facts Fly through over 36 different missions Experience three distinct time periods Battle in the skies above South East Asia, Gulf States, Arctic Circle, and Miramar Base, each varied with cityscapes, seaside views, and deserts Varied atmospheric conditions alter lighting and weather Replay mode lets you watch your entire missions after completed Quickstart mode lets you customize level, combat type, and difficulty No progressive scan support   Gameplay Top Gun: Combat Zones really only offers up two ways to play: Quickstart and Game modes. Quickstart is just a way to jump into Combat Zones without the hassle of training or mission briefings. Just select it, choose your aircraft (you must unlock most), choose the terrain, difficulty, and combat type and get started. It's a true blessing that this options is included, because the Game mode, which is a career-based story mode, requires a lot just to get started. It takes you through the ropes, teaching you to maneuver your plane, target enemies, manage your weapons, air-to-air combat, and air-to-ground combat. You absolutely have to pass each training sessions, and it's all very tedious. It's simply not entertaining, and stands as a very poor beginning to the real gameplay. Once you do start diving into missions, and there are about 36 of them, you will be presented with more engaging challenges. You begin with basic dogfighting, but you'll work your way up through having to manage air and ground combat in confined spaces.   The problem is not the mission structure, though. It's the core control mechanics that hinder the experience. Top Gun: Combat Zones is just boring. There is no ~heat of the moment~ or intensity. It seems to be an improper balance between flight simulation controls versus those that are more loose and arcadey. Digital Integration sets the controls to default to ~simple,~ which makes flying easy, but the ~expert~ controls available don't change the pace of the game at all. Basically you can use both analog sticks to fly, where the C-stick acts as the rudder, but it doesn't really make it more entertaining. Combat is further complicated by the fact that the radar system is completely unintuitive and, well, totally useless. You can see where targets are around you -- there is even a bar on the bottom of the screen that tells you if they are in your direct line, but there's no indication that lets you know how high or low the target is. This all adds up for an experience that just isn't worth trudging through. It's frustrating and regardless of how many targets there are to hit or missiles there are to explode, the action is lackluster.      Top Gun: Combat Zones presents the player with very little reason to drive forward. The mission briefings are boring and with the initial combat controls so poor, what does it matter how many planes you unlock if you won't want to fly them? Lastly, the question must be asked: what does Combat Zones have to do with the movie Top Gun? As far as we can tell, absolutely nothing. There is no Iceman, no Goose, and no carrier flybys. Could the title be any more misleading? Paramount should have been a little more specific about the use of the license, it probably would have made for a better game.  In short, Top Gun: Combat Zones is not worth your time. Putting aside the fact that it's not remotely related to the fine 80s flick, the flight combat has ingredients to be entertaining, but the final result is anything but that. It's just plain boring.   Graphics The back of the box will have you believe that Top Gun: Combat Zones features ~astounding~ and ~very detailed graphics, especially in low flying combat.~ Let us assure you that's just as misleading as the use of the Top Gun name. The visuals, especially at low level, are blurry and outdated. The most advanced portion of the engine is probably the particle effects, where exploding aircraft rains to the ground below and cloud cover feels thick.   No progressive scan support.  Sound Last we checked, flight combat is very loud; the hiss of the jet engine, the booming of rocket impacts, and echoes from approaching enemies should all add up for a great aural experience. In Combat Zones, it doesn't. What's there suffices, but it's very weak. Don't even think about asking about surround sound. Furthermore, apparently Titus only managed to get the Top Gun logo and none of the assets that go along with it. There are cheesy guitar ballads mixed with some more modern techno beats for most of the missions. There is a mere hint of the high-pitched Top Gun theme at the main menu, but it's really nowhere close to the real deal. Forget about flying into the Danger Zone. There is none.Plain and simple, Top Gun: Combat Zones is just not fun to play. No matter what age you are, there's little chance for enjoyment. It's not that the developer had bad ideas. It's just that none of them came together for a cohesive design.Plus, I'm not so sure Titus bought the right Top Gun license. The one I know of has you attending flight classes, getting into fights, pulling pranks on your instructors, hanging out in bars, riding a motorcycle, and landing on aircraft carriers...frequently. Top Gun: Combat Zones had none of this. And it's really a shame, because I think in the right hands Top Gun could make an incredible game. Unfortunately, this is not it.Not recommended.", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
