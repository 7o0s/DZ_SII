It pretty much works for every game review. Here, let's try it out:Fans of the Duke Nukem franchise will enjoy Zero Hour -- but everyone else might want to think twice before buying the game.Not bad.How about this:Fans of the Ultraman franchise will enjoy PD Ultraman Battle Collection 64 -- but everyone else might want to think twice before buying the game.D'oh. It doesn't work. I don't care how big an Ultraman fan you are, Ultraman Battle Collection 64 is so ridiculously bad, I wouldn't recommend it to ~fans of the genre~, ~fans of the franchise~, or even ~fans of wacky Japanese games that cost a lot of money but don't offer any gameplay fun~. Ultraman Battle Collection is a bad game, even by Bandai's standards (and Bandai has published some pretty amazing stinkers for SNES in the old days).I'm not going to waste too much of your time here, so let's keep this review shot and sweet. Ultraman Battle Collection is sort of a mixture between a strategy RPG and a Pokmon Stadium-style battle game. Indeed, the game's coolest feature is its use of the Transfer Pak (64GB Pak). Plug any Game Boy cartridge into the Transfer Pak and PD Ultraman Battle will use the data to generate a character for you. Awesome idea! Too bad this feature is put to use in a game marred by bad play mechanics, horrendous graphics and terrible sound.At the core of Ultraman Battle Collection, you will find a simple turn-based RPG that has you exploring a world map filled with all kinds of buildings. Instead of moving your Ultraman character around yourself, you simply pick your destination from a barely legible menu. Selections include a gym where you can train your character, a clinic to heal your HP, a Colosseum for battling opponents, caves and mountains to explore, and even a Museum where you can view your complete character collection. Once you have selected where you want to go, your character will start to move. Most players will already watch in horror as your badly animated Ultraman slowly walks across the blurry landscape... and walks... hmmm, is there any way to speed this up? ...and walks... Oops, the phones ringing. Let me pause this game. Huh? The Start button doesn't do anything either? ... and walks... C'mon, I gotta have some control here! ...and walks... Oh, look, the sun's setting. ...and walks... Why is nothing happening? ...and walks... There. He finally stopped. I see, it's night now. He has to rest. Hmmm, I wonder what happens when the sun goes up again. ...and walks... Noooo! ...and walks... How can they make a game where you have to sit through animation routines that are both tedious and terrible looking? ...and walks...To be fair, once in a while you are attacked by an enemy creature. Ultraman fans will get a kick out of the super-deformed renditions of their favorite rubber monsters -- unless you have a problem with how the creature's limbs cause all kinds of clipping and flickering when they move... The battles themselves are turn-based, much like the ones in Pokmon Stadium. Each combatant has a status bar that slowly fills up (you can speed up the process by rapidly tapping your buttons) as the camera rotates around the characters to display the whole blurry mess in all its choppy goodness. Once the bar is full, you can select an attack, an item or a special move from your battle menu. Win a battle and you gain experience points, which eventually causes you to gain a level and learn new moves, and so on. It's all standard RPG fare, only that everything moves at a maddeningly slow pace.When you're not inside buildings or engaged in battle, you can also give your character alternate tehings to do. For example, you can have your Ultraman search for items or ~play~ (the latter increases your characters' friendship gauge, but brings down your stamina). Searching for items is similar to moving around. As soon as you make your selection, the game takes over and forces you to watch in horror as your badly animated Ultraman walks around the hills for minutes, bending down to look at the ground every couple of steps. This is supposed to be fun?Bandai has a lot of experience creating innovative toys like Tamagotchi, but the company really needs a lesson on what constitutes fun gameplay. While Tamagotchi made its owners wait around a lot, it had the advantage of being portable. Sitting in front of your TV waiting for Ultraman to find a ~life pack~ is not fun. By adding terrible graphics, a horrible interface and repetitive sound, Bandai has created a monster that should never find its way into the home of any import gamer.I love the Monster Rancher-inspired idea of creating my own creatures by using a Game Boy cartridge. I just hope that another developer will use this idea in a game that's actually worth playing. Ultraman Battle Collection is a worthless mess that fits right on the shelf with the other sub-par Ultraman titles Japanese gamers had to put up with over the past years. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this turd. Import store owners -- please don't stock this game.", "date": "Mar 28, 2000"}
