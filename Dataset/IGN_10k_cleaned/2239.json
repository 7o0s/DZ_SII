{"name": "Ghost Recon", "name_review": "Ghost Recon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/10/ghost-recon-4", "text": "Ghost Recon is easily as impressive today as Rainbow Six was three years ago. And knowing how much we love Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear, that's saying a lot. Tom Clancy's franchise of highly realistic action games put a great spin on the classic shooter model. No longer were missions just a matter of staying one health point above your competition. The Rainbow series of games adhered pretty clearly to the ~one shot, one kill~ philosophy. By emphasizing episodic mission objectives and not allowing any saves, it created an amazing tension that can't be equaled by the likes of Quake or Unreal (for the record, I am fans of those games too -- let's skip the part where you send me hate mail, okay?). And now Ghost Recon has taken the model of Rainbow and placed it in a special forces, military-style game.  The story is plausible and intriguing (and already covered in our preview) but as far as I'm concerned, it's merely the excuse for the game. I didn't necessarily find myself following the story from mission to mission. Within the missions it's important to know what's going on but for all the effort that obviously went into the story, the game itself is completely enjoyable as a series of single episodes. The mission briefings are a welcome change from the Rainbow model. Instead of reading through seven separate dossiers and reports, all the information you need is presented in a simple text box. A handy map showcases key points (but strangely doesn't seemed synched with the voiceover).  Once you've got a handle on the objectives you'll proceed to the platoon selection screen. Here you'll pick six characters and assign them to one of three teams. There are four main classes: riflemen for shooting people, snipers for shooting people, support guys for shooting people and demo guys for blowing things up (and people). If you complete a mission's extra objectives you can be rewarded with specialists that possess higher than normal abilities (easier people killing). But you can improve the abilities of your own basic soldiers by spending combat points earned in each mission. You can increase each soldier in one of four performance areas: marksmanship, stealth, endurance and leadership.  From there you'll go into battle through 15 missions in the single player campaign (and all without the notoriously unwieldy planning interface from the Rainbow games -- more on this later). There's a pretty good range of objectives here (although let's be honest -- it's all about killing the other guys, right?). You'll have to investigate a crashed helicopter in crowded city streets. You'll have to blow up a bridge in an enemy occupied valley. You'll have to protect a column of tanks as they rumble through bombed out city streets. You'll have to raid rebel bases deep in the forests and fend off similar assaults on your own positions.  But exciting as the mission design is, the one thing Ghost Recon scores biggest on is atmosphere. Imagine standing waist deep in a swamp with trees and grass all around. Realistic rain falls all around you. As you move through the water, a small island appears out of the fog, as you move closer you notice some shadowy figures walking near the shore. You fire off a shot and watch the lead figure drop. You take out the rest of the patrol and pull back behind some fronds. Switching to your bravo team (who you just happened to have placed on your flank) you see the dim outlines of a dozen soldiers racing towards your alpha team. You open up with your machine guns and watch them drop. After you've fended off a few more assaults like this, you eventually come upon an abandoned cabin. That's when the real run starts.  While the swamp is my favorite, there are fourteen other missions each with their own sense of place. A forest-covered valley, a neatly ordered field, a bombed-out village, Red Square with its ornamental minarets and a host of other environments await you.  The sound enhances the mood substantially. Using full EAX support you can easily recognize and respond to audio cues. But even without the positional audio, the sound effects themselves are absolutely first-rate. In the swamp mission you hear thunder roll realistically across the sky. Other levels have jet fighters screaming through the air. Weapon effects and impacts are insanely frightening and the little ~kfump~ that you hear when the bullets start hitting the ground in front of your feet is enough to make you want to duck under your desk. In one mission you'll be walking through an underground garage and hear the echo of your footsteps and gunfire. The typical Bill Brown score is here as well, but for some reason it doesn't seem to have the same importance as it did in the previous Rainbow games.  Obviously all this ambiance comes with a hefty price. The system requirements on Ghost Recon are definitely geared towards the high side. I thoroughly enjoyed the game on a P500MHz machine with 512MB of RAM and a GeForce. At 1024x768 you could definitely see some frames drop but unless you're in a big level with lots of effects it won't really be too much of a problem. There are 15 separate graphic options to tweak so, unless your system is out and out mediocre, you ought to be able to find a setting that strikes a balance between a good frame rate and nice details.  Red Storm has provided substantial enemy AI. You're frequently outflanked and, if you're not careful, you can be completely overwhelmed. Part of this is a function of the placement of the enemies and the layouts of the environments. But the way the enemies respond to you is surprisingly fluid and dynamic. Although most enemies begin in the same place, they respond to your actions by moving to new areas of the map. I've been outflanked countless times by the enemies and have been forced to take cover with one group firing on me as another group moved in to start tossing some grenades at me.  I will say that the detection ranges for the enemies seems really short. One mission where you rescue two downed pilots from a farm requires you to assault two separate buildings. I popped several grenades into one house expecting to see reinforcements come rushing in from the other house just a short way up the road. Apparently they didn't hear me. But since engagement distances seem maybe a little shorter than they might be in real life (especially so for the snipers), this isn't such a bad thing. In any case the enemies are a lot more mobile this time around so don't be surprised if they suddenly show up where you never expected to see them. Like behind you, for instance. While I'm on the subject of enemy detection, the threat indicator at the bottom of your screen will point you in the general direction of the enemy. A separate set of signals warns you when you're being fired upon or when you've come within 40 meters of an enemy. Sadly the threat indicator only considers the enemy's position to you relative to a flat horizontal plane. You could be standing under a bridge with enemies 100 feet directly above you and the ~enemy nearby~ indicator would be on.  There are also some tether problems with the following members of your fire teams. Since most of the action takes place outside, your teams tend to stay a bit spread out. This is normally not a problem but you occasionally run into the problem of placing your lead guy behind some cover only to turn around and discover your other teammates still standing in harm's way. This problem is only aggravated when you go prone. If you're running forward and suddenly drop to the ground, the other members of your fire team drop with you but stop moving forward. This can leave you kind of lonely in a firefight.  Thankfully Ghost Recon seems devoid of the collision detection problems that plagued the Rainbow Six series. While there is the occasional odd stickiness around certain doorways or stairways or trees, no one really gets stuck anywhere. For some reason the other members of my team often had to be led individually up to the roof of an embassy in one mission. I suppose it may be that the team's cohesion is based on a horizontal rather than vertical separation. In other words, if the lead guy gets up the stairs, the other guys might not follow because he's not far enough away from a strictly horizontal point.  Still, considering the extent to which you can count on them to act smart, your other team members are extremely useful. You can't issue orders to them the same way you could in Operation Flashpoint. While you can issue basic hold and advance orders and set rules of engagement, you can use the new command map to move your other fire teams around. I found it was better to switch between them whenever they were approaching hostile territory, but the command map lets you move your troops all over the level with very little trouble. You can set firing arcs and stances for them as well.  A few other things should be addressed. The in-mission save and load feature (which I'm 100% thankful for and hesitant even to criticize seeing as how I just spent 3 hours trying to get through that stupid bus driver mission in Black Thorn, which doesn't let you save), could be better implemented. For one thing, the default keys for saving and loading are right next to each other.  Note to all game developers: Excitable and/or fat-fingered gamers will occasionally hit the save key when they mean to hit the load key! Give them a break and move the keys apart!  You can rebind the keys so it's not awful, but it is a mistake made by a lot of developers. The real kicker is that you can only use the quick load key within the mission itself. If you've lost and moved on to the mission results screen, you've to exit out of that and then load your game in a separate menu.  I'm the type of guy who cares more about taking out the competition than worrying about rescuing hostages or disarming bombs. As in the old Rainbow games, a Ghost Recon mission ends in success if all of the enemies are taken out. But in Ghost Recon there are extra bonus objectives that you have to complete in order to gain access to the specialists. If you kill all the enemies before you've taken care of the extra objectives, then those objectives are not completed. In one mission you've got to rescue two pilots and, if you have time, blow up their downed plane. But if you take care of the pilots first and then go after the plane, you're in trouble. The plane is heavily guarded and once you take out the guards, the mission may end before you have a chance to set the charges.  If you do succeed in completing a mission, you're rewarded with skill points and medals for all of the characters. Though there still aren't any hard and fast measures of success (other than being alive at the end of the mission) you can see how long it took you to complete a mission.  If the review ended here, I'd recommend Ghost Recon to anyone who has the system to run it and had 16 or 20 hours to spare. But when you add in the multiplayer and quick mission options, you've got a whole new reason to check the game out. Not only can you play through several different one-shot single player missions -- most of which are just more generic versions of the campaign missions -- you can also play through the campaign cooperatively with a bunch of your friends.  And then there are the more traditional multiplayer game types. King of the hill, deathmatch and last man standing options each bring a new approach to the game and the server can set various toggles to allow for respawns, kit restrictions, team play, and a host of other options. Right now the plan is to host the game on the nascent ubi.com service. Since the service isn't quite up and running yet we haven't been able to accurately test the servers. Still, the hours we've played around the office and with the folks at Red Storm are more than enough to convince us that if ubi.com does work, Ghost Recon will have as loyal (if not as large due to the higher requirements) a following as Rainbow and Rogue were on the Zone.   Simply put: do not miss out on this one. The single player missions and multiplayer modes are more than worth the time you invest. There are a few minor problems with it (and you still can't jump or pick up other people's weapons) but in all, the game is highly polished, marvelously fun and unexpectedly believable. It won't be out until next week, so you should have ample time to reserve a copy at CompUSA or CompUK or CompBRD or wherever the heck you shop.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
