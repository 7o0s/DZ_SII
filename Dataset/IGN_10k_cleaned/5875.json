{"name": "Pac-Mania 3D Mobile", "name_review": "Pac-Mania 3D", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/09/pac-mania-3d", "text": "Namco is high on Pac's birthday -- the old yella fella is 25 years old, and that's certainly cause to celebrate. As part of the festivities, Namco is rolling out a cornucopia of mobile games featuring the grand daddy of video game icons, including Pac-Mania 3D, which is based on the classic arcade game of the same name, save for that whole 3D suffix.   Pac-Mania 3D was kind of the odd duck out in the whole Pac oeuvre. The familial titles -- Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man Jr. -- and even Super Pac-Man pretty much stuck to the top-down labyrinth design, but Pac-Mania 3D struck the maze chase in an isometric view which really altered the game play, especially when coupled with Pac's newest talent: jumping.   Thanks to the new view, Pac-Mania 3D's mazes cannot be seen in a single screen. You must scroll around, which really jettisons a lot of Pac strategies. Couple that with the surprise of a nearby ghost being out of view until it's sometimes too late to do anything about it, and you start to see some of the problems with the game. Even the ability to leap over ghosts is of questionable use, as sometimes it is hard to judge Pac's landing zone.  Now, there are two ways to view Pac-Mania 3D. As a game, I was never a huge fan of this installment. It just didn't keep me glued like my two faves -- Ms. Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man (which deserves a mobile port). However, this is a very technically sound port of the game that will please its fans, wherever they may be. If I was scoring Pac-Mania 3D on my dislike of the game alone, I might be a little more harsh on it -- but as mentioned, this is a solid port that captures the essence of the game, whether it's flawed or not.", "date": "Jul 9, 2005"}
