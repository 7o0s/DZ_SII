When Pro Pilot went on sale early this year without any support for 3D accelerator cards, a lot of gamers were shocked. With Microsoft's Flight Simulator 98 already on the shelves and Looking Glass's Flight Unlimited II on the way -- both with spectacular 3D accelerated graphics -- it looked like marketing suicide to release a civilian flight simulator with blocky, software-only graphics. But the bigger Sierra gets, the more the company's savvy seems to slip away. Pro Pilot was released without 3D support -- not to mention a slew of other problems, including a raft of bugs and a poor flight model.  Pro Pilot '99 is less a sequel than an attempt to address the original game's shortcomings; its primary new features are support for Glide-compatible (i.e., 3Dfx-based) 3D accelerators and the handful of scenery enhancements that makes possible (clouds, lighting effects, better-looking terrain). Anyone with a non-3Dfx accelerator is still out of luck, and a number of problems that existed in the original game still haven't been fixed.   Chief among those problems is PP99's dodgy flight model. Hard-core sim fans (those who managed to get past the homely graphics) complained that the original Pro Pilot's flight model didn't allow you to pitch any of the planes past the vertical, which made aerobatic maneuvers like loops, half-loops, the Immelman, and the split-S impossible. Try to pull a loop, and the plane would stop dead at the vertical position, as if it had hit an invisible wall, then hang there by its nose until it stalled -- at which point it would invariably fall forward regardless of what you were doing with the stick. The same problem exists in PP99.  Admittedly, this is a civilian flight simulation, so the inability to pull loops and other related maneuvers isn't as glaring a flaw as it would be in an air combat sim. But the fact that these maneuvers are physically impossible in PP99 -- regardless of the plane you're flying or its energy state -- is an indication of a seriously flawed and unrealistic flight model. If it won't let you pull past vertical, you have to wonder how else the design team fudged PP99's flight model. And the fact that this flaw still exists in PP99 -- despite the complaints of gamers who bought the original -- suggests that Sierra was more interested in making cosmetic improvements than in fixing the sim's more fundamental failings.  Pro Pilot '99 doesn't seem to be nearly as buggy as its predecessor, but it's still pretty unstable. In my first seven or eight sessions playing PP99 on two different PCs, I was only able to shut the game down normally three times -- every other time, it crashed or locked up. This problem seemed to disappear when I freed up enough hard-drive space to do a full installation of the game -- but anyone considering buying PP99 should bear in mind that choosing the minimum installation will probably result in a lot of headaches.  Ultimately, Sierra is still far behind in its game of catch-up with Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Unlimited II. And with new, improved versions of both the Microsoft and Looking Glass sims on the horizon -- not to mention Terminal Reality's promising Fly! -- it's hard to imagine why anyone would buy Pro Pilot '99.   -- Luke Shannon", "date": "Oct 24, 1998"}
