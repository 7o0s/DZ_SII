For Capcom, that goal has been realized with Flipnic Ultimate Pinball, a pinball game that lets its freak flag fly in the wind as it offers up not tables, but environments. This is not pinball, but pinball deconstructed and mashed back together again into a bizarre new beast. It's an interesting promise, but in the end it's one that only manages to hold up its end of the deal for partway through the game before it gets to be more tedious than fun.    By completely forgoing ~real~ tables, Flipnic has opened itself to the possibility of plenty of oddball techniques. The first level, Biology, starts off with an area that's pretty familiar: a couple of flippers, some bumpers, targets, and silver rails that lead elsewhere. Of course, that's assuming that playing on a river is normal and that silver balls can glide across their surface as if it was hardwood. And those silver rails? Those lead off to a completely different area for some different types of action. One rail can lead to a bumper village while another can lead to a multiball arena to score some jackpots.   Splitting the levels into a group of separate sections connected by rails is a novel one, but the even bigger promise is when the game gets even more fantastical. Starting a mini-game can lead to a quest to feed a monkey bananas or begin a UFO counting contest. Nail a series of bumpers and the water will all freeze over, leading to the next challenge of smashing the ice wall that was the waterfall in order to find a new area to play in.    While playing through the Biology level, the novelty of the gameplay keeps the action moving along nicely, even if there are a few problems along the way. The most glaring problem is that every time a new mode is introduced -- like multiball or a new challenge -- the game insists on showing a short movie for it. No matter how many times the multiball starts, the game has to show a scene of balls falling from a tree. It can be cute once, but when it's a few seconds long and happens for many events it slows the action down a little and loses some of the momentum. Sadly, this problem repeats itself throughout the game.   Another problem is that there gets to be some emphasis on non-flipper action. This can happen in an area where there are bumpers that can be put up or down with one of the flipper buttons. Guiding the ball through is a matter of timing the bumpers right and making sure that the right ones are up or down to bounce it or let it through. Variety is usually good, but this part of the game tends to lean towards careful manipulation of the ball with some clumsy controls instead of the fast targeting and ramp-rolling that the flippers bring in. Sometimes this makes the action much more reminiscent of the Plinko game in The Price is Right than any pinball table.   Still, the novelty of it all keeps the game going through Biology. But with three other levels it should have been that the level of quality and imagination would get progressively better, but the reality is twisted and the levels get progressively worse and stripped down. In the next level, Metallurgy, the waterfalls, plants and animals are all ditched in favor of a gray setting with lots of metallic objects. In the Optics level many of the textures are dropped and the resulting look is like that of a dance club that's bathed in black light. Finally, in the Geometry level, even the third dimension is scrapped and what's left is a 2D level that looks like a mix of Pong and Breakout. For some reason the developers decided to steadily remove any and all visual elements for those who play further.     It's really a shame that the tables get less fun as they go on. While the bumper sections and the flipper-less areas of the Biology level were forgivable for the most part, they get even more frustrating later into the game. The Metallurgy level has a frustrating maze that's mildly interesting the first time and absolutely tedious in successive attempts. The Optics stage manages to one-up this by throwing in some boring challenges that require players to collect different colored rings by awkwardly moving through the different areas and it includes a huge field of bumpers that should never have been put in the game at all.   While Metallurgy has a couple of fun challenges to save the level, the Optics level is the point where Flipnic completely loses the plot and then the only reason to keep playing is for the hope that the Geometry level is worth unlocking for full play (all levels can be played for a few minutes at first). Sadly, it isn't. It upholds the dismal value that's been established by Optics. After so many challenges of endlessly bouncing a ball around a pile of bumpers or trying to hit it up a ramp in the back of the screen that's hard to see it's clear that the developers lost track of how to make a fun game.   Put it all together and Flipnic contains about one-and-a-half levels that are decently fun to play. While there are plenty of odd things that happen in Flipnic, the most bizarre bit is how the development team took a good idea and ran it into the ground. Instead of keeping to the spirit of pinball of using the flippers to nail some tricky shots and keeping the action big and loud with the use of ramps and special events, everything slows down further and further until the final result is that of bouncing a circle around a 2D playing field, trying to collect keys and destroy blocks.   Even playing the only two decent levels of Biology and Metallurgy can get a little old. The long intro movies for the modes, the Plinko action, and the lack of different camera views can get old as well. There are also a few two-player modes, but these are barely a sideshow to the main action. With the emphasis yet again on playing with bumpers, the two-player games don't lend themselves to some fast-paced gameplay where you can gloat over a killer shot.     From Biology to Metallurgy...      to Optics and Geometry.Flipnic starts out with a bang and follows that with a quick fade into nothingness. It's rare to see a game that takes away more stuff as it progresses rather than adding new features, but here it is. It doesn't seem like there was a need for this since the graphical look of the first couple levels is very nicely done, but if there was an intent to give off a feeling of de-evolution, then this title has been enormously successful.", "date": "Jul 13, 2005"}
