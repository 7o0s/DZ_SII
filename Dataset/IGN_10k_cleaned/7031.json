THQ Wireless flanked last year's ~Revenge of the Sith~ with a suite of Star Wars-themed games, such as Lightsaber Combat and Battle Above Coruscant. The mobile maker added a surprise entry in the mobile franchise last week with the release of Death Star Assault 3D for select 3D-enbaled handsets.   There was no reason for a stealth delivery, though, as Death Star Assault 3D is an enjoyable arcade-style shooter that gives mobile pilots a seat in the cockpits of both an X-Wing and the famed Millennium Falcon, Han Solo's smuggling ship turned Rebel icon. The game, played out in full 3-D as promised in the title, comes across as a blend of the classic vector arcade game and the flight sequences of SEGA's more-recent Stars Wars trilogy cabinet.   Death Star Assault 3D's levels are like a highlight reel of cool moments -- even though the game is short, there are no lulls in the action. The front half of the game has you swooping in to destroy the original Death Star in Luke's X-Wing, nailing TIEs on approach until skimming the surface of the orbital battle station. After you ventilate wave after wave of TIEs and blast laser turrets on the Death Star surface, you drop into the trench for the famous ~Use the force, Luke~ torpedo delivery run. The back half is all Falcon, with you making a run on the rebuilt Death Star above Endor, worrying about Star Destroyers and TIEs before delivering the death blow to the Emperor's toy.   As mentioned, there are no slow spots in this game, just lots of shooting action in brief levels -- each worth replaying for not only increased scores, but just for the fun of it. You earn control bonuses for going above and beyond the call of duty by destroying extra targets, but I found myself making runs a few times seeing if I could score a 100-percent kill rate. The levels often last no more than a couple minutes, which make them the perfect length for fast mobile gaming. You get in, stomp the Empire, and get out in time to catch a bus or pay attention to a class lecture.   The sights look great, with well-done 3D. The textures are great, the models look good, and the scaling is very smooth. (I played the game on a Sony Ericsson W600i.) You can really appreciate the texture work when you start closing in on the Death Star and the Executioner, the biggest Star Destroyer in the Imperial fleet. As said in the preview, the star fields in the background employs a nice blur effect when you sharply turn during a dogfight.  Star Wars: Death Star Assault 3D is a good download for fans of the classic trilogy, as it covers some of the best moments -- and delivers very playable action with good control. The game is a bit on the short side, but has strong replay value, especially for Star Wars junkies. If you want to take a break for poker and puzzle games, download Death Star Assault 3D and blast a few TIEs out of the sky. Recommended.", "date": "Jun 28, 2006"}
