In many ways Play the World is just a tighter, more refined version of Civilization 3. But there are plenty of changes that make the game different enough that it's a must have for any Civ fan(atic).   While there are numerous changes to note here, the big addition is multiplayer. In that regard, the biggest liabilities of the Civilization model are its turn-based format and the amount of time required to complete a game. With eight people alternating turns in a 500-turn game, you can easily waste three full days finally getting through it all. Fortunately the team has included some new modes that speed things up a bit, not just in terms of making the game faster but also in terms of making it more focused on specific victory types.   Rather than alternating turns players now have two new options. The first, simultaneous movement has all the players taking their turns at the same time. Once the turn clock runs out, all the moves and orders are carried out at once. Better still is the turnless mode. Here there are still turns but they run in real time in an unending sequence. At the ~end~ of each turn, production from cities is added up, population grows and research and taxes are applied. Each unit also has a clock that prevents them from moving until their movement points regenerate.   This turnless mode is really cool and adds an intensity and sometimes even a panic that's missing from the turn-based modes. The game forces you to pay attention only to what's important. While I appreciate the narrowed focus in most cases, things like automated research paths tend to frustrate me. The fact that you can't add computer controlled AI players to the game is also a bit disappointing.   Hotseat and Play-by-email modes are also included if you don't mind taking a little more time with the games. I've not found them nearly as compelling as the other modes, but they're a nice alternative. And since you can set time limits for the turns, you can force players to get through the game a bit quicker. The option to set a time limit or point limit for the entire game, also lets you bring things down to a manageable level. Optional accelerated production effectively doubles the resources of each city, making the games run even faster.   In Regicide, each civilization gets one or more king units representing their leader. The Americans have a little Abe Lincoln unit right on the map, for instance. Like in chess, their mobility and usefulness are very low and, also like chess, they have to be protected at all costs. Lose all of your king units and you're eliminated from the game. A second elimination-based mode, aptly called Elimination, destroys your whole civilization the turn any of your cities are captured or destroyed. As you can imagine, this makes for some very touchy games.   The balance of power can change drastically with these elimination oriented game types. Since you can wipe out a whole civilization by taking a single city (or unit), you'll find yourself faced with new possibilities for expansion late in the game. This opens up a few strategic considerations that weren't a part of the original game. This time around, before you wipe out a civ, it makes sense to have settlers and workers ready to rush in and fill the vacuum.   Supplementing the two elimination modes are two point-based modes. Domination flags every civ's starting square as a victory location. These locations take the form of small temples so you can spot them at a glance (assuming the civ doesn't build its first city right on top of it). At the end of each turn, you earn points for the victory locations you hold. Since each player starts with one, you'll need to take others away from your opponents. (The editor lets you place additional victory locations so you can recreate a Holy Land fervor among the players.) This mode is fun initially but the AI players are relentless once you take the lead in points. Human players are more likely to adopt long-term strategies that don't necessarily involve kicking your ass right away.   The silliest of the modes is Capture the Princess. It's just like capture the flag but in this case, the flag is a princess. She begins on your starting square and cannot be moved except by military units of other civilizations. The idea is to capture a princess and take her back to your capital. Once done, you score a ton of points and the princess returns to her capital city. This mode is really interesting in terms of concept, but it requires a lot of time and attention to work right.   A running scoreboard tells you how you're doing in terms of points and lets you see who your biggest rivals are. (There are traditional Civ 3 points awarded for happy citizens and the like so you needn't play one of the specific point modes to see this info.) The host can save games if they start to drag on too long. In fact, the autosave feature helps preserve the state of the game for dropped players and crashed games. Just make sure to stop after a player drops because once they're gone, their empire is completely eliminated from the game.    The game runs on Gamespy but, for once, I'm not going to complain about it. While I normally despise third-party multiplayer services, this time around it's made as innocuous as possible. A series of handy filters let you pare off the games you're not interested in playing while player customization options give you a modicum of personality online.   Eight new civilizations have been added to the game (I still can't get used to calling them tribes). I'm really glad with all the new civs as they include some interesting and influential cultures from world history. There's a good distribution of characteristics as agendas as well, with an even mix of commercial, military, industrious, religious and expansionist civs.   Each new civ also comes with a new unique unit. Some, like the Scandanavian berserker, are as effective as they are novel. In the case of the berserker, it gives the player the change to conduct amphibious assaults early in the game. Others, like the Numidian mercenaries of the Carthaginians, aren't as innovative but still pack quite a punch. The Spanish Conquistadors are probably my favorite with a nice attack and defense and the ability to treat all terrain as roads.   In addition to the new civ-specific units, there are two new units that all civs can build. The first available are medieval infantry. These serve as a nice compliment to the pikemen but, more importantly, they're upgraded from swordsmen. This extension of the warrior-swordsman path lets you maintain your offensive advantages moving from the Ancient to Medieval periods. In the Industrial Age all civs can build guerillas. These are nice all-purpose units that help give you a bit of versatility and are available fairly early in the Industrial Age.   New worker actions help you defend your territory even better now. Outposts are available early and allow you to see nearby squares even if you have no nearby units. This is a great way to keep an eye on a nearby enemy or chokepoint. Much later in the game you can construct radar towers that grant all nearby friendly units a significant bonus in combat.   And since you lose the worker to create these outposts and radar towers, you can't just build them all across your borders. There are also new airfields that can be constructed in your own or any neutral territory. These airfields can be used as airbases to help extend the range of your air units. It's good to see that the enemy uses these three new installations as frequently as wisely as the player will. They seem to place more emphasis on radar towers than on the other two items, but they still seem aware of the strategic value of all the new actions.   This time around all of the possible unit actions are available via buttons at the bottom of the screen. In the previous game, you had buttons for all the main actions, but the more obscure ones required you to know the appropriate hotkeys. Now all of these options (including irrigate to city, build trade network, and several others) are conveniently placed alongside the more basic worker actions. On the worker front, the expansion prohibits you from adding workers to cities experiencing starvation.   Inside the cities you'll find three new things to build. The stock exchange and commercial dock help boost your commerce and tax output.  It gives you a bit more gold to work with and also increases the value of well-supplied coastal cities. But the most significant city improvement is the civil defense structure. This provides a badly needed defensive option for cities that can no longer use city walls.   The only new wonder, the Internet, basically replaces the SETI Project from prior games. It not only adds a free research lab to every city on the continent but also, and perhaps more importantly, automatically triggers a Golden Age if you haven't already had one. Coming fairly late in the game, that can really help turn the tide in your favor.   From a standpoint of function, the game takes advantage of some new features and fixes some old ones. First off, the sorting ability on the advisor screens works so that's a plus. But beyond that, there are several other interface changes that make things much more convenient and fast for the player. Automated bombardment and bombing let you focus your attention on other matters while your artillery and bombers wear down your enemies. Stacked movement allows you to get lots of units from one area to another without having to move each one. You can also set rally points for unit production so you can have your military units build up in a particular location without needing to move them all one by one.   Diplomacy and espionage are consolidated into one location this time around which lets you get your head around the overall situation a bit better. The only real issues with the diplomacy interface is that you often have to wait for your opponent to make a decision about your offers. In most cases, this isn't a big deal, but if you're playing a turnless mode, it can slow you down a bit. Renegotiations in hotseat and PBEM modes is a bit of a pain as well and make take several turns before you reach a final deal.   What did you think of Play the World?   Having kept up with the current patches for the original Civilization, I wasn't too surprised by a lot of the changes in the expansion. And luckily, nearly every major issue I had with the original game has been cleared away leaving only one lingering frustration -- the inability to easily distinguish among unhappy, happy and content citizens on the city screen. It's not that it's impossible but it's much harder to ~read~ the happiness of a city at a glance. But hey, if that's the only thing that's really wrong with the game, I probably shouldn't complain.  We've been waiting for this for a while. And while I thought multiplayer was something that should've been included in the first place, I'm glad the Firaxis folks have bothered to put so much time and effort in to the update. There are still a few issues that I'd like to see fixed but, for the $30 asking price, Play the World is a game that no Civ fan(atic) should be without. Unless they don't have an internet connection.But then, how are you reading this?", "date": "Oct 31, 2002"}
