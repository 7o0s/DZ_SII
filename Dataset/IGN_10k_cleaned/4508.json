The top guilds server-wide had long since conquered Quarm and were turning the Plane of Time into a weekly shopping spree while casually cruising through high-risk adventures from Lost Dungeons of Norrath. The challenge at the high end was dwindling. The cry and hue from the community could be heard. Would EverQuest be able to grow in new and meaningful ways, even for its most advanced players?   Enter Gates of Discord -- yes folks, the challenge is back with vengeance and fury. This wasn't done simply by making tougher monsters; Sony listed to the old guard players and reached into their bag of tricks to modify the game in a number of new ways. Break out those dungeoneering skills you mastered in Sebilis and Chardok back in the day because you're gonna need them all. Also break out your best gear and get ready to be scared. But also be ready to experience that feeling again of a hard-earned success and a new appreciation for your fellow adventurers as you begin to succeed against the most challenging trials your avatar has ever faced.   While Gates aims directly at getting the blood pumping in the level-65 players, but there are a number of innovations in this expansion that will serve to enhance gameplay for players of all levels. A set of new Advanced Abilities have been provided as well as whole new experience tracks based on group and raid leadership experience with new types of Abilities designed to increase the variety and usefulness skills players can develop. On top of these new features, a system known as ~tribute~ has been added -- old items that have been rotting in players banks can be converted into tribute buffs, a valuable way for a player to tap into the resources of their home city. All classes get a handful of new spells or disciplines, mostly at level 65. Finally, add to this list of new features a new player class that looks as promising as the recent Beastlord class, the Berzerker. Let's take a look, shall we?    Taelosia  The lore continues with our friends the Wayfarers Brotherhood from the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion. The ancient continent of Taelosia has been discovered. Morden Rasp and the Wayfarer's Brotherhood are charting the continent and seeking to right the wrongs that have happened to some peaceful faerie-like people called the Beludu and their worker golems, who have been enslaved by an evil movement known as the Mata Muram. Now Taelosia is teeming with swarms of very nasty monsters.    Elements from some of the more interesting expansions of the past can be seen. Remember Kunark and needing to run through 4 or 5 dangerous zones to get to your favorite exp spot? Remember naked corpse runs through Western Wastes? Gates of Discord has only one known port point, and we haven't found any zones beyond that that allow players to bind themselves. Don't look for any graveyards to recover your corpse from -- /hug a rogue or necro for those corpse drags and summons you're going to inevitably need.   Like Planes of Power you must earn character flags to gain progressive access to the zones that are deeper into the continent. So far as we have seen in Gates of Discord, flags can be earned by single groups and may also be earned alternatively by defeating raid-level monsters. Don't let this flexibility in acquiring zone flags be misconstrued as easiness. A flag earned by a single group may take an uninterrupted dungeon crawl with a very well-balanced group of as many as 6 hours to complete. These single group flag events are called Expeditions and utilized the instanced-zone feature which debuted in Lost Dungeons of Norrath.    The Evolution of the Instanced Zone  Gates of Discord builds on many of the elements and improvements from the instanced adventures pioneered in Lost Dungeons can be seen everywhere in this expansion. Of the 20 new zones in the expansion, 10 are instanced. This may not seem like a lot of instanced zones by Lost Dungeons standards, but these are different in many ways.    Immediately we notice that each of these instanced zones are more intricate than those in Lost Dungeons. You will always get the same map for an expedition you choose, and you will not be choosing the difficulty level -- consider them all 'high-risk'... Instead you may choose whether you are doing this expedition for experience and loot or if you wish to undergo a trial to receive a character flag that will contribute to opening up additional zones.    Each expedition has some kind of lore and a unique set of goals to solve. For example, in one of the sewers trials given by Gamesh in Barindu, you must collect four different, randomly-dropped skulls, then kill four named monsters at the far end of the dungeon, then you must make your way with a time limit to hand the skulls in to another NPC at another part of the dungeon in order to succeed.    Interestingly, each of these expeditions needs a strategy to win which may not be easily intuited. This is an interesting twist to a game where developing a strategy to progress was almost always associated with much larger raid-level encounters. Look for some clever twists like being required to answer riddles successfully or needing pick pockets for keys...    Tribute  Everquest has been around for many years, and without 'item decay' the amount of items available for sale have flooded server economies, causing what many players smirkingly call 'mudflation.~ Items which people were paying top price for in the East Commons tunnel and then the Bazaar (after the Luclin launch) kept getting more and more affordable due to the oversupply. It became easy for a new character to acquire a full set of powerful gear beyond their level and progress through levels more than 10 times faster than in years past. Platinum piled up in players banks. This put a damper on the vibrancy of the player economy as a whole.   Enter Tribute. Players far and wide are cleaning out all those items gathering dust in their banks to get some tribute points in their home cities. These points can be spent on a huge variety of statistic or ability bonuses that can enhance a character for a fixed duration. These enhancements can range from providing focus effects like mana conservation to buffs like increased hit points. Many of these 'stack' with conventional buffs or abilities, thus making them extremely compelling. My wizard has been selling all his old items to make sure he has a constant stream of the extra mana regeneration, to the tune of 210 tribute points per hour.    As players stock up on tribute points we may see a far more interesting value scale in the player economy, making it more interesting to be a trader or a craftsperson in EverQuest again -- a dimension of the game that has long been considered in need of some help.    Group and Raid leadership abilities  This may prove to be the greatest new addition to the game of the many offered by Gates of Discord. Two new experience types have been created which a player can earn if they are a group leader or a raid leader. If you hit the L key a menu comes up with all available abilities and costs, much like the Advanced Abilities window. While there are some conveniences like graphically highlighting monsters, there are some very interesting abilities here. A single group might find the Find Path to PC handy to keep players from getting lost in a twisty dungeon, and graphically marking the target of the person designated as the main assist may prove very handy.    For raids, each group in a raid will begin to tune itself to these abilities. A caster group might have a leader that would invoke the Mana Enhancement ability, while a melee group might have Health Enhancement going. A healing group might have health of target's target going so they can see the health of the target monster while healing. Meanwhile, the raid's leader will be able to graphically describe a complex attack strategy with the assistance of these abilities.   New class: Berzerker  Say hello to the first new character class since the popular Beastlord from the Shadows of Luclin expansion. The berzerker is very similar to a warrior in terms of weapon ability, hitpoints and Alternative Abilities, but wear the armor of a chain melee class.    They sport some unique hybrid-type abilities like a type of snare (Leg Cut (32) Leg slice(54)), and stuns (Head Strike (16), Head Pummel(40)). Of note, Berzerker abilities are not magic -- ~As he becomes more powerful, he can infuse his rage into various thrown weapons, causing dire effects when they strike a foe.~ Berzerkers actually craft their own throwing axes to use these abilities.    Diverging from their more conventional melee cousins, Berzerkers forego the kick ability at level 6 when they instead get Frenzy. Frenzy can be used about the same frequency as a kick but it causes 1-3 extra swings with a 2-handed weapon. With a good 2-handed weapon this could get berzerker damage on par with say a rogue. Possibly the most powerful of all the Berzerker abilities may be the Battle cry line of disciplines -- a group haste that lasts for one minute -- ~Berzerker energy wells up inside you.~ These abilities look to span both group and raid usefulness, and suggest a good chance of viability for this class.     New Alternative Advancement Abilities and New Spells  On top of the major changes brought to EverQuest by the new expansion, incremental enhancements can be found as well. There's a new batch of Advanced Abilities once again, which will increase the power and variety of skills player characters may earn. As was the case with Planes of Power, these may build on existing abilities and won't come cheaply.   Additional spells can be found also, 4 or 5 per class, also mostly incremental at the top levels. Also this expansion marks a return of Ancient spells. Looks like one of those per class, considering the uncommonness of spell drops in this expansion up through the first 10 zones, we can expect these ancient spells to be rare and hard-earned treasures.   Zone Design  The new zones are architecturally very dramatic, with grand structures abounding. Morden Rasp's massive 3-hulled flagship is dominates the Abysmal zone. Moving deeper into the continent, Ferubi is an impressive looking raid zone with many vaulted chambers and intricate statues and fountains. There's a real sense of journeying deeper into the continent as you travel through the mountain pass zones of Vxed and Tipt; beyond which lies the immense Kod'Taz zone, with massive temple-like structures in mountainous canyons. The largest building in Kod'Taz echoes the mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Kod'Taz has a sheen of black mist hovering on the ground which displays ripples of wind blowing across it. One can only imagine the imminent graphical engine overhaul scheduled for March will only enhance these already pleasing zones. Check out our Media Page for a full tour of the first 10 or so zones in this fearsome new continent.     Sony didn't skimp on the monster models in this either. You will notice a whole slew of new monsters with fearsome looks that reflect the attention to detail that went into their design. The Kyv Archers can strike fear in the best-equipped players with their fierce scowls, lightning speed and propensity to see through invisibility.   Gates of Discord is refreshing in a lot of ways and has surely offered a bold answer to the question of whether there's room in the game design for challenge at the high end. The new leadership abilities are major features that add broad new dimensions to this already rich tapestry. The instanced zone concept has taken evolutionary steps here as well. The rich detail in the new zones, multitude of new monsters and challenges show that much effort went into Gates of Discord across the board.With such a large number of changes in one expansion, balance issues can turn up that may need to be tuned. The new difficulty and the single group focus of the instanced progression zones may put to the test the long-term player class equilibrium that has been so delicately tuned from expansion to expansion. For a guild to progress to Kod'Taz, for example, members must be flagged through single group expeditions in Vxed and Tipt. These zones really seem to require balanced groups that will put heavy demands on some classes like warriors while make other classes like mages, wizards and rogues in oversupply for the 'DPS' role. Hopefully this potential crimp on group makeup flexibility will not dominate the entire expansion. Being able to enjoy the game at a group level with unconventional group setups has been a great part of the game and we hope to see a place for that in this expansion as well in order to call it a truly great expansion. Will the deeper zones and raids address this? It can take many months for the mysteries of a new expansion to be discovered, but for the player who has played this game for a while, there's a palpable aura in the air -- the risk and challenge are back, the dangerous continent of Taelosia beckons. We are playing with an enthusiasm many of us haven't felt in a long, long time. Hats off.", "date": "Mar 3, 2004"}
