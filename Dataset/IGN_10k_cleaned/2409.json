Okay, now say that a couple of times in your head and please don't forget it.  The fact is, whether we like it or not, MMOG's are not only here to stay but also their production is no longer restricted to massive, well endowed studios.  In fact, some minor design companies, such as Shattered Galaxy's Nexon, have already entered the market with considerable success.  So before you disregard Maximum Charisma's Fighting Legends as ~a poor man's Everquest~, open your mind a little bit and read on.  The story behind Fighting Legends is simple.  And by simple I mean intricately confusing, containing many names I can't pronounce and melding science fiction, fantasy and religious theology. Basically it's enough to either give you a throbbing headache or make your mouth water with anxiety, depending on your willingness to loose yourself in the environment.  The game essentially revolved around a world, Exisle, which has been severely disturbed by the crash landing of a ship containing hundreds of frozen specimens of species from all over the galaxy.  As you can imagine, quite a stir is made over this event and several factions are formed, each attempting to achieve enlightenment and rid the world of ~the cycle of incarnation.~  After becoming familiar with Fighting Legends' background and each of its nine player factions (divided into three sub-factions -- the Underworld, the Surface Plane, and the Sky Realm) you are directed to the Avatar creation screen.  The Avatar is your primary character, a squad's immortal leader, customizable in 5 key traits (HP, Damage, Rate, Range, and Speed) and only a handful of preset character appearances per clan.  And while these options are disappointingly limited, the clans are varied enough and the preset characters are designed well enough to make the limitations acceptable.  Once character creation is completed, you are placed in the world of Exisle and the game begins.  Fighting Legends is advertised as a role-playing strategy epic.  And as the game makes clear early on, the gameplay is primarily centered on the latter genre.  While the game defines the main character as your Avatar, a strong case can be made that the game's focal point revolves around the base, which controls everything from skill research to resource mining to squad creation.  And while the base does encompass all of the game's playing elements, its range is limited, so expect to pack, move and unpack (a lengthy and dull process) your base early and often.  Once you have found a suitable location for base extraction, the meat of Fighting Legends' gameplay begins.  Realm resources (specific to each sub-clan) are required to carry out pretty much every base action in the game such as unit construction to researching technology. Resource mining is done automatically for the most part, but unfortunately the resources in the game are hardly balanced.  Everything, especially resurrection and technology research are very expensive, requiring numerous hours of tedious, early-level gameplay before any progress can be made -- a definite turnoff for the casual gamer.    The most intriguing facet of the base is the Archetype Hut -- which essentially means barracks in Exisle lingo.  There are 5 types of huts, each representing one of the five combat units in the game: Melee, Missile, Mpow (mana based characters), Tecniq (a Melee/Healing hybrid) and Speed.  Each clan has preset definitions for each character archetype so don't get too excited -- a broad range of characters is hardly evident.  Taking the time (and resources) to build the huts and characters is bearable, but it's quite a hassle to have to worry about constructing huts for each character -- yet another deterrent for the casual gamer.  However, once you are able to hurdle Fighting Legends' gathering and construction barrier, you will find that combat is actually a pleasant reward.  As I noted earlier, there are several features that may dissuade the game's apparent target audience: gamers interested in the MMOG craze but intimated by the complexity of some of the genre's major players.  Fortunately, Fighting Legends has integrated a simple, enjoyable combat element to help win over some of this audience.  Combat is handled in a console-style manner requiring only targeting (manually done by only tapping the space bar), a switch in your ~mood~ (from passive to aggressive) and a left click to begin the battle.  Once your action bar (the recharge time is determined by your character's Rate) fills up again, the process (sans the targeting and mood change) repeats.  It's easy, fast and surprisingly enjoyable if a little plain.  Fighting Legends attempts to strike a balance between achieving cartoonish artistic surrealism and appealing to casual gamers of all ages, but in the process, ends up looking bland and outdated. Unfortunately, this crux is widely apparent. For instance, the character designs are innovative, but there isn't enough detail to truly make them awe-inspiring.  Similarly, the world of Exisle has a surreal, otherworldly appeal to it, but comes off looking like something created for the N64 four years ago, with its dull shapes and lack of colors.  But while a seasoned gamer may scoff at Fighting Legends' look, in comparison to Anarchy Online or The Dark Age of Camelot, the game's graphics do succeed in maintaining a straightforward, unique, PG appeal that some will find refreshing.  Okay, so now what?  We've covered the graphics and the core gameplay, but how about the bigger picture?  Does Fighting Legends differentiate itself enough from other MMOG's to make it worth your precious time and money?  Well, while the game does follow the traditional hack n' slash character advancement formula that has proven to be so successful for MMOG's to date, it adds a few new interesting elements.  For instance, various relics of great value are located throughout Exisle that provide much-needed boosts to your squad.  Unfortunately these items are rare and can only be used once -- so continual questing is a must if you want to progress.  Another nice breath of MMOG fresh air that Fighting Legends possesses is the strategy elements intertwined in the gameplay.  I've already mentioned the base-building aspect, but the game really differentiates itself from the competition in the team-based combat.  You can divide your units into up to four subgroups, each conveniently controllable through keyboard macros.  In fact, you can determine which group to control and what formation to assume in a fashion very reminiscent to Homeworld (the 1-4 keys, and the F1-F6 keys).  And while the squad control is intuitive and a breeze, the game slightly suffers when it comes to camera control.  None of the three default camera views gives you a sufficient view of your surroundings and the manual control uses a tricky combination of keyboard and mouse controls that can be a real pain if you want to get a different perspective during combat.  This is not a major problem, but it does take away from the experience.  Overall, neither Fighting Legends' unique features nor its innovative world are significant enough to alter the fact that the game is just a bland, simplistic alternative to other prominent MMOGs.  It offers nothing new in terms of quest goals and gaming depth; in fact, it's quite disheartening to learn that the game's limited front-end options (only five unit classes, three realms, etc) aren't offset by depth in other facets of the game.  For instance, skills are limited and tough to gain, the world isn't all that large, and there's hardly any incentive to interact with other players (given that the game doesn't really have an economy).  Such shortcomings make it hard for me to recommend Fighting Legends and its $9.95 monthly asking price to anyone already familiar (and pleased) with the deeper, most gratifying MMOG's already available.  However, if you aren't yet involved in the genre, pursuing Fighting Legends might be a nice first step to take.  -- Michael Perlo      Want to share your opinions with the world?
