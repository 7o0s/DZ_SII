{"name": "Gals Fighters", "name_review": "Gals Fighters", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/30/gals-fighters", "text": "If the words, ~I'm cute, so take it easy on me!~ make you feel surly, then this game isn't for you. It's Gals Fighters, silly boy, and it's cute as a button. So ding-dang cute that characters even tell each other how cute -- or not cute -- they are. If you can't take it, or if you'd feel embarrassed having a fighting game in your collection with only femme fighters (and none in a string bikini, you naughty lads), then skip this pink-trimmed fighter.  But for the rest of us happy fellows and snappy lasses, Gals Fighters is a lot of fun. Without as many characters as SNK vs. Capcom and a sillier appeal, it's a lesser game than some of SNK's more established Neo Geo Pocket fighters. However, you know you're going to buy it -- it's all-girl fighting! Come on, that's love! The only question left is how it plays compared to SNK's half-dozen other fighters.  Features  More than 12 female characters  Link cable support for two players  Get powerful items  For NeoGeo Pocket Color   What's the plot of Gals Fighters? Cheeky monkeys, you would ask such a harebrained question. But there is a plot, and by gum I'm going to tell it to you. What we have here is a cat fight, a 90210-to-the-max hair puller of eight jealous, gorgeous damsels. It seems that somebody has uncovered the K Talisman, a magical amulet that allows its owner to make any wish, and it will grant it! Any wish? Yes, any wish a heart can desire. Well, that's too much to resist for our feisty feminine fighters, and they have entered a dream match to prove that they are Queen of Fighters (get it?) to claim the K Talisman. Along the way, each girl will have to meet her friends and enemies in furious battles, scrapping up with wacky attacks using tokens taken from fallen opponents to make their way through the tourney.  It's all very silly, and the game is even more ridiculous in the token collection portion of the game. The point of Gals Fighters isn't just to battle through the game pointlessly end on end of days -- there's an actual collection system in it, which is saved to the battery-backed cartridge. The gals have different knick-knacks, like earrings, amulets, hair pins, and party invitations. Many of these goodies empower your lady jay with new powers -- earrings let your character build her special meter easily, while a face scarf will cut your enemy's life in half.  These special powers make the game easier once you get better, but there is strategy involved. You can only pick one trinket for each battle, and if you lose the match, you lose your bauble. This ~collectible~ feature also makes two-player bouts more intense, as collectors who haven't mastered the game will fight much harder for the odd items.  As you can see, this game is a little more involving that the rest of the SNK fighter line-up, and this really makes a difference. But the real advance of the game isn't this fun side-project game -- it's the speed. This is the fastest of SNK's fighters, and it really makes a difference. While the gameplay isn't quite as sharp as SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium as far as accurate play control and technical fighting, it looks smoother and feels a whole lot more swift because of the speed boost (you can even toggle the speed in the menu). In fact, I had a hard time going back to any other SNK fighter after this one, and I had to sit my Neo Geo Pocket out a day without playing any fighter before SNK vs. Capcom felt right again. It's not much faster, but it is, and it makes a big difference.  As far as SNK fighters go, there are so many now that it's hard to distinguish one from the other now. They are all good games, but the fighting system is very similar across the board, and the graphics and sound are all about the same.   Gals Fighters plays for gimmick before anything else, trying to stand out from a dozen other similar titles, and that's probably why it will sell well. Fortunately, however, it fights pretty good and stands well against other Neo Geo Pocket fighters. It's the fastest game of the bunch, but still retains the precise control and animation quality. All of the attacks, counters, taunts, and special moves are here, plus many more. It has the same graphic style of its competition, but the style is even more cartoony and fun (Akari hit others with a frying pan, Leona ties lit dynamite to a girl's hair and the jumps away in an attack, and Athena run like a cartoon character, with dozens of flurried feet under her-- too cute!) Gals Fighters is also less letterboxed compared to SNK vs. Capcom.    That's all well and good, but of course, let's not forget that these are girls fighting here. That raises the bar in a lot of our books, both guys and gals. The superdeformed anime just goes great with a girlie fighter, and SNK has done plenty to make this game both cute (lots of pink, and the win bar has a heart for a victory) and also hot (all of the appropriate -- or inappropriate -- wiggle and jiggle is here). The girls have super-sweet endings as well, where their babyish dreams are brought to reality -- yet always with a twist!This isn't the greatest or most technical fighter on the system -- that honor still goes to SNK vs. Capcom. Gals Fighters doesn't have as many options (no tag) or characters (only 8 main characters, although more can be unlocked), and it plays more chaotically. However, the novelty of the game is very appealing, and the controls are still very good. In fact, as the fastest one yet, Gals Fighters is my personal favorite of the SNK Neo Geo Pocket fighters. I compare SNK vs. Capcom and Gals Fighters like I do Super Street Fighter II to Marvel vs. Capcom -- the original series is the greatest, but the crazy characters, oddball cameos, and insane are just irresistible. If you already have a pocketful of these SNK fighters, you don't really need this one... But who are we kidding here? These are fighting girls, and we love them!", "date": "Mar 30, 2000"}
