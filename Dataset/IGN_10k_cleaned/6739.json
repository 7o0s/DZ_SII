Sick of running from Sandscrawlers in the Pillars of Flame? Well, we've got good news for you, Lord Fancybottom: the new EverQuest II expansion pack will definitely help extend your enjoyment of the game -- as long as you're tough enough to face the challenge. Like the previous expansion Desert of Flames, Kingdom of Sky is focused almost exclusively on high-level players. Even the weakest of enemies in the expansion can easily take out adventurers below 50th level. As for the strongest enemies...well, even high-level characters should make sure their life insurance is all paid up before venturing into some of the areas here.  The new expansion opens up a series of floating islands collectively known as the Overrealm. Inhabited by feathery and scaley fliers (and frogloks, strangely), the islands of the Overrealm are part of the Plane of Sky that have found their way into Norrath. There are three large zones here, each of which is composed of a variety of floating islands. Wingless players will be happy to hear that the islands are connected by a series of free transport pads. Simply hop on the pad, pick a destination, and you'll be whisked away by a gentle cloud.   The three islands are dominated by a variety of refugees, dragons and bird people. There seems to be a few different conflicts going on at once here with the bird people warring amongst themselves and the dragon lords pretty much taking on anybody who gets in their way. Sitting off to the side are the Chthonian terrorlords, the mantis-like Ravasect, a whole island of beholders and, for some reason, a little society of frogloks. To help you negotiate the dangers here, the level cap for Kingdom of Sky players has been raised from 60 to 70 and up to 50 for guilds.  If you stick to the quests, you can expect to do a lot of creature farming here. Many of the quests involve killing mobs in hopes of getting item drops. In some cases, the drops are frustratingly rare, found on around one in four. In other cases, you can be assured of a drop every time you take an enemy out. If killing's not your thing, you can always turn to the wide variety of collection and errand quests. While the errands are fun, I can see the collection quests starting to get a little more aggravating once more players find their way onto the islands. There's just not enough real estate for more than a handful of players to go after the same objectives.   On the ~gotta catch 'em all~ front, Kingdom of Sky includes a ton of new collection quests. Whether you're picking up pages from a book, teeth from a monster, or some kind of ancient coin, there are dozens and dozens of collection quests scattered throughout the Overrealm. While this is a pretty popular feature, it still feels like busy work. Players who can't wait to get their hands on the prestigious rewards and rewarding prestige this obsessive-compulsive hunting offers will definitely have more enthusiasm for it.   There are plenty of new items to collect in this expansion. First, there are loads of new armor models that add a lot more variety to the game. Players who are growing bored with some of the generic-looking, underpowered designs will definitely have the chance to customize their appearance with a wide variety of new hats and helmets. Okay, okay, new hats isn't exactly a huge selling point, but there are plenty of other cool items that will not only protect your character but make them seem a little more stylish as well.      The one thing that lower level characters (well, those above 20) can really sink their teeth into is the new Achievement system. I was really disappointed that the starting characters were far too generic when EverQuest II first launched. Since then the team has incorporated a wider variety of character types to help differentiate the different types of fighters, spellcasters and rogues. The Achievement system is just one more tool that players can use to set their character apart from others of their type. In short Achievement points are earned for both combat and exploration. Once earned, these points can be used to buy abilities off of a skill tree.  The tree functions similar to those found in games like Diablo or World of Warcraft; entry-level abilities open up brand new opportunities. The initial levels let you define a general direction for your character and grant access to a wide variety of special abilities. Better still, picking abilities along one path doesn't mean that you can't explore other paths as well. Since you can upgrade the individual abilities on the tree, you'll have to decide whether to focus on a few key moves or spread your points out to grab as many different kinds of abilities as possible.   In addition to the giant praying mantises, there are some other, more aggravating bugs to be found here. Some of the quests triggers are completely broken. One in particular tasks you with throwing a note over a ledge; I must have walked back and forth along that edge for ten minutes and never once triggered the drop. Even more frustrating are the broken flight pads. Though it doesn't happen often, sometimes the flight pads connecting the islands just simply stop working. Oh, sure; your character will float a few inches in the air, buoyed up by a white cloud but since you don't actually go anywhere, it's kind of pointless. Short of logging on and off until the pads start working, your only option is to fall to your death and be resurrected on the main island.  Visually speaking, there's a lot more variety here than there was in Desert of Flames. In place of the repetitive Arabian dunescapes, the Overrealm presents players with three different kinds of islands. There's the grassy, cratered world of the Tenebrous Tangle; the rocky crags of the Barren Sky; and the purplish wasteland of the Bonemire. Whether you're enjoying the stunning vistas from a floating mountain peak or the colorful interior of one of the many dungeons, you'll definitely appreciate all the work that's gone into the visual design of the Overrealm.   But while the environments are nice, it's the inhabitants of the Overrealm that really impress. The three different varieties of Aviaks are all wonderfully designed. Watching the Vultuk fly down and start scrapping with the eagle-like Blacktalon soldiers is a real treat. My favorite by far are the owl-inspired Aviaks. The feathered texture is simply great and I love the way they turn their heads almost all the way around. And it's not just birds either. There are a wide variety of dragons and dragon-like creatures here -- from the Scaletalon warriors and Droag beasts that populate the first island to the full-on monsters of the later zones.  Given the focus that the original game put on voiceovers, it's odd that the two recent expansions have pretty much ignored voice work altogether. You'll hear some spoken lines here and there but Kingdom of Sky is dominated instead by convincing ambient sounds and a largely forgettable soundtrack. Again, Sony seems to have focused this expansion almost exclusively on the hardcore players at the top of the pyramid. Admittedly there's a broad range of players who can take advantage of the new achievement system but they're still missing out on the actual content -- quests, monsters, zones -- that's being offered to the high-level crowd. Whether or not it makes sense to give Kingdom of Sky a try will depend on whether or not you're already bumping your head against the current level cap and are growing bored with the existing content. If the answer to both questions is ~yes~ then you'll definitely find plenty of rewards here. Players who haven't yet hit those walls and don't really care about new hats can hold off for now.", "date": "Mar 16, 2006"}
