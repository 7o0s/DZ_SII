It came before most of the other ones, did things well, and from then on everybody else has been compared to it. Even for games that are arguably better (Crash Team Racing), Mario Kart still outshines. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Torus Game's Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing, based on the wildly popular movies, is more like the bumbling, awkward middle child. An awkward middle child that is also an ogre. Smash N' Crash tries it's hardest to be a good racer, but it's overshadowed by how poorly it uses the biggest draw the game has: the Shrek license.    Every major (and a few of the minor) character from the films is in the game. Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and Puss in Boots lead the cast, accompanied by some of fairytale's all stars. Each character has their own vehicle/animal that they ride around on, and it's here that the license seems to get misused. Why does Shrek have some sort of giant bog beast? Puss is riding a bull, and for some inexplicable reason, the three little pigs fly around on a magic carpet. The only vehicle that seems to make sense for the license is Donkey riding atop the dragon. It's like the developers thought up that one first, then just randomly gave the other character some vehicles. It seems very slap dash and lazy.    In fact, most of the game feels lazy. There are a lot of elements that are good, but just don't have enough to them to make the game enjoyable. For instance, there are a few really nice tracks in the game, from the swamp to Far Far Away, and all of them look great. They have a lot of detail, and really capture the look and feel of Shrek's world. However, there aren't very many of them, and they're all really short. Players will quickly memorize the layout of each track, making the race seem old two laps in.    Looking at the main menu would have players think that the game has multiple gameplay modes, but it seems to be a cruel trick. There's Tournament, Cup Challenge, Quick Race, and Time Trial. The first three are essentially the same thing, just longer versions of each. The Tournament is just a nonstop series of races, with nothing to really tie them together. It's like the three race Cup Challenge, except players don't get a break when the gameplay becomes tedious. Time Trial allows players to race on the track by themselves, getting the best lap possible. The tracks are interesting enough by themselves without the powerups and racers to compete against, and player's best times are recorded during the Cup Challenge and Tournament mode anyway.    It might be better if the races were more challenging. It is a little tricky to figure out the right control of each race; who seem to have different stats, but the game doesn't tell you what they are. The AI is all over the place. When players are passed up, the rival racers seem to slow down, so it's never hard to catch up. Likewise, no matter how good players are racing, the other contestants are always right behind, oftentimes hitting players with a weapon right before they can cross the finish line. See, the AI seems to have a much greater control over the weapons. The computer can hit players with anything they've got. They also never seem to get hit by any of the trap items. Almost a third of the weapons are of the ~oil slick~ variety too, which is annoying anyway. If Mario Kart had three bananas that all did the same thing (nothing), it'd be stupid. And it's stupid here.     Speaking of stupid, the voiceovers get old pretty quick too. Each character has a few phrases they say during and after the race. The quality is not bad. The voice actors do a fine job of mimicking the big name actors. The problem is that they only have a couple lines - usually a bad joke when they get hit with something - and players will hear them all in the first race. The jokes are rarely funny to begin with, and hearing them a dozen times doesn't help much. Sometimes a character's line after being spun out is so long, that he's caught up with the pack again before he finishes saying it. The rest of the sound by comparison is just fine. The background music is simple and non-offensive, and the sound effects have a cartoony quality that works well for the subject matter.    After each race is finished and the selected character has said his or her one line (again!), players are shown a winner's box with the top three racers for the Cup or Tournament. It's here that players finally get to see the characters up close, since most of the time all they can see is the back of their head's and their ridiculous vehicles/bog beasts/flying carpets. It's only a few seconds long, and not hugely important to the game, so maybe the developers decided to do a bare bones job of this part. The characters look not alive. They barely move and seem more like cheap Shrek robotic characters one would see in a bad theme park ride.    Kart racing is a beloved multiplayer game for many people, and so of course Smash N' Crash has a multiplayer mode. It requires each player to have a cartridge though. The races can have up to four people, and playing with friends is more fun and fairer than the single player mode, but the amount of fun is still far less than an acceptable level. Convincing someone to buy this game is a sure way to lose a friend. For what it's worth, Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing is not the worst kart racer out there. Heck, it's not even the worst Shrek Kart Racer for a handheld (Shrek Swamp Kart Speedway gets that honor). Still, this game only does a few things right, and even those it doesn't manage to carry through. The tracks are well done as far as looks, but they're short and poorly laid out. The actual racing is not challenging and clumsy. The voice acting, while well matched to the celebrity voices, are obnoxious and far too repetitive. For kids under eight that adore everything Shrek, this game will amuse them for about 20 minutes, tops. Everyone else is advised to stay far away.", "date": "Apr 4, 2007"}
