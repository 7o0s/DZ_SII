So the servers are a little more stable and the community has grown a bit since we posted our first impressions of the game. Now it's review time. While Tribes 2 does offer a lot of improvements over the original, it doesn't break too much ground either in the area of design or gameplay. But not counting the first Tribes, there's no better online action game around than Tribes 2. Whether you're using your jet pack to fly the enemy flag back to your base, battling enemies in the close confines of a massive base or raining down mortar fire from a high flying hovercraft, Tribes 2 maintains a level of excitement throughout. Tribes 2's arsenal of amazing weapons, fantastic environments and human versus human competition makes for an unforgettable experience.  One of the problems with Tribes 2 isn't anything that Sierra really has any control over. While Tribes 2 has a lot of flexibility in terms of game styles, there's not enough variety on the actual servers. Capture the Flag games are still much more common than any of the new game types. It's a shame, really, as some of the newer game types seem kind of intriguing. I think it was a good move on Dynamix's part to emphasize individual achievement in the newer game types, but it seems like most players prefer the team based format.  But hey, it's still fun, right? You bet your ass it is! It's the perfect blend between the strategic team play of Rainbow Six with the intensity and action level of Quake. This game is perfect for any action gamer who wants to play tactically but still likes lots of explosions. Two teams of a dozen cooperative players can create some of the most amazing fun you'll ever have playing in a game. Unfortunately, the game isn't quite ready to live up to the challenge of supporting 64 players. While we have had some decent games with around forty players, lag tends to slow things up a bit at this point, especially when you get more than a dozen or so characters on the same screen at the same time.  But if you'd rather play with yourself (oh, grow up), the single player ~campaign~ is really great -- assuming ~campaign~ is a French word for superfluous tutorial. While new players will benefit from the instruction, Tribes veterans won't have much use for it. You can play the new game types with bots. Not all maps support bots but even on those that do the challenge level can be inconsistent. We've seen the bots pull some pretty cool tricks and we've also seen them stand there while you blow the crap out of them. Whatever.  On the gameplay side, there are some impressive additions. The new inventory system allows you to set up to 20 different packages beforehand which you can call up with a single key stroke. Playing in the default mode, you're no longer able to buy things a la carte at the inventory stations. If for example, you want to run and grab a repair pack, you have to have a preset for it (or set one up during the game). On the plus side, it's not too hard to set them up on the fly, but it does take some getting used to. You can enable individual item purchases at inventory stations and get your repair pack by assigning it to a hot key.  The new weapons and items are pretty sweet but that's only because very little has been changed. The disc launcher, chaingun and plasma blaster are all still here as are the grenade launcher, sniper rifle and mortar. The shocklance is a new melee weapon (which, thank you, I don't use) and the missile launcher homes in on flying targets or objects painted with a targeting laser. In all, very little has changed in terms of weapons. The shocklance makes an effective counter to the sniper rifle and the missile launcher makes vehicle destruction a lot easier.  The vehicles, for the most part are pretty average. I like the idea of ground vehicles, but the extreme slopes of the terrain make them really impractical. The Jericho Mobile Point Base has the bonus of operating as a mobile inventory station, however, so it can be a tremendous tactical asset. The flying vehicles are almost as hard to control as the ground vehicles. The main problem here seems to be that the maneuverability is way down from what it used to be. The controls are sluggish and the cockpits remind me a little of the ring toss game at the carnival. It may take several tries before you eventually wind up in the seat of the damn things and if you jump out of a scout while it's in motion, you die.  I will say that the flying vehicles are much easier to control in third person, though.  The voice chat menus are much improved over the original game. The layout of the various commands and chats is much more intuitive this time around and offers a much broader range of sayings. The command system itself (which is now fully accessible from within your suit) offers a lot more options now, but winds up just being confusing. While it's great to be able to see every single object in the game on your command map, it's not really necessary. You do have the added benefit of being able to observe players and cameras in a small window on the command screen now which is a big help.  None of us are really sure that the new engine is all that better than the first one. It doesn't seem to look that great on most mid-range machines. And if you've got a Voodoo or TNT card, you're pretty much screwed. The frame rates and texture problems I experienced running on a Voodoo 5 5500 made the game almost unplayable. Once I switched out the card for a GeForce2, things ran much better. But why should I be experiencing slowdown in an offline game on a 600MHz machine with 256MB of RAM and a GeForce2, y'know?  The new maps are really great. While we lament the loss of such classic levels are Broadside, Roller Coaster and Ice Ridge, there are plenty of kick-ass levels in the new game. And the variety is a little better as well. New swamp and lava terrains add to the existing temperate, ice and desert sets. Excellent use is made of fog and rain and the spectacular meteor and lightning strikes really heighten the tension. The new bases and other installations are pretty sweet as well. I really like the fact that you can get lost in some of the bases. Many of them extend much farther underground and a few even connect to the enemy base via a network of underground tunnels.  On that same subject, Sierra has finally released the documentation for the mission editor. The map editor as it is is pretty intimidating. Having this documentation in the actual box would've been nice, but at least it's available online now. The intro warns that the doc is a ~work in progress.~ I sure hope so. While it's useful as a reference, it's still has a few shortcomings -- the authors have written under one of the features ~we're not sure what this does either.~ Nice job, guys.  One of the most amazing things promised in Tribes 2 were the new community tools. The front end of the game comes with all sorts of enticing browser and clan management tools that, at the moment, unfortunately don't work at all. The browser is supposed to be the pivot around which the whole community is centered. You can find out information on other players and tribes by searching for their pages. A chat and an internal email feature enable you to keep in touch with your pals and the other members of your tribe. The news section is also supposed to clue players in to particular events. The problem is, none of this stuff works yet, except for the chat and news room. Still, the game itself is up and running and, for the most part it's fairly stable now, so I guess we shouldn't be complaining.  All that said, Tribes 2 is still amazingly fun. We're playing the hell out of it around work and home. If you see Albrecht-IGN, Boognish-IGN, or Fatty McGee-IGN on the servers (or anyone with the IGN at the end of their name for that matter), go easy on 'em -- they're probably just there to take some screenshots.
