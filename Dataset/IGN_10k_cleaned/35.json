Command and Destroy technically might not be the first RTS on the system (Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings says hello) but this one's much more along the lines of the resource management-heavy design that PC gamers have been enjoying for years.    Now, I said it was ~almost~ cause for celebration: despite the development team's effort to essentially steal  oh, let's just say ~borrow~  its design from the successful classics like Command & Conquer, Command and Destroy stumbles as a Nintendo DS game with bad control and even worse gameplay features like the inability to save your progress.   Command and Destroy is not very creative  the title alone (~Destroy~ instead of ~Conquer~) should tell you that. Everything that's in this Nintendo DS real-time strategy game has been done in other RTS titles, but better. The story's completely forgettable and generic (Humans vs. Aliens), the art style just screams ~basement project,~ and the controls are, to be quite blunt, terrible.   The core game mechanics of Command and Destroy are solid enough, but that's only because the developers lift those mechanics out of Command and Destroy. In this game, players pick a side, and use funds earned by mining resources out of the battlefield to build and command an army of troops to eventually annihilate the other side doing the same thing. Everything's done in realtime, hence the ~RT~ in RTS, so the quicker you can work through the interface and tell your troops what to do, the quicker they can get to work and get the job done.   Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but sorry...not a duck.(Duck = Command & Conquer)   A lot of the problems of Command and Destroy are rooted in a simple fact: this game was originally intended as a Game Boy Advance title, but quickly ported to the Nintendo DS when the GBA market dried up. And had this game come out on the Game Boy Advance I think I'd be a little more lenient and accepting to the issues. But the fact of the matter is, the game seems to have been converted with very little thought given to provide Nintendo DS centric elements. The programmers couldn't decide whether to give players the ability to play via the touch screen exclusively or by controlling the cursor using the D-pad so they offered both  but due to sloppy implementation of both you have to constantly swap between the two no matter what.    So yes, you can use the stylus to maneuver the cursor around the overhead perspective. You can quickly select individual troops by tapping on them and telling them where to go by double-tapping on a specific location. You can select multiple troops with a resizable marquee that pops up after holding the stylus on the screen for a second. But then you run into problems. If you try and carefully place a building on the map, the slow movement of the stylus will make the game think you're holding the stylus down for that single second, which will abort the building placement and turn the cursor into that resizable marquee selector. And trying to drop buildings on the map with pin-point precision is next to impossible using the stylus because of the game's  ~double tap~ mechanics: you'll find yourself moving a square off from where you intended more often than not.   And you really can't exclusively use the D-pad because the designers fail to reset the cursor in the middle of the screen. Wherever you last left the cursor with the stylus is where it'll remain if you use the D-pad to scroll it around, which makes it less than functional if it's tucked away in the corner. And when you scroll to the edge of the map, the cursor will shove itself to the edge anyway, forcing you to pull out the stylus to reposition it.    A lot of the problems could have been remedied had the developers decided on one control mechanism over the other. Instead, it's an awkward mess that requires constant swapping of the hands. Other problems include the usual RTS fare of poor pathing and artificial intelligence of soldiers not attacking things right in front of their face, but honestly most problems in this game are due to the awful controls.    The absolute nail in the coffin is the evidence that this was indeed a Game Boy Advance port: password save. Password save on a Nintendo DS game? Did the developers miss the meeting at Nintendo that informed them that all Nintendo DS games would include some form of save technology? I'm guessing the team got the OK to port its GBA game to the DS but didn't get the time and/or budget to remove the password save system out of the project. The result is the clunky and archaic ~jot down the code after each mission~ system, which shouldn't exist nowadays. And the inability to save your game during a mission is a game killer. Sorry guys. In the right hands, real-time strategy and the Nintendo DS could go together like chocolate and peanut butter. But these arent the right hands: Command and Destroy has all the makings of a good RTS, but the awful controls and the even worse save system kill the fun. Even with fixed controls the game would never have been as good as any of the classic PC games, but it certainly would be worth playing. Instead, it ends up a tremendously huge missed opportunity, a big tease to a genre that still has yet to be exploited on the Nintendo DS.", "date": "Mar 17, 2008"}
