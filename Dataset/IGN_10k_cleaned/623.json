Parappa not only integrated music into a game, it wove music and gameplay equally into one. While previous incarnations of ~music games~ reach back to the Genesis (ToeJam and Earl) and the Commodore 64 (Break Street), they didn't push the music envelope as drastically, nor were they solely musical games. Codemasters has approached making music altogether differently on the PlayStation.   In its second effort to bring music to the PlayStation (~Music~ never made it out of the UK), Codemasters has delivered to North America MTV Music Generator, a do-it-yourself, 24-track music making piece of software that has got to be one of the most ingenious ~games~ on the system. It's really more of a program that a game, as it enables you to play, create, edit, and compose songs. Players can now simply assemble their own music, choose from hundreds of pre-recorded sounds, riffs, vocals, drum beats, etc., and lay them down from various several musical libraries.  Having created one, you're hooked like kid in an unlocked candy store.   Gameplay While the core of MTV Music Generator is a music-making program, that isn't the only aspect of the game that's interesting. Music Generator is a fully fleshed out game that enables players to create music videos to complement their songs, play a one- to four-player ~Music Jam,~ and delve deep into music making with special recording, riff splitting, and riff-making abilities that enhance the entire experience.   For those who don't consider themselves musicians, don't worry. Music Generator isn't only for trained musicians. I play the harmonica but can't read music at all (yeah, it's all about the simple blues), and yet I have been enthralled by the simple icon-based riff libraries and the ease with which I can cut and paste riffs into songs.  Creating Your Own Songs The Song Track mode looks complicated but it's not. By pressing the L1, you access the music library, chock full of drum, bass, guitar, keyboard, and vocal clips. The library of sound is massive, and with the exception of the generic and occasionally embarrassing vocal clips, such as Rock's ~1-2-3-4,~ or Vocals' ~Check it out,~ which are so cool they're not, it provides hundreds of possibilities for songs.  Players can choose from several different genres, such as House, Drum N Bass, Beat, Rock, Trance, and Techno. And under each one, are sub-~instruments,~ such as Sound Effects, Percussion, Bass Lines, Melody, Drum Loops, and Vocals, each with a range of choices, from 10-25 selections.   At first, the choices look overbearing. You have to listen to everything to create right song. One big complaint is that each riff has its own load time, which sometimes means hours of searching for the right melody or sound effect. Likewise, there is a limit to the quantity of riffs you can paste into your library. And with a loaded song in the Song Track, you can't instantly switch to Music Jam because the PS's RAM is maxxed out. You have to save or delete the song first to play Music Jam. But, to be fair, this isn't Codemasters fault so much as it is the PlayStation's lack of RAM. Given the system's meager 2 MB bottleneck, Music Generator does a stellar job.   The division of music into genres helps beginners. If you pick a Rock bass line, you should stick with rock vocals, and percussion. Until you get better mixing produces some nasty songs, which I personally have created -- mixing funk and techno isn't pretty 99% of the time.   From the riff library, press X to copy a riff and then X to paste, and you're on your way. A Riff Palette appears at the touch of the R2 button, simplifying your ability to re-use riffs, and a Short-cut technique (Select and X) quickens the pace. Unlike so many manuals that accompany games, players will need to read the Music Generator booklet. Luckily, it's easy to use and drives you right through the basics without a stitch. The manual enables you to walk step-by-step through a song. On the disc are about 20 pre-made songs for you to listen to, or re-assemble, just to get an idea of how to visually lay down a song and what your choices are. Whether you read the manual or not, Codemasters and Jester have thought out numerous ways to get into music making.   The depth of the game comes into play after about 10-15 hours. Once you are familiar and comfortable with creating a song, the next step is slower but more rewarding. First, you can transpose the key of the songs, i.e. change the key. This differentiates the songs from generic death, making them personal. It also, enables musicians to do tricky, subtle changes. Second, you can edit the BPM (beats per minute) track, which speeds or slows down the song. Third, you can increase or decrease reverb and volume. Fourth, you can split riffs and create your own. A new palette opens up for you to create your own riffs, or edit built in ones. This is so engaging that it should take up the rest of your weekend, like it did mine, and decrease your chances of have a social life, like it did mine. Last, you can take samples from your favorite CDs, and then use them as is, or edit or bend them however you choose. These last aspects totally justify MTV Music Generator as a powerful, legitimate music program that rivals far more difficult $1,500-$3,000 products of the same ilk. Of course, this $45.95 product is the only one of its kind on PlayStation.  Video Making Once you create a song, you can assemble a simplistic video to accompany it. Yes, you can direct, too! (Just kidding, really.) I guess this is the ~MTV~ part of the game, a fleshing out of the whole creativity process, but it's just weak. You have access to several elements to make a video that moves ~dances~ with your song. The library is slim, and the final product always looks like a rudimentary fractal program (because that's what it is), the free kind you see on a PC monitor, but it's less pretty, dynamic, and...um, er, well...stony. You can create other little experiments, but they are just that. None are worth saving to memory card. The low resolution doesn't help at all, either. Don't get me wrong, this area is worth a try, but don't expect the same level of depth or fun.  Music Jam Another aspect of the game that's fun -- for about five minutes -- is the Music Jam mode. What is essentially a pre-school demo of the game, Music Jam does take advantage of the multitap, enabling one to four players to take off their ties and high heels and ~jam~ like unbridled hipsters 'til the break of dawn. Ohhh baby!   The screen in this mode resembles the old Simon toy, but it obviously plays differently. Split into four rounded quadrants, each section has color coded buttons (X, O, Triangle, and Square), L and R buttons, and uses the D-pad, too. Players select a sample sound library from five, each with a drum beat or two, a bass line, sound effects and melody. The idea here is to Jam. To create spontaneous music. To get jiggy wit' it. To feel the wind through your hair and sing to the Gods as you fly through the clouds and... Er, yeah, right.   The reality of this mode is much different. Music Jam is a dumbed down demo of the Music Mode. Not only is it terribly limited, but it only really works with two players at most. With more than two players jamming, you unleash the most terrible sounds man has ever heard, all off beat, all repetitive, all dangerous to your ears. If you have a Fischer Price music making toy, your kid would prefer to use that over this. At best, Music Jam mode is a good idea, badly implemented, and with terrifying consequences.   Graphics There's not much to say about the graphics here. It's just not about graphics.   Still, the rudimentary graphics do their job; they make this game easy to use. The entire game is a music-generating program, and at best it's a technical looking songbook. The best aspect is that the song riffs have visual identities. Each time you lay down a riff or vocal, it looks like a small or rectangle or a square with a color, and a little unique icon, like a hammer, skull-like thingy, set of keyboard keys, etc.   The biggest complaint I have is that the video-generating aspect of the game sucks. The movies you make to accompany your songs won't only bring a scowl your friend's face, he'll beat you up for wasting his time.   Sound The whole game is about sound, and I can gladly say it's filled with 3,000 instrument sounds and 1,500 riffs. It's a huge, amazing library of sounds that is almost perfect. My biggest complaint is that the vocals library is embarrassingly bad, and could be entirely replaced, except for the hilarious ~Stabba Cope,~ which I found infinitely hilarious. More Latin beats could have been incorporated, too. My only other complaint here is that many sounds are too quiet, as if they were recorded badly. They're so quiet they fade behind other sounds, and therefore become nearly useless. Skip the Music Jam and the Video Creation parts of MTV Music Generator, they're useless. The real core of this game is an amazing music making program. The video library is massive, and the utilitarian feel and ease of composition is nearly flawless. For the most part the sound effects and beats are great to use and easy to paste into the music score, or to alter. I got a big gas out of sampling music from my favorite albums, and I also had a lot of fun simply listening to different song variations. If Codemasters doesn't send me another copy of this game in the next week, I'm going to go buy it. I highly recommend it.", "date": "Jan 12, 2000"}
