The brand's flagship PS2 title, NFL GameDay 2001, was critically panned across the board and things didn't really get any better with the subsequent releases of NCAA Final Four 2001 and NCAA GameBreaker 2001. Despite the bad track record, our hopes for NHL FaceOff 2001 were quite high simply because we didn't think things could honestly get any worse and 989's hockey series has always been one of its strongest franchises.   Anyway, to cut a long story short, NHL FaceOff 2001 won't do anything to help the deteriorating 989 Sports brand name, as it's another lackluster sports title from the company that helped make the original PlayStation the first choice for sports gamers across the country.   Gameplay  The basic problem with the game is that it lacks a lot of the key features and gameplay technicalities that have become mainstays in the genre since the days of the Sega Genesis. For instance, while the game has all of the basic play modes and options that are completely necessary in a hockey videogame, such as Exhibition, Playoffs and Season modes, and full statistical tracking and roster management capabilities, it only has the bare minimal feature set.   There aren't any sliders to adjust the intricacies of the game, the create-a-player option is overly simple, and only a few things about the game can be customized. You have the obligatory option to adjust stuff like period length, clock speed, and period length and toggle on and off things like offsides, icing, and the like, but don't have the option of playing anything less than a full schedule in season mode and there's nothing even close to a franchise mode.   The game does include a very robust Line Editor that lets players determine the players on the four forward lines, three defensive pairs, two power play lines, two four man penalty kill lines, two three man penalty kill lines, extra attackers and the shootout lineup. It's also quite easy to change either the forward lines or defensive pairs during the game by simply holding down either the R1 or R2 button and then pressing the corresponding face button.   NHL FaceOff 2001 also features the exclusive rights to a bevy of NHL legends and has an enjoyable Shootout mode, but even with this stuff and the detailed line editor, one can't help but think that they're not getting their money's worth from this title in way of gameplay options. While missing a few options here and there can be forgiven if the gameplay is tight, this simply doesn't have the playability to make up for its shortcomings in its feature set.   Player control is very limited, as users only have the ability to do very simple things like speed burst, check and switch players without the puck and just shoot, pass, speed burst and drop the puck when in control of the black disc. The omission of mapping buttons for things like instant spins, dekes, or crazy special moves is completely defensible because those are all things that can be accomplished with the analog stick or digital pad and shouldn't really be handled by a simple button press. However, there's not a valid reason for not giving the player the ability to do something as essential as a poke check.   To make things worse, the computer AI makes the single player game almost completely worthless. On the easy and medium difficulty settings, most players can expect to score an average of 20 goals per game over the course of a season regardless of the team you play as. And while some contests will prove to be tight and competitive on the game's hardest difficulty level, getting 10-plus goal outbursts and shutting out your opponent happens all too often.   Computer defenders like to stand around and leave offensive players standing right in front of the goalie for easy one-timers. The lifeless computer AI also affects the multiplayer game, as close and competitive contests can become infuriating when you give up a goal to a friend because your CPU-controlled teammates offered up no help on defense or your goalie let by too many fluke goals. The human player should be the most significant factor in determining the outcome of the game, but it's never good to be handicapped by stupid artificial intelligence.   The most frustrating thing about all of this is that there's actually a very solid base for a really good hockey game here underneath all of the rubbish. The control is remarkably tight and responsive and it's even arguably better in this particular area than EA Sports' PS2 hockey title. Users are given complete control over the movement of the onscreen player, things like spin moves and dekes can be handled effectively with the control stick and the basic feel of the game is comparable to EA Sports' NHL titles on the Sega Genesis in speed and precision.    Graphics The thing that helps gives the control in FaceOff a slight edge over its competitor from EA is that the game moves at a solid 60 frames per second with absolutely no slowdown during gameplay. Replays are a choppy mess and there's a weird framerate drop when the puck is dropped for face-offs, but none of these problems ever crop up during the flow of the game.   However, the solid framerate is the only good thing that can be said about the game's visuals. Outside of the fully articulated 3D hockey arenas and nice little touches like reflections in the glass, there's nothing here that'll make you believe that the game is running on a system as powerful as the PlayStation 2. The player models are unrealistically proportioned, lack detail and are overly blocky. The general skating animation is good and there are some really nice collision and goalie animations, but the players don't move as realistically as they do in other next-generation hockey titles.   The one saving grace is that the since hockey games are best played from a camera angle that isn't too close to the players or ice, most of the graphical flaws of the game don't prove to be an issue during general gameplay. Players are only forced to take a close look at the horrific player models during face-offs and instant replays. And the good thing about the replays and close-ups is that you're not forced to sit through them like you are in NHL 2001 from EA.   Sound NHL FaceOff 2001's best quality is undoubtedly its play-by-play announcing. The commentary presented by Mike Emrick of the New Jersey Devils and Darren Pang of ESPN is some of the best you'll find in any sports videogame. There's an excellent flow between comments and while they sometimes get behind and mixed up with their calls, it's generally perfectly in tune with the onscreen action.   Likewise, the game has some excellent sound effects and very reactive crowds. The crowds will react to the action on screen and if the home team puts together a flurry of goals or big hits, you can expect the crowd to rock the arena. The only setback in the audio department is the fact that the general sound samples don't seem quite as crisp or engrossing as what was offered in EA's PS2 title. It's as if they're sampled at a lower rate.   I honestly enjoyed playing NHL FaceOff 2001 much more than I ever thought I would. The player control is top-notch and the fact that playing it reminded me a lot of EA Sports' Genesis hockey games is a very good thing. But, the game's horrible AI, limited feature set, lack of a poke-check button, and unsightly visuals, ultimately kills its value. Because of these shortcomings, the single player game pretty uneventful and the appalling AI of your computer-controlled teammates and goalie makes the multiplayer aspect of the title much more frustrating than it ever should be. I honestly could've lived with the shoddy visuals, but the problems with the gameplay are too much to turn a blind eye to. Let's hope for better things next year.", "date": "Feb 7, 2001"}
