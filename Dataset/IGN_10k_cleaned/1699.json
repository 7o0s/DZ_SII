After finally acquiring the Magic: The Gathering license, Acclaim decided to turn the popular card game into a pathetic realtime strategy game that should've remained turn-based.  Unlike the card game, Magic: The Gathering - Battle Mage possesses a generic realtime battle engine in an attempt to make it more appealing to a wider audience. Unfortunately the opposite has happened.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, well, the game is hard. Almost too hard. The AI in Magic: The Gathering - Battle Mage is totally boosted and will either provide you with a challenge or just annoy you to death -- you decide. An example would be when you're trying to summon a monster and the computer opponent is constantly summoning things because he doesn't have to fiddle with a booty player interface.  In a sentence: if you like Magic, save your money for some Tempest expansion packs, because this game ain't worth it.  Jay Boor", "date": "Sep 18, 1997"}
