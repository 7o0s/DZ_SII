Pokmon Pinball has been designed with two types of gamers in mind: those who just can't get enough of those cute little critters, and die-hard video pinball wizards. And you'll easily see that Nintendo has filled both of these nichs nicely.FeaturesTwo pinball machinesFour bonus stagesCatch all 150 PokmonBuilt-in Rumble featureTransfer high scores via IR link Printer supportFor Game Boy or Game Boy ColorIn Pokmon Pinball, one thing is obvious: the design team took the existing pinball engine of Kirby's Pinball Land for the Game Boy, and converted it into another machine altogether. That isn't to say that the game is lacking in features. Far from it  the game is loaded to the top with stuff to do, to find, to uncover. What this means is simply that the game has a familiar feel, and if you've played through Kirby's Pinball Land, you can easily pick up and play this one.In the game, you whack a Pokeball (the unit that captures and holds Pokmon creatures) around a pinball machine that's constructed of Pokmon-related obstacles and structures. There are two machines, Red and Blue, and each machine has its own techiques, challenges, bonus levels, and Pokmon. Yep, the idea in the game is to capture Pokmon. How? Well, each machine has its own way of finding the creatures, but once you find it, it's all a matter of hitting it six times with your Pokeball. They'll appear in the center screen, and if you manage to catch a Pokmon, it'll sit in your built-in Pokedex. Each machine will also give you the ability to evolve captured Pokmon, since some creatures are not out in the wild. What happens when you manage to get all 150 Pokmon? Ah, that's a secret that has to be discovered, and it won't be easy. You'll have to learn exactly how to unearth certain Pokmon, since not all Pokmon can be obtained the same way.Pokmon Pinball is one of the first Game Boy Color cartridges to feature Rumble. The box includes one AAA battery that you install in the oversized, uniquely-sized cartridge. Once installed, every time your ball bumps or nudges into something along the playfield, your system vibrates in your hand  almost like the Rumble Pak for the N64. It's a neat feature, but don't expect it to add to the pinball realism, since a real pinball machine rarely zaps you in the palms.The one thing Kirby's Pinball Land had over this one is stages: instead of the three triple layer screens, Pokmon Pinball has two machines, and the machines are only two screens tall. As you shoot your Pokeball around the playfield, the screen doesn't follow it. Instead, it fades to the next portion of the machine the ball enters  either upper or lower. Pokmon does have a series of extra, one screen bonus stages  four in fact. Kirby's Pinball Land had one per each of the three machines.If you're a fan of Pikachu, crank up those speakers  you'll be greeted with a hearty, digitized ~Piiiiiika!!!~ if the electric mouse saves your ball from going down the drain. Ah, those guys really know how to appease the fans of the series.I love pinball. I love video pinball. I played Kirby's Pinball Land until I beat the end boss (and yes, there was one). While I prefer that one over Pokmon Pinball, this one is still a well-designed pinball game. It's  a great title to just kick back and play for a few sessions, and makes for one of those ~Just one more time~ Game Boy titles. And I've a feeling I'm going to be playing this one until I've caught 'em all. As of this writing, 21 down in my Pokedex...", "date": "Aug 18, 1999"}
