Rocky and Black and Bruised certainly failed to deliver on consoles, but TKO Software thinks it can give up the goods on your handset.  Is Knuckle Up! the heir-apparent to the throne, or should you go back to waiting for Nintendo to finally pull the lead out?  Features: Boxing action Multiple opponents  Knuckle Up! starts out like most boxers, putting you in the ring with a glass-jawed opponent that goes down quick.  As you progress, you'll find yourself facing down a cast of unique characters, such as Mr. Mole, who constantly hides behind his gloves, occasionally peeping up to deliver a painful barrage of body blows.  Control is simple enough.  You push down to guard, left or right to dodge incoming swings.  There are two punches: press up to deliver a sharp jab, or press up to release a massive uppercut that takes a serious chunk off your opponent's health meter, but forces you to wait for a moment before unleashing another blow.  You'll need to watch and learn the tactics of your opponents to determine which punch is the best technique for that particular fight.  For example, when Mr. Mole comes up for his flurry, guard until you see he's done.  You have just a moment to hit him before he ducks back down, so hit him hard with three jabs, then nail him with an uppercut.  And really, that's all there is to Knuckle Up!  Just plow through the small stable of boxers, delivering three knock downs to each one for the victory.  And while it doesn't sound like much, it does manage to be a nice little package of fun for people looking for the perfect five-minute distraction.  (You know, because being alone with your thoughts can be scary.)  The game is visually competent, but nothing terribly special.  You have the feeling the TKO was seriously limited by the capabilites of the phone, and not their imagination, but each boxer looks decidedly different.  The moving background crowd is also pretty impressive considering how little things like that are often cut to ensure a tiny DL footprint.Boxing is one of those sports that is either nailed or completely botched in video games -- there never seems to be a middle ground.  At least, until now.  TKO has managed to craft a fairly decent little bruiser for the handset, and we were pleased with the results of our test run (on the Samsung N400).  It's certainly more satisfying than last month's Lennox match, that's for damn sure.", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
