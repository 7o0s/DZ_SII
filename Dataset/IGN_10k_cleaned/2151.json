It ports its coin-op games from the arcades to the home systems. The idea is great: It makes a fun, instantly easy to pick-up-and-play arcade game that a wide variety of people play and then become fond of, and then Midway brings it to the home systems, for a practically guaranteed sell.   But the recipe doesn't always work. While great titles such as SF Rush, NFL Blitz, and Hydro Thunder paved new roads for Midway, games such as Off-Road Challenge, War Gods, Bio-Freaks, and Mace, among many others, stopped Midway dead in their tracks because those games were horribly disappointing, to put it nicely.   In the last two weeks, Midway has given us the same kind of love-hate bundle, with the loveable Spy Hunter one week, and the miserable Arctic Thunder the next. Arctic Thunder, Midway's latest coin-op translation, wasn't just a game that lost some of its ~thunder~ in the translation, the snowmobile racer was never good in the first place, and now it's worse on PlayStation 2.   Gameplay  Hmm...~gameplay.~ The concept of gameplay in Arctic Thunder is certainly worth examining. What happens in Arctic Thunder is best described with words like ~random,~ ~unintelligent,~ or perhaps ~crazy,~ ~insane,~ or even ~bitch-slapped.~ Yeah, that sounds kind of good, ~Arctic Thunder is kind of bitch-slapped.~   Whatever words you choose to describe this poor example of a game, Arctic Thunder is like entering into an insane asylum of game theory. Players can literally close their eyes and drive forward and wind up in second or third place, or they can keep their eyes open and watch as their fake sense of ~skill~ is thwarted by cheap AI, horrible control, and a poor framerate (I'm just getting warmed up), and then take fourth or fifth place. It really doesn't matter how you play because the result is the same.   There are only a few complaints about the game's port, and while they're not minor, the real problem with Arctic Thunder the PS2 version is Arctic Thunder the arcade version. It was a good idea poorly executed. I mean, I loved the arcade game Hydro Thunder, and the arcade game Arctic Thunder is essentially a carbon copy of that game, with a few things missing. Those missing things just happen to be the best, most important things, though, and Arctic Thunder doesn't benefit in anyway from their absence. Everything from clever course design, compelling jumps and bonus areas, smart short-cuts, and an interesting physics engine are absent in Arctic Thunder, and so the guys at IP, who ported the game to PlayStation, didn't really have too much to work with in the first place.    But that doesn't entirely excuse this shoddy port, either. Arctic Thunder probably looked good on paper, and the PS2 version has lots of unlock and a two-player version, but the port suffers from a bad and inconsistent framerate, a ridiculous trick system, and power-ups that are almost entirely irrelevant to the outcome of the game.   There are dozens of examples, and I'll give you a few. The trick system is automatic, so you're robbed of the fun of pulling off a trick. Second, one of the power-ups (Rooster tail) generates a giant, white rooster tail of snow, which literally blinds you from seeing where you're going. The entire screen is blocked off with white. Not part, not most, but the entire screen. And it's not even a pretty rooster tail. Thankfully, due to the game's own faults, you don't really even need to know where you're going to earn a decent final spot in Arctic Thunder.    Controlling these snowmobiles is entirely unrelated to riding a snowmobile in real life. Yes, I've ridden a snowmobile before, and yes, this is an arcade game, so the vehicles don't have to actually ride much like the real thing, but these things could be gas-powered bananas, mouse turds with engines, or giant crabcakes with treads, it just doesn't matter.   In short, despite the additional power-ups not found in the arcade version, the upgrade shop, and the completely mundane two-player game, Arctic Thunder is very much a flop in every sense of the word. I wish that it weren't so, because I hate panning games, but Arctic Thunder in no way appears to make use of the PlayStation 2's abilities, and it looks far more like an Nintendo 64 game or even a PlayStation game, and it plays just like any bad game. I highly recommend avoiding this game at all costs.   Graphics  Visually, Arctic Thunder disappoints all around. Because your racer is moving around so manically all of the time, with the screen literally exploding in icons, zippy racers, courses that collapse into entirely new ones, colorful icons, and power-ups blasting and flashing at any given moment, the game looks more like a poor imitation of a Jackson Pollock painting than anything else.   What kills the already poor sense of control and speed is the framerate, which causes the game to appear in stutters, mixing fast sections with lots of slowdown. The courses themselves are quite imaginative, however, at least in form. Players constantly find themselves in places they'd never expect, from Washington D.C., to the crotch of a giant monster ape, to underground courses and the insides of buildings.   It's all quite like a wild roller coaster, and in that sense, it's kind of neat. And yet, Arctic Thunder is more like a Ritalin-special for ADD kids. So much is happening on screen at once, it's truly difficult to know what's happening at any given second.   Sound  Just like the visuals in Arctic Thunder, the sound effects are fast, furious, and so cluttered together that it's almost impossible to know what's you're hearing before another sound effect happens to and confuses you again.   The music is very arcade-like. It's got heavy base sounds and thumping drums, and every theme is mixed with little bits of favorite or popular tunes, from old songs to wedding songs. The music is exciting, if not all over the place.After a game like Spy Hunter, Arctic Thunder just looks like Midway made a mistake. They just shouldn't have brought this to anyone's home. If Spy Hunter hadn't ever come out, I'd think that Midway was simply following its old formula and that regardless of whether the game was good or bad, they'd just bring it. Regardless of Spy Hunter, Arctic Thunder all on its own is a poor game, with all of the markings of a bad game, from shoddy control, no skill required, and simply too many things happening on screen simultaneously.  It's clear that whoever made this game wanted to do a little of everything. Unfortunately, they got a game with a little bit of everything, and yet nothing truly compelling at the same time. I don't even recommend this as a rental. Go play Spy Hunter if you really want to play a fun Midway game.", "date": "Oct 5, 2001"}
