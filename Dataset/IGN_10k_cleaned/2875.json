One of the few occasions that I actually sat down and played through a title without ever leaving my space, it was the most satisfying 12 hours I had experienced with my PlayStation 2 to that point. A rousing combination of classic Resident Evil story-telling, eye-popping visual stimulants, and bloody sword-based action, Onimusha: Warlords was the game that convinced me that the PS2 had truly earned my $300 dollars.   If anything, vanquishing the forces of Nobunaga had left me clamoring for more. An open-ended conclusion to be sure, the climax to the adventure of Samanosuke Akechi was screaming follow-up. As there were an abundance of loose ends and questions still lingering after the defeat of the giant demon snake, and a tale that plenty more to say.   And so, with just enough time to let fans of the series catch their breath, Capcom has returned to the lands of ancient Japan to continue its story. Bigger, bloodier, and deeper than its predecessor, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is on many levels the perfect sequel. Evolving beyond the first game in multiple arenas, the gradual transformation from hack and slash adventure to Action-RPG is as seamless as one can hope. Not without its flaws however, a number of curiosities, omissions, and gameplay choices have (like the original), kept Onimusha 2 from transcending its role as a must-have purchase to the status of a legendary hall of famer.   Story  If you wanted to know what happened to Samanosuke after the end of the first game, forget about it. Onimusha 2 follows an all-new hero, Jubei Yagyu. With his likeness based on the late Japanese acting great Masadu Matsura, Jubei is a much more verbal and personable lead character, who develops in far more interesting ways than our pal Samanosuke did. The plot follows a similar pattern as well, with more twists and sub-stories than previously seen.   Set in 1573 (13 years after the events of the first game), Nobunaga has resurfaced and unleashed his demon army onto the populace of Japan. Slaughtering innocents one by one, the ruthless warlord is quickly ensnaring the country with his iron fist. One target in particular, the peaceful Yagyu village and home to Jubei, is where our story begins. Told via fantastic CGI cut scenes, the systematic extermination of the town's citizens is both brutally horrific and cinematically impressive. Eclipsing just about anything out there short of Final Fantasy X, the beginning and subsequent movies are sights to behold.   As Jubei hurries home to find his village in ruins, the plot thickens quickly as he finds himself face to face with a small army of demon warriors. After vanquishing them and following a mysterious ethereal voice to a remote cave, Jubei is introduced to a strange flying woman who tells him of five magical stones. Each one enchanted with a different human virtue, they're the only known tools that can put an end to the demon menace, and stop Nobunaga once and for all. After giving Jubei one of the stones, he sent on his quest to retrieve the others and discover the mysteries that await him.   Keep in mind, that this is only scratching the surface. Overflowing with dialogue, interesting back-stories, and relationships that you didn't think existed, Onimusha 2 is as intriguing as it is action packed. And while I won't reveal further the eventual outcome and direction that the multi-branching storyline that presents the player before all is said and done, let me say this: It's one hell of a ride.   Gameplay  Onimusha 2 is an effective blend of the old and the new. While it still retains many of the previous title's Resident Evil inspired control elements, there's a lot of tweaks and refinements that have been made for the pickier sect of the populace. Though many balancing issues will rear its ugly head before you're finished, chances are you won't mind. But jumping ahead of myself. First, the familiar:   Laid out almost identically to Warlords on the controller face, Jubei moves around with the digital directional pad. The game's biggest limitation and a jump that the Resident Evil series had made several sequels ago, the lack of analog support is a feature I'm still mulling over. Why resort to archaic manipulation devices when you're character is expected to move and react to objects and enemies within a 3D space? A choice I may never fully understand, the directional pad is still more than adequate for veterans of survival horror games and supported with a 180 degree turn button via the shoulder key to prepare for the quick attacks.   The rest of your commands are the same as they were before too. With Square hacking and slashing away at your demon foes while Circle absorbs their souls. Additionally, Triangle uses your magical spells, X uses items, and L1 blocks oncoming attacks. It's all a rather intuitive system and one that I think could have been strengthened even further with analog support, but don't get me started down that path again.   Much like the first Onimusha the captured souls of your fallen opponents act like experience points for your weapons and armor to gain strength and power. An approach that was mastered far too easily in the original game, the soul collecting/experience system in the sequel is just the opposite: it takes too long. Requiring a heap of fallen spirits before powering up your items even halfway to their first level (especially true for armor-type goodies), you can expect to move in and out of rooms for thirty minutes to almost two hours building up your reserve of souls: A necessity so that you can compete with the latter enemies. And while I'm just as big a dungeon crawler as any other RPG veteran out there, finding a more balanced way to approach the need to fight and collect souls should have been considered.   That's not to say that it isn't fun -- because it is. More action than adventure, the hack and slash situations Jubei finds himself in may grow tedious if you're a perfectionist, but are just what the doctor ordered for straight-forward action hounds.   New to the mix is Onimusha 2's item trading system. An RPG spin on the traditional ~talk to so-and-so~ formula, the ability to buy items for use in bartering sessions with Non-Player Characters and supporting folk turns out to be quite entertaining, and just as valuable. So while you may think that giving Ekei a bottle of Vodka isn't so important now, keep trading with the chap and see what happens. It's a wonderful excuse for trying to collect money and items that you'll find throughout your quest, and an even more fun when you give people things they don't need. Some of their reactions are priceless.   Additionally, there are several story-based optional paths that can be opened and traversed based on your actions and performances elsewhere. One of the keys to getting the most out of your game, these optional branches can range anywhere from insignificant plot point, to important special item. Or perhaps even an all-new outlook on one of your closest sub-character pals.   Other improvements are the refined and more intelligent approach to puzzles and brain-benders (which rely more on smarts and good old-fashioned clue-hunting than blind luck and sliding whiz-a-ma-gigs), and a much smoother camera system that creates fewer instances of wall bumping and jitter. Granted, there's still a lot of tightening and tuning that could have been made when it was all said and done, but Onimusha 2 still weighs in as one of the most playable action/adventures around.    Graphics  Are there words enough to describe how marvelous Onimusha 2 really looks? Already established as one of the premiere visual feasts on the PlayStation 2, the first in the series has few equals, much less competition that actually surpasses it. Amazingly, Samurai's Destiny pulls it off with even better looking backgrounds, smoother animations, and a larger variety of special effects.   Of course, the most immediate improvement you'll find is by way of the CG. Hauntingly realistic and better than the last (much to the wonderment of EIC Doug Perry who couldn't get enough of the first game), the beautiful, sometimes provocative, movie shorts are just as impressive as the feature film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Yes, they're that good.   But that shouldn't take away from the brilliant motion-captured animation and well-constructed character models that you'll find throughout the regular gameplay. Detailed, smooth, and overly polygonal, the people and creatures you meet in the world of Onimusha 2 are so strikingly humanoid that you'll almost believe that there are actual little personalities infesting your television screen. In combination with the improved pre-rendered backgrounds and ultra-translucent and bright visual effects, and you've got yourself one of the most ocular experiences this side of Fantavision. Sadly, there's no Widescreen or progressive scan support for us HDTV users -- bummer.   Sound  I really must say that I'm thoroughly disappointed with the finished audio. While the soundtrack is easily on par with the original game in terms of quality and musical variety, the painfully bad vocals detract from what should have been a serious adventure into the macabre side of ancient Japan.   A most appreciated option in the original, the choice between Japanese and English tracks with subtitles was a purists dream come true. In fact, other than a few trial runs for some hearty laughter, I never once moved my voice cursor off the Japanese selection. And other than the nagging problem of the final story point not appearing as text in the final CG cut scene, I was absolutely enthralled with Onimusha: Warlords vocal Shakespeare. If only Capcom would have kept the same philosophy for the sequel.   Unfortunately, they didn't. And what we're left with is one of the worst Japanese to English voiceovers I've heard in an incredibly long time. And while Capcom is usually entertaining with its bad English vocals (the original and memorable Resident Evil springs to mind), the overtones in Samurai's Destiny are just plain awful. Exaggerated accents, William Shatner-like pauses between deliveries, and a long list of other nagging tidbits litter the field like some kind of negative goulash. Why didn't Capcom include the Japanese option for us? It hurts damn it a lot.   As mentioned earlier however, the soundtrack is solid (if not slightly less inspiring than that of the first), and the special effects are good companions. Be it the clank of sword meeting sword, or the bloody slashing sound of tearing flesh, the crisp and clear backup does a great job. But the vocal work is damn near unforgivable.As my predecessor was before me, I too was a tad on the critical side when evaluating Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. The natural tendency of someone in my position who thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of a series, looking for a title's flaws is oftentimes easier to do than finding what's great about it.But that's actually one of the best compliments I can give Capcom's remarkable sequel. As other than the few problems I've mentioned here and there throughout the review, the remainder of the game is simply spectacular. Longer, deeper, and more personal than the original, fans of Warlords, Resident Evil, and the like have their next great adventure right in front of them.I just can't wait until next year when I can finally get my hands on the third (and reportedly final) installment to finish out the trilogy. Hinted at in the finale of Onimusha 2, the final journey to Ancient Japan could be the most intriguing ever. And after playing through and finishing Samurai's Destiny, that's truly saying a lot. We'll find out, soon enough.", "date": "Aug 26, 2002"}
