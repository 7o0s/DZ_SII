But this Alpha Black Zero has very little to do with contemporary thrillers. This story is one of a futuristic elite squad led by Kyle Hardlaw, a man who's been accused of treason. You lead Hardlaw and his team through a variety of missions in a squad-based action format.  Given the popularity of the first-person shooter genre, it's always interesting to see action games that take place in third-person. In the case of Alpha Black Zero the third person perspective doesn't really add much to the game. All it does it highlight the awkward animations showing the character moving in a constant crouch, regardless of his stance, and sliding around on the environment. It also shows off the clunky camera system that bumps your view around whenever you get up against a boundary.  Most of the futuristic weapons are quite effective. Sure, they make a little pop when you shoot them, but they're very deadly despite that. In combination, the large assault guns and sniper rifles are useful for your support teams. It lets them take on opponents at a multitude of ranges. Your own high-tech rifle gives you the versatility to fill in where and how you need to. I was a bit disappointed that the basic pistol was so deadly. Where the assault rifles bounce around like crazy when you shoot, the pistol has absolutely no recoil whatsoever. Even if this is explained in the context of the game world, it seems really unbalanced.  Before each mission you can select to outfit your squad for stealthy or aggressive play. Unfortunately, the stealth/aggression axis in the game is a bit of an illusion in many of the missions. A better distinction could be made by assigning kits based on long-range or close-quarters combat or slow or fast movement. You won't see the type of stealth action here you might expect from games like Hitman or Rainbow Six. Instead you'll either go from chokepoint to chokepoint taking out a parade of enemies, or merely hang back and defend an area from enemies approaching from all sides.  The missions tend to get a bit monotonous and, for my taste, are overly long. To my way of thinking, the first mission in any game should be short and sweet -- something to get your head in the right place and introduce the basics of gameplay. The large marathon missions in Alpha Black Zero should be placed towards the middle or end of the game rather than at the beginning.  The AI does get better throughout the game (to better model the increasingly sophisticated nature of your enemies) but, even at the highest level, they're not overly challenging. The later ones' behavior is a long way from the ~rush headlong into the fire~ tactics of the game's early enemies but it's still predictable in its own way.   Friendly AI seems a little more reliable but that's mostly because your squadmates rely on you to lead them into dangerous areas. When you have them beside you in combat, they prove to be very reliable and can take out enemies nearly as quickly as you can. I wish they'd show some initiative when the squad reaches a crate that offers resupply and healing. They're also absolutely terrible at finding their way around anything more complicated than a tree so you'll often have to backtrack to lead them around small snags.  But that's assuming you know where you're going to begin with. Many of the levels in Alpha Black Zero are so large that you can quickly become confused, particularly since the mini-map doesn't show terrain features. Thankfully there are lots of narrow corridors that keep you from diverting from the mission path. It frustrates me though that the corridors and paths twist and turn so much that you may have to head away from an objective in order to reach it. It's just confusing.  Graphically, Alpha Black Zero is pretty average. The textures used on the terrains and structures is relatively bland and, though some of the interiors have a real lived-in look, there's not enough going on the outer environments to provide much excitement or interest. I mean, you can only walk through so many featureless canyons before it starts to drive you a little crazy.  Character models are much better, particularly in the cutscenes. The work on the faces and animations here is much higher than you'll find when you're actually playing the game. Animations are relatively bland and not terribly varied. You just don't get a sense that any of the objects in the environment are interacting with each other. For forty bucks, Alpha Black Zero isn't terrible. It just isn't very entertaining. For that price (or cheaper) you can pick up any of a number of shooters that are both better looking and more fun. Alpha Black Zero has a lot of potential but the execution falls short of being good. What we're left with is a game that's frustrating because it seems like it could have been much better with a bit more polish and more comprehensible missions.", "date": "Aug 28, 2004"}
