Well, according to their theme song they do.  The Power Puff Girls have proven time and time again that they can survive as a girls cartoon in a boys' dominated market.  The main reason is they appeal to boys as well as girls.  But the question I have now is will this series make a good videogame for the PlayStation?  And even more, can you make a good 3D game out of a cartoon that is stylized in 2D?  BAM! Entertainment and Vis/Asylum sure think so.   While Professor Utonium was mixing ingredients for the perfect little girls, sugar, spice, and everything nice, he accidentally added the mysterious chemical X, and thus the Power Puff Girls were born!  Using their powers to fight crime and defend the city, the Power Puff Girls fight Mojo Jojo, an evil little monkey with a colossal cranium bent on taking over the world.  The team consists of Blossom, the brains and leader of the girls, Bubbles, the cute and innocent one of the bunch, and Buttercup, the tough buff brawler.  As the Power Puff Girls set their pie on the windowsill to cool, Mojo Jojo and the other goons of Townsville steal it.  Now this is no ordinary pie, no, this is a pie made with Chemical X!  Not knowing what that mischievous monkey will do with the power, the Girls take off to stop him.  Gameplay At the game's start, you're able to pick from any three of the Power Puff Girls, Blossom, Bubbles, or Buttercup with the goal to defeat a series of enemies in very small rooms.  Scattered throughout the rooms are various boxes, lamps, and chairs that you can toss at your opponent to inflict damage.  (Can you say, Power Stone, anyone?)  When you hit the other character with a hurled item a Chemical X Beaker will fly from him.  When you start each level you have one beaker and your opponent has one beaker.  Searching the level you will discover a third beaker.  Collecting all three enables you to use your super laser eyes.  (OK, wait a minute.  Did I forget to mention Power Stone?)  You can also punch, kick, and fly (well, sort of...) to send the enemy into a world of hurt. I'm being thorough to prove a point (which I'll get to soon enough).  Needless to say, the first problem on the long laundry list of problems, is that the levels are terribly confining.  They're small and there's not much going on.  You run around in this little room waiting for objects to appear and every level is basically the same just in a different location.  The mayor's office has a couple chairs, a globe, and a desk, whereas the school has a couple desks, a dollhouse, and a chair.  The objects are different but their purpose, to hurl at your enemy, are all the same. If you thought Powerstone was confining, these rooms are even smaller.   Second on my list: The characters are slow. Very slow. Actually, I should say the characters you get to pick, are very, very, very slow.  Even when you fly, you just sort of hover at the same speed.  Your enemies, on the other hand, seem to bounce around where ever they please.  I also found when picking up items, the opponents would either pick up an item faster than me or kick the item in my face!  When trying to kick the enemy's item in their face, I found it impossible, for every time I got close enough, the enemy would use his lightning quick reflexes to bash me with a box!  Every time!  The enemies seemed to have a really high priority over me in every way.  They could pick up objects faster, punch faster than me, and when jumping, dive faster than me.  They could do everything faster than me!!  It's just unfair I tell you.  Each enemy you defeat is then unlocked in two-player simulator mode.  Two player mode is basically a one-on-one fight between you and a friend, with all of the characters and levels from the story mode. So, if you wish to play this mode and are willing to lose your friend for even suggesting to play this game, have fun!  Characters Now that I've told you how much fun I've had with this game (If you don't feel the sarcasm, believe me it's there).  You probably want to know who's in it.  I'll just give you the rundown of characters in two player mode because the enemies are not selectable in story mode.  Blossom Bubbles Buttercup Mojo Jojo Him Ace Big Billy Fuzzy Lumpkins Seduca Princess Morbucks   Graphics The game looks bad. Very bad. When you have a 2D stylized cartoon, wouldn't it make sense to make a 2D game?  I make an effort to play all sorts of 2D games; 2D does not make a game bad.  I can still play my Super Nintendo and Genesis and have fun.  Now, the early 3D PlayStation games are another story.  And that's what Power Puff Girls reminds me of, an early 3D PlayStation game.  The polygons are big and jaggy, there are many places where the character moves through graphic errors, and it hurts my eyes. Badly. Very badly.   The cutscenes made me cry.  This is a 2D stylized cartoon!  Why would you render 3D characters for cutscenes?!  Yet they do, and it looks horrible.  It makes you wonder why they didn't just simply digitize the cartoon in, for the cutscenes.  And what's worse is it isn't even cell-shaded (Cell shaded is a 3D technique to make the characters look cartoony, i.e. Jet Grind Radio for the Dreamcast or Harvest Moon for the PS2). It's this hybrid 2D on 3D that just looks bad.  Sound The sound is probably the only saving grace.  The voices are great.  The voice actors are the same ones that they use in the cartoon.  Beating up ~Him~ and hearing ~Him~ scream is just music to my ears (I hate that villain.  Something about him rubs me the wrong way.)  And the music just drives you to kick Mojo Jojo's butt for snatching your pie all over his mountain lair. (OK, I admit, that sounds bad.)This game is a travesty.  It reminds me of Power Stone if you were to combine it with... well something really, really bad.  In Power Stone you could pick up swords, guns, or sit in turrets and blast your enemies away.  In Power Puff Girls you can pick up stuff and chuck it at your enemies and... Pick up stuff and chuck it at your enemies... I loved that cartoon!  Playing this game leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  This game is bad.  If you like the Power Puff Girls and you buy this game you will be very disappointed.  The fact that it was Power Puff Girls was the only reason why I trudged on to finally beat this game.  So parents, shy away from this one, lest you wish for a very un-Merry Christmas, and watch your children cry as they curse Santa and throw their PlayStations across the room.  I love the holidays.", "date": "Nov 30, 2001"}
