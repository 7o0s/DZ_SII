You can afford it. Despite any of the shortcomings in this otherwise exciting racer, you'll probably be thrilled just to do these kinds of dangerous things with the car you own. However, we know most of you can barely afford car insurance (if you can even drive yet), let alone a new videogame, so there are some things to consider regarding the latest addition to the venerable Need for Speed franchise. It has all the expensive foreign cars, the huge tracks, the thrill of the chase, and everything you'd expect from EA's reliable racer. In fact, it's an arcade driving experience we recommend checking out, but if you're picky about racers, and we're sure you are, it's by no means perfect. Learn before you burn those tires, led-foots.  Features15 pumping songs from the EA Trax library, including hits from Uncle Kracker, Bush, Rush, The Humble Brothers and othersGameplay Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 builds on the time-honored tradition of playing ~cops and robbers.~ You come screeching hot out of the auto stables with your latest toy, and take on the attitude of total disregard for the law, as well as danger. Imagine racing along side a Porsche, Viper, Jaguar and Aston Martin in your BMW M5, taking to the twisting roads of the Mediterranean or the wrapping around highways that run through tropical settings. Meanwhile, the law -- cops, the fuzz, whatever you label them -- is after you at every turn. It's your job to outrun and outthink them with pure speed and meticulous driving skills. Choosing from over 20 different exotic, erotic, enchanting cars (which cannot be damaged, possibly due to licensing agreements), you'll find the gameplay dynamic is always a little different, ranging from trying to pull away in a bulky, to high top speed vehicle to trying to keep control in the quick, but erratic muscle cars. This mode is called Hot Pursuit, and it's the core single player experience, taking you through 33 different events.   It takes the basic concept of arcade racing, and throws in the relentless intensity of being chased down by police cars. How exactly do they stop you if you have a never-ending supply of gas, a sports car, and a led foot? These are no ordinary cops. Equipped with equally as speedy automobiles and the ability to team up, they're fully capable of bringing you to a stop. A blue meter is displayed at the top of your screen and indicates how close you are to losing them. Like a fuel tank going on empty, the police will opt to let you go out of respect for public safety and self-endangerment if you keep up the high-speed pursuit long enough. There's always another cop around a corner, though, so you're never completely free. The goal is to finish the predetermined amount of laps, like any racer. It's not just a simple chase with lights in your rear window, either. These police will use brute force to take you down. This includes ramming into your tail-end to spin you out of control, in addition to teaming up with other cop cars for road blocks. They will pull ahead in front of you, sandwich you in, and even throw down the spiked chains if need be. Fortunately, when they do get so drastic to slash your tires, you are able to intercept it over the radio, which tips you off as to where it will happen. This gives you a chance to avoid it, naturally, whether that be by shortcut or ramming through the parked police vehicles that attempt to funnel you into the tire-slicing roadway.   This mode is extremely entertaining, and the vehicles combined with the branching track designs really bring it all together. Each of the 33 high-speed events predetermines a selection of vehicles, lap count, and occasionally multi-track races. This means the CPU is at a level playing field with you, outside of the fact that it will know the track layout by heart. It's a superb racing environment, where tracks are miles and miles long -- sometimes 15 miles -- and you must find the best paths, treat your car right, fight with opponent racers that crowd the tracks, and fend off cops. Speaking of which, every car handles nicely. They all have a very heavy feel to them, so at first it feels unresponsive, but with enough practice you realize it's a taste of simulation on top of the arcade action.  imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Fneedforspeedgc_092702_bev1.jpg&caption=%3Ccenter%3E%3Csmall%3EThe+cars+and+body+reflections+are+very+pretty.%3C%2Fsmall%3E%3C%2Fcenter%3E That's a very important aspect to consider if Hot Pursuit 2 sounds interesting to you. You can lose control of your vehicle fairly easily, be slowed quickly by scraping against road walls, and be sent tumbling along if you hit oncoming traffic. Traffic AI is nothing special, but it will react to your path (or opponent's path) and attempt to get out of your way. If you do happen to lose it and know the competition is going to blow past you, there's always the option to resent your vehicle facing in the correct direction, but you can only do it three times per race. Overall, there's a lot going on to keep the Hot Pursuit 2 experience a cut above average racers.   There are other modes, too. If you tire of the constant interference from police, you can still race the lavish vehicles in a completely different series of 33 Championship events. It's a simple fact: racing these fine foreign automobiles is okay in almost any setting. So, you can enjoy pure racing if that's your style, and get all the same rewards of indulging in these lovely automobiles. Beyond those two main modes, there is also Quick Race, which is a quick, randomly generated race, where you won't know the track, vehicle, laps, or opposition. If you want more control over your joyriding, there is Single Challenge mode. This is totally customizable from tip to toe; choose lap count, police presence, CPU vehicles, track, and basically everything you'd want. It's really a handful of modes in one, as it offers up Free Run, Be A Cop, two-player, and the unique Lap Knockout, where the last place driver is arrested each lap.   For the most part, it's got just about everything you'd want expect for one major exception. You can't ~Be A Cop~ and chase down a friend in two-player mode. It's a rather shocking exclusion, but perhaps the developer could come up with a good dynamic for it. After all, the police are at a distinct disadvantage in every race. Naturally, though, it's a big disappointment that it's missing. Potentially a monster addition to replay value, we believe it could have been included with enough work. Why not set up a race where the cop player can continually switches to new checkpoints where he/she gets another opportunity to stop their opponent? Include the same ability to call in CPU team cops that would help stop the violator. Make it parallel a hit point based or high score fighting games in design, perhaps. Its lacking presence is very damaging to the two-player value. The ability to race across huge tracks in extravagant, six-figure value vehicles is amusing, but playing ~cops and robbers~ would be the most important addition that needs to be made. On that note, two-player is also hindered by a downgrade in visual detail, which further detracts from the two-player worth.   All said and done, the Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 package is a pretty tight one. It has a robust selection of tracks, which have multiple layouts and shortcuts, exotic cars, and a very healthy dose of modes. On the unlockable side of things, single-player Hot Pursuit or Championship will reward you with cash, which you can use to purchase the very expensive vehicles and different tracks for Single Challenge. Ever wanted to drive a Dodge Viper police car or the incredible Mercedes Benz CLK GTR? Earn enough cash and you can anytime you want.  It all sounds too good to be true, right? A well-balanced, thrilling racer with a huge garage of awesome vehicles, varying control mechanics, and large-scale tracks has hit GameCube without any major flaws? Unfortunately, like a spiked chain to rubber tires, Hot Pursuit 2 has an ironic need for speed, as the action takes place at a sluggish pace on GameCube. We don't have a problem with the weighty feeling of the vehicles, but when they're topping out at speeds of 170, it doesn't feel like it. Part of this is inherent to the design, but a very large problem we can point our finger at is the framerate, which is unacceptable.   Considering that speed is a major component to the series, it's not easily overlooked. Having said that, Hot Pursuit 2 still offers up a splendid racing experience but it is beset by the sluggish pace of the races. It had its chance to be a must-have racer on GameCube, but the lack of velocity is a major wound to that possibility. Fans of arcade racing should consider a buy, because, let's face it, these cars are amazing, but if you're not as passionate about the Ford TS50 as the next guy and can wait for another GCN racer to come along next year, just stick to renting it.  Graphics The most stand-out visual element in Hot Pursuit 2 is most certainly the beautiful car models, which have been painstakingly recreated from fender to fender to resemble the real life version. The environments around it attractively bounce off the shiny paint to give it a believable look, and inside you'll find an animated driver, shifting and steering, accurate seating, and all the extras rendered in real-time. Because it's impossible to see all of these cars up close in real life for most people, the developer has done a wonderful job to bring it as close to home as possible with great models.   It's good that this much detail has been put into cars. However, not as much can be said about the blurrily textured tracks. Ranging from colorful fall tracks, laced with vivid oranges, reds, and purples from changing tree leaves, to the more creative tracks that wrap around active volcanoes, the textures just don't do the art vision justice. The result is a clash between the ultra pristine luxury vehicles and Vaseline-coated environments. It's true that there are some high-res textures on these very large tracks, but the end result just isn't as good as it could have been.  imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Fneedforspeedgc_092702_bev2.jpg&caption=%3Ccenter%3E%3Csmall%3ENFS%3A+HP2+is+pretty+at+moments%2C+but+not+perfect.%3C%2Fsmall%3E%3C%2Fcenter%3E All said and done, the truth is that the textures, draw distance, and lighting are fairly acceptable. The main problem, above all, is the horrible framerate. After seeing the previously released Burnout locked at 60 frames per second with tons of traffic on the road, the often sub-30 frames per second offered up by Hot Pursuit 2 is intolerable. As the name of the franchise indicates, this should feel like a lightning quick game, but it doesn't. It occasionally gets bad enough that you do lose track of the road, or miss a shortcut.   Combined with a lack of widescreen support and progressive scan for HDTV users, we can't say we're especially impressed. Overall, it's an average offering by GameCube standards, where the car models are by far the most eye-pleasing element.  Sound Different engine sounds for many of the cars, which produces a nice sense of shifting into higher gears, while screeching tires, metal-on-metal scrapes, and that classic siren sound come from the exterior. Great job overall, but there's a lack of surround depth, even for stereo, but especially Dolby supporters that just doesn't come across.   Fortunately, Electronic Arts draws on its Trax library for a big selection of tunes you'll probably blast over the action. Whether its the techno beats of The Humble Brothers, the rock guitars of Rush, or the kick-back alternative buzz of Bush, there's something for everyone. We look forward to seeing more of what EA has stored in the Trax library. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 brings the best of both worlds -- simulation-meets-arcade controls and pure thrill ride, out-of-control racing. The lavish, untouchable cars (by paupers such as myself) are plentiful, and, thus, kept me pushing forward to test them out and earn enough cash to try the ones I haven't driven in. And, just in general, I love the dynamics that throwing a chase into the middle of an already intense race produces. There's no doubt that this is a hot racer that EA has crafted.Unfortunately, as noted in the review, the sluggish feel to it and terrible framerate for GameCube is a huge drawback. I absolutely loved Criterion's Burnout because it was so quick at 60 frames per second; I thought my heart was going to explode. It, too, is a highly respectable arcade racer, even if very different in style Need for Speed. So, while I appreciate the car and track diversity in Hot Pursuit 2, the sluggish pace of it and sticky framerate heavily detract from the overall experience, which doesn't bode well for the two-player value either. Absolutely rent this one, don't pass it up. If you absolutely can't wait for the next racer to come along on GameCube, definitely consider this one. There's a lot to sink your teeth into.", "date": "Sep 27, 2002"}
