THQ went to Mobious Entertainment for the Game Boy Advance version of this racing design that originally hit the PlayStation 2 and PC, and that development team really went to town producing a game that seriously pushes a stunning presentation and impressive 3D polygonal engine on the GBA hardware. The racing itself is a bit lacking due to loose controls and the admittedly basic visuals, but it scores points for the developers insistence of going above and beyond for a ~kiddy~ racing game. Features Eighteen racers Eighteen tracks Track and drag racing Cartridge save Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  Drome Racers are another toy spin-off of the Lego brand where kids can create and race special vehicles in its own little universe. THQ's Drome Racers for the Game Boy Advance is based entirely in this world, where players race and customize more than a dozen different vehicles on eighteen different tracks. It's the standard racing fare where players attempt to come in first during the race to score enough points that'll let them advance through the ranks in all the different championship cups. Between races, players can also head into the unique ~dragster~ races to see how well they can keep a straight line and shift without redlining; the designers definitely looked at the classic 2600 Dragster for this mini-game.  Drome Racer's real claim to fame is in its 3D engine. Mobious is previously known for its work on 3DO's High Heat Baseball series as well as the yet-to-be-released Sound of Thunder, games that have limited, but effective polygonal engines. Drome Racer's in-game graphics are almost entirely polygonal. More correctly, its tracks and environments are 3D with the vehicles and track objects rendered as 2D sprites. The result is a game that shares a similar look to Sega's own Virtua Racer; and even though many developers have been pushing texture-mapped and raycasting, Doom-style engines on the handheld, Mobious' engine still manages to impress since it manages to keep the action smooth and fast. The engine isn't used to its fullest potential, since players can't freely hop into and out of the vehicle's cockpit, nor does it give players the ability to view multi-angled replays of the action...features that are pretty much the norm in 3D racers. But it's a very good start, and it would be worth, say, Sega or Midway's time to poach these guys for GBA versions of Virtua Racing or the Hard Drivin' series.  But even though they're pretty impressive in motion, it's also the game's simplistic visuals that affect the playability of Drome Racers. Since the track layouts feature low-color, angular geometry, they're tough to follow when the roadways twist and turn and flow over hills; it's occasionally very difficult to immediately tell road from barrier. And while players have the ability to upgrade their vehicles to stronger, faster, and more controllable racers, even with these enhancements in place, the racing feels a little bit on the ~loose~ side. And collision detection with power-ups has to be absolutely spot-on; if you miss a weapon or speed boost by even a pixel, it won't register. The mushy controls don't help here, that's for sure.  But everything else in Drome Racers screams quality. The cartridge features a battery save that not only records progress and vehicle settings after upgrades, but it also saves the best times on each track. And when players link up in four-player races, these best times can even overwrite what's been recorded on the other cartridges in the network chain...with the proper name, of course. The designers even go to the extreme with an energetic menu system that pushes the GBA's sprite handling abilities.  The only thing truly missing in the design is a recorded ghost racer during the time trial modes on each of the tracks.  3D is definitely not a new thing on the Game Boy Advance, but Mobius still manages to get the ~ooh, neat~ factor into its development in the GBA version of Drome Racers. The controls could be tighter and the collision detection a bit more forgiving, but overall this racer is a pleasant surprise; it definitely exceeds the expectations for a THQ-published Lego racing game on the handheld.", "date": "Jul 31, 2003"}
