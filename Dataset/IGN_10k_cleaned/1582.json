Well, I really don't know and the chances are that neither does your kid. For those of you that are in the same boat, Mort is the hero of a game developed by AndNow for Crave Entertainment that is intended for a younger gaming audience. The game's story revolves around Mort, a chicken with super powers, who must save baby chicks that have been kidnapped by mysterious creatures from another planet.   Gameplay There's definitely not anything wrong with making a kids game with a cheesy storyline and setting and you definitely can't blame the developers for not making the game too complex. It's a game for kids and the general goal for a game of this type is create something that will appeal to a younger audience, which a big, bug-eyed chicken might in fact do. The problem with this game is that it has poor control and some horrible camera angle problems that will likely frustrate a younger gamer much more than any of its assets would please them.   While the game does have plenty of different power-ups, some cool and some not, some well-designed levels, and puzzles that have been balanced nicely with the younger gamer in mind, it's just not enough to keep the game from being a completely unpleasant gaming experience for gamers of all ages, whether young or old.    Graphics It seems that if you're making a kids game nowadays that it just can't be that good looking. Mort the Chicken falls into this grouping perfectly as it has a horrible frame rate, poor polygonal models, low-quality textures, plenty of clipping, and lots and lots of ugly little glitches. The game's a poor excuse for a PlayStation game and there's nothing really much else to be said.   Sound Filled with plenty of chirps, clucks and other chicken-sounds, Mort's audio and musical soundtrack is perfect for a game that's all about chickens. However, just because its style is perfect for the game doesn't mean that it's any good. The voices are poorly done, the background gets annoying as hell after just a single level and the audio is just generally unimportant, uninspiring, and unappealing. I was once told in response to a complaint about a game's framerate that the framerate for the game didn't matter because it was a children's game. Apparently, if a game is aimed at younger gamers, that it doesn't need to be any good -- it just needs a kid-oriented license and some cute characters. This belief is a complete farce and just one look at the long list of games that Nintendo has developed over the years shows that you can create a game for kids that has depth, character and solid gameplay.", "date": "Dec 2, 2000"}
