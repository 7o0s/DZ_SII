Funny cartoony little games are much fewer and far between on the PC nowadays. While there are a share of those cartoony style games set in 2D landscapes, you'll have to look pretty hard to find more than a couple that take advantage of the third dimension to really bring colorful and silly worlds to life. Not only does the Sting do this fairly well, but it also provides some interesting gameplay where you get to organize heists and burgle all kinds of places under pressure of being caught and thrown back in jail. And for a first experience with planning burglaries, it was a really good time even though some control issues and slightly retarded AI get in the way of a completely smooth experience.  The Sting is being published in North America by the up and coming European publisher JoWood and developed by NEO. It follows the exploits of a bit of an anti-hero named Matt Tucker. He grew up on the streets and learned to fend for himself as a filtch and robber. Over the years, he developed quite the reputation as a thief. Unfortunately for him, the police took notice of him as well and caught him. On the positive side of things, Matt had his mentor on the outside ready for him to be released back into the free world. He was set up with a crappy little place to plan new schemes from along with a crappy little car with which to flee the scenes of his crimes. The city has changed a bit since his incarceration so that a citywide curfew has been installed, the crime scene has been knocked down a bit and people in general are just a bit tense.   It's up to you, as Matt, to rise back up into the upper echelon of the burgling world and burgle the city 'till it can't be burgled anymore. Burgle. Sorry, I just love that word. In order to climb the crime ladder again, you'll need to start small until your reputation grows back up a bit so that you can find partners with which to organize some bigger heists.  You'll find these people and all of your marks around the city in various locations. The entire game is centered in this one city which is rendered in full 3D with a very distinctively cartoony feel. All of the buildings, characters, cars, and objects have that slightly warped look that the Cartoon Cartoons on the Cartoon Network all seem to have adopted. While the result isn't the prettiest thing you'll ever see, especially when you zoom in on some of the objects and characters, it certainly does the job it was planned for with alacrity. The art holds a lot of personality along with the layout of this crazy city that looks to have been planned by a mental patient. There's no real rhyme or reason to the design here except to make the city look like nothing you would see in the real world. There is just some weird stuff here that reminds me a little of those creepy cities from City of Lost Children and Dark City. It's very gloomy here even with the bright colors. But it also gives you the feeling that things aren't so happy-go-lucky around the old digs.  Gameplay is broken into a couple of distinct sections. First off there is the adventure part of the game that has you wandering the city looking for accomplices and lets you scope out your targets by looking in windows before you actually tackle the projects. You can wander pretty much anywhere in the city except for locked doors that aren't attached to possible burglary locations. I'm not too sad about this, as there are a lot of buildings in the city that would have been a pain in the ass to wander through. As it is, I thought that maybe there was a little too much travel across the city as it was. Thank god for the taxies that made their way through the city to get you places faster.  The other part of the game is the planning and execution of heists. It's a pretty simple and complicated task all at the same time. It's simple due to the ease of setting up your crew and actually giving them commands, but complicated in terms of timing and getting everything right. To start off your plan, you'll need to get back to your hotel room, which doubles as your headquarters. From there you can pick your target (more will open up as you finish other projects), choose a getaway vehicle, pick any accomplices you might need, and equip your team with tools.  As you complete crimes and fence off stolen materials, you'll be able to buy more equipment to pull off more jobs and bigger getaway vehicles so that you can carry more weight. All of your team, their tools, and their loot, will weigh something. Both people and cars can only carry so much, so you'll have to plan wisely who you want to tag along with you on jobs. You should also plan well because each extra accomplice you take with you (you can take up to three) will take a piece of the action for his or her self, leaving you with less money.   After you have all of that stuff set up, you can go into planning mode. This transports you to the crime scene and lets you plan your moves step by step. A bar sits at the bottom of the screen like you might find on a camcorder. You'll find record, stop, fast forward, step skip, play, and jump to end and beginning buttons. All you need to do is select the character you want to move or complete a task, hit the record button and give a task. You'll see a little timer running on the left as well showing the timing of the job. Once that character completes the task, the timer will stop and everything will pause until a new command is given. During this planning phase, you'll be able to rewind and change plans for each of the characters individually as well in case you accidentally run into the sight path of a guard or set off an alarm or something. You can switch between characters at any time you would like and give them orders as well. If you rewind the time and give a different character orders from the beginning of the plan, you will see any characters that you have already given plans to run through their assignments as you go so that you can give each their assignments one at a time.  Each of the characters will have different skills than one another as well, so there's a good chance you'll have to bring a few different characters along to speed things up. Bring one lockpick to open doors and desks quickly, a safe cracker to open those hard to get into safes, and an alarm specialist to knock out those pesky alarms that might be guarding more prized possessions. Each of these characters will also have to be equipped with the right tools for their jobs before they enter the planning stage.  My main beef with this part of the game comes from the inability to give more than one character orders at the same time. Having to go back and make all of the individuals walk somewhere one at a time is more than a little annoying, especially considering the camera is attached to each of them so you can't just click on an area that's far away and expect them to eventually get there. You have to follow them along while they walk in order to give more orders. Pathfinding AI was downright strange at points as well with characters trying to walk through locked doors when the one that has been picked is two feet away and they both go to the same room. Even stranger when they don't go to the same room and they try to go somewhere altogether different then where you told them. For the most part, pathfinding is okay, but there are definitely quirks that gave me some fits.  Once you finish your plan, you exit out, save it and then start the plan to see if it worked. During this process, you can speed up the action with the fast forward slider, but otherwise this section is out of your control. You watch your crooks go about their business, just as you planned through the various floors of the buildings while switching between characters to watch what they're doing. If one of your characters is seen, sets off an alarm, did too much damage to a window or door so that it was noticed, stole something that was discovered to be stolen before a getaway was made... you fail. Strangely enough, there is really no penalty for failing, which is my biggest problem in the game. There is really no reason not to just go through with trial and error until you complete a burglary perfectly except for your own desire to try to get it done right on the first try. Consequently, it does tend to be a little hard to care whether you actually do it right. If you do screw up, you can just jump back into the edit plan and fix the problem as your plan is saved still.  But even with these little mishaps, The Sting really was a refreshingly fun game for me to sink my teeth into. While it certainly isn't going to appeal to everyone for its emphasis on planning instead of action, those with a thing for puzzle-like games will probably get a kick out of it. It definitely has charm. In a gaming world filled with clones, it's fun to see a game like this pop out of the woodworks every now and again.   -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
