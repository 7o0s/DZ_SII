The Expansion Pack offers some new roller coasters, attractions, scenarios, and other enhancements.  The original game had a pretty complete roster of coasters, so as you might expect, the new coasters in the Expansion Pack are very specific: the ~Wooden Side-Friction~ coaster, ~Vertical Drop~ coaster, or the ~Steel Twister~ coaster.  They basically vary from the originals versions by allowing steeper banking and tighter turns.  The ~New Rides and Attractions~ selection menu offers little hints on the features, foibles or gotchas of both the new and existing rides.  The side friction wooden coaster keeps launching cars into the air if the hills you design are too ambitious or if the car goes too fast.  The first scenario in the expansion pack makes for a physics problem as you build one of these coasters on the side of a cliff.  I was frustrated (and, okay, I admit it, secretly delighted) when cars full of people would be launched in the ocean even after extensive yellow light testing.  The main thing that disappoints is that the featured new roller coaster of the level is already built for you in the opening scenarios, leaving you to build bathrooms and hire janitors while you save up to build your own first coaster in the park.    The one feature I was most excited by is very simple.  The Roller Coaster Construction menu adds a new, more gradual angle that the tracks can turn at, even for the older coasters from the original game.  It basically lets you ditch the North/East/South/West track directions and have tracks that travel diagonally across the grid landscape.  Although, of course, you have to shell out more cash from your theme park's budget to cut down a lot more trees and level a lot more ground to lay those diagonal tracks, but what's a few dollars compared to the perfect coaster you can charge $5 a head for?  Additionally there are new slow rides and attractions, which provide a little more variety.  I always think of these as candy, to snack on between roller coasters.  They're not really the meat of the game, of course, but sort of obligatory for an expansion pack. If you're tired of the haunted house, you can build a crooked house instead.  None of the new slow attractions I've see so far moves or makes sounds or has any neat bells and whistles that make placing them really gratifying.  I suppose it was easy for the designers to throw in a couple more still attractions to flesh out the offering.  The new scary landscaping items (skeletons and bony hands to adorn the paths and gardens) pleased me a great deal, though. The new ~banner sign~ landscaping item, meant to be placed over paths is another small touch the Expansion Pack adds.  Ostensibly to subdivide your park into ~Happyland~ and ~Sadland~ and ~Futureland~ and such, the best thing about it is you can make it a ~Do Not Enter~ sign, and keep visitors from wandering too far in mostly empty parks with large networks of foot paths.  It's exactly what you want to cut down on customers complaining about being lost or bored.  Otherwise, the banner signs are basically the same as the marquis signs on the ride entrances.  Still it's another place to slip bad words and dirty jokes into your theme park to entertain yourself while you wait for the money to roll in to fund your next big coaster. The footpath menu also changed to a drop down style for colors and textures, which disoriented me briefly, but is otherwise pretty neutral compared to the old menu.  The Expansion Pack does let you build balloon stalls that sell other color balloons besides blue.  A very small point, I concede, but something that I wanted to do on the original game and couldn't.  For that matter, queuing lines also now come in a choice of four designer colors.  You can also use the new Alternate Color Schemes and paintbrush in the individual ride menus to select parts of your coaster to follow a different color scheme from the rest of the ride.  I can finally make my ~Ride the White Tiger~ coaster in alternating black and white stripes.  Again, not a hideous oversight in the original game, but, hey, the devil's in the details.    If you're in the thick of hours of RollerCoaster Tycoon, and think you still have hours more to go, the Expansion Pack adds some nice functionality and some interesting scenarios, and gives you a little more license to build complex coasters, all at a low low price.  Old saved games, and the original game's scenarios are all still playable from the Expansion Pack.  The old scenarios just appear in the list in the ~New Game~ menu under the new ones.  Otherwise, the Corkscrew Follies Pack adds some nice perks, but is basically not a really substantively different from the fun of the original.  -- Fergus Poole", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
