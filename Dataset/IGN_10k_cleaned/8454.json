In fact, fans of the original Shadowgates on the NES and PC will get a great nostalgia kick from roaming around the old castle using the N64 controller but anyone looking for a new adventure that takes full advantage of the N64's capabilities may be a little disappointed.   You're cast in the role of Del, a halfling that finds himself locked up just as the game begins. Your mission is to escape and travel around Castle Shadowgate solving mysteries and puzzles that lead to bigger and better puzzles and mysteries. Shadowgate will have a very familiar flavor to it for anyone that dabbled in the previous games and you will need all of those problem solving wits about you to get through this one as well. We guessed that there have got to be some parts and clues from the old games that would help us get through this version, but since we sucked so bad at the old NES version we couldn't tell you which ones those are.  Sharp eyes and a creatively warped mind will be your best friends as you proceed through S64. Be prepared to examine every part of every room right from the get go, because there will always be something that'll you'll overlook. It goes without saying that you pickup anything and everything that's not tied down or, in a few cases, magically bound to another object.  Gameplay The game plays almost exactly like the old NES version. You spend the majority of your time walking down hallways and pathways and advancing to different parts of the castle once you figure out how in the hell they come up with such frustrating obstacles and puzzles. It's a slow moving first person observer with action and adventure popping up periodically.  At times Shadowgate64 gets so lonely that we find ourselves wishing for a Pigcop or even an Imp, not to kill mind you, but to be friends with and keep us company. Anything to break up the monotony of condemned-castle exploring. What a sad day it is when you don't feel the urge to blow away a videogame bad guy.   Reading is an important part of S64. If you're illiterate or otherwise afraid of the written word then there's not much for you in this game. The variety of books, memos and important pieces of paper  scattered around the castle make you wonder why the hell a powerful wizard like Lakmir, the proprietor of the castle, can't conjure up a maid or something to keep the place tidy. You will assemble quite a collection of easy to find books that will give you all kinds of insight into the science, history and politics of the strange world of Kal Torin. All of this written information will have clues, some more obvious than others, about how to advance through the castle.  Next to the books, the odd assortment of items and junk you pick up will all be used at some point in your adventure. Of course these items may not be used in the most conventional or obvious manner. A pickaxe, while normally a pretty useful tool or weapon is also a great way to climb a wall. Again this is great stuff for Shadowgate/puzzle fans but for the alien/zombie killer in all of us, it'll seem very strange to have so little @ss-kicking in this first person 3D world. We're not kidding when we say that one of the most action packed moments early on in the game comes when you walk into a room and a giant table tips over onto its side. Wheeeee.  The puzzles get abstract early on. We like the one where you're faced with a shelf that has three statue holders. The first two are empty and the third one has a statue of normal looking man. You check your inventory (which is so huge, you must be storing this stuff in a parallel universe) and what's this? You happen to have a statue of both a primitive man and a an apeman!! ~No problem~ you think, ~I know that theory of evolution where man descended from apelike creatures so I'll just put 'em in order in my own little evolutionary model!~ You will be flabbergasted to find out that this is  not how it's supposed to be done in this game. As you curse the game's logic and begin searching for the nearest anthropology book, you'll realize that this is Shadowgate and the game has it's own universe of logic that may or may not be the same as that found in our world. Get used to this. If you like to be intellectually challenged by your videogames, the Trials of the Four Towers will have you questioning the value of your education.  Graphics: Shadowgate 64 has it very easy over some other first person style games since there are no weapons or gangs of enemies to draw on screen like you would have in GoldenEye, for example. But the textures on the walls and doors are simply done and repeat themselves throughout the levels. Picking up objects leads to a sequence where the object floats towards you, growing into a giant pixelated object as it gets closer to you. A little animation here would've helped and it couldn't take much to have a nice polished object that stays more in focus as it moves. There are no lighting effects except for an overall darkening of the screen when you're in a room with poor light.   There are only a few characters to interact with in the game, so it would've been nice if we could've gotten more animation out of them. A ghost that really looks creepy and moves like a disembodied spirit, whatever that would look like, could've been a real boost to the game. Instead, we have to face minimally animated apparitions that fade in and out to offer threats and words of warning and advice.  Sound  A nice way to put it would be to say that the game's sound is appropriate for the game. A meaner, and much more satisfying way would be to say the sound is as devoid of life as the graphics and gameplay. You will hear the pitter patter of footsteps and the creak of great old wooden doors as you open them but after that there's just not to much sound to be heard. It's not that the sound isn't done well, there just isn't anything in this game to make cool noises. The jingling of keys or the flapping of pages sound very accurate but it's not anything that'll make you crank up the stereo system so you can get the full effect. The background music lends itself to castle exploring with its whole mystic mandolins and eery lyres. It changes depending on the section of the castle  you're in and it can be a good way to keep track of where you are since the hallways can get a little confusing sometimes.Shadowgate64 is quite simply Shadowgate for the N64. It stays very true to the concepts behind the original games which in this case may be bad thing because of the breadth of today's videogame marketplace. Extreme puzzle fans and diehard Shadowgate fans will love the N64 version of the classic braintwister, but for the rest of us, RPGs have developed so much in the last few years that there's no reason to sacrifice action for great problem solving elements. We can't tell you how frustrating it was having neither the @ss kicking guns nor worthless bad guys to blow away as we patrolled the hallways of castle Shadowgate with our controllers set on Turok-style, perfect for destruction. With the addition of Shadowgate64 to the library, the Big N is still very short on its quota for RPGs.", "date": "Jun 10, 1999"}
