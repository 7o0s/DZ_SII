This is not a game that is friendly to the novice - and I'm by no means a shooter virgin. Between figuring out what the dozens of HUD symbols meant, finding out where the hell I was supposed to be and struggling with the extremely high pace of the action, I spent the first few hours as a pin cushion for enemy bullets. It was only after a good three or four hours that things began to fall into place, and I started to see how this game has carved out a very distinctive niche in the crowded team-based shooter genre. And yet it was only after a few hours of play time that I also started to noticed the one major issue I have with the game.   First things first though. There's no way to avoid the similarity between this game and Battlefield 2142. They're both sci-fi team-based shooters, with two sides going head to head over large battlegrounds. ETQW spices up this winning formula by focusing on objective-based level design. Instead of the teams fighting over meaningless capture points as in Battlefield, each ETQW level is comprised of a series of linear objectives. It could be destroying a shield generator or hacking a control grid, but regardless of the objective, the result is the same - the battle remains focused on a single point on the map. It also gives meaning to your cause, as opposed to battling to the death over a small counter in the top right of the screen. There are usually a couple of smaller side objectives, but these only have a minor influence on the flow of the fight. Ninety percent of the players, on both the attacking and defending sides, will all be pounding away at the same scrap of land. Once an objective has fallen, it's on to the next one, with the spawn points for both sides shifting to reflect the movement of the battle.   Due to the large draw distance, sniping is very effective.  This has both a positive and negative effect on the gameplay. The plus is that it keeps the action intense, countering the game's relatively low 24 player limit (it doesn't appear this limit is hard-coded though, as I've seen 32-player servers in the browser). But it can also lead to major stalemates - if the defenders act as a team, it can seem impossible to break through their line.    It's for this reason that teamplay is absolutely crucial, especially when you're on the offensive side. There's very little room for lone wolf gameplay here - act as part of the collective and you'll be far more likely to crack the objective. Go and snipe on your own and watch as your team falters from the loss of manpower. Which begs the question - if teamplay is so important, where's the VOIP support? It's due in a forthcoming patch, but this is a game that demanded VOIP right off the bat. To compensate for this, the game includes one of the most comprehensive selections of pre-recorded messages I've seen. Sadly, the sheer number of these messages results in a voice system that is as unwieldy as it is diverse. Having to hit mouse button three, then 5, then 1, just to report an enemy infantry unit, is a sure fire way of winding up on the wrong end of a rail gun.    Thankfully the initially confusing HUD and radar help to alleviate this problem. The myriad of symbols soon start to make sense, and you'll know where you need to give medical attention or where a friendly airstrike is about to vaporise a large chunk of the enemy's trenches. There's also a rudimentary fire-team system, which groups players up into distinct groups, but without voice I haven't seen anybody actually bother to use it.   It all looks great... until something explodes in all its 2D glory.  Another major point of difference with ETQW is its support classes. It's commonplace for the engineer class in shooters to be able to build turrets, but the range of toys to build in ETQW goes one step further. In fact, there are so many deployables that they're spread over two classes - one class focuses on defensive, the other on offensive. It adds an almost RTS-like element to the game, and makes the support classes some of the most valuable. It's especially crucial to utilise their abilities when the action is outdoors - without the use of their support structures the opposing team will steamroll through your side like a tank through a garden shed.   Speaking of tanks, vehicles also play an important role, though to a much lesser extent than in BF2142. Both air and ground vehicles can deliver a hefty punch, but this is balanced nicely by their being vulnerable to enemy turrets and missiles. A few cleverly placed anti-vehicle turrets and a rocket launcher or two will quickly rid the air (and ground) of any armoured threats. They're quite tricky to handle, and if you really want to throw them around you'll need to enable advanced handling in the options menu. This ups the difficulty even more, but rewards you with increased manoeuvrability.    As is the norm with online shooters, a persistent ranking structure is in place, but it's an odd one. While you do rank up and earn medals over time, in-game rewards (such as new weapons and boosts to abilities such as sprinting) are only temporary. They'll last for a full campaign, which is three maps linked together over a series of three matches, but after that they're gone. All that hard work for nothin'. I can understand that this helps to keep all players balanced, but it also removes the 'must play more' factor of unlocking new toys.     A healthy selection of twelve maps is included with the game, offering up a nice serving of variety. Using id's vaunted MegaTexture technology, they're quite vast in their size, so you'll still be exploring their nooks and crannies for months to come. The draw distance is phenomenal, with very little of the fogging that Battlefield players have learnt to live with. This leads to longer range duels, but the canny map makers have included plenty of cover to ensure snipers don't dominate. As the maps are built around objectives, their vast size doesn't mean you'll ever be lost in the wilderness with a marathon ahead of you - there's always a spawn point close to where your assault rifle needs to be. At first their sheer size can be a little overwhelming, but you'll soon figure out where to go. While they're mostly pleasing to the eye, compared to up and comers like Crysis and COD4 the lack of vegetation is quite jarring - there's a weed here or there but nothing to excite a Tasmanian lumberjack.   The rest of the visuals are also up to scratch, especially in the character design. The Strogg stand out as being some of the coolest baddies yet seen in a shooter - their cybernetic mixture of flesh and metal is chilling. The GDF aren't quite as impressive, with quite a generic Halo-esque design, but small touches like a visible HUD on the recon class's helmets show off the character model's attention to detail. Their animations don't show the same level of polish though. The transition between each is rudimentary at best. There's none of the smooth blending from running, to crouching, to jumping that we've come to expect - instead the animations jump between each other in a very jerky manner.   Somebody get the Mortein - the bugs are big this summer.  From afar vehicles are suitably sexy, but up close they look like they've been carved from a large block of clay, rather than pieced together from hundreds of separate bits of metal. It's obviously a limitation of the engine technology, as the vehicles in Doom 3 also had this same weird look. But where the graphics engine totally falls flat is in one area that is so important - explosions. For a game that has so many massive blasts, it baffles the mind to see the use of an old-school 2D sprite effect whenever a large explosion takes place. It really detracts from the overall look of the game, as explosions are a commonplace effect. Every time something goes up in (2D) flames, you'll be checking the graphics options to see if there's a setting you've accidentally turned down to low.   The sound effects are also a disappointment. Gaming guns are meant to sound like howitzers going off in a large cave, but in ETQW they're as underwhelming as they are repetitive. The GDF weapons in particular sound like pea-shooters rather than high-tech tools of destruction.    So there are a couple of issues with the game's presentation, but it's mostly acceptable. And there's no denying the fresh feel of the combat - it's high paced, with a movement speed closer to Quake 3 than Battlefield. After the first hour of confusion, the game really started to grow on me. The objective system gave real purpose to the battles, and the Strogg freaked the crap out of me. But then I noticed what is, to me, the biggest issue of all.   The way the game feels.   Character models are simply stunning.  It's hard to put into words what this sensation is like, and why it's such an issue, but here goes. To put it simply, when you're running around in ETQW, it feels like you're skating across the surface of the world. Look at other players and they too appear to be sliding around, as if the world was made of ice and had low gravity. It lacks the solid, real feeling of other shooters - it's as if the players aren't really a part of the environment. It's even worse with the ground vehicles, which don't convey the sensation of weight that they should.   Making matters worse, the movement tracking in the game seems a little bit wonky. Regardless of how good my ping was, and which server I was playing on, every few seconds other players and vehicles would slightly warp, as if there was lag occurring. It's definitely not an ISP issue on my end - the Team Fortress 2 Beta, Battlefield and countless other shooters run absolutely smooth, and without issue. The problem is compounded in close range fights - trying to score a melee kill on a moving player is an exercise in frustration.   It's something that isn't immediately apparent when you first play the game - you'll be too busy figuring out where to go, what class to use and how not to end up as meat in the Strogg machine. But the more I played it, the more this disconnected feeling bugged me. Fingers crossed it's a patchable issue, but judging by the experience of the beta, where this also occurred, I'm not holding my breath. I could be totally wrong here, but it's a similar problem I've seen in other online games that have such large draw distances. Could it be that the trade off of tracking so many entities over such a large area is a decrease in precision and accuracy at closer range? Bring on the thousand and one emails from programmers explaining how I couldn't be any more incorrect   By the way - if you don't have a decent broadband connection at home, this is not the game for you. While bot support is included, this is first and foremost an online shooter. The bots are great for familiarising yourself with the lay of the land - and in this game the levels are huge - but bots pale into comparison when playing with fellow organic life forms.   Team-based shooter fans will feel like theyre slipping on a familiar glove when playing ETQW, yet the rolling objectives give the game a fresh feel unique to the genre. Its true to the Quake universe, and the Strogg are some of the nastiest bad guys yet seen in a videogame. The pace of the game is exponentially faster than most other shooters of this nature, and the presentation (other than the explosions and sound effects) is top shelf.ETQW does so many things right that its a tragedy the handling is so unsatisfying. Thankfully the developers are some of the most responsive in the business, so Im holding out hope that the ice-skating handling gets tuned. If it wasnt for this issue, Id have no hesitation in adding another point to the score, but its such a crucial element to the game that it simply cant be overlooked.", "date": "Oct 2, 2007"}
