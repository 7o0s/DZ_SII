That's exactly what Konami's doing, as it's moved into the extreme arena with ESPN, and created its own take on the thrashing sport in X Games Skateboarding.  But despite the company's efforts to capture the energy of the sport, the Game Boy Advance version is not an alternative to Activision's skater...not by a longshot. Features Eight pros Halfpipe and skatepark modes Free mode and competitions Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  The skatepark in this game is, obviously, an afterthought. It's nowhere near as complete as Tony Hawk on the GBA, as it uses two perspectives to pull off the gameplay -- players skate around an overhead view of a skatepark, and when the skater reaches a fun box, quarterpipe or halfpipe, the game switches clumsily from this view to the standard side-on view...creating havoc with the player since there's a definite pause between the two viewpoints.  It's like the developers created a really tight halfpipe engine, and realized 3/4 of the way through development that they actually need something more than that to compete with the likes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. There's a definite line drawn between what's fun and what sucks in X Games Skateboarding, and anything beyond the halfpipe engine sucks.  Which is a shame, because the halfpipe portion of X Games Skateboarding is like a rebirth of the excellent skating portion of California Games on the Atari Lynx handheld, sans zooming camera and the Lynx's ability to play four players on the same pipe. It's actually a lot of fun zipping up and down the slope, performing proper stunts off the platform through button and controller combinations...there's a whole library of moves to pull off (42 of them in all), but most are of the airborne style. Not every character has access to every move, and that's where the competition comes into play -- perform well against your peers, and you'll earn credits which you can use to purchase new moves. Character animations are also well done, as it seems that Konami videotaped real players and rotoscoped their moves into the game. The result is a series of smooth 2D sprites that link together in your combinations. They're not as silky as Tony Hawk's polygonal character models, but they get the job done...especially since they don't have to be modeled at every conceivable camera angle.  Each character has his own skating attributes, and to build up his abilities, you'll need to enter the cool but strange X-Rage mode. Here, you have to pull off tricks to fill up the X-Rage meter, which unlocks a coin on the halfpipe. Grab the coin, and you're thrust into the heavens, where your challenge is to pull off a 10 move combo after which gems will fall back down to the halfpipe for you to collect. Grab enough jewels of a color and you'll increase that skater's abilities in either speed, jump or balance (three different colors).  But buying this game for the halfpipe is like ordering a large pizza just to eat the toppings  -- the package as a whole is what's being reviewed...and unfortunately this game can't come anywhere near the brilliance that is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the handheld. Granted, the X Games halfpipe is a lot more user friendly in its side-scrolling environment,  but Tony Hawk's overall design is the game's brilliant charm. With its sloppily designed skatepark environments, X Games just doesn't come close. What this game does have is presentation. Right on boot-up, you're flooded with flashy graphics and explosive energy...even when pulling off a trick you get nailed with wacky animations of each move's official name. But what X Games Skateboarding doesn't have is the same playability of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the handheld -- and if you're going to compete, you need to see what the competition is doing. This Game Boy Advance version makes no attempt to provide an experience even close to what's offered by Activision on the system -- which is odd, since the PlayStation 2 editions try to mimic the Hawk's gameplay as close as it can. The GBA game is a fun halfpipe minigame, but it's on the lame side as an overall package.", "date": "Sep 27, 2001"}
