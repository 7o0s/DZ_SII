Now that the iron curtain between Nintendo and Square has been lifted, fans finally have a chance to explore the Final Fantasy universe on GameCube -- although it might not be in the way they expected. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles doesn't contain any of the Final Fantasy staples. There isn't a detailed story arch, there aren't any full motion video sequences, there isn't a deep experience/upgrade system, and you won't find a wide variety of magic spells. In fact, the only reason this game can get away with being called a Final Fantasy game is because there are a few recognizable items and creatures, and it shares the franchise's quality music and artwork.   But, even though this isn't a true Final Fantasy, this hack n' slash spin off isn't without merit. Game Designer's Studios and Square-Enix have done an admirable job of trying to make this more than a simple melee run through dungeons. There's a huge emphasis on teamwork, whether it's as simple as healing each other's wounds, working together to unleash a devastating magic attack, or solving puzzles. The magic and experience system has been reinvented -- and there's finally an admirable use of the GBA/GCN connectivity, which allows you to mange items without pausing the game. Is it perfect? No. Is it a Fantasy worth playing? Read on.   The Facts:   Travel through a Final Fantasy inspired world  Hack n' slash styled gameplay  Up to four player cooperative play  GameCube/Game Boy Advance connectivity  Progressive Scan Compatible  22 blocks of memory   Gameplay  Crystal Chronicles throws you into the midst of a troubled land. The world has been polluted by a toxin called miasma -- its very touch is lethal. Before the miasma was able to wipe out all life, it was discovered that certain crystals had the ability to repel the toxin and allow life to continue its struggle. However, these crystals (which have been erected in the center of towns) will fail unless they are replenished each  year by a substance called myrrh. Each town must send out a caravan of young adventurers to obtain myrrh -- as one of your town's youths, your role is to lead its crystal caravan and save the townsfolk for another year.

Your task, although noble, boils down to five years of fighting through dungeons, defeating bosses, and collecting precious drops of myrrh. This simple format is applied to most aspects of the game, whether it be combat, magic, experience, or the story. FFCC shows very little of its RPG pedigree and instead focuses almost entirely on action elements.   When you embark on your quest, your caravan appears on the world map. This is where you decide which dungeons to tackle and what towns to shop in. However, while you're given the illusion of freedom to roam as you please, your progression is completely linear. This is due to the world's division into five sections by miasma streams that can only be passed once you've obtained the correct element by defeating a boss -- effectively trapping you in a given region.   The world map is also where you encounter random cut scenes (instead of random battles). These are the only story building elements besides for the introduction and brief chats in town. Sadly, most of these contain no more information than another caravan wishes you good luck on your journey -- and you're likely to encounter the same scene multiple times. FFCC even injects ~story~ into the game at the end of each year by recounting everything you just played through. This also comes with the requisite dance scene reminiscent of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi -- fortunately these can be skipped. It's really sad how little time was spent developing story or characters, especially from a company renowned for its story telling.     While the spartan plot elements might not be a compelling reason to play through the game, at least there's lots of combat to be had. For the most part, the gameplay concept is well thought out, but in actual practice it can prove to be a trial of patience.  You'll fight through 14 dungeons, all seemingly different. The environments are diverse, whether it's a marsh, mushroom forest, or a desert, and all have their own breed of enemies. Some are obnoxiously long, and its all too easy to get lost in them for an hour, while others are fairly short. There's a decent mixture of both length and design, but they all feel strangely similar -- primarily because of the limited nature of the combat, enemies that behave in the same way, and simple puzzle elements (primarily switches).    To coincide with the ever present miasma, whenever you enter a dungeon one character is forced to carry a crystal chalice that will keep the party alive as long as it stays within a certain radius. This is one of the most irksome elements of the game because in multiplayer whoever has the chalice is severely slowed down and can't fight or pick up items unless the chalice is dropped (which keeps the entire group from moving forward). The single player has it a bit easier because a  moogle carries the chalice for you (but it comes with its own set of troubles). In both cases, this circle of life seems like it's there solely to annoy you. Theoretically, the chalice adds difficulty to the multiplayer game, makes sure there's communication, and that players won't try to wander off on their own. However, even with the best communication, somewhere during your journey someone will get stuck behind an unseen obstacle, you won't be able to avoid some attacks, or through camera tomfoolery you'll lose the chalice altogether. Fortunately for multiplayer, Square-Enix did build in a nifty feature  -- whenever a player is in GBA mode, he'll automatically be dragged along the edge of the circle.   Your combat options are limited by the nature of the GBA as a controller. You can do two things, pickup/drop an item or perform an action. Actions, like use item, attack, defend, or magic, must first be assigned to a command slot and then they can be selected with the L or R triggers. If you're curing someone and then want to attack, you have to scroll through all your actions until you find the appropriate one before hitting the action button. It seems straightforward, but it makes defend useless because you never have enough time to toggle it before you're hit -- you'd have better luck running away. This also causes a lot of accidental item use from forgetfulness or neglect. While it's the best way to solve the button shortage -- it's not effective. Especially when single player is confined to the same short comings instead of mapping actions to different buttons on the GCN controller.   Unlike other games, your magic skill set is reset every time you enter a dungeon. Had fire and blizzard in the mushroom forest? They've magically disappeared when you enter the mines. This means you have to wait until an enemy drops cure magicite before regaining that precious spell. While there are limited magic types, FFCC deserves credit for allowing you to fuse multiple types together to create new spells. These can either be more powerful forms of preexisting types (fire + fire = fira) or an entirely new spell (blizzard + life = holy). While fusing these within your command list uses up those limited slots, those playing with multiple people can create the same spell fusion by unleashing fire at the same time. It's a great way to force teamwork out of players, especially because they'd otherwise have to switch spells after killing every enemy (like you do in the single player game.)   The experience system is handled in a bizarre and unfair way. Unlike other games where you gain experience by killing enemies, FFCC gives you a bonus task at the beginning of each level. These range from the ~cause physical damage~ or ~cause spell damage~ to the hard like ~spell fusion,~ ~don't heal,~ or ~don't pick up items.~  You're awarded points corresponding to how well you performed the task -- whoever has the most points has first pick at the attribute enhancing artifacts found throughout the dungeon. If you didn't find enough artifacts to go around or the last person already upgraded with the only artifact left -- he gets no experience. At first it seems funny, but after the same player is repeatedly screwed over by impossible tasks -- you realize that system is flawed.   The most surprising thing that FFCC got right is the difficulty curve. When you're still trying to figure out the controls, the dungeons are laughably easy. By the time you've figured out how to mix gravity and have spell fusion timing down, the dungeons are brutally hard. The difficulty has even been successfully weighted according to the number of players.   Multiplayer Vs. Single Player  There really  is little debate in this matter -- the only way to truly enjoy FFCC is by playing with friends. Regardless of the inclusion of single player, the game wasn't meant to be enjoyed any other way. Besides for the almost obscene GBA requirement and the clunky controls that result, FFCC is a fun, if not an incredibly deep, multiplayer game. Like other hack n' slash titles, it can get monotonous and once you figure out how to kill enemies it can be really easy (especially if there is always someone ready to heal or bring you back to life). However, being able to strategize with your friends about spell fusion, tactics, and the frustration of a certain boss is really the redeeming factor of FFCC. Most of the play mechanics are built around it -- whether it's the different maps all four are randomly assigned at the beginning of each dungeon, the combined effort to bring down a boss, the spell all need to cast in order to open a door, or the self sacrifice one makes to grab a key lying outside the protective bubble while the others stand on a switch.     That said, the pace of the game is slow, even with multiple people. It takes a while to get into the game, but the game grows with you over time. The circle of life is the most prominent problem. Not only because you're likely to kill one of your comrades during your adventure in a chalice related incident, but your group is slowed down to a crawl -- which means you can't run out of the way of powerful spells. There's also the problem of the camera, which can't be controlled. Normally your view is so zoomed in that the circle takes up most of the screen. If you're walking near an edge, you can be attacked by unseen foes.  This becomes more of a problem when you're fighting bosses because they can walk between the camera and you (so you can't see yourself) or the circle. This problem escalates if the chalice carrier gets hit because the chalice is instantly dropped -- and the boss is able to kick it wherever it pleases (which changes the circle location), usually resulting in an unseen death.    Two to three players seems to be the magic FFCC number because there are enough people so that you don't have to rely on the moogle's sporadic attempts to help you and there aren't too many people that it gets overly confusing. Four people just seems too crowded, especially with the camera angle so close to your party.   Single player seems like a last minute addition to FFCC, and is no where near as enjoyable. It usually borders on not even being fun. As a single player, there are usually far too many enemies for you to take on by yourself . You'll do a lot of running away, especially since enemies take an unusually long time to kill (even with four people) and will return to their start location once you reach a certain distance. Even facing two enemies can be daunting due to the time it takes to cast magic. Boss battles are even more bothersome, because some have an insane amount of HP that really requires at least two people to kill it within a reasonable amount of time. Solo also means that there isn't the fun that the mass chaos of four people running around brings to boss fights. Dodge the attack, strike, wait, and repeat. While impressive, bosses are so set to an attack pattern (as are most enemies) that the only challenge in defeating them is that of patience.   A few other things hint that this isn't a single player game. Besides the controls, the ~experience~ system works the same way (you're even ranked -- and always win). The puzzles are also clearly designed for multiple people. You'll often die trying to reach a key outside the circle of life while the chalice rests on a switch, have to be hit by an enemy attack to set off a switch, or be stuck trying to get your your moogle to cooperate with you.   Overall, the adventure lasts around 14 hours in single player if you don't revisit dungeons. Multiplayer, although easier, lasts a little longer because of the increased time spent in towns and the general indecisiveness of four players.   Graphics  Although FFCC doesn't have any of the trademark FMV sequences, the graphics are stunning in their own way. Everything from the character models, water, environments, to the particle effects are excellently done. What's even more amazing is that the cut scenes (though few they may be) are all running off the game's engine. Most likely the zoomed in camera that can be so troublesome to gameplay is there to show off all the detailed texture work, lighting, and shadowing. Wait until you're treated to your image refracted in one of the giant crystals, the miasma particles floating around your circle of life, or the particles cast by your spells -- it's simply amazing. The first time you see your character's reflection rippling in  a stream or gleaming off the side of a chalice, you realize that regardless of what flaws the game might carry -- nothing mars the graphical style.   FFCC truly is a testament to what kind of graphics the GameCube is capable of, should developers exploit the hardware. And, for those lucky enough to own a HDTV, FFCC runs in progressive scan.   Sound  This is another area where Final Fantasy has traditionally shined. The musical score, while you'll too often be reminded of  a renaissance fair, fits perfectly with the artwork and world. The only complaint is that tracks are repeated too often -- the world map and town themes are always the same. Also, similar themes run throughout most pieces, which makes the score meld into one piece instead of recognizable parts. More variation would have been nice, but it works well with the game.    In terms of effects, not much is noticeable in dungeons besides the clang of weapons or the casting of spells, when you're walking through towns you'll hear your feet tread against wood or dirt. In the distance, you can hear cows mooing or the murmur of water. For the type of game, it's surprising to find such small details, albeit few, in the aural experience.     In terms of voice work, there's very little. Cut scenes and conversations with townsfolk all take place with word bubbles. The only time you're likely to hear voices is during the introduction to each dungeon where a spooky Galadriel-like voice tells you a random tale about the location.   Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is a game that I wanted to like a lot more than I did. I was excited for it, connectivity and all, but something feels a little off. I don't know whether it's the lack of cohesive storyline, or that the gameplay elements were so surprisingly simple. Poor controls also plagued my enjoyment. I never used defend once -- it would have been helpful, but it's not practical. While there's several nitpicky things, like being killed by the camera, the big problem is that this isn't any different than any of the other hack n' slash titles on the market. It has high production values, connectivity, and the Final Fantasy name attached to it, but other than that nothing stands out. If this were to be rated solely on the single player experience, the score would be much lower, but fortunately multiplayer, flaws and all, is fun. Although I firmly believe this title could have worked without the use of GBAs had it followed a control scheme similar to Heroes, I appreciate the effort put into actually making the GBAs in some way integral. Their use is likely to breed more teamwork in multiplayer than usual because while adjusting items, your teammates need to defend you. Also, only one person has the terrain map, it's his job to successfully lead you through the dungeon. Even other elements, like spell fusion and the annoying chalice, breed teamwork, which is really important to a cooperative game. The single player experience is no where near the same -- and for many reasons (mainly boredom) is very average.Was FFCC hurt by being affiliated with Final Fantasy? Probably. Even though it's not an RPG, there are still elements, like story, that are expected from Square. Even so, if you take away the stellar visuals and audio, there really isn't anything that would make this title stand out from Heroes or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance besides for connectivity. The bottom line is that Crystal Chronicles is a fun multiplayer game if you own enough GBAs. There are some problems, more than I'd like to see from Square, but overall it's a fun experience. The single player game, on the other hand, isn't nearly as fun.", "date": "Jan 31, 2004"}
