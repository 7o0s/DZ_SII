As many of you might already know if you've played Worms 3D or any of the 2D Worms games of the past, the point of the game is to strategically position your of cute cartoon worms and annihilate the enemy team through the use of over-the-top weaponry. Eliminating your foes can occur by directly damaging them with weapons, knocking them into bodies of water, or triggering some of the environmental pitfalls like land mines and poisonous barrels.   Just like in Worms 3D, players will find a substantial amount of single player content in Mayhem. In addition to a tutorial, the game features a challenge mode and a story mode. In the challenge mode players will be able to participate in various mini games like sniping or shotgunning targets. As you beat one you'll unlock the next, though these can get old rather quickly since they're somewhat repetitive. You'll have a better time in the game's story mode. Though the plotline is total garbage, it basically consists of you going on a ~field trip~ to complete various objectives. Eventually a time machine is mixed in and you head to different maps to fight different enemies.   What's cool about the story mode is that it plants you on unique maps and charges you with specific challenges. Instead of just killing your enemies you'll be given the chance to detonate certain objectives and in some cases do some platforming. The destruction objectives are entertaining and help to expand some of Worms' gameplay. For instance, in one level you'll be charged with blowing up several wind generators located across an island chain. As you hit the generators, grenade tossing enemies that float on clouds will appear near you. You'll only have control of one worm, so you'll have to take the enemy out and continue destroying the generators until they're all turned to rubble. Before the end of the mission you'll have to battle a boss worm.   As refreshing a change of pace those missions are, the missions where you're forced to perform platforming actions are a real pain. In some you'll have to use a combination of girder laying, parachuting, and doing backflips to properly reach collectible items you'll need to obtain in order to complete a stage. The problem arises from the controls being unreliable. For instance, if you're too close to a wall and you try to hop over it, your worm will fly backwards. This normally isn't a problem since you can just try again, but if you're on a narrow cliff then you'll wind up either drowning or taking massive fall damage. If you do wind up surviving the fall you'll have to go through and redo all the platforming puzzles you've already completed. This can be frustrating given that your character controls aren't as precise as they should be and this really isn't a platforming title anyway.    The platforming control gripes bring us to one of Mayhem's biggest problems, the aiming control. Using the joystick to control exactly where you're trying to toss a grenade or blast a rocket is extremely touchy. You'll spend at least half the time of your turn trying to get the cursor to exactly where you want to try your shot. Since much of Worms' gameplay involves trial and error shots and minor corrections afterwards, the control issue is annoying because it makes it really difficult to fine tune your follow up attack after the initial assault.   Worms 3D showed that the Worms franchise did not transition well from 2D to the three dimensional realm. Aside from the annoying touchy controls, it is just extremely difficult to intuitively guess where you should be firing shots while taking into account horizontal and horizontal axes as well as the wind direction. For larger targets like explosive barrels the controls are alright, but any sort of precision aiming requires far too much trial and error to be entertaining. In addition, the 3D maps make it much harder to tell how objects like grenades will bounce or roll once they've hit the ground. Also, the transition between an attack, notification of how much damage was inflicted, and the next turn needs to be sped up. As it is, you'll spend an overly long amount of time just waiting for the game to process all the actions.     There are some new weapons available to players, most notably the sniper rifle. This weapon, while useful in many cases, suffers from the same imprecise targeting that plagues the rest of the games weaponry. It should be said, though, that these weapons are only frustrating at long distances, within a few feet or when the sniper rifle is zoomed in as far as it will go, the joystick control becomes less of an issue. Still, the point of Worms is to be able to make precise long distance shots because of your skill, not your ability to luck out while battling inexact controls.   Now that we've got those issues out of the way, let me say that Worms has an absolutely amazing array of customization options. First and foremost are the additions of a create a weapon feature, create a team, and create a game mode. Basically, these modes let you create the most ridiculous looking Worms you could ever want to, including ones with military hats, disco glasses, blonde handlebar mustaches, and pirate gloves. All sorts of crazy weapons can be customized and all their attack parameters such as worm damage, environmental damage, poison effect, delivery type, among a huge list of others can be set. The game style creation tool is of an equal depth to the others, letting you tweak six pages full of different options.   There's more still, including a random game condition generator called the Wormpot, tons of unlockable content you can purchase with coins won in the story mode, and a huge array of preset weaponry, so you'll never feel limited.   Of course, Worms is a game that's meant to be played with more than one person, and this game definitely provided options for just that. Up to four players can compete with one console or you can take your game online over Xbox Live. This is definitely the high point of Worms 4: Mayhem, especially because by yourself, the controls may prove too frustrating to continue against an A.I. that isn't hampered by such limitations.    In terms of visuals the game isn't much to look at. It's bright, it's cartoony, and it animates smoothly, but there's noting especially detailed or impressive to speak of. The explosions are decent and spray some landscape chunks into the air but the textures are large devoid of intricacies. Character design is equally simple, with many of the game's landscapes and objects looking blocky and dated. There are some story related cinematics that are significantly more attractive to look at than the gameplay visuals, but nothing worth changing the score over.   The sound is less impressive than the graphics, especially the character voices. The intelligible chirps the worms utter when delivering lines of dialogue is more aggravating than cute, and the weapon sounds are tinny and weak, though I suppose this has been the case with all Worms games. Through it all the game still manages to maintain a sense of cheery humor, especially in the death messages that appear at the top of the screen.  Worms 4: Mayhem incorporates even more customization options than its predecessors to provide a truly mind-boggling array of gameplay possibilities. To best experience this game its definitely worthwhile to gather together a few friends or take your game on to Xbox Live. For those more inclined towards playing alone there is definitely a variety of play options, but the frustratingly inaccurate controls may drive you away from competing against an A.I. that doesnt suffer from the same problems. Hopefully in future Worms titles the game mechanics will be perfected so the 3D version of Worms to be as accessible and enjoyable as the original 2D games were. Oh, and it's only 20 bucks.", "date": "Oct 14, 2005"}
