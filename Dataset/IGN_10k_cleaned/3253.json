{"name": "Worms Blast", "name_review": "Worms Blast", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/21/worms-blast", "text": "Many years ago developer Team 17 came up with a concept: turn-based warfare set on a battlefield of crumbling ground. Only, to evoke a little lightheartedness, you played at worms. Thus the Worms franchise was born, and it has gone on to become extremely popular on both the PC and consoles. It was only a matter of time before the company branched out the series into new genres. It has already explored pinball, and now Team 17 is exploring the puzzle genre with Worms Blast for GameCube.   It isn't exactly the most addicting experience, but it does offer up all the classic weapon-based action in a satirical Worms environment. And, just like the standard Worms games, this one is best served for two, as the Versus mode is where all the replay value and excitement comes in.   The Facts All the same mayhem of the Worms series in a frantic puzzle environment Worms must stay afloat on a bed of water and shoot orbs with like-colored paint to disintegrate them Numerous weapons add depth to the strategy; use the grenade launcher, laser, rifle, and cannon Puzzle action is mixed with mini-game style challenges Tournament mode with a number of special mini-game challenges Two-player and CPU versus with up to eight different modes Progressive scan support   Gameplay Worms Blast brings the big guns and geometric tactics of the originals into a half-puzzle half-strategy environment. Basically, you choose from one of the wacky Worms characters and take to the open waters on a rowboat. This is the main dynamic of your movement, which is affected by the physics of momentum and wave ripples. Meanwhile, the objective is to obliterate the colored orbs above you. You have to use like-colored ammo, which is where the strategy comes in. It's clearly inspired by the Bust-A-Move franchise. Again, gravity and real world laws of physics apply to the heavy projectiles you fire above you. Missed shots can easily come back crashing down on you, depleting some of your available health, and even if you manage to dodge them they will cause the waterbed to ripple, which makes it difficult to aim. So, there's a lot of Worms-style strategy here, but because it's not turn-based it feels completely different.  The main single-player game takes you across the map to 60 different puzzle challenges. Team 17 has really worked hard to diversify the experience. It hasn't forgotten that Worms really isn't a puzzle game, so you get to indulge in a lot of different tasks. They range from timed challenges of dodging falling blocks to collecting falling stars, which also happen to lower the water level in any challenge. The main puzzle-style challenges call for a lot of strategy too. Some are time-based and require you to hit a specific target, often locked deep in the clutter of the colored orbs. For these, you have to strategize and look for shortcuts, which often relate to finding a new weapon. In most challenges you will see a question-marked box somewhere in the mix. You can switch from your normal paint-splattering cannon to a rifle, dynamite tosser, laser beam, grenade launcher and more. If used properly, you can clear blocks far more quickly. In the case of the aforementioned challenges, you might have to bounce a laser through a passage to reach the target on time. This is where Worms Blast finds its entertainment value and even feels rewarding. However, the overall single-player experience only runs skin deep.       Like so many puzzle games, Worms Blast is a far better two-player experience. There's no four-player. Versus mode features eight gameplay styles ranging from deathmatch to star collection. Each mode has its own dynamic, but the best ones are easily those where you get to catapult your gunfire over the wall at your opponent. These modes are genuinely more amusing, and frantic, than the single-player.   In sum, Worms Blast is an interesting variation on the franchise, but the single-player value is practically null. There are simply better puzzle formats out there, and the Worms fans that can appreciate the mechanics probably won't, because they'll just want it to be the standard turn-based warfare. The versus mode with its eight gameplay styles is the only real worthwhile part of Worms Blast. Definitely pick it up for a rental with a friend. However, seeing as there are currently no good two-player puzzle titles on GameCube, this may be a good addition to your library.   At the end of the day, though, Worms is best left in its original form. We can't wait to see Team 17's next true addition to the turn-based series.   Graphics Worms Blast borrows from the same style of exaggerated cartoony environments that its predecessors have. In fact, it even looks to apply some basic cel-shading to achieve an even more illustrated style. As a puzzler, it's very simple. The backgrounds are nice static and the rest of the screen is filled with red, purple, yellow, orange, and green orbs. The most complicated animation and visual effects are seen down at sea level. The water has some wonderful physics and animates accordingly as your bullet shells come crashing down below. Meanwhile, your character is also a focal point, but it's nothing that's is exactly utilizing the next-generation technology in GameCube.    Special commendations to Team 17 for supporting progressive scan. Those who can use it will benefit from an even more vivid picture of the already vibrant Worms Blast.   Sound Music is uncomplicated and often repetitive. It's quirky and fits with the theme of Worms Blast, but you won't be humming any of it. The sound effects from gunfire and especially the dialogue from the characters overpowers everything else. There is a handful of sarcastic trash talk that you'll hear, some of which is pretty amusing. Very plain over all. I love the Worms franchise and I love puzzle games. Worms Blast found the best medium between the two styles as it could, but I don't think this spin-off is one that Team 17 should continue with. As a fan, you want single-player to just be worms -- there's no avoiding it. For versus mode, things improve dramatically. You can get involved in some pretty intense matches, but the gameplay does not lend itself to be longlasting like some of the other addicting puzzlers out there.Recommended for a definite rent. It's GCN's best two-player puzzle game for now, but competitor Super Bust-A-Move 2 has a chance to top that. Only the most hardcore Worms fan looking for some variation will want to invest in it long-term.", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
