Or at least, I used to be before I became a big fan of video games. No dice, no setup, no friends. Computer games have it all. Three years ago FASA Interactive brought the world of BattleTech from the tabletop to the PC. While MechCommander had a lot going for it, it also suffered from some serious flaws. Thankfully the concerns of fans have been addressed here without deviating too far from the strictly military, slightly mercenary approach that makes the game world so engaging.  For those of you who don't know what BattleTech is, first off, shame on you. Second off, it's a game where human pilots jump into the cockpits of gigantic robotic fighting machines and duke it out with each other. While there's a rich history to the world, the real appeal is in the various scraps and duels to be had. A context was just an excuse and, in my opinion, probably not even necessary.  It appears the designers of MechCommander 2 agree with me. The story of the game seems a bit tacked on but with all the excitement of blowing stuff up, you might not even be bothered.  In any case, the real point of the game is directing your mechs (of which you only control a handful at any given time) through an almost exclusively military exercise. But while there's no traditional RTS resource management here, there's an incredibly rich and intricate management side to the game going on between the missions. You're in charge of salvaging beaten mechs, purchasing and equipping new mechs and training your pilots.  At the request of the fans a few basic improvements have been made. You can set waypoints, save in the middle of the mission. AI has been beefed up as well most notably on the friendly side. Friendly units show much more initiative than before so you needn't babysit them all the time. Still a few other things that were supposed to be added still seem to be missing. Heat management was supposed to play a much bigger role this time around but it doesn't. I didn't seem to have any heat problems even while in a huge toe-to-toe firefight with mechs equipped with flamers. The idea of targeting specific locations is also a little ~lite~ here. This wouldn't be such a big deal except that these are two crucial concepts in the board game.  The idea of managing a stable of mechs is included however. What's more, it's implemented incredibly well. In between each mission you'll have the chance to buy or sell new mechs (as they come available) as well as customize their loadouts. And since each mech persists from mission to mission, a premium is placed on keeping them in top condition. The same can be said of your pilots. If you're careful your limited pool of pilots will grow in experience. At each new promotion level, you can pick certain skills for your pilots. This gives the game a very RPG sort of feel and ensures that you genuinely care when one of your squad gets stomped.  Graphically, MechCommander 2 looks much better than several other recent RTS titles (if you've got the hardware to run it -- the minimum specs are the minimum minimum). Mech models are sweet with tons of details. Weapon effects and the explosions they produce are truly satisfying. I was a little saddened to see that the environments were so similar -- one of the strengths of the BattleTech universe is its planet hopping nature. Luckily the environments have plenty of tactical features that you can take advantage of.   The interface is pretty straightforward (or at least it should be to anyone who's played a real-time strategy game in the past ten years. A group of tabs gives you easy access to the minimap, your mech stats and your support options. I experienced a little confusion and a lot of frustration over unselecting units and canceling support orders. Still the interface is simple and clean and never gets in the way of the game itself.  The game is buggy as all hell. While I did finally manage to get it running in a stable fashion, this was preceded by a full week of headaches. Rather than go into a full description of everything, let me just give you a brief sampling of the problems I had.   The game wouldn't run from the Start Menu or the Shortcut. I had to run from the splash screen every time. I tried three different GeForce 256 machines and couldn't get it to run on any of them. Once when trying to save, the game crashed. Whenever the game started after that, it automatically loaded a mission in which everyone was named Bubba.   Multiplayer is equally troubling due to the fact that a) it's hosted through the Zone and b) LAN games crash and crash. By now I think everyone's familiar with my own personal dislike for the Zone. It's not that I think it's a bad service, but you have to open far too many windows just to get to a game room and then once you get there you find out no one's actually come there to play the game. In any case, I'd rather play a LAN game. But even these seemed to cause problems. Dan and I tried to play for a couple of hours and I don't think we got through a single game without it crashing.  The fact that there's no instant action option for single player (or multiplayer with computer AI at least) irritates me further. I mean, the usefulness of the mech lab is predicated on your ability to experiment. After I've built a mech, I like to try it out. Sadly, the only option here is to take it into the campaign missions or into one of the game's poor multiplayer areas.  But that doesn't mean that the game isn't incredibly fun. I had a blast playing it and it's one of the few games I've played recently that I genuinely want to go back and finish. Hopefully with a few patches under its belt MechCommander 2 will be even more stable and that much more fun. Until that happens I'm willing to put up with some of the game's minor issues for the sake of everything else that it does right.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
