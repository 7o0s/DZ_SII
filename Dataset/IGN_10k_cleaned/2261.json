{"name": "Ultimate Ride", "name_review": "Ultimate Ride", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/14/ultimate-ride", "text": "It's hard to dispute the world's fascination with amusement parks and roller coasters. There's just something exciting about slamming your body around and experiencing sensations that would otherwise go unnoticed without the technology to bring us to high speeds and unusual amounts of G-force. The feeling that, even if you are relatively safe, you have just escaped death is thrilling even if you do throw up and crap your pants. So it was no big surprise that game developers started to find that there was a definite market to give people the opportunity to create their own parks (and more importantly their own rides) where they could see simulated people running around having fun, throwing up, and crapping their pants. Most of these games gave gamers the chance to run all aspects of an amusement park from the design to the economics, but for some this was a little too much. So then someone had the great idea to sit down and make a game where you didn't have to worry about money problems but did have the opportunity to build and ride a 3D roller coaster. Unfortunately that game (I dare not speak it's name lest it be summoned to terrorize the planet yet again) was so horrific that I barely escaped with my life while my poor dog Killa was so bored he slipped into a coma and passed away. I kept thinking to myself, ~How could they kill my dog? What would possess someone to make such a bad game out of a good idea?~ I still don't know the answers to that, but I do know that someone took this idea and pushed it into a much better and pretty enjoyable experience. And I think it's pretty appropriate that someone was Disney and their Imagineering group. What they've done is create a very workable tool for creating some exciting 3D roller coasters that you can ride when complete. Ultimate Ride isn't the deepest game around and never really pretended to be, but it does its job well and should be commended for it.  The basic premise is, well.... basic. You get some 3D terrain and build an exciting roller coaster over it. That's pretty much it. You can do this in what amounts to a free build mode where there are no rules of engagement, just a sense that you need to create an impossibly stomach churning ride, and an Imagineering mode where you are challenged to build or finish a coaster that completes a certain set of tasks. This could include a certain length of track, building a track through rings, or G-force limitations, but the end result can be challenging to come by. Unfortunately you can only build wooden, metal, and hanging coasters during the game. More choices definitely would have been appreciated here.  The real joy here is the tools for building the coaster. Everyone who has played Roller Coaster Tycoon knows the frustration of building in an isometric view with only four angles. They also know the frustration of building a coaster out of set parts. There was still a major amount of creativity that went into building the rides in that game, but it also left you wanting the chance to build something with a little more freedom. Ultimate Ride's tool set definitely gives you that freedom giving you the opportunity to create virtually any piece you like in the three types of coasters.  Instead of setting pieces of coaster in stone with certain angles of ascent, amount of curve, or tilt, they've made it very easy to adjust all of these things with a few easy clicks. Once a piece of track is placed, you can adjust each of these things. Want a curve to be tighter but longer so the angle you leave the curve is different? Easy as pie. Want to have a coaster a certain height but one of the straight pieces is too long and the other is too short? Just use the lengthen and shorten buttons. It's all put together in a very easy interface that anyone should understand. Adjusting specific sections of coasters you build is very simple and doesn't mean that you'll have to delete a ton of track to make your small changes work. The game will automatically rework any track near the point of contention and make it fit automatically. Of course this may present a problem with having enough inertia to get around the final track, but it certainly is simpler than the Roller Coaster Tycoon model of design.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to borrow underground for tunnels or manipulate the terrain in any way shape or form. These couple of things could have made a huge difference to the overall appeal of the game. As it is, you get a set terrain tile to build upon that while interesting, doesn't allow for quite the creativity in overall ride experience that I would have liked to have in a game like this.  Once you finish your coaster, you can test it out to see if it will make it all the way around the track. Once you decide to do this, you'll be transported to a rendered first person view of the track at which point you can start the ride and see where the mistakes are. Readouts for all of the necessary things such as speed and G-forces will be shown while you test the ride so you can see exactly where the mistakes are and what kind of changes need to be made.  After all of the necessary adjustments have been made and you're happy with your track, you can stick some extras onto the surrounding environment to give the ride that extra oomph. There are four different themes to pick from including such as sci-fi and Middle Ages and each has a few different objects to choose from. The objects range in size as well as how much they actually move around. While some of the objects are pretty neat and show more life to them, many of them are blocky, a little boring, and are hard to work into the coaster design other than as background fluff.   The engine itself does a pretty decent job of bringing the rides to life after you finally are completely finished and take a trip in one of the cars. You have the opportunity to ride in any of the seats in the train and view the ride in first person, 3rd person, cinematic, or overhead view. The trains themselves are kind of creative, if a little blocky. Unfortunately if you don't sit in the front seat with some of the trains, you won't be able to see over the car in front of you, blocking much of the experience.  Any way you look at this one, you aren't going to be completely blown away by its originality or stylish gameplay. But those that like creating crazy roller coasters and ride them when you're done should get a kick out of this one even with its basic gameplay.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
