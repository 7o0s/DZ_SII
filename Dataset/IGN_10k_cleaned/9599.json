Surely at least once, even if only when pondering the meaning of life while staring intently at an anthill! Well, Bullfrog's Populous series has always had this tradition in mind, but usually played from the perspective of an already extant diety. Populous: The Beginning (PTB) takes a slightly different slant and enables you to play as a Shaman whose goal is to become a deity to command all deities.  But how is this done? Pretty simply, actually. You play the game from an overhead isometric perspective which enables you to quickly move about the globe, viewing a 3D map which depicts the landscape, structures being built, and people maneuvering about - all in realtime, of course. As Shaman, your goal is to guide your people through this world to ever-increasing power and dominance. Of course, there are usually other ~people~ in the way (overseen by their own Shaman) who have the same goal. As such, your goal is to destroy the opposing forces and take control of religiously significant points such as idols and totems until you have complete mastery of the particular world you're battling over. Once finished, you move onto another world and begin the process all over, but this time with the advantage of followers and spells collected along the way.   You aren't totally helpless as Shaman, and have the ability to cast a variety of entertaining spells to wreak havoc on the opposing forces. At first you start with some basic fire spells, along with the ability to create the occasional land bridge, which makes new lands accessible to your followers. Casting these spells takes a form of energy called (originally enough) Manna. In order to learn and cast new and more powerful spells you continually need to increase your Manna store. You gain Manna as your followers worship at the aforementioned shrines; obviously, you also gain more Manna the more people you have, so creating facilities that grant you more followers is always high on the priority list.   Megalomaniacs unite! As you gain Manna and the spells to use it, a variety of fun and entertaining ways to destroy those who oppose you awaits! Is the opposing population growing too quickly? Try a horde of locusts! Or perhaps the enemies' hometown is looking a little too well fortified to attack with your precious followers... no problem! The architectural addition of an erupting volcano should do the trick!   The game begins with an introductory cinematic that defines your goal and depicts you as a female character. Other than that little twist, it's pretty much your standard intro cine that we've all seen a million times before. However, musically, the game is quite nice with ethereal choruses rising to the heavens, and an otherwise quasi-Techno-Enya bent to the theme. Sound effects aren't quite as strong, but are certainly adequate and not embarrassing.   A realtime God-Sim strategy game like this requires quick and accurate control; unfortunately, the best control device is a mouse, which most don't have for the PlayStation. However, Bullfrog has done quite a decent job of converting the mouse ~click 'n point~ control scheme to the game pad. Commands can be accessed through double-press button combinations that are quickly memorized, and certain oft-used functions such as spell-casting or ~center on Shaman~ are called out to separate buttons. Dual Shock pad users will find their control pad investment aptly rewarded as PTB supports vibration when doling out or taking damage, and also enables the user to scroll the screen and target cursor independently when using both sticks simultaneously.   The game's 3D engine is also well-designed, enabling deformation effects, such as the aforementioned volcano rising from the ground and rippling ocean water, along with the capability to skim over the world from a bird's eye view, giving you that all-powerful deity goodness that so defines the Populous series. Playing Populous: The Beginning was an interesting experience, especially for those who may have also played any of the Populous series on the PC. Although an excellent port to the PlayStation, those who have played with a mouse cannot help but find themselves limited by the control scheme of the control pad. However, I must stress that this should not be seen as a fault on the game designers, as they've done an excellent job of converting the interface to a console-friendly one. My suspicion is that traditional PlayStation users who have never played Populous before, or have never played on the PC before, won't have any problems. Gameplay-wise, PTB has that all-engrossing time-suck factor that one looks for in classic games. There's something about playing as an all-powerful deity that truly takes you in and keeps you from looking up from the TV for hours. Yes, there are some occasional nits: the sprite-based characters are a little fuzzy and small, and the overhead summation map can get a little confusing, but this is also an artifact from being ported from the PC which has a far higher resolution display monitor. You could remove some of the characters or detail from the PlayStation port, but you'd also lose a lot of that Populous feeling. All in all, Populous: The Beginning is an excellent addition to the Populous series on the PlayStation and is highly recommended for all you megalomaniacs out there!", "date": "Jul 13, 1999"}
