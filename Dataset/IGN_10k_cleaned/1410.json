One of the first games to threaten to crack the PlayStation's axle now stands in sequel form on the showroom shelves as the only new Dreamcast game on the event of the PS2's release. There's not much here to combat the BigBlue2, if you're thinking this is any more than coincidence. Still, with the up and down quality of the other guy's new games, there's plenty of room for a game that just books and crunches metal, and that's Demolition Racer busting a nutshell.  The gig in a demolition race is that you've got to put on a show. Just finishing first in a race or surviving like Big John Stud by avoiding fights in the demolition derbies won't put you on the pedestal. The big hits must be doled out, and some engine fires must be lit, or else you're going home empty-handed. That puts an interesting spin on the race modes, since you can never safely ditch the pack (unless you're so good that you can lap the field). The game scores by the damage you've put on others times your finishing position, so if you slack in either department, your total will not measure up. Often times, it's a matter of sacrificing one or the other and judging what that will lose you, since the pack tends to let three or four leaders escape the field. Do you risk finishing fifth to rack up some major damage, or should you gun down the frontrunner and hope that your standing holds?  The same smash-but-survive gameplay begs you into the butcher pit, but it's here that one starts realizing just how limited and lax the game is. Sixteen cars are out in the field, making for quite a threatening pack to go up against, but when you see all fifteen opponents drive straight ahead at the beginning of the game and smash head-on into each other, you get the feeling that nobody's behind the wheel in any of those cars. Even deeper into the game (which is otherwise very, very difficult in challenge), the AI proves to have no gameplan other than to smash you with the front of their car. Opponents don't have varying temperaments or vengeance's, so while the game is fun for a few crashes, continuous play isn't as fun as it might be if opponents were programmed to start feuds with you. It's just no fun to pick on the faceless racers.  Behind the wheel, you'll find a car racer that controls nice and greasy, but amongst all of the carnage in the game, the driving in this game is a bit too smooth. Pitbull Syndicate may have made the executive decision that it's more fun to crash when the cars are always at top speed, but it's not exactly true to the demolition derby spirit, where wheel damage affect turning and speed, making sitting ducks of the pummeled. Wrecks don't affect the ride, and in a game where wrecks are 3/4 the gameplay, that's pretty limiting. Still, there's nothing more fun than plowing through a ten-car pile-up at full speed, so while the trade-off means a limited and sometimes bland game, a few big hits in the two-player bout will make those errors slip from your mind until Pitbull comes up with a better performing sequel.  As for the graphics, there's not much to complain about. Then again, borrowed heavily from the PlayStation game, there's not a ton to brag about either, but at least everything is flat-out fast. Some little touches have been doused on these dark and dingy tracks, like planes flying overhead and lens flares in the glass, but the window dressing has been kept low to make sure there's a big pack to lay some pain on. And when dozens of cars spin and slam in every-which direction in a massive pile-up up ahead, that's all of the ginchy gloss you'll need. Car damage on the waxed and shiny cars shows well, and the level of detail in the damage models is still one of the things Pitbull does best. Unlike the PlayStation version, it's pretty rare to see parts fly off cars that just look like random polygons -- now you can see exactly what chunk of the car has been knocked off. The move to the Dreamcast has been quite nice to this game, with a smooth two-player game that runs almost as many opponents as the single game, and only a limited amount of pop-up. It's dark and not very pretty looking, but this isn't supposed to be a pretty racer, and the grubby look is much preferred now that the game runs at 60FPS. The only issue is an odd one -- at this high framerate, the crashes hang less and look less devastating, and the high-flying flips and crashes now look like toys being tossed rather than 1/4 ton cars. Ironically, the slowdown and framey quality made the PlayStation games look like a slow-motion replay, and that quality is missing here.  This game is unapologetically about metal violence, and for a quick fix, there's nothing more fun than running down and pummeling a friend or enemies' ride into shrapnel. Try to get above that with Destruction Racer, and you'll find nowhere to go. But for what it is, it's fast and brutal, and plenty of fun for a few dents and demolitions. Now that the series has jumped to a meatier machine, there's hope that there will be more to mine out of this admittedly sugary bit of gaming candy. Demolition Racer itself is a stock car. Next time, pop this puppy open and see what we can shoehorn in there.  --Marc Nix Without being too descriptive, let me get to the point. I found this game to be too difficult. While that helps increase lasting appeal, it also frustrates the crap out of people like me. I want to see all the tracks and vehicles without putting in a cheat code. Sure, I'm a fan of hidden characters and surprises, but that's the problem with this game-- there are no surprises. The menu already displays all the circuits and cars, but most have a big red ~LOCKED~ stamp on em. Show me three cars and two tracks. That's all I need to see. Anything else I get is a bonus. Please don't tease us with 10 cars, saying, ~Sorry, Johnny. You can only have two of the ten right now, but if you eat your vegetables, you'll get some more.~ C'mon. On the bright side, I enjoyed the little film strip introduction as well as the soundtrack. Headbanging music is fitting for Demolition Racer's daring gameplay, but that isn't a good enough reason to buy the game. I would rate this as a 2-day rental, not a keeper.", "date": "Oct 27, 2000"}
