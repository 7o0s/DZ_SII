While the vast majority of titles have merely imitated the style and characteristics of their predecessors, few have been willing to introduce either the new concepts that drive the genre into fresh territories or the subtle refinements that transform recent innovations into universally accepted standards that define the genre.  Best Way's Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 offered up a number of improvements. Allowing players to assume direct control of individual units added a Contra-style flavor to the to the proceedings, while solid physics-driven building and vehicle damage lent a cinematic (and tactical) edge that the genre sorely needed. While the sequel, Faces of War, retains many of the elements of the original, the overall presentation isn't quite as engaging and the game as a whole suffers from numerous problems.   Faces of War lets players lead a small squad of infantry and a handful of vehicles through a series of unconnected missions during the final years of World War 2. Three campaigns let players try their hands at leading the Germans, Western Allies and the Soviets through a wide range of battles. Old favorites like Bastogne and D-Day are here but battles like Stalingrad and Market Garden are strangely absent. The missions are generally quite long and challenging and will take you from snowy forests to bombed-out cities.  Even though there's a nice range of mission types and environments, the missions themselves are a little generic and feel almost interchangeable. While there wasn't a strong story in Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, there was more of a sense of connection between the missions. The original game also offered a bit more flexibility in terms of your approach to each mission. Faces of War, by contrast, presents very scripted, linear missions that don't allow for as much freedom.  Faces of War distances itself from Soldiers in the emphasis on larger battles. Soldiers had a bit more of a special operations, Commandos-inspired mission design. This time around, your squad will merely be one small, admittedly essential, element in a much larger operation. It's a real blast to cooperate with friendly AI forces but it can sometimes leave you feeling like your efforts don't matter, particularly when the mission brings in a massive allied army to pull your chestnuts out of the fire.   Compared to games like Sudden Strike or Blitzkrieg, there's not a great deal of variety to the units here. Instead the focus is on iconic vehicles like Shermans and Tigers and T-34s and infantry armed with a wide range of weapons, from SMGs to flamethrowers. Some gamers might miss the more obscure units but the ones that are included in Faces of War definitely capture the flavor of the conflict and allow for all the cool tactics and schemes seen in your favorite war movies.  One of the worst offenders in Faces of War is the poor artificial intelligence of your units. The cluttered nature of the levels really frustrates the game's pathfinding, particularly if you're trying to make your way across streets strewn with rubble. Since there's lots of rubble throughout the game, you'll find yourself getting frustrated when your soldiers can't seem to work their way quickly around the various obstacles in front of them.      The AI's tactics and rules of engagement are also sometimes suspect. While it's amazingly awesome that your soldiers will pick up live grenades and throw them back at your enemy, it's completely stupid for them to use their own grenades against lone enemies who aren't even behind cover. Likewise, soldiers armed with bazookas will sometimes ignore MG emplacements and vehicles in favor of shooting at infantry. Soldiers who are armed with sniper rifles will frequently leave places of cover and concealment in order to engage enemies at close range. Other times you can rush your soldiers right up beside an enemy and they sometimes won't even bother to shoot for a few seconds.  You can counterbalance the unpredictable, sometimes reckless nature of the AI by taking direct control of your units. This feature was a real blast in the previous game, letting players treat the game like a complex, 3D version of Ikari Warriors or Contra. You'll use the arrow keys and the mouse to move around and fire your weapons. Unfortunately, while in direct control mode, you'll lose the ability to jump over obstacles or loot enemy bodies, which are essential elements of the game. You'll also lose the ability to direct your squad mates, which means you're essentially one your own until you surrender control and switch back to RTS mode. The addition of squad control element would definitely make the direct control function more useful.    The tutorial is as lengthy as it is unhelpful. It manages to give you a decent enough introduction to the basic concepts of the game but there are plenty of important ideas that aren't covered, particularly when it comes to directly controlling your units. Even a search through the manual won't provide many of the answers you seek. I'm still not entirely convinced that it's impossible to loot bodies or climb walls with directly controlled units but the manual is no help here.  The visuals in Faces of War are a good bit ahead of those in Soldiers and most other games in the genre. Detail in the unit designs, from the patches on the infantry uniforms to the rivets on the armored vehicles, really add a sense of life to the game and, while the animations aren't brilliant, they're definitely convincing enough for the game's scale. The environments are also quite realistic, particularly the urban locations.  Faces of War really makes full use of its physics system. Since blowing things up, apart and around is the whole point of war in the first place, Faces of War's physics really bring a high level of excitement and interest to the experience. When tank shells hit, they can send your soldiers flying up into the air. Watching them (and their rifles, helmets and other accoutrements) cartwheeling through the air makes the whole game feel like a war. When you see tank turrets pop off or sandbags scatter under the    The game suffers from regular framerate problems, particularly once the physic effects start piling up. Blow up a building and the game will really slow down considerably. While the game is supposed to slow down while your characters access their inventories, it seems that the game sometimes forgets to speed back up once you close the inventory screen. It can make the game incredibly boring and frustrating until the clock starts ticking at a regular pace again.  Unfortunately, some of these speed issues seem to cause synch problems in multiplayer. If you can manage to get a game running at a good speed, there's lots of fun to be had here across a wide variety of modes. The most unusual of the modes involves competing with other players in hunting down and collecting chickens. It really has to be experienced to really understand it but it's definitely loads of fun. Most fun of all, however, are the cooperative modes where you and a buddy can take on an entire mission together.  Finally, the sound in Faces of War leaves a bit to be desired. While the sound effects and dramatic score definitely help add some substance to the action, the voice work just horrible. The accents are inconsistent and there are frequent and obvious errors in the text and dialogue. Next time hire an English-speaking porfreader.Released right around the same time as THQ's Company of Heroes, Faces of War suffers from the worst case of bad timing since Abraham Lincoln decided to wait until intermission to get some popcorn. While the game might have stood well on its own, the comparisons to Company of Heroes are inevitable and almost universally unfavorable to Faces of War. It does offer some challenging tactical battles, loads of physics-driven mayhem and the novelty of directly controlling your units. While that certainly made the original game a nice treat, those same features don't really do enough to separate Faces of War from the other World War 2 RTS games that have been released in the last year or two.", "date": "Oct 6, 2006"}
