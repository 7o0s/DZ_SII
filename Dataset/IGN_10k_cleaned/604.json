The game is based on Shanghai, the game developed by Activision originally on the Mac  this title is an awesome solitaire puzzle game, as well as a great, hectic two player challenge. Features Twelve levels Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Let's get this out in the open  Shanghai is not Mah Jongg. It's a solitaire game designed to use the existing Chinese Mah Jongg tilesets, where you're confronted with an organized pile of these symbol-marked pieces. The object is to work your way down the pile, removing pieces that can freely move left or right by matching two of the same tiles. Once out of the way, you can work further into the pile  the game ends when you've either run out of moves, or you've wiped out the entire puzzle successfully. It's a game where you have to think, since each design shows up four times on the table  removing the wrong two at a time might make the field impossible to clear.  The Game Boy version by Sunsoft is a great version of this classic puzzle game  despite the low resolution of the Game Boy screen, the designs on the Shanghai tiles are easy to see and easy to discern between the set. But if you have a hard time with the elaborate piece design, you can simplify them by changing them in the options menu.  What makes the Game Boy version awesome is the addition of the two-player features. You can go up against another player (via link cable and another system),  or against the computer in two versions. One, each player is faced with the same pile of pieces, and the first person to reduce the pile completely wins. The other is a lot like Tetris, where each player has a pile of specific tiles  removing a combination of tiles in a row will send a bunch of tiles to the other player, making it difficult to clear out his pile before you can.  I originally only had one complaint about the game -- for some reason I thought you couldn't turn off the clock in the game. Readers have pointed out that it's in the options mode...and their right. I glanced over it completely -- what a goof. Well, now I don't have a complaint about the game.  I also have to note that even though this was one of the earliest Game Boy Color games to hit the market, the graphics are very good, and the music is some of the catchiest tunes I've ever heard on the system. It's a really well put together package.  Tetris will always be the best puzzle game ever created, but Shanghai, in my opinion, comes in a close second. I've played versions of Shanghai on the PC, Mac, Apple IIGS, and even my Atari Lynx, and this Game Boy version is just as good  the fact that you can't alter any options is a bummer, but the two player modes are a great addition. They balance each other out quite well, I think. And though I've said this game was released back in 1998, it's still in ample supply...for now. It's really worth a purchase, and will be a game you'll keep playing over, and over, and over...", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
