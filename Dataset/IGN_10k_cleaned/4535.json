One series that continues to hold tight to that distinction is Rainbow Six. Three iterations have made their way to PCs and the title is just starting to appear on the current consoles. Beyond and between these releases, the series has received an added boost from expansion packs.   These expansion packs almost always focus exclusively on new missions, new levels and new weapons, leaving the addition of new gameplay features to the developers of the official sequel. Such is the case with Athena Sword, the latest expansion for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. But though it merely pours on more of the same, it's a same that we like enough to still be hungry even after having seconds.   Though Gutierrez's story from the previous game was definitely compelling (who can resist those power-hungry Brazilians?), the action this time around is over quickly enough that you won't yet have forgotten the beginning. It builds on the previous story, exposing Rainbow's lapse in tracking down all of the members of Gutierrez's multi-cultural terrorist entourage, then takes off in a new direction, letting the player venture around the Mediterranean in their efforts to finally put a stop to this madness...at least until it's time for a new mission pack.   In the meantime, you'll have no end of trouble tracking down terrorists, starting at an art-filled Italian castle and running through to a Greek marketplace. The challenge level is fairly high here, not just in terms of enemy performance and level design, but also in terms of scripting. Where previous Rainbow games made do with the odd bomb defusal or stealth mission to break up the monotony, the series has started including a few more variations on the standard mission. One here, for instance, requires you to actually capture someone who doesn't want to be captured. It's a small thing but definitely forces you to rethink your approach somewhat.   Seven new weapons will also require you to reconsider your options. While the new shotgun and machine pistol are very useful under some very specific circumstances, I found the new G3KA4 to be the real star here. It's both lighter and less cumbersome than the G3A3 I already use. The M240G and OTs-14 are both fantastic guns for players who like to work in volume, but the G3KA4 is pretty much the best of the new weapon additions.    Though the core game's offerings weren't exactly meager, we could always use some more multiplayer maps. The five new spaces included in the expansion will find lots of fans among existing Raven Shield players. The large University level is a favorite of mine already with a large, open central area bounded on all sides by the tall walls of the university itself. And though the Chemical Plant probably has some of the most tactically striking height differences, all of the levels continue Raven Shield's model of putting danger above and below as well as beside you.   The new head-to-head terrorist hunts are a blast and give you an interesting outlet for those times when you crave a three-way fight. Having two teams competing to kill terrorists and each other definitely raises the tension for me. I still think the game's at its most fun in straight head-to-head team matches but having those terrorists in between mean there's less skulking about and more complications overall. Unfortunately, neither the new adversarial terrorist hunts nor the capture the enemy mode are available as custom missions; if you want to play these, you have to head online.   The graphical updates are much more noticeable in the redressing of the three classic levels. It's funny how I still remember some of the details for these old levels; the one-shot, one-kill format has a way of focusing my attention, I suppose. Whatever the reason, I have strong memories of the three ~classic~ missions and I was genuinely impressed with the visual improvements made in the expansion. Heading into that back room of the Embassy, I expected to see a few new textures but I wasn't prepared for the fully furnished effect that the designers have achieved. Once empty rooms now contain all manner of settees, divans and sofas. Seeing these new elements in old levels gives you a great perspective on how far the series has come.  You can look at this expansion as a math problem. Eight new missions plus seven new weapons plus five new multiplayer maps almost equal a reasonable return for your thirty bucks. But it's more than just a matter of quantity. You also have to consider both the quality of the additions and whether or not they fill a void in the current game. Those two issues aren't directly related, however, and I found that, while I think that the weapons and levels and missions are as fun as those in the core game, the adversarial terrorist hunt mode is the only thing that makes this game seem at all different from the last.For some, that's not enough to justify a thirty-dollar buy-in. For others, it's a done deal at an even higher price. I'm somewhere in between, appreciating the solid gameplay and slick level design that made the core game so compelling, but I tend to think that $30 is a bit steep considering the quantity of additions here. It's definitely worth it for fans who are just craving more of that intense action found in the original game; had this been priced ten bucks lower, it'd be a much easier recommendation for the rest of us.", "date": "Mar 10, 2004"}
