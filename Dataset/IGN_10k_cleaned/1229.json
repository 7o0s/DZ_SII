Skateboarding titles are on a serious incline in popularity, so it's not surprising to see other big publishers jumping on the bandwagon. THQ dishes out its own entry in the genre with  MTV Sports Skateboarding -- like Tony Hawk, don't expect console quality with this title...but THQ has pulled out the best boardin' title yet on the Game Boy Color. Features Four boarders, including real-life pro Andy McDonald Four play modes 18 cities Only for Game Boy Color MTV Sports: Skateboarding is less a skateboarding game and more a search-and-explore and beat-the-clock-style action game. Oh, sure, you've got yourself a healthy array of moves you can pull off  rail and table grinds, 360s, kickflips, flips, and nollies, and plenty of obstacles to zoom up and leap off of. But it's more about completing a series of tasks to move onto the next level. The game is broken down into four different gaming options, three of which are different sets of challenges that'll put you to the task of completing a set quota before you can move onto the next city. Oh, sure, you can simply head into an open arena and try out your mad boardin' skills, but the main gameplay of MTV Sports: Skateboarding revolves around the game's three circuits.  The controls are very sensitive, so much to the point that you'll find yourself bouncing off walls and hitting ramps at the wrong angle early in the game. But stick with it because maneuvering the character gets easier and more intuitive the more you play around with it. Pressing A will offer a kick to speed you on your way, and right and left will turn your boarder clockwise and counterclockwise. Hitting the B button will make your character jump into the air, and pushing the pad in a specific direction will pull off a specific set of moves.  You can even pull off a handstand or nosewheelie by pushing up or down while cruising through the semi-3D arenas.  To advance through the game's challenge, you need to follow the quota. In one level, for example, you have to skate around the arena scoring a set amount of points before the clock runs down  while tricks offer a few dozen points, the only way you're going to meet this quota is to grab MTV icons thrown all over the place. And you can't just run over them  you'll need to touch them while pulling off a trick. And here's the sticky part  you cannot grab a token by pulling off the same trick as the one you did before. This encourages the use of all the tricks at your disposal, and insures that you don't simply pull off one kickflip after another. Other challenges in the game are a little more cut and dry than this  in one, you'll simply grab balloons thrown about the arena. In another, you'll run through an obstacle course and get to the end before time runs out  grabbing time icons to add precious seconds. And in one extreme event, you'll skate through a museum and uncover artifacts by crashing into priceless vases.  But I can't play this game without wondering...where the heck is the halfpipe? A skateboarding game without a halfpipe...are you guys nuts? This is a staple feature that should be in all skating games, and to leave it out just makes the game feel unfinished.  It would have been nice if the game focused more on the trick aspect of skating  the only reason to perform combinations is for your own personal enjoyment. There's no real reason to leap off an incline onto a rail and 360 jump off onto a table  oh, you can certainly do this in MTV Sports: Skateboarding, but moves like this aren't required or encouraged. They're just something you'll stumble onto as you wander around the game's arenas on your board. A better points structure for complex maneuvers would have done wonders for this game. Some of the options, like the choice of four different skaters, weren't followed through all the way -- you don't get much out of changing your skater other than a pallete swap. And the front-end interface could use a complete revamp  it's way too cryptic for its own good.   Most everything else about this game, though, is pretty high up there in quality. The animation of the skateboarder, the sense of speed, the satisfaction of pulling off a few difficult stunts  the developer who worked on this title definitely knows the Game Boy hardware. It's just a shame the game has a learning curve a little on the high side.  All right folks, it's time to turn the tables on the sales charts. Tony Hawk Pro Skater has been dominating the Game Boy Color sales for way too long, and it's time to let a better skateboarding game take the proper glory. MTV Sports: Skateboarding may not have the huge name (Andy McDonald doesn't have the same punch as Tony Hawk), but you all will have to agree that, while the game isn't perfect or a complete skating package, it's the best of the three skateboarding games currently on the Game Boy Color. There are more coming in the next few months, but as of right now, THQ dominates the portable skate park.", "date": "Sep 8, 2000"}
