I have been looking at games that really managed to convince me that I not only love the game designers at Sega, but that their latest hardware effort has more than enough punch to push it in to the next round of the console wars.  But, as with all big hills on any coaster worth its salt, you've gotta come down at some point.  Such was the case when I took a seat with Sega's latest arcade-to-Dreamcast offering, Zombie Revenge.  On one hand, you've got a great looking title, with killer character design, and cool environments, but on the other, you've got a problematic, redundant gameplay engine that simply isn't all that it could have been, and the end product ends up being a real shame.  I mean, it takes a lot to make me dislike a game that offers up psychotic, hatchet-wielding zombie monkeys. But someway, somehow Zombie Revenge does just that, and it makes me more than a little ill.  You can clearly see the dilemma that SoA faced when bringing this game to the home market, and unfortunately for them, the overall design of the game wouldn't really be kind to any decisions made during such a process.  Hmmm....what's the best way to explain it. I guess you could say a home version of ZR is a lot like having your girlfriend ask you if she's fat.  Regardless of your answer, you're not going to like the result.  Such is the case here, as the game is obviously designed to make you slam quarters into the slot, and because of this fact, it is a bit too challenging for its own good at times. You just always seem to die at the worst times.  I mean, gee, here comes one ugly mother #$%&*$ of a boss.  Just when you've got him on the ropes...WHAM.  You eat it.  And like any good solider, you have to keep going, because you're not gonna let some bad guy get the best of you.  Oh, no.  So, take into account the fact that unlimited continues have now been locked away inside the coffers of the VMU mini-game and there is no way to save at any point in the game, you're forced to be a really good button masher to get through the game in any normal fashion.  But then in comes the problem of the gameplay itself.  Because of the issues herein, you're probably never going to get there.  The collision detection is dodgy at best, and I constantly found myself wailing on someone with a gun or my fists of fury, and because they were just arriving on screen or happened to be a bit to this side or that, I completely missed them.  You may think I'm just a bad shot, but trust me, if you spend any amount of time with this one, you'll have that ~someone just got out of prison~ feeling in no time.  On top of that, the moves are extremely limited, and pale in comparison to even the abysmally bad Dynamite Cop.  But the move selection and the collision detection are only the beginning of this game's woes.  In truth, you'd be hard-pressed to notice either, as the game's reaction time is so slow when pressing the attack keys that you can hardly pull of the moves that are here without getting hammered by the horde of blood-thirsty zombies.  Punches are slow and sometimes get caught in the system cache and them come out in a flurry a good 2-3 seconds after you hit the buttons, a la Trickstyle, and for some odd reason, pressing the trigger on a gun is a whole hell of a lot more difficult than it should be.  The overall effect of this problem adds to the quarter-crunching mentality I mentioned earlier, as you take a lot of needless damage from enemies that shouldn't even lay a finger on you, and then, of course, you end up dying and have to expend another valuable continue.  But perhaps my biggest gripe is the game's own lack of a sense of continuity in the design phase with regards to weaponry.  Not only is stocking up on guns a physical impossibility, or even picking up two of the same gun and getting extra ammo (which would have been a welcome addition), but for some reason, you lose your weapon upgrades each time you exit an area that requires a loading period.  Even the area you're headed to next is on-screen.  This, my friends, is just plain stupid.  I know if I was an action hero, I'd be thinking ~Man, there sure a lot of evil creepies around here.  I barely made it out of this area alive.  What ever should I do now that I am walking five feet away into the next section of this warehouse?  I know!  I'll drop my more powerful, more efficient method of killing said bad guys!  That's the ticket!~  WhatEVER.  Who in their right mind would let go of a machinegun or flame thrower in the midst of hundreds of baddies intent on eating you lunch?  Not only does it make the game much harder than it should be (again, remnants of the arcade roots of the game), but it defies all logical thought, and that is really inexcusable.   It's things like this that make people think arcade games can't make the transition home, when in fact a little more planning in the conversion phase could have put a stop to almost all of this crap.  Sad.  Especially considering how much Sega has done with this title that is worth remembering.  The character design is just plain bad-ass, and the game is one of the best looking titles on the system to date.  Both the models and the textures are top notch, and the animations are very sweet as well.  All the boss encounters are pretty incredible, and the look of each will have you pretty intimidated, echoing back to the days of 8 and 16-bit, where boss encounters REALLY meant something.  The effects are also pretty cool, such as a little per-pixel lighting, awesome lighting and flames, and real time damage to enemies that leave some of these zombies quite messed up.  I am also pretty impressed with the lengths with which Sega has gone to ensure VMU usage, as you can unlock things such as continues and the infamous ~red-blood~ code by doing well in the available mini-games (which, by the way, are tied to the game's original mode).  But the thing is, they are all wasted on the play mechanics and overall game design.  True enough, this game was created as an arcade experience, and in that regard, you have to respect how clever Sega was at finding subtle ways at weaseling you out of your hard earned quarters, but we've seen home conversions that manage to come off like actual gameplay experiences instead of the chore that this game presents.  It is actually quite ironic.  Sega seems to have both included old elements and made key strategic changes to the game itself to keep it from being a one-shot deal, but in doing so, the end up with a gameplay experience that isn't even worth that in many senses.  I mean really.  Who wants to play a one-on-one fighting mode that is based on a lousy fighting engine in the first place?  Who wants to play through a game over and over again due to a lack of continues or save points when the game's problems only manage to become more and more evident with each play?  Certainly not me.  The fact is, titles like Streets of Rage and Double Dragon were successful at home not because they were deep, engrossing gameplay experiences that left gamers feeling accomplished for completing them, but rather because they were quick and dirty, and solid enough to keep your interest.  Obviously, gameplay has evolved since then, as the lackluster Dynamite Cop has clearly demonstrated, and Zombie Revenge's peerless presentation in the genre is a step in the right direction, but without a more robust gameplay experience, it just ends up being empty and worthlessly frustrating, zombie monkeys aside.     With games like Crazy Taxi and Dead or Alive 2 showing that an arcade game can come home and make you want more, this sort of title gets sent packing to blockbuster (or Hollywood Video in this case), without a second thought.  It is a pretty cool game in a lot of ways, and is certainly worth a look for action fans and casual gamers, but is really more of a chore than the labor of love past beat-'em ups have been.  Think long and hard before you plunk down money that could be purchasing some Crazy Taxi a week or so later.  That's all I'm sayin'.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Jan 22, 2000"}
