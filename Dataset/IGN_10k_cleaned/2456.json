No, I'm not talking about the World's Strongest Man competition on ESPN2 -- I'm talking about the Olympics!  And not just any Olympics, the Winter Olympics. ATD and Eidos have joined to bring you the official videogame sponsored by the Olympics, Salt Lake 2002 for the PlayStation 2.  Ever since I first saw Track and Field in the arcades back in the 1980s, there has been a need to play videogames based on the Olympics. And who could forget the addictive Epyx game Winter Games back in the C64/Atari days? Like with those titles of yore, you begin the game by selecting your name and which country you're representing. Salt Lake 2002 has a total of six events. You heard me right -- only six events: Men's Snowboard Parallel Giant Slalom, Ladies' Alpine Skiing Slalom, Women's Freestyle Skiing Aerials, Men's Ski Jumping K120 Individual, Men's Two-man Bobsleigh, and Men's Alpine Skiing Downhill.  Gameplay All of the events use very few buttons.  The Men's Snowboard Slalom uses left and right on the D-pad, X to crouch, Square to jump turn, and Triangle to change view (this button layout is the same throughout all the events, except for the Women's Freestyle Skiing Aerials.) The sad thing is that like the other skiing events, the Men's Snowboard Slalom isn't very exciting to play. Sure, the gameplay in games like SSX wouldn't exactly fit into a simulation of Olympic events, but there are so many competing snowboarding games out there that mimic the feel and thrill of snowboarding much better than Salt Lake 2002.  One interesting event is the Women's Freestyle Skiing Aerials.  In this event one athlete skis off of a ramp and jumps into the air.  While in the air you have to push a series of buttons and directions depending on what the meter on the bottom of the screen shows you.  It reminds me of Parappa the Rapper.  Failing to hit the buttons at the right time results in a lower score. It's fun, but the gameplay gets stale rather quickly because of the lack of variety.  On the other hand, ATD did a good job at recreating the thrill and speed of the two-man bobsled event. Unlike Konami's winter sports game, Salt Lake 2002 puts you in a first-person view when steering the bob which makes for a much more exciting experience.   But what Salt Lake 2002 lacks is anything out of the ordinary. All of the events in this game have a ~been there, done that~ feel to them. What you're left with are a few winter sports mini games that are less interesting to play than virtually any skiing/snowboarding or Parappa-style game out there. While arcade game fans won't find much to like here, it's fans of the real-life Olympics that will be even more disappointed. As Konami's ESPN International Winter Sports game has shown, Figure Skating can be pulled off very nicely by making it a Dance Dance Revolution type game. And what happened to speed skating, one of the more prominent events at the Winter Olympics? What about Biathlon, the one event that seems taylor-made for a videogame conversion? Someone go play MGS2 and see how much fun target shooting can be.  Graphics Not only does this game play and feel like it's the bare minimum, it doesn't look very good either.  The characters' faces all look very ugly and the backgrounds leave much to be desired.  Just look at the Men's Ski Jumping K120 individual, what are those things on the sides of ski ramp, twigs?  Hair?  And when you ski down the slopes, the snow kicks up behind you, but when you make a sharp turn, nothing.  There's no snow flying off to the sides of your skis, just the calm cool feeling that you're skiing on Styrofoam.  The other thing I didn't like was the ending poses for your character.  I got the worst time in some events, yet my character would jump up and down as if he just got the gold.  Sometimes I wouldn't even know how he felt, he would wave his hands up and down, look around, and retain the same goofy look he had since the beginning when I chose him.  Dude, why are you happy?  You came in eighth place out of eight contestants.  Sound The sound has to be the best thing about this game.  But we all know that sound, by itself does not make a game good.  The commentary is bad but it's nice to know they took the time to put it in.  The music does not take away from the game and only plays when you watch the replays.  I would say the game is trying to be exceptionally realistic, but I'm pretty sure you can make a Winter Olympic game that has better controls than this one.  Every event I compete in feels like the absolute bare minimum.  It hurts to say it, but on balance I have to say this is the worst Winter Olympics video game I have ever played.  Come on -- when you buy an Olympic video game, you tend to want as many events as possible.  This game has six.  Six events?!  I know for a fact that the Winter Olympics has more than six events.  Where's my speed skating?  Where's my figure skating?  And for the love of god where the hell is my CURLING? [Editor's note: you forgot to get pissed about the lack of a luge event, Mark]  If you really need a Winter Olympics game I would suggest playing ESPN International Winter Sports 2002.  I know for a fact the game has more events than Salt Lake 2002, and looks better to boot.", "date": "Jan 31, 2002"}
