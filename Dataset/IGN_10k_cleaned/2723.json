Most people have moved onto the more advanced hardwarerightfully so, but it's a shame if their mentality will sway them away from GBC games from now on. Shantae, actually in development for more than two years, has finally hit the market thanks to Capcomand while it's no Game Boy Advance-specific production, it's a stunning production nonetheless and Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color gamers alike should not pass this one up. Features More than fifty locations Five different transformations Three minigames Battery save (three slots) For Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance Shantae follows the adventures of a sexy half-genie girl set out to stop the sexy pirate girl Risky Boots from acquiring the relics that will enable her to start the stolen steam engine and rule the land. Players assume the role of Shantae and take her across many different lands, whipping enemies with her hair, collecting money to purchase new attacks and moves. Shantae can walk, run, attack, and, when available, perform dances that will alter her form.  This Game Boy Color game is very much like Castlevania and Super Metroid, in the sense that you can only gain access to future portions of the level. Turn into a monkey, for example, and she'll be able to climb up to high platforms and leap higherbut without the ability to attack enemies. Turn into a half-bird type thing and you the sky's the limit. Half the challenge is to know when you'll need to use your powers to get through to the next part of the game. The game also features a bit of strategy, since you can (and should)  acquire and utilize offensive and defensive items to get through some of the toughest locations in the game. WayForward Technologies, the developer of previous Game Boy Color games such as Xtreme Sports, Wendy: Every Witch Way, and Sabrina: the Animated Series, is responsible for this superb looking and playing side-scrolling action/adventure on the handheld. Most of WayForward's previous GBC games have one thing in common: a shared game engine for each of their designs, giving their titles a similar look and feel even though each one is significantly different in their own way.   Shantae uses the WayForward GBC engine at its absolute peak, showing off elements that push the Game Boy Color hardware almost into Game Boy Advance territory. You'll find multi-scrolling backgrounds, water transparencies, night and day effectsif this game was released during the prime of the Game Boy Color life, it would have set a serious standard for other GBC developers to reach. The character animations alone are downright stunningShantae herself is just a work of pixel art by herself, and each enemy has several frames of animation to their design, offering a smooth, professional look to their motions.   But it's not just the look of the game that makes the game such a stunner. Levels are absolutely gigantic with several clever puzzle ideas throughout the adventure. The dynamic day-to-night-to-day effect increases the replay of the levels since hidden items only show up during one of the two time during the day. And it's obvious that the extra time in development has benefited the production of Shantae, so much that the developer created a handful of decent minigames throughout the adventure. And though the game isn't written specifically for the Game Boy Advance, playing Shantae on the newer system will unlock new items, abilities, and brighten the colors up...most GBC games end up a bit darker on the GBA LCD screen, but WayForward adjusts the colors to make them more vibrant on the Advance system.  As excellent as the game is, the design isn't flawless. The camera tends to latch onto Shantae, putting her directly in the center of the screen. Since she's a pretty big sprite, it limits the view of the level around her. You'll be forced to do those annoying ~leaps of faith~ in unfamiliar territory, basically jumping off ledges to reach parts of the level that do not fit on the screenit would have benefited the game design had the developers given players the ability to scroll the screen around the immediate area. And because some of the levels are just so darn big, the game could have used an automapping feature similar to what Castlevania and Metroid use to orient the gamer.   You've had exactly a year to train those eyes to scan the Game Boy shelf for the ~Only for Game Boy Advance~ border on the left-hand side of game boxesbut now it's time to teach yourself to look for the ~Game Boy Color~ border one last time. Shantae is one of the best on the GBC system, and its success on the system pretty much will decide whether or not this genie lass will make it to the big time in the form of Shantae GBAor, even more ambitiously, Shantae PS2, Xbox or GameCube. And you'll be there on the ground floor, able to tell your friends you were a Shantae fan since the very beginningSeriouslythe game is a wonderful platform adventure with excellent puzzle elements, as well as having tons of variety in its level and character design. Shantae looks fantastic as a Game Boy Color game, and pretty darn good on the Game Boy Advancecomparatively speaking, of course. Shantae is in seriously limited release because of the game's lack of familiar branding and lowered demand for GBC product, so get out there and pick this girl up.", "date": "Jun 11, 2002"}
