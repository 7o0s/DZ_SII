I'll say this now - if you're a soccer game fan, you must own this game. Whether you like arcade-style action or deep simulation, FIFA has it all.  For pure soccer realism, you'd be hard pressed to find another game as deep as this one. All of the major soccer-playing countries' teams are represented here, complete with stats and everything else you could hope for. Player control is a dream. You can head, pass, block, and tackle with ease, and every play has just enough realism added to make it authentic but still exciting. The announcing is smooth, accurate, and actually adds to the game, while the camera angles are varied and useful.  How many good things can we say about FIFA? Even if you're not the biggest sports fan, you'll love this game.   Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
