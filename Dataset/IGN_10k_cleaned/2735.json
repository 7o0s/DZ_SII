Forced to take a back seat to NASCAR here in the states, the worldlier racing of F1 is usually under hyped to obscure showings in the early morning on regional sports channels. Only then, do I actually have the opportunity to sit down and appreciate the skill and technique behind manipulating the sleek and powerful sonic machines that the drivers call automobiles.   Additionally, I was a little nervous when I found out that I'd be handling the review duties for F1 2002, as it's considered by many a religion in certain circles. Similar to the popularity of FIFA in plenty of European households and increasingly so in North America, tackling an F1 review is akin to reviewing Star Wars: Die-hard fans will hunt you down and poach you if you don't get it right.   Another concern I had was the possibility of me not liking it. Rarely amused by similar simulations based on the NASCAR license, the prospect of playing yet another racing game on my PlayStation 2 was almost annoying. After all, how many damn axel-and-wheel titles have we had on this system in its first two years of existence anyway? I'm always up for a good experience however (and managed to play through last year's above-average effort with few complaints), so I remained open-minded and dug right in.   Featuressize=5>  Structured much differently than F1 2001, the latest edition reminded me of Acclaim's All-Star Baseball. Requiring you complete team-based challenges for Toyota, Minardi, Jaguar, and other popular licenses, you'll earn trading cards that open up new options and gameplay elements that will help to further your experience. I enjoyed that feature tremendously in All-Star Baseball 2003, and thought it was a great idea here. It's a clever way to get people to try out several teams and expands the possibilities for returning to the track immensely.   Laid out in a similar fashion to that of Gran Turismo, each challenge consists of something different for every team. While Ferrari may ask you to show them your hairpin turning ability, the Renault squad may need you to perform a quick stop before passing a red-zone. Other sessions find you completing full races and other tasks before earning the bronze, silver, and gold versions of a card. Intelligent planning.   There are other ways to enjoy a race however, with plenty of different approaches that you can partake in. Individual exhibitions, single grand prix, full championships, and team duels should give you plenty to do between earning cards. The multiplayer aspect and ability to create your own championship with a unique set of rules is pretty cool as well.   Gameplaysize=5>  The computer A.I. is a ruthless opponent that bashes you, forces its way through bottleneck turns, and slows down only when need be. The good news is I like it. Challenging without being cheap, the competitive intelligence keeps you on your feet at all times. Following real world trends, you'll see everything from the domination of the Schumacher clan to the fierce battle for placement during an initial green light start.   Driving through each level is difficult even without opponents; as well-designed tracks based on their reality counterparts are sharp and extremely fast. Overcompensate even a little bit, and you can quickly move from third to 20th, as you spin out of control and crash into everything in sight. Especially when racing via the simulation controls. Difficult to master even with the most precise steering wheels, playing through using this technique is recommended for experts only. Real-time damage, burnouts, and all sorts of obstacles bully their way into the gameplay and can make for some extremely frustrating racing sessions. I was thankful on more than one occasion just to be able to finish a competition, much less win one.   ~Normal~ racing mode is much more forgiving, with fewer stalls and wipeouts and a more responsive car. While the level of realism may not be up to par with the simulation aspect, it's on the whole a lot more fun. Spend too much time fiddling with steering wheels, analog sticks, and digital pads just to make it past the first marker in the inaugural race, and you'll quickly forget why you're playing in the first place. Normal was easily the preferred racing mode in the IGN offices.   Graphicssize=5>  Identical in almost every way to last year's version, F1 2002 gets the job done, but could have used some improvement. Stuttering around at just under 30 FPS, the much talked about lack of fluidity from the 2001 edition doesn't seem to have been addressed here. It's possible that there have been specific frames of animation removed purposely to increase the sense of speed when moving throughout the level (which has been achieved), but it leaves us with a choppy looking product.   Curiously, driver animations are right on and bolster some additional points to the overall visual score. Subtle movements like removing a visor or pumping their fist after a clever passing maneuver are but a few of the many actions an F1 pilot will perform when in the heat of a race. Other factors, like muck and grass attaching itself to tires independently before being worked out through wear and tear and physically correct crash reactions are worth mentioning as well. Unfortunately, the bizarrely paced fluidity of the track and other objects make for an unbalanced visual effect.   At least the backgrounds have been modified to give a more populated presence to the spectator area, and additional particle effects and light reflections appear to spruce up the presentation nicely. Splendidly handled billows of smoke, realistic weather conditions, and wind-cutting tracer effects on the edges of your opponent's tailfin are appreciated details. If you're looking for a more refined car that's packed full of lines, textures, and moving parts however, you can forget about it. As it seems that the models are identical to the ones used previously.    Soundsize=5>  Somewhat repetitive with its grinding engines and tire screeches, the audibles are nothing you haven't heard before. Apparently lifted from last year's installment, the sound-alike automobiles sound like the real thing, but don't offer too much variety. Since this is a straight racing game though, it's not that big of a deal but varying motor tones would have been more than welcome.   Musically there isn't too much to write home about, with your basic British techno beats popping in at the menu screen and throughout your basic race. Though they do help fire you up for any given event, the similarity between them can get a bit grating. Expanded diversity is a phrase perhaps that the sound team may want to consider for 2003.Much more enthralling to me than NASCAR Heat or CART Fury ever was, F1 2002 is a pleasant diversion from the glut of street racers and stock car drivers that permeate the PlayStation 2. While the visuals need some work and the simulation aspect could be perceived as too difficult, there's plenty to enjoy here.Unfortunately its similarity to last year's game is more than just passing, and for fans that played the previous version; there may not be enough reason to return. But for those of you looking for a new racing experience and can take your simulation with a grain of salt, F1 2002 will do you no wrong.", "date": "Jun 13, 2002"}
