We already played Pinball, but we also got our webs on Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock, a multi-stage platformer.   Features:   Multi-stage action game  Story Mode and Arcade Mode  Run, sling webs, save MJ  Battle Doc Ock in boss fights   Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock is a more traditionally movie game, featuring situations from the flick. It's a multi-stage game, complete with different styles of game play. Are of them particularly spectacular? No. But do they work? Yes -- and they convey a decent representation of the source material. Which isn't bad for five bucks.   The game's story mode follows a rough-hewn collection of scenes, starting with Spidey running across the Manhattan rooftops, looking for MJ. Spider-Man automatically runs from left to right, it's up to the player to either swing across gaps between the buildings or shoots webbing at loitering thugs. In early stages, Spidey's spider-sense tingles, alerting the player of an upcoming obstacle.   The next phase takes players beneath the city, into the cavernous subway system. Spider-Man is chasing Doc Ock through the tunnels. Catch is, the trains are still running. Spider-Man must dodge trains by jumping on to the ceiling. However, if an overhang is coming, you must drop back to the floor.   Finally, Spider-Man comes face to face with Doc Ock himself. This scene plays out like a regular boss battle. Spider-Man is on the bottom of the screen, dodging Ock's tentacles while shooting webbing to stop them from striking. Gum up enough tentacles and Ock is finished.   Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock is an easy game, simple enough for any player to pick up and get into. These are the kinds of games that succeed best on handsets, which is why we expect Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock to do big business for Sony.   The game itself looks decent enough. At times you will be reminded of a Game Boy Color game, with bright, crisp sprites -- and occasionally clunky scaling routines. However, Spider-Man himself looks good, and the boss battle with Doc Ock is well-constructed.   Audio Update: When we played Spider-Man initially for this review, the sound wasn't working right. We played it again this weekend, and heard new effects, as well as musical interludes. When Spidey leaps over buildings, for example, there is a little noise. And when you complete a level, the game pumps out a quick, but good, musical flourish. So, to be completely fair, we decided to update our review with this new info.Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock is not going to win any awards for innovative game design -- but it certainly takes us a step closer toward forgetting last summer's crop of crap movie games. It follows its source material, looks pretty solid, and is an easy play. If you just want a casual distraction, Spider-Man Vs. Doc Ock is a good buy.", "date": "May 24, 2004"}
