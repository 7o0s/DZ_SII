Rebellion was a steaming pile of Bantha poo and Force Commander was only slightly less nauseating than seeing George Lucas in one of those gold bikinis. The only bright spot was Galactic Battlegrounds, a title that applied a thin Star Wars veneer to Ensemble's The Age of Kings. We were understandably squealing with delight when we heard the gang at Petroglyph hoped to set things right with the full on one-two punch of a galactic level strategy game and a cool tactical battle engine.    The result of their efforts, Star Wars: Empire at War, manages to convey all the coolness of the franchise. Players will be able to take hold of nearly every cool toy featured in the original trilogy: stormtroopers shooting it out with rebel soldiers, Rebel frigates blasting away at Star Destroyers, bounty hunters tracking down smugglers, A-wings chasing TIE Fighters through asteroid fields, AT-ATs blasting away at shield generators, the Death Star blowing the crap out of planets. It's all right there in front of you and it's all undeniably authentic.   Sadly, the overall presentation and setting is only half the story. Star Wars: Empire at War still has to succeed as a strategy game. On that level, Empire at War offers up more than a few interesting innovations as well as a handful of disappointments. The innovations and the authenticity of the Star Wars setting will likely encourage die-hard franchise fans to look past the weak points, at least for the short term. Hardcore strategy junkies who are looking for more than just a chance to relive their backyard battles won't stick with it nearly as long.  Where Galactic Battlegrounds merely asked the player to fight a series of battles, Empire at War lets the player take part in nearly every aspect of the Galactic Civil War, from managing production and strategically maneuvering forces around the galaxy all the way to leading bands of soldiers and spaceships into direct combat with the enemy. Empire at War manages to integrate and balance the two experiences very well. Determining just how to build up your forces and take over the galaxy is every bit as important (if not exactly thrilling) as squaring off against your enemy in a face-to-face battle.   The basic setup of the galactic level gives the players a few starting planets and some starting units and a bit of cash. You can use the money to buy facilities on each planet -- mining facilities to boost a planet's credit income, barracks and factories to produce military units, and a handful of other buildings designed to defend the planet or increase its ability to produce. Space stations can be built above the planet and used to create the fleets you'll need to take over the galaxy. Some specialized buildings can only be built by certain factions, or on certain planets. The Ion Cannon, which disables ships in orbit, can only be built by the Rebel player. The Hutt Palace, where you recruit bounty hunters, can only be built on Tatooine, Nal Hutta and a couple of other planets.  As you build up your fleets and armies, you'll want to send them out to take over neighboring planets. If an enemy owns the planet, you'll need to defeat their space forces before sending your troops down to the ground to take control of the planet itself. Owning more planets gives you more resources that let you build bigger armies to take over even more planets. Each planet offers unique bonuses: gaining Mon Calamari will let you start pumping out cruisers and Star Destroyers, Naboo gives Rebel tanks a bonus, Bespin generates bonus mining credits, etc.  The galactic map also makes use a wide variety of heroes, each of whom has a unique role to play in your overall strategy. C3PO and R2D2 allow the rebel player to steal technology from the Empire. Mon Mothma can set up shop on a Rebel planet to reduce production costs on that planet by 25%. In a planetary battle Chewbacca can take command of an enemy vehicle while Colonel Veers can deploy additional squads of stormtroopers from hit massive AT-AT. These heroes can have a massive effect on the battles you're involved in. To counter this effect, generic bounty hunters can be hired and paid off to eliminate a rival hero from the game.      In keeping with the spirit of the franchise, the two sides in the conflict have unique advantages and limitations. The Rebels, for instance, have ready access to all kinds of information on the status of Imperial forces. The Empire enjoys no such luxury. In order for the Imperial player to discover what's going on, he or she will have to send out bounty hunters or probe droids to gather information. The Empire will also find it a bit easier to build up massive armies to smash their way through the Rebellion's defenses. Though the Rebellion can't exactly beat the Empire in terms of production, they can form small groups of units into raiding parties that can easily work their way past Imperial fleets. There are plenty of other differences in the way each side plays but that should at least indicate that the two sides will have to employ very different strategies on the galactic map which definitely adds to the replayability of the game.   There are two storied campaigns, one each for the Rebellion and the Empire. The campaigns basically cover the events between the two trilogies through to the end of A New Hope. Players will be able to take part in many of the more exciting moments -- from helping Han Solo rescue Wookiees on Kashyyyk to intercepting Princess Leia as she flees with the Death Star plans.  The story doesn't ever really go out of its way to provide much context for these events but since everyone on Earth has seen the films, it's not too hard to piece it together yourselves. Things are a little more bewildering in the Empire story. It seems to revolve around Darth Vader's efforts to uncover a traitor but the story never really has anything to do with the missions themselves.   In addition to the two story-driven campaigns, the game also offers a handful of more freeform dynamic campaigns. There are a few scripted objectives here and there during these open-ended campaigns but it's basically up to you to wipe your enemy from the galaxy however you want. I did run into a few bugs in these campaigns. One in particular simply refused to let me invade the Rebellion's final planet. Though annoying, it seems like the type of bug that can easily be patched.  While the galactic management of the game is satisfying, the game really doesn't take off until you actually take part in the full battles. The space battles come damn close to capturing the excitement of the films. The appeal of seeing the different units blasting away at each other is undeniable. Watching the TIE Fighters and X-Wings mixing it up with massive Star Destroyers and Rebel Cruisers will really give you a strong sense of scale. Throw in the massive planet below the action, tons of asteroid fields and tactically significant nebulae and you really start to feel like you're watching a Star Wars movie.      The range of units includes everything from the films, from A-Wings to Star Destroyers. You can even make use of cool hero units, like Darth Vader's TIE, the Millenium Falcon and Boba Fett's Slave 1. Every ship, hero or otherwise, has unique skills that they can use. X-Wings can trade firepower for speed by locking their S-foils. (Most Rebel ships can actually redirect power from weapons to either shields or engines.) On the Empire side, you can make use of tractor beams to hold enemies in place or sensor pings to reveal part of the map. I was a little disappointed that the Death Star can only ever be used against enemy planets. I guess only the second one was able to target capital ships as well.  One of the big problems here though is that there's not much latitude to create unique forces. Because of the way the counters work, you have to create a relatively balanced force if you want to be able to meet whatever threat the enemy puts in front of you. This basically means that both you and your opponent are going to be coming to battle after battle with roughly the same force mix. There's really no room for player innovation or surprise here. Sure, you can bring in Interdictors to stop enemies from fleeing or use Y-Wings to disable enemy ships but space combat is rarely more sophisticated than simply picking the order of targets.   There are some interesting innovations to be found once the combat moves to the planet itself. For one thing, the buildings here don't actually produce any units. (There is a skirmish mode where they actually do produce units but not as directly as you'd find in most other RTS games.) The planet is defended by whatever units were in place there when the invasion began. The invading force is ferried down unit by unit at pre-selected reinforcement points. Each reinforcement point entitles you to have a certain number of troops on the battlefield. Once you reach the limit, you'll have to wait until an existing unit dies or you capture more points with your infantry before you can bring down more units.   While the idea of reinforcement points makes for an interesting game mechanic, it seems a little artificial. Nowhere in the game is it ever really apparent why those areas are more suitable for bringing in new units. It also means that your initial invasion force is limited to a mere handful of units. To be fair, one ~unit~ usually consists of multiple figures -- one AT-ST unit is actually made up of four individual walkers that fight and move as one -- but it's still barely enough to allow for the epic battles that characterize the Star Wars universe. (This concept of reinforcements applies to space battles as well but since the capital ships spawn their own fighters, it doesn't feel as limited.)   Whatever buildings (mines, cantinas, factories, etc.) that have built on the galactic map will be present during the tactical battles. Though few of them actually play a big role in the game, you'll definitely need to worry if the defender has built shield generators or turbo laser cannons. Fortunately, things like shield generators require a separate power generator. Once you take it out, you're able to call in bombing strikes from any bombers you might have left up in space. Each map will include a number of build pads that you can capture with your infantry. Once captured, you can use them to construct healing stations for your vehicles or units or turrets to protect you from your enemies.  It should be mentioned that, while heroes can play a big role in space battles, they tend to be much more effective on the ground. You can basically take out an entire planet with Obi-Wan or the Emperor. Even some of the lesser powers, like Han Solo's machine-scrambling pulse, can really have a massive effect on the outcome of a fight.      The planetary maps aren't quite as open or as large as I'd have liked. They're all full of valleys and impassable mountain ranges (or for the urban levels, streets and large walls) that funnel the action into predictable paths. As a result, there's not much chance to maneuver around your enemies here, which reduces almost every invasion into a head-butting competition with your enemy.  In fact, the only variety you're going to find during the planetary battles is the change of scenery brought about by the Star Wars tradition of having a single planet devoted to every possible type of geography and climate. Desert, snow, lava or forest -- they're all here and they at least keep the action from getting too monotonous.  But while the visual differences are a welcome touch, the actual graphics on the ground aren't all that hot. Sure, I like the walker animations and, sure, the laser fire is pretty to look at, but the geometry and texture of the unit models leaves a lot to be desired. After seeing games like Company of Heroes, these sorts of models really just don't cut it anymore. They manage to support the basic action of the game but they're certainly a real distraction during the cutscenes. This blocky quality is less of a problem with the space units, which are, for the most part, intentionally more angular. The textures on the space units are much better as well.   Ironically, a game based on a lesser-known franchise (or a complete original property) might be able to get away with the types of textures seen here. While it might have worked in Homeworld 2, for instance, too many people know exactly what a Star Destroyer or AT-ST looks like, so any faults are going to stand out even more. Even games that don't have as strong a visual reference, like Emperor: Battle for Dune, can get by with fewer details.  The good news is that the effects and explosions and what not in space are all very well done. Seeing a Star Destroyer crackle with blue ion energy or watching a wave of enemy A-Wings explode in flame is damned exciting. Best of all the larger ships and stations can be destroyed in pieces. Taking out a shield generator or a cannon will cause the part to separate and float off into space. While most ships will eventually completely explode, the largest ships in the game, the Mon Calamari Cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers will actually tear into pieces that linger throughout the battle.   I was very pleased with the camera options here. A full range of tilt, twist and zoom options have been included and they're all very easy to manage. In fact, we may be more disappointed in the appearance of the units simply because the camera lets you get so close to them. A lesser developer might have limited the camera's zoom ability so Petroglyph at least gets points for being brave enough to let us get right down on the action.  At any point during the battle you can activate a cinematic camera that will show you the action from a (theoretically) interesting angle. I say ~theoretically~ because every once in a while the camera seems to be pointing at absolutely nothing. When it does work though it really highlights the spectacular moments of the fight -- whether it's the Millenium Falcon making a run on an Imperial space station or on an Imperial missile frigate dealing a death blow to a Rebel frigate.  As with all Star Wars titles from LucasArts, the sound in Empire at War is very good. With access to the entire library of effects and cues from the films, LucasArts is always able to create a completely authentic aural experience for their games. Since so many of the brand's heroes make an appearance here, it's particularly nice that the sound-alikes match so well.Star Wars: Empire at War definitely scores big in terms of style. Gamers who are looking for an authentic Star Wars experience will not be disappointed with this one. It evokes all the charm and excitement of the childhood action figure wars that have been fought all across the nation over the last thirty years. When you add in the great sense of scale and the comprehensive roster of units available, Empire at War is like the ultimate digital toy box, at least for the original trilogy.What really stinks is that the actual gameplay isn't exciting enough to support the setting. Admittedly, the developers are hampered by the two-sided nature of the fight and by the limited roster of units, but there's just no escaping the sense of repetition that starts to kick in after the first few hours. You'll still enjoy seeing the units fight it out in front of your eyes but you just won't care as much about the tactics of it all. If you're hoping to enjoy this game because you really like Star Wars, you'll probably be satisfied for quite a while. As I said, the game is remarkably faithful to the brand. If, on the other hand, your interest in the Star Wars property takes a back seat to your desire for a solid strategy experience, the few innovations aren't going to be enough to overcome the repetitive nature of the fights.", "date": "Feb 15, 2006"}
