Having been unfortunate enough to ship long after Nintendo's Super Mario 64, the game literally fell between the cracks of the consumer market. With this in mind, we're not exactly sure what prompted developer Japan System Supply and Sunsoft to issue Nintendo 64 owners a sequel, but they have, and it's arrived in limited supply on select retail shelves across the US.Chameleon Twist 2 begins exactly where the original left off. The game introduces a handful of new in-game features to the chameleon's arsenal, but mostly, there is quite a bit more of the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when compared to the wonders that the competition -- wearing the faces of Rare and Nintendo -- are actively dishing out, the color-changing reptile just doesn't compare.Features Four playable characters. Six different worlds with multiple layers of levels. Unique training mode. Controller and Rumble Pak compatible.The Story~It was a lovely day, and Davy and his chameleon pal Jack were playing outside on the see-saw...~ begins the epic tale that is Chameleon Twist. Admittedly, this isn't the sort of a game that needs a compelling storyline to back it up, but we'd be liars if we said our cute-o-meter wasn't at its boiling point. The story continues that, as Davy goes up and down on the see-saw with fellow chameleon Jack, a giant rabbit falls from the sky and lands on it, sending Davy soaring in the clouds above and into another world.The GameChameleon Twist 2 plays almost entirely the same as the original, with a few minor additions. Players control Davy the chameleon or one of his three friends Linda, Fred and Jack depending on personal preference. The characters differ mainly in color. Being chameleons, players a have a number of different options and moves that can be executed at their disposal. Pressing and holding the B button unrolls Davy's incredibly long tongue, which can then be manipulated using the analog stick. The tongue acts as the main weapon and resource of the game, enabling players the power to suck in and spit out enemies, cling to objects, perform tongue-stands and even loop around objects. Quite frankly, the mechanics of the chameleon's tongue are very well executed and literally make the game fun -- just as was the case with the original. New to the sequel is the parasol, which can be opened using the Z button and then used to float across gaps and sail upwards atop jet-streams.The whole gameplay system feels right, controls precisely and is generally intuitive. Unfortunately, however, Chameleon Twist 2 suffers from the same problem that ruined the first game: It's far too short. With only six worlds that, with any practice at all, are too simplistic and easy to master, players will almost certainly run through the game's challenge in no time. Considering the fact that Chameleon Twist 2 has no multiplayer mode, this is inexcusable.GraphicsWhile the visuals in Chameleon Twist 2 are in improvement over the original, the game still looks a far cry from the likes of Banjo-Kazooie or even, for that matter, Super Mario 64. This time around textures are filled with more vibrant colors, but everything still has a very low-resolution dither about it and everything -- be it characters, backgrounds or foreground objects -- is constructed with a very low poly-count, which of course results in generic looking levels void of detail. Just as last year's game was very ~first-generation~ in appearance, so is Chameleon Twist 2 -- just add more color.SoundAs we were writing this review, we left the game on with the music going. In that time, two of our co-workers first asked us and then demanded that we turn down the volume ~or else.~ The music is a cheery compilation of MIDI happiness and glowing, repetitive joy tunes. While it's not terribly awful in short doses, prolonged usage may lead to brain damage. Meanwhile, on the sound effect side, all the beeps, bops and giggles appear to be present. Chameleon Twist 2 passes, but just barely.Chameleon Twist 2 is extremely generic looking, its music may drive gamers mad and, truth be told, it really offers nothing new in the way of 3D platformers. And yet, despite all of this, I find myself enjoying the game for its simple, but intuitive gameplay mechanics. I'm almost ashamed to admit that I love the way I have full control over that wily chameleon's tongue; the way I can send the licker out across a chasm, wrap it around a pole and pull the reptile across.But regardless of how addictive a game's mechanic is, it is by no means all we have to consider. The fact that Chameleon Twist 2 is, like the original, extremely short, weighs heavily on our final rating and, of course, that's to say nothing of the game's first-generation look and sound. All in all, this title is perfect for rental purposes, but we certainly don't recommend shelling out the cash to own it. It's far too easy and besides, Donkey Kong 64 is waiting in the wings.", "date": "Apr 29, 1999"}
