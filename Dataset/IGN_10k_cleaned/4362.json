And while the odd little guy may not strike fear into the hearts of evildoers with a looming appearance, he remains a limbless force to be reckoned with. Whether you like Rayman's unique look or hate it, it is undeniable that his adventures have resulted in some of the best platforming titles to hit the home console and portable scene in last few years. Luckily the N-Gage version of his latest adventure Rayman 3, continues the series' tradition of being charming, imaginative, and just plain fun.  Features Three multiplayer modes Detailed 2D graphics Learn new abilities as game progresses Excellent level variety Breath-taking character animations   The adventure begins when Globox, one of Rayman's close friends accidentally swallows a powerful creature called a Dark Lum. Globox starts acting strange, eventually disappears, and it's the player's job to help Rayman track him down and purge him from the strange and magical creature. Rayman 3 isn't a story-driven game, but the funny and imaginative setting open of the possibility for some very creative levels, which complement its gameplay very nicely.  Rayman 3 slays the current batch (extremely small batch) of platforming titles available for the N-Gage and has enough tricks up its sleeve to impress the most seasoned player. The basic level progression is simple and usually involves traversing an obstacle course to reach an end goal, which is a task much more difficult and exciting than you might expect.  While the basic goal of each level may be similar, there is an excellent amount of variety in the obstacles and techniques required to complete them. Some levels focus on swinging from multiple grappling points, bouncing on a succession of springy platforms, waterskiing behind a speedy snake, or running wildly on the back of a walking missile--what you've never heard of a walking missile before? Just when you think you've seen all there is to see in Rayman's colorful world, it throws you new surprises.  Controlling our limbless hero in all his various situations, whether hovering around, crawling under narrow cracks, or scaling up tremendous heights is fairly simple and well mapped to the N-Gage's number pad. The most common problem doesn't have to do with the controls but with the limited field of vision. As much fun as Rayman 3 is, it occasionally suffers from the ~leap-of-faith~ syndrome common to many N-Gage games. Fortunately, situations requiring players to make a blind leap are kept to a minimum, save for a couple instances where they have no choice but to throw caution, and themselves to the wind.  Anyone interested in picking up this fun platformer should keep in mind that this seemingly cute and child-friendly game has a difficulty level that can have you crying for mommy. While each new set of levels initially introduces new skills and challenges, the difficulty increases steeply and will test the limits of your patience. Self-proclaimed platforming masters will definitely get a healthy challenge from Rayman, but anyone with repressed rage and a case of shaky thumbs might want to use their N-Gage to call an anger management workshop first.  While Rayman 3 isn't a member of the portable 3D club, it does belong to 2D-on-steroids anonymous. Character sprites are extremely clean and sport fluid and often entertaining animations. Just leave Rayman idle for a few moments and he'll amuse himself in a variety of different ways such as bouncing him abdomen like a basketball. Every one of Rayman's actions, from winding up his punch to throwing himself flat on the ground to crawl on his belly are animated with such character and emotion they really bring him alive. Rayman may have hoarded all the really good animations for himself though as enemies never seem to move with an equal amount of finesse.  While you're sweating the jumping and enjoying the visuals, your ears will also be treated to a memorable soundtrack and audio effects. Like in previous Rayman titles, the N-Gage version boasts a versatile score that is fitting to Rayman's sometimes anxious, silly, and magical world. There is also an impressive assortment of sound effects, including expressive gasps, yelps, grunts.  In addition to the single-player mission, there are a few multiplayer challenges where up to four players can compete in capture the flag, burglar and tag modes. Multiplayer objectives are much too simplistic and fail to take gameplay beyond the level of frantic and repetitive lap running. Players should just stick to the single-player mode for the real fun.Rayman 3 is one of the most enjoyable games currently available for the N-Gage, not to mention one of the most polished 2D platforming experiences we've seen in quite a while. As long as you're not afraid of a little challenge, Rayman 3 should not be missed.", "date": "Jan 7, 2004"}
