Last year, the mobile maker managed to take the only reason at the time to buy a PlayStation portable -- Lumines -- and make it better on mobile, thanks to better control, a more manageable play field, and extra game play modes. Now, the blockbuster mobile publisher/developer is working that voodoo on Q Entertainment's Meteos. A hit puzzler for the Nintendo DS, Meteos on mobile is actually more enjoyable for exactly the same reasons as Lumines. Anybody can get into this puzzler and have a good time.   In the original Meteos, you used the stylus to shuffle colored blocks vertically to form either horizontal or vertical lines of three or more like-hued bricks. If you made a match, they would launch toward the top screen. If there weren't enough blocks in the volley to go into low orbit, they slowly fell back down to the bottom screen. You can fire bricks into the falling array and try to make a combo. If you're successful at linking at least three more bricks within the failed orbital push, the grouping rockets back toward the top of the screen.   You could not move anything horizontally, though, and while this was a totally legit design choice that made the game incredibly challenging, it also proved ultimately frustrating to a lot of players. Like Lumines, Meteos was a game that knew no mercy.   Gameloft has this original mode tucked into their mobile Meteos, but it can only be unlocked after playing through the story mode, called Star Quest, with the new mechanics. You must save the planets in our solar system from attack by the dreaded planet Meteos, which appears in the center of the star field as a flaming eye. A cosmic Sauron, if you will. During your first play through Star Quest, you can now move blocks horizontally by switching pairs or push them off column tops on to the next stack. You should also make use of a horde of power-ups, such as the Cross Bomb, that help you clear the Meteos blocks on both land and air. Thanks to these new mechanics, the game cooks.   Each planet hosts three different challenges, selected fro four different events. In Shoot, you must launch specific number of blocks off-screen. Timed mode gives you a required count and a clock the countdown the seconds until the Meteos take over. Puzzle grants you only a couple moves to clear the screen of blocks -- you have to figure out the proper combination of moves to empty the planet. And finally, Boss pits you against an alien monster that patrols that top of the screen. To defeat the boss, you must launch bricks into it and deplete its health bar. Definition of awesome: None of these events are duds. The boss battles in particular are especially satisfying, as menacing masses of eyes and tentacles swarm the top of the screen, just begging to be perforated with spears of freshly launched blocks.   Do yourself a big favor and don't set it on easy, or else you'll breeze through the story too fast. Set it on regular difficulty first and then work your way up from there.   Outside of story mode, you can play the Puzzle mode separately, working through an increasingly complex series of block-filled screens. At first, you'll only have one move to clear the screen, and things are pretty obvious. But before long, the screen is half-full of blocks and you only have four moves to wipe everything out. Is there some way you can turn half of the bottom row into a combo and launch it into the atmosphere? One false move will have you reaching for reset. These puzzles are a stellar addition to the formula and completing them is almost -- almost as enjoyable as story mode.   Survival mode is a toughman contest against the Meteos, as you see how long you can hold out against the cascading array of the colorful blocks. This is really when being able to slide blocks horizontal is a major help, as you can avoid a column poking out of the well with one small click. You aren't avoiding disaster by any means, just postponing the problem for a few seconds while you scan the screen for possible combos. Survival is frantic fun, but it definitely takes a back seat to the Star Quest and Puzzle mode.   Since there's only one Meteos game, it's hard to imagine Meteos having any purists at this point, but I can certainly imagine some fans screaming ~sacrilege!~ about the mechanical changes Gameloft made to the Q's DS game -- on which Craig bestowed a hearty 9. But these changes make the game move smoother and faster, which is perfect for the mobile medium. You can enjoy dropping into quick events in Star Quest for just 90 seconds before moving on with your life. (Although, good luck with putting it down. Once Meteos gets its hooks in you...) And if you really get that bent out of shape about the changes, you can always play it with the original configuration after finishing up Star Quest.   Meteos is a looker, thanks to the original designs of Q Entertainment. The little aliens that grace each planet in the solar system dance and wiggle as you select which world you want to rescue in Star Quest. Each planet has a different well; all of them are colorful, but not so much that you cannot see the blocks clear as the Milky Way in the Midwest sky. Meteos also has plenty of little jingles and sound effects to keep your handset jumping and buzzing. (For the record: We tested the game on a Sony Ericsson w810i.)  Craig wasn't wrong to give the DS edition of Meteos a 9, and with all of Gameloft's improvements for the mobile debut, I feel great about handing over a similar score. I wish there were more planets in Star Quest, as even on the regular difficulty, you can lap the solar system in only an hour or two. But Meteos is stocked with awesome replay value. Not only do can you unlock the original mechanics or play Star Quest with different difficulty levels, but Survival and Puzzle mode will last a long, long time. This is the first must-download game of 2007.", "date": "Jan 17, 2007"}
