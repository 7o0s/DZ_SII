After playing a few rounds of Magical Drop, my eyes are exhausted, and my thumb feels like it's going to fall off. And in the videogame world, that's generally a compliment. Features Story Mode Self-Challenge mode Link cable support for two players For NeoGeo Pocket Color  At first glance, Magical Drop Pocket looks a heck of a lot like another NeoGeo Pocket Color puzzle game -- Puzzle Link. But believe me, these two games are different beasts altogether. In Magical Drop, you're still given the task of connecting like colored pieces of a playfield, but the rules are a little different. You have to grab the colored tile that's above your head, and then throw it back into the mix  only when you connect three like colors together vertically will the pieces disappear, taking other like colors linked in the pile along with them. Once the pieces are out of the pile, the rest of the tiles shift upward, possibly forming more combos. There are wildcard gems that turn into colored tiles when you form links next to them, and there are pieces that cause like colors to disappear all over the playfield when removed  but that's pretty much all there is to the game. But let's not forget the fact that the pile is constantly falling, and once it gets passed the bottom of the screen...it's all over.  What makes this game such a rush is how fast you need to keep up with the pack. You have to constantly move from right to left, grabbing and placing the tiles, usually without letting your brain get in the way. This is one of those ~zone~ games, where you find yourself working on auto-pilot creating chains and combos without giving a second thought to your motions. The computer can throw together chains and combos extremely quick, which makes your life a lot more hectic since the pile keeps dropping...faster...and faster...  The only real design flaw is the fact that you can ~cheat~ the program into giving you combos  as long as you form a link of three while it's still counting the previous link, it'll count it as a combination. This might have been an intentional inclusion, but it just seems wrong to be awarded combo points just because you can work faster than the computer can count.  Chalk another really good puzzle title up for the NeoGeo Pocket Color  this one will really hurt your eyes because they're constantly scanning the entire playfield, so a little warning to your optometrist here. It's also another NeoGeo game with quirky anime characters and silly conversations, complete with the typical SNK japenglish. It doesn't have the little extras that a lot of SNK games have been including, but there's plenty here to keep you hooked.", "date": "Jan 25, 2000"}
