If you fall in either of these categories, read on brother, because NASCAR Legends is definitely a game to race to the store for.  Fortunately for driving game enthusiasts, NASCAR Legends uses the same engine as the stellar NASCAR Racing 3, so you can expect incredibly realistic physics, inspiring visuals and plenty of replayability for its wealth of options. The game begins with an high-speed intro featuring video footage from the 1970 NASCAR season, complete with an Allman Brothers-esque southern soundtrack. It succeeds in setting the time and tone for the game before the player chooses what kind of game to partake in: solo races, a championship season or multiplayer gaming.   The single races are exactly as they sound  individual races where the gamer can choose a driver, track and adjust the options to begin a race with as little or as much car setup as desired (the manual and in-game menus do a fine job in explaining how to build a better racecar in the garage, if so preferred). Gamers can race as, or against, forty-two drivers from the '70 season  many of them sporting lamb chop sideburns if the intro movie is any indication. Of course, you can change any name to your own too, so it's possible to kick Richard Petty out of his car to take it for a spin...    The championship mode is arguably the most exciting of the game modes, but requires more player commitment. Instead of choosing random tracks as in the single race mode, drivers must follow a schedule of races in order to race for a title, then points are awarded by length of race and standing. For example, 100 points is given to a player for coming in first place in a 250 to 399-mile race, with two points less for each subsequent position. Gamers can save their position and return to it another night.   Lastly, NASCAR Legends offers multiplayer support for those who would rather race against a human opponent rather than competing against the game's artificial intelligence (A.I.). It's quite easy to set up a LAN/IPX game, or to play over the Internet as there's a TCP/IP option or to use Won.Net's servers to host or join a game. Unfortunately, I was unable to find many gamers (two races at any given time was the maximum number for every time I looked for opponents). The multiplayer experience itself wasn't so bad - there didn't seem to be much lag during the actual gameplay and it was cool to chat with this hardcore NASCAR fanatic from Arizona (who ultimately whipped my Canadian butt).  Where NASCAR Legends really succeeds is in its ability to realistically simulate the entire driving experience. Granted, I've never driven a real stock car before but everything from the working displays on the car's dashboard (fuel gauge, oil pressure, tachometer, oil and water temperature, etc.) to the audio commands from the pit to smoky chain reaction of a spinout all add to the all-important suspension of disbelief. Hook up your force-feedback steering wheel, turn off the lights and crank up the speakers for an incredibly authentic experience.   As with NASCAR Racing 3, there are dozens of options to create a new driving experience each time. Along with many of the Grand National tracks to choose from (except Daytona, allegedly for licensing issues), gamers can tweak the length of races, weather/wind conditions, damage preferences, number of cars and opponent A.I., just to name a few.   There are also so other goodies embedded on this CD-ROM such as comprehensive driver info, a detailed look at the entire NASCAR season and the piece de resistance - the option to customize a car with the bundled paint shop utility. Already there are dozens of fan sites on the Web dedicated to creating and swapping these custom-built skins.   There aren't many beefs with NASCAR Legends. As with NASCAR Racing 3, it's impossible to change the view of the action from within the race, but rather the gamer must select the camera angle before each race or following it in the replay mode. Secondly, as touched on earlier, it was hard to find people to race against, but perhaps that will pick up as the game continues to build momentum from the racing game community.  Any way you slice it, NASCAR Legends is a highly entertaining, challenging and gratifying way to forever immortalize this classic season in American racing history. And better yet, be a part of it.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Jan 19, 2000"}
