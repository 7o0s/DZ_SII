Well, unfortunately we don't have one yet.  But we do have the next best thing: Trickstyle -- a futuristic hoverboard racing sim from the lads and lasses at U.K.-based Criterion Studios, the developers of such PC titles as Redline Racing and SubCulture.    For the most part, Trickstyle is basically the same game as the Dreamcast version.  However, the PC release of Trickstyle feels like a much more finished product than what Dreamcast owners got.  Hey, you can't blame the guys at Criterion Studios for wanting to get the Dreamcast version out for the system launch, but thank goodness they held onto it for a while and cleaned it up for the PC.  Like the Dreamcast version, the graphics in Trickstyle are absolutely amazing.  Racing takes place in three locales -- London, New York, and Tokyo -- with each area represented by five artistically incredible tracks which focus on unique aspects of each city.  For example, you'll race through the subway system and through Central Park in New York, high in the clouds through the high-rises of futuristic Tokyo (which bears a remarkable resemblance to Cloud City from Star Wars), and even have an opportunity to burst through the face of Big Ben in London.  The art team also did a great job on the high-polygon characters, and they move very realistically when they're ripping through the air pulling off impressive stunts.  The stunt animations themselves are also handled very well, and it's a treat just to watch your character twist and turn in mid-air, basically break-dancing on their anti-gravity boards.  The most impressive visual aspect of Trickstyle is the lightning effects, some of the best seen in any PC game to date.  From the long light trails the hoverboards leave behind as they streak through the sky to the rays of light that are cast from numerous sources on each track, the art team did a great job of portraying an impressive spectrum of lighting effects.  The only graphical problems I encountered in Trickstyle were the occasional clipping problem if I jumped too high and ran off the course, but this was a rare occurance and did little to detract from the overall beauty of the game.  While the game is an artistic masterpiece and could almost stand on its own just for its visual qualities, it's still an action-heavy racer, meaning it has to pass the performance test to make the grade.  No problems here.  Trickstyle moves like a dream, and is incredibly easy to control given the number of tricks you can perform throughout the course of the game.  Although I'll admit I've never ridden a hoverboard before, the game just feels right, and the team at Criterion Studios have done an absolutely amazing job simulating anti-gravity physics.  If you have a 300Mhz+ processor and a decent 3D accelerator you won't suffer from any of the slowdown problems that were so prevalent in the Dreamcast version.  Trickstyle is as smooth as Vincent's bikini line after he waxes ... at least that's what he tells me.  The game is fast, but not so fast you can't control and react to what's going on in the race.  The designers did a great job of combining action with playability, and Trickstyle has my vote for one of the most fun feeling games of the year so far.  Let me tell you now, though, I highly recommend a gamepad for Trickstyle.  It's really the only way to play the game in my opinion.  The keyboard controls work fine, but you don't get the same feel as you do with a gamepad.  If you don't have one already, Trickstyle may be the game that warrants a controller upgrade.  As the name implies, Trickstyle isn't all about racing.  It's about the tricks you can pull off while you're racing.  Not only is Trickstyle the name of the game, it's also the philosophy behind the design. and you have to look good while you're pulling off sick tricks like triple flips, boogiedrills, and bones.  You'll start off your hoverboard career with only a handful of stunts under your belt, but throughout the game you'll have a chance to learn new tricks by beating your trainer at certain challenges between races.  For example, you might have to race against him through a series of hoops or grab glowing balls suspended in the air in a certain amount of time.  Unlocking new tricks will keep you coming back to the trainer for more challenges.  These physical challenges are actually a great way to learn your new skills, and you'll have the opportunity to practice your newly learned tricks in the three stunt areas without having to worry about racing.  This part of the game is a lot of fun onto itself, and you can literally spend hours just twirling and contorting wildly in the air with no particular goal or purpose.    If Trickstyle has any weaknesses, and that's a big if, then it's lies in the audio and lack of Internet play.  Yes, you can play 2-player split screen on the PC, but the ability to race against six live opponents over the Web or LAN is something this game is screaming for.  As far as the sound goes, it doesn't live up to the impressive visual presentation. The repetitive techno soundtrack quickly became annoying, so I turned it off about five minutes into my first session and never turned it up again.  At least this let me focus on the sound effects, which are subtle and sparse but well done.  The characters themselves also occasionally shout a few canned phrases, which, while recorded well, get repetitive after only a few races. Complete voice-overs for all of the characters would have been cool, especially for the trainer since you're obligated to read multiple pages of text every time you're presented with a new challenge.  It's not that the audio portion of Trickstyle is bad, it just doesn't do justice to the rest of this amazingly gorgeous and slick game.  After reading this review, it's not hard to tell that Trickstyle is a real winner, and it's getting a lot of play by everyone at the office.  I actually had to remind Vincent quite a few times that I was the one reviewing Trickstyle as I took the game from him, and I caught Mr. Robot licking the Trickstyle CD and whispering sweet nothings into the center hole on more than one occasion.  With that said, Trickstyle is certainly a game that makes a worthy addition to any software library and I highly recommend it to everyone.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 23, 1999"}
