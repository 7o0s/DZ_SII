{"name": "Chicken Run", "name_review": "Chicken Run", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/17/chicken-run-9", "text": "Terrible children's movies typically spawn even worse platform games.   Luckily for home audiences, neither the Chicken Run film nor the predictable  interactive spin-off fall into either of these categories.  In fact the  motion picture performed way above critics' expectations, having raked in  beaucoup bucks at the box office and garnered cult status with the young  'uns.  Mind you, the stealthy antics featured by this enhanced PC port of  an extremely console-centric title can't lay claim to that kind of success.   On the other hand, they will however satisfy plucky consumers looking for a  fairly humorous product that's none too complex.  It's not the average, everyday product which casts players in the role of a  chicken. Then again, nothing about Chicken Run besides the quality of its storyline  qualifies as normal.  Per the cinematic-displayed plot, players are a  talking hen named Ginger hell-bent on escaping from Tweedy's Farm.  With the  aid of superhero poseur Rocky and other familiar faces like Mac and Babs,  not to mention the person behind the keyboard, the heroine might just live  to see the correct end of a pot pie.  Admittedly, this is probably the  lamest setup of the season, but although the setup sounds ridiculous, it  actually makes for a rousing adventure that's essentially a barnyard version  of Commandos or Metal Gear Solid.  Pessimists will find their doubts melt away once the gameplay starts.  A  miniaturized radar proves the amazingly versatile device around which events  unfold.  While you explore, collect, and bounce across a full-screen view of  Ginger's immediate surroundings, this readout provides feedback on enemy  activity.  Foes like dogs and Mr. & Mrs. Tweedy prowl the grounds of each  environment, hoping to catch wily cluckers in the act of skidaddling.   Avoiding these hazards, each displayed as a blip with a cone shaped line of  sight indicator attached, long enough to pick up special items is the main  goal.  Draw too close and the radar lets you know you've been spotted,  providing a moment's warning before all hell breaks loose.  At that point  it's either run like hell or get caught and lose an item.  While you can't  'die' per se, except during boss sequences, the annoyances associated with  being captured are incentive enough to plan operations in a low key manner.  Sneaking around chicken coops searching for goods can be a rewarding  experience.  You'll acquire a taste for covert ops in addition to a knack  for vamoosing when the fit hits the shan, both of which are fueled by the  simplistic, highly responsive control scheme.  That's all well and good,  seeing as how every puzzle and mission goal undertaken in pursuit of  building a new gadget demands one or more object collection expeditions.   The ends at least justify the means, because several of these special items  can be used for practical purposes, such as when Ginger hides beneath a  boot, or as distractions in sticky situations. While the goofy play mechanics just described can't sustain a long term  relationship (and what non-strategic or FPS title can these days?), they're  good for a few hours of mindless enjoyment before your cortex reverts back  into its usual mushy state.  Eidos tried to be clever and avoid this fate, though.  Mixed in with the  standard stages are silly mini-games and special levels.  If desired, gamers  can sometimes skip egg catches and other obvious filler, but they can't  avoid certain end sequences.  Thus you'll be stuck performing a mannequin  balancing act or slogging through some other fruity arcade sequence now and  again.  Shame that the developers weren't smart enough to have taken the  McGruff stance on the issue and just said no altogether.  Nonetheless, the  complaint carries little weight, given how the screwy interface responsible  for the extreme difficulty level of these vignettes (previously a major  point of contention with the console versions) is no longer an issue.  Of greatest import as negative impact goes is the unpredictable AI.  Once  latched onto a scent, bad guys will steamroll their helpless victims.  Yet  that involves noticing an errant chicken first.  Though dogs seem almost  preternaturally aware of one's presence half the time, you can stand halfway  up their rectum the rest with no adverse effects.  Also the red flashes and  blaring alarm sounds that let you know when a goon's spotted Ginger's  feathered bum could induce a seizure.  But how exciting is it when you  discover that you can avoid a restart by standing in a corner where  troublemakers can't reach the heroine?  Even if they're staring right at a  cornered victim, under the aforementioned circumstances the helplessly daft  evil buggers eventually give up and move on, letting one escape their  current predicament.  Sad thing is, the AI's actually sharper than on its  PlayStation or Dreamcast cousins.  PC owning moviegoers will also benefit from an enhanced visual  presentation.  Day and nighttime scenes are much easier on the eyes thanks  to home computers' expanded color palettes and improved texture display  capabilities.  Even the characters sport more fluid movements and  animations.  Apart from occasionally scratchy sounding, but professionally  delivered British voice-overs, the offbeat sound effects also won't  disappoint.  Like the flick, this game has an appropriately cartoonish feel,  though it may alienate mature geezers because of the juvenile decor.   Because the quirky atmosphere and arcade-like audio effects are honestly  suitable for adults as well, hopefully it won't be a major turn-off.  Released with the fanfare of a new Yanni album, this title will likely exit  stores as quietly as it tiptoed in.  And while the masses won't mourn its  passing, those in search of a fun, short-lived action adventure cum platform  game should.  Flawed in many ways, though entertaining in a smidgen more,  Chicken Run deserves a better fate than languishing in bargain bin  purgatory.  Were ports of console products this plausible as a whole, people  wouldn't see so many publishers vacating exclusively for greener pastures.   Quoth the disappointed editorial staff, ~Damn...so much for that rotten egg  pun you had to know was coming.~  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
