He had just met with Peter Molyneux and had some long talks with him about game design, and was still buzzed from the visit. What stuck with him most as we talked was how Molyneux emphasized the importance of keeping clear of release date pressure -- the art of being able to let a game slip back without letting the pressure kill you. If the game is fantastic, he related, then no one will remember years from now that it was delayed six months after the original release date. Still, he was nervous. Garden had worked on some high profile games at EA, but this was his first project on his own, and its high profile status meant that the world was waiting to see what Relic, and Garden, could do with a project that would daunt most veteran designers.  The initial press of Homeworld painted a picture of the next logical progression of strategy games -- 3D. Free-form space environments would be the games most daunting task, especially in a genre that was complicated enough when you were looking down at model-sized objects, let alone an entire world of spacecraft and gunfire. As details were released, the concepts behind Homeworld began to take form, and what appeared was something much larger than expected. Hundreds of ships could be focused on in a giant battle, or you could zoom in to a specific ship to watch the action up close. The storyline was much more involved than most strategy games, dealing with Homeworlds, yes, but all of it drenched with a sober maturity that rarely grace mainstream games. The Relic kids, it seemed, were aiming for something but bigger and nastier than simply a dressed-up Starcraft.  Now it's finally here, and it's so much more than everyone thought possible. Relic not only tackled space, but may have just changed strategy games forever. I'm proud to say that Homeworld isn't for everyone. Casual gamers will find the level of difficulty daunting, and hardcore strategy players may not enjoy the more plot-driven, free-form gameplay that makes up the core structure of Homeworld. Relic has created a specific gaming experience that can be much more comfortably compared to film than to gaming, with its story-driven missions, surprise twists, and majestic views. And it's all worth it. The complete package is an experience to behold, and unlike movies, something you can experience first hand.  The Homeless Race  The Kharakid live on a world so hot that they must keep at the poles in order to stay alive, and in their misery, some come to the conclusion that they may not have been built for the world at all. Scientific research begins to prove no real similarity to any plant or animal life on the planet, and word begins to spread, despite cries of heresy, that the populace may not have originated from the planet. Then, a discovery -- a ship is found in the desert, which puts an blunt end to the debate. The ship pushes the world's technology forward thousands of years by giving researchers access to previously unknown technologies, and building begins. Then, the guidestone is found -- a map which shows the way to the true home of the Kharakid, Hiigara. The people of Kharak unite to build a mothership, and many years later, the planet is finally ready to return home. But their adventure is about to begin, because they have no idea what lies in space, and what is in store for them --  and neither do you. The information given about the game doesn't even hint at the amount of story told in the game, the plot which moves the gameplay in a way we've rarely seen in gaming, and have never seen in a strategy game before. Twisters like Half-Life and Grim Fandango may have shocked you with surprises, but Homeworld will have you rapt with attention as mysteries are solved, and information is revealed regarding the true history of the Kharakid, and the dangers lying in wait for them.  Mouse Power  After you finish the extensive, clear tutorial, you can begin the first couple of missions, which take you through the more advanced control concepts in the game. You can choose to play as the Taiidan or the Kushan, which not only designates the look of your ships, but chooses which race-specific units you'll have access to, such as the Taiidan Defense Fighter and the Kushan Drone Frigate. Controls are a mixture of mouse and keys, which you should memorize, and quickly. Knowing hotkeys can be essential to winning the game, and drastically reduce brain strain when you're trapped in the midst of heavy battles.  Units are laid out in three categories: strike craft, capital ships, and super capital ships. Strike craft are your most plentiful early in the game -- Scouts and Interceptors can be built quickly and cheaply, and provide some slick firepower against large groups of small enemies. Capital ships are much harder to destroy, and though they are more expensive, become a smarter fighter of choice as you progress farther into the nebula. Do enough research, and you'll be able to add multiple guns to create craftier capital ships, as well defensive measure like Support Ships, which are repair carriers made to aid your ships in battle. Super capital ships are such beasts as the Destroyer, which are slow but unstoppable machines to set against your more formidable enemies. Other units include Probes, Research Vessels, and Resource Controllers (ships that can aid resourcers in getting resources into your pocket much quicker).  The key to winning battles is learning how to combine your ships, how to group them, and when to use them (check out some of the formations available in our movie below). No more sloppy clicking and waiting -- you need to actively watch your ships and what they're attacking, and learn to react quickly. The wrong set of ships can quickly become scrap metal when pushed against a faster, smarter, better organized group of foes. A variety of formations and tactics can be attached to groups, which work in specific environments. If this sounds confusing, it will be -- at first. You'll get used to it quickly. Each mission offers clues as to the weaknesses of your enemies, and if you listen to your groups closely, you'll get constant updates as to the status of you ships, and the pilots. Relic has also added a feature that you'll be using to save yourself, often -- pause. You can pause the game at any time, and reselect units, change formations (it won't be implemented until you unpause), and view the battle from any angle. It not only gives you breathing room, but it allows you to make decisions ahead of time when the going gets rough -- and believe me, fights will get messier than you can imagine during large-scale battles. Though it's simple to switch between groups in the game, and select ships, we did have a complaint in the office -- it's near impossible to find a specific ship without having to look around by hand. Having a menu with your total ships, and allowing you to choose from them would have been nice.  Station to Station  The mission structure is like nothing we've played in strategy gaming before. Instead of being structured on a mission-to-mission basis, Homeworld is one game separated by chapters -- with each segment filled with pits, traps, and surprises. It not only means that you can never be sure when a mission will truly be over, but it means that you have to watch your team that much more carefully. This means that the units you build in the first mission will still be with you in the fifth, which makes for some interesting issues. Like all strategy games, you must mine resources, but Homeworld's are parceled out in every mission. Limited resources mean that you can't build indefinitely. Once an area has been scoured for resources, there's no other option but to wait until the next hyper jump point to get more. What this creates is a need to think over every unit that you build in the game, rather than just building until you've exhausted your resources, or beat the mission. It also means that individual units are much more valuable. If you lose your resourcers, or a research vessel, then you've lost a vital lifeline, and the time and money it takes you to rebuild them could mean disaster for missions later in the game. It can be frustrating, and yes, it may mean you have to go back and play an earlier mission more than once until you get the hang of it, but it's a much smarter and more realistic approach to strategy gaming.  As you look into the details of the game, you begin to realize just how bent on (if you want to get film-geeky) magical-realism the Relic team really is. There's a lot of fantasy going on in with the gameplay, but the important concepts have been thoroughly thought out. You'll quickly notice that enemies no longer have damage gauges -- you'll have to get used to finding out for yourself just how damaged your foes really are. And get ready to be on your toes. A mission may start out with a simple task like resourcing pieces of a nebula, and end with you holding on for dear life while trying to fix your hyper drive while dodging hundred of ships while defending your resourcers while praying that their capital ships don't take you out... and so on. And that's just touching on one of the concepts.  What Homeworld has captured that almost no other game has is the seamless integration of storyline and gameplay. Even Final Fantasy VII and VIII, bastions of the big story, still pull you out of long conversations for some dungeon crawling. It becomes predictable after a while, despite the underlying story's unpredictability. Homeworld changes the rules completely by having each mission built upon a segment of the story. To mention the details would ruin the story, but it's safe to say that before long, you'll be waiting on the edge of your seat waiting to see how a mission will end. Sending a probe into a new area may discover things you'd rather not see, and may not be prepared for. And even when you think you have the upper hand, you may just find that your enemies were tricking you all along. New enemies appear, secrets are unearthed, and lives are lost -- mostly yours. What does become sacrificed because of the storyline is the difficulty level. Surprises mean that you must always be ready for a huge battle, sometimes even before you have the time to prepare. There is no difficulty level in the game, simply a set of missions which quickly become deadly. Once you've learned the basics, you're almost immediately thrown into a huge battle, one which will burn up most casual gamers. You should expect to spend quite a bit of time replaying each level to figure out strategies and approaches, and even more time honing your skills with the ships and their intricacies. For some, this will mean frustration, but for those of you willing to put the effort forth, you'll find that the levels aren't impossible at all -- just smart. Once you figure out the correct tactics and approaches to each mission, it becomes much easier, and more satisfying. Even when I was banging my head on certain levels, by the time I was done I felt a sense of accomplishment I rarely experience with a video game.    Sense Surround  The design team tackled the problem of making distant space seem alternately cold and familiar by creating a dynamic environment -- as you progress through the game, the nebula you see in the distance will get closer, until you find yourself lost in it's red glow. Just being able to get your bearing adds a sense of security to the game, while making you feel very, very alone. The individual ships in the game didn't start out so hot -- we loaded up the game and began playing, and noticed how pixelated the game looked. The ships looked nice from afar, but close-up, they seemed incredibly dated. Still, the gameplay shined. Seems we never noticed a slight glitch where it automatically starts the game up in software mode. Yeeks. The two selectable races in the game are both incredibly alien in design (Peer insisted on calling the Taiidan mothership a flying toaster), and intricate in detail. Zoom into a battle, and you'll actually see individual turrets targeting enemies, and jet boosters flaring as it changes direction. Once you get farther in the game, you'll get the pleasant surprise that the Taiidan and Kushan forces are actually the most conservative ships in the game. It only gets better.  The music uses a mixture of tracks which sound nothing like game music -- the opening songs are taken from classical choral pieces, while later pieces sound similar to Peter Gabriel's Passion album. It's ambient and moody, and fits much more snugly with a vast strategy game than you'd expect, so much so that you'll wonder why anyone bothered to use guitar and loud, thumping techno in the first place. Voices are, like the space environments, a mixture of cold military gamespeak and emotional speech. Homeworld never reveals the humans which reside in the myriad of ships you control, and rarely refers to individual characters, which makes the voice acting that much more crucial to connecting with the gameplay. Homeworld pulls it off, having you feeling for your mothership in ways that you though you never could... or never should.  Multiplayer options are exactly what you'd expect -- up to eight players can take each other out on a variety of arenas, using pre-set resources, or by having to use a Resourcer to gain material. Goals range from the standard ~destroy your enemy~ goals to the more intriguing Bounty Hunter missions, which give you resources for destroying enemy ships. What's even nicer is the you vs. computer option, which allows you to fight against computer bots and get in some needed practice before taking on your smarter, human foes. I played most of my battles with Stephen, who proceeded to destroy my ships and my spirit in no time flat. Fortunately, I gained the upper hand by pouring Coke on his keyboard and replacing his Chapstick with Krazy Glue. We not only had fun, but he learned a valuable lesson -- never beat anyone at anything ever again.   The sound (like all the elements in the game) shines on its own, and like all great games, comes together to create something unexpected, and new. Homeworld is an original gameplay experience that has as much in common with Zelda as it does with Command & Conquer. This isn't just a reworking of an old genre, or even a fresh concept given to a stale genre. Saying that Homeworld is just a well-done strategy game is like saying that Blade Runner was a nice little Sci-Fi movie. We've rarely played a game with this much substance, and certainly haven't played a game that has had us so excited about the genre in a long, long time. Watch Relic and Alex Garden  now, because you'll be hearing a lot more from them in the years to come.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Oct 1, 1999"}
