{"name": "FunPack 3D", "name_review": "FunPack 3D", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/12/funpack-3d", "text": "Long, long ago there was a time where games had to stand out by virtue of their gameplay because, honestly, graphics technology just wasn't advanced enough to do much more than represent a yellow disc being chased by ghosts on the screen. It was during this time, that the true classics of gaming were forged by developers to give gamers value for their quarter spent. Many remember these games of the past fondly, which has brought on the recent huge upsurge of retro gaming where the older games have come back into vogue again.   Of course, where there's a trend, you'll find the minds at Wizardworks have already set themselves up to exploit it. This time around they've ~re-made~ such favorites as Pac-Man, Asteroids, Breakout, and Missile Command to take advantage of 3D accelerators. We imagine the board room meeting for green lighting the project went something like this:  Executive: New computers that people are buying have 3D accelerators they may not understand.   Developer: I could rip off some game ideas and make them 3D so that people will think they're buying old favorites, but that they will look real pretty.  Executive: Can you have that on my desk by Wednesday? We're shipping Friday.  You see, the sad truth of the matter is that these games they've made feel nothing like the original on which they were based. They aren't fun, and they aren't even that great looking. The box states that these new versions are ~staying true to the spirit of he originals that made them so fun and addictive to play.~ But we can't help but think that somebody has missed the point - ~the spirit~ doesn't really mean ~just as fun~.  Chomper 3D!  The first game in the pack is a remake of Pac-Man creatively titled Chomper. At it's core, Chomper remains closer to the original Pac-Man than the other games in the pack do to the games they're modeled after. After all, you still have to wander a maze (some of which are very close to being rip-offs of those in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man.) avoiding four Ghosts of varying colors while eating small dots. Of course there are ~power pellets~ placed into each corner of the maze that will make the ghosts turn purple so that Chomper can turn the tables and eat them.  While conceptually sound (It was one of the greatest arcade phenomonons ever.), Chomper fails badly in execution. First of all, the game is slow and easy. Things speed up later in the game, but the patience required to get there is formidable. There are also so few dots on the board the game starts to drag right from the beginning and it never really picks up. On top of it all, the ghosts have absolutely awful AI so that you can actually count on them not finding the best path to kill you.  The 3D aspect of the game is the maze itself. While Pac... err Chomper and Co. are all pre-rendered sprites, the game board is true 3D so the camera can be changed to a whole bunch of new angles that make the game much less playable. For those who've ever wondered what Pac-Man would be like in 3rd or 1st person we can now say with certainty that it doesn't work. For those that just have to find out on their own, be warned be cause the ground spins at dizzying speed in these modes and those subject to motion sickness better have an air-bag handy. Those not subject to motion sickness may want an airbag handy just because, well, it's always hard to see happy childhood memories sullied like this.  Meteor Gunner  The second game in the pack stands out because it actually shows some forethought to design. As re remake of Asteroids, Meteor Gunner actually takes the concept of sitting in space shooting rocks succesfully into 3D with its spirit intact.   You play the lone starship from the third person perspective this time around and you are surrounded by a dozen or so hostile rocks. To successfully complete a level you must destroy all of the rocks around you as well as the assorted alien spacecraft that show up from time to time. The problem here is that you are playing in a full 3-Dimensional space yet you can only see the playfield in front of you. To assist with the other 5 sides of your ship a radar has been implemented to help you track everything- but this is confusing to use.  You can now pick up power-ups which will upgrade your ship, which are nice because, without any sort of targeting crosshair you'll spend a lot of time with each rock just trying to hit it. The collision is far from precise as well so you can expect quite a few deaths until you learn that there are no ~near misses~. The real killer, though, is noticeable after some time playing and that it that most of your time isn't even spent in action- it's spent down hunting down rocks or the ships shooting at you. The game is just a little too unwieldy for its own good. The game is still playable, though, and this is the title is probably the best in the pack. Keep in mind that the best in this pack equates with, five years ago, was known as shareware.  Super Brick Breaker  As you can guess by the title, this is a remake of breakout. The 3D hook here is that the game is played from above the paddle with you blocking the ball coming up at you and the bricks being in assorted patterns below. Of course, clever readers may note that you may actually be playing from below and blocking the ball as it falls down but, since there really isn't any backstory you'll just have to deal with our description.  This is an obvious way to do the game, but surprisingly it doesn't work very well.   The main problem is that it is very difficult to judge the exact depth of the ball in relation to your paddle so you tend to miss it a lot. This is further compounded by the fact that every time you hit a block, the numbers for the point value come spiraling out at you, obstructing your view. Even the ability to grab the ball, which you are given at timed intervals, doesn't help enough because you still can't catch the darn thing. In the ensuing chaos of powerups like multi-ball and dual paddle, you must rely on sheer luck alone to get you through, and that's not any fun. Bottom Line: There is no fun here. If you are looking for ~fun~ we recommend that you go somewhere else.   Missile Defense  The final game in the Funpack is a remake of the classic Missile Command. This game is fun for about 5 minutes before the tedium sets in. Basically, you control the lone cannon defending the cities on the ground from oncoming missiles.  The game is actually quite similar to the original in terms of gameplay except for one strange design decision- making the play field larger than the screen. This means you constantly have to watch the radar to see where missiles are falling and then scrolling the screen there, which detracts immensely from the action. Now you're not testing your reflexes against missiles- you're constantly just watching the radar. All of the effects and eye candy in the world doesn't mean squat if you're not really watching the gameplay.   The lack of variety is also a killer (even in the original game) and the difficulty doesn't ramp up anywhere near fast enough to hold interest. Just like the other games in the series, Missile command might have been fun if they had balanced it some. Or maybe (gasp) played it....  Overall, while we're sure the game wasn't aimed at gamers, the obvious lack of effort that has been put into it is appalling- especially when you consider that this pack could have been fun with some polish and playtesting. It's just sad that people see the need to crank out software with no regard to the quality of the title when, with just a bit more work it might be a worthwhile diversion. In a market where you can find excellent games for $20 that are just a few months old, this is not a good way to spend your money. While non-gamers may enjoy this product due to its ease and flash, we recommend that you steer clear.   -- Blake Fischer", "date": "Feb 12, 1999"}
