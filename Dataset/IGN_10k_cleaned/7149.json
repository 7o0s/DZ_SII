Return of the Jedi had just hit the theaters, reminding everyone that Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were no flukes. Video arcades were filled with out-of-this-world space shooters that, for a few moments at least, transported players away from their earthly confines and into a far-flung galaxy of adventure and futuristic weaponry. And in 1984 came The Last Starfighter, a hidden gem of a movie about a high school kid so proficient at shooting down marauding spacecraft at his local coin-op that he was recruited for a real life defense of the earth.   Fast-forward to 2006, a time when we all know the biggest threats to our planet come from within our own atmosphere. Nevertheless, there's at least one design studio that hasn't forgotten the spirit of '84. With DarkStar One, Germany's Ascaron Entertainment comes straight out of left field and smashes onealmost out of the park. Baseball analogies aside, DarkStar One is a smooth-moving, smooth-playing sweetheart of a game that'll satisfy both the space adventurer and the space warrior among us. It looks good, it feels good, and it's completely scaleable to every rank of pilot. Though the plot is hackneyed and the periphery somewhat repetitious, the game rarely crosses the line into boredom and should therefore keep space nerds happy for some time to come.    In DarkStar One, you'll play the part of one Kayron Jarvis, an up and coming young pilot who's just as eager to battle enemy ne'er do wells as he is to track down more information regarding the suspicious death of his father. As luck would have it, both wishes can be filled within the context of the game. You see, Kayron soon meets people who know a lot more than he does about dear old dad's final few months and days. He also has the good fortune of arriving just as his own solar system comes under attack by all manner of pirates, mercenaries, and assorted dastardly villains.   Unlike most of us poor shmucks, whose first taste of motorized transportation likely featured the words ~Ford~ and ~Escort,~ Kayron almost immediately becomes the proud owner of a brand new spacecraft. A gift from his father from beyond the grave, the game namesake ~DarkStar One~ is as experimental as they come, and quickly becomes the star of the show. Kayron will stick with this craft throughout the game, a fate that isn't nearly as dull as it might seem.   Truth is that DarkStar One isn't your average fighter. As it turns out, Kayron's dad was into some seriously wild engineering before he passed on, and he instilled a ton of that engineering into Kayron's inheritance. Like a hippie's diet, the DarkStar One is, like, organic, dude. Indeed, it's fully capable of becoming something much bigger, much more advanced, and much more unstoppable than it initially appears to be.    Of course, in the interests of believability, the various ~artifacts~ required to transform this comparatively sedate fighter into a fire-breathing monster are scattered across the four corners of the galaxy - some in particularly odd places like the middle of hollowed-out asteroids.    It is Kayron's purpose, therefore, to source out and gather up all the artifacts. It is also his purpose to participate in and emerge successful from the missions he is given. Some missions will include the fiery destruction of enemy craft. Others will ask him to tow cargo containers from one solar system to another. Still others will have him zipping about hither and thither to meet up with certain powerful people, or just to find a good hiding spot for a little undercover work. Soeven though most of his sorties will begin and end in rather repetitive fashion - by leaving and returning to one of the many identically structured space stations he finds in each new locale - and even though the game squeezes him into a linear plotline, there is variety to be had.   Moreover, Kayron's official missions are just part of the story. Along the way, he'll take care of personal business too. He might transport goods and products, ensuring that the customers on the receiving end are willing to pay a good buck. He might involve himself in a little smuggling, facing the threat of police persecution and a possible criminal record for the potential reward of a big payday. He may even pop a cap in the rear of a neutral or friendly craft, just to gain the reputation of someone who can't be messed with. And he'll battle a hodge-podge of enemy craft - sometimes out of necessity when he's suddenly accosted, but other times just to play the part of bounty hunter and score credit points to purchase weapons, navigational aids, and other perks. As time goes on, Kayron will find himself piloting one heck of a nifty ship.   One of the game's great strengths is its surprising simplicity. The cockpit, for example, initially seems rather cryptic. However, it's rendered and conceived in such a way that Kayvan's multitude of duties never seems overly burdensome. Using your joystick to steer and shoot, your space bar to activate your mouse, and your mouse or hotkeys to access items such as your logbook and your all-important navigation chart, you'll rarely have a problem with logistics. Keeping track of the items you need, the items you have, the places you've been and the places you need to go involves a little on-the-fly referencing, but it's never a hassle.    Indeed, DarkStar is a shining beacon of user- and rookie-friendliness. The printed manual is, in a word, superb. It exhaustively describes absolutely everything you need to know, and does so without being dull or confusing. The game's narrated, playable early tutorial missions are foolproof yet instructive, gently leading you into full control - like that grade school swimming coach who'd keep a hand under you until you eventually floated off on your own.       But despite DarkStar's adventuring nature, make no mistake - it is foremost an exercise in dogfighting. Hardcore simulation pilots may have some issues with the simplicity of the flying model, but the ship is definitely realistic enough to be more weighty and less maneuverable with a heavy payload, and turn and roll like it's in a no-gravity environment, and get ruffled up by its own afterburners.   In any case, the thrill of old school space fighting is once again alive and well. The game's weaponry is wide-ranging and thoroughly harmful, the enemy pilots are intelligent enough to pound you into smithereens if you let them, and the pyrotechnics are magnificent - particularly when displayed against the backdrop of an especially dark bit of space. Incoming ordnance doesn't shake you around as it should or look as scary as it is, but there's certainly no mistaking when you finally succumb. Unfortunately, you'll never succumb to another real life human opponent, because DarkStar One doesn't support multiplayer.    It does, however, support the idea that space is a beautiful place. Game developer Ascaron has concocted a killer color palette that'll knock your socks off when you first get behind the wheeler, stick. Take just one flight through an asteroid belt with a white-hot glowing sun in the background and pinkish hues all around try not to be impressed.   Monster ships and space stations are detailed, fully animated where they need to be, and incredibly impressive. Some vessels are long and lanky, others are tall and thick, and even others break apart into separate sections. Rocket trails burn in the distance and artificial lighting flickers. Weaponry effects are so-so, but the resulting explosions will play havoc with your monitor.   Yet after you've played for a few hours, you get a sense that you've seen much of it before. And indeed you probably have; the many solar systems on display are, in most respects, strikingly similar.    The game's audio adds ample oomph to the proceedings, especially during the battle scenes when the dynamically engineered music takes a dramatic turn. Explosions rock the floorboards of subwoofer-equipped systems. And all the while, the verbal taunts of your adversaries, who somehow seem to have a lock on your radio frequency, filter through to your cabin to annoy you even further. Even between battles when you're merely flying about, you'll hear various friends and foes talking up a storm.       And the DarkStar One? Well, it can be tossed about impressively once you've fitted it with the right stuff and learned how to use the many directional controls to your advantage. And it's nothing short of a killing machine when you've loaded it with guns, cannons, missiles, and anything else the game has in store. Just be sure to use a joystick for flying, because mouse control in this game is ugly.    Unlike some space sims, DarkStar One doesn't burden you with long stretches of monotonous flying. Yes, you're often compelled to travel great distances, but you can utilize your ship's hyper jump capability to warp yourself across particularly large gaps, and its afterburners for short hauls. If you're really stuck for time, you can always engage the time acceleration feature. Be careful though, because every object can be crashed into.   Unfortunately, unforeseen crashes may not always be confined to the on-screen action. We were unceremoniously dumped from the game not once, but twice during our testing. Both times we were greeted with an exception error message direct from the Ascaron website, where we believe we were informed that the error would be reported and addressed in the next patch. We weren't sure, however - the error message was in German.DarkStar One faithfully takes us back to those glory days of yesteryear, but with all the advantages of current technology and far more depth. It's a bit mundane in spots, it really doesn't deliver anything new, and it likely isn't authentic or complex enough for serious sim-heads. But for sheer shoot 'em up fun in outer space, enhanced with enough peripheral activities to make things interesting, there isn't much out there today like it.", "date": "Aug 23, 2006"}
