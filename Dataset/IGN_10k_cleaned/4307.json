In fact, it really wasn't even that popular on the PlayStation when it was released years ago. But Gameloft saw something in it, something sinister that deserved to be taken on road trips or enjoyed in train stations, and now the undead are back in play on your cellphone. Is it worth your scratch, or should you put garlic on your phone to keep it away?  Features:  Boss battles Undead hordes Backgrounds inspired by 19th-Century Prague. Prague, fool!  You are a monster hunter, seeking to free your homeland - Prague - from some, well, nightmarish creatures. The beasties have been sent forth by an evil wizard and are currently terrorizing the helpless citizens. Take up your blade and gun to rid the metro of zombies and gargoyles.  Or don't. Your choice - as there really isn't anything wondrous about the game, but there realy isn't anything that bad about it either. Ah, the curse of middle-of-the-road mediocrity.  Nightmare Creatures is a very, very simple game. You run from left to right, vanquishing monsters with a few attacks. If you manage to find some power-ups, you can use your pistola to blast the baddies back to the beyond, or cast spells that make monsters go boom. The little animations that go with your attacks are decent - limited, but decent. They certainly look better than the shambling zombies, who seem to have only two or three frames to shamble in. Talk about ugly.  The action unfolds over seven levels. From the city (which does look pretty solid - we could tell it was Prague, but mainly because for a while, it seemed every movie was filmed there) to the sewers, you'll battle wave after wave of unending evil. So unending that things begin to get a little boring. Now, if you dig on Final Fight-style game play, where you pound buttons to kill, kill, kill, Nightmare Creatures may be your bag. But for gamers needing a little variety, there are far better Gameloft titles to check out -- Splinter Cell and XIII come to mind.  It does help that you do learn new attacks as the game progresses. And it is nice to see that when Gameloft offers three levels of difficulty, they actually mean it. Play Nightmare Creatures on 'hard' and it's by far more arduous than the cakewalk 'easy' setting. I've played better. And I've certainly played worse. That's the trouble with games like Nightmare Creatures. They're so mediocre, it's hard to really get a bead on them. I mean, you don't wanna poop on Gameloft for offering something decent, but it's hard to get excited when there are far greater games available for your handset. So, if you really get into side-scrolling brawlers and are willing to settle for a decent showing, by all means, download it. Otherwise, move long and save your strength for bigger, better fights.", "date": "Dec 6, 2003"}
