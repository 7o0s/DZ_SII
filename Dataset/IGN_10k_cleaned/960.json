{"name": "Rugrats: Totally Angelica", "name_review": "Rugrats: Totally Angelica", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/27/rugrats-totally-angelica", "text": "The impression in the gaming community of how to attract female gamers (a massively growing sector of the gaming fanbase, and by the way, welcome to you if you are a new girl gamer reader) is to take old cliches about what girls like (puppies and kitties and babies and clothes), slap some pink on the graphics, and throw together a base of lunkheaded gameplay retreads in hopes that ninny, prissy girls might put down their mascara cases and diaries for just long enough to buy this cheap product.  It's a whole new century, fellows, and those pony gals have been replaced by career women, superstar athletes, and intelligent baby lasses with bright futures. Sure, some of them exist, and maybe even a little part of that still exists in every girl (just as slugs and snails and puppy-dog tails are still part of my sensitive man pose). But to undermine the abilities of female gamers by making slap-dash titles like Rugrats: Total Angelica is pathetic and insulting.   Features:  Nickelodeon Rugrats characters  Six mini-games plus one final battle  Swap outfits and accessories with other players via Infrared Port Only for Game Boy Color   And that's just the start of my criticism of this vehemently mediocre game. Saying that it's a bad girl game hardly hedges on the fact that the control is pitiful, the excitement level is flat-lined, the graphics are lilting, the wonderful Rugrats characters are horribly misused, the soundtrack uses none of Mark Mothersbaugh's themes (even though Factor 5's sound tools were licensed for the music), and the game in general is pointless and duller than snot.  The game concerns Angelica, the most rotten of all the Rugrats (and the least liked -- why THQ would build a game around this brat is beyond me), wandering around in a mall trying to win fashion shows so she can get enough points to rescue her doll from Chuckie and Tommy. Of course, it's totally out of character for these two to steal something from Angelica, but the more strange thing is that Angelica will have to team with the babies at certain points to earn more credits (and they are the judges at the fashion show as well.) Where's the logic in that?  Handling the six mini-games (yes, only six) ranges from dreadfully dull to backhandedly futile. The only clever game is a labyrinth-style maze where you bounce a ball of yarn through a maze, but the length of the maze is far too long (it takes nearly six minutes to get through it) and there is only one maze, so the challenge and fun quickly falls away to boredom.   Then there's a Cookie Catch (which is set, of course, inside a dress shop), a match game (which randomly chooses cards until a match comes up, meaning that you might wait for minutes on end waiting for a match to show), a bug hunt (where Phil and Lil stumble around on bugs), a Simon game, and a puzzle shuffle. The end boss battle (if you wish to call it that) is just dire crap. Nothing makes sense of what to do, and in the meantime you're being barraged by cheap shots and bad control. When you finally save your Cynthia, there's not even a scene showing the two reunited -- just a title card.  There's a reason why guys cringe when they see things like the boy in Game Boy scratched out and replaced with Game Girl Color on the box art of Rugrats: Total Angelica. It's not that the idea of a cutesy girl's game is a bad concept; it's that we all know that whatever's in the box is destined to be crap. The designers spend more time on the feminist posturing than feminine gameplay. It's the same with any Barbie game, any animated movie license, any hacked-out idea that advertises in Sassy instead of Next Gen. The time simply isn't spent on making a fun game, and it doesn't matter how many options or outfits the characters can change into in the game if the actual play is trash and the joy isn't there.", "date": "May 27, 2000"}
