It was a long time in the coming, and maybe it would have made a bigger impact if it had been released at the system's launch last year, but if you don't own the PlayStation version just yet, you cannot live without Street Fighter Alpha III.  The PlayStation version of the game was made so awesome for a variety of reasons, first and foremost being the original arcade source material.  The Alpha series asks that you forget about the one hundred hit combos, the super air jumps and the aerial raves of its contemporaries spawned from X-Men Children of the Atom.  Super moves are de-emphasized except for as part of an overall deadly strategy, a strategy which is less about flash and more about quiet, reserved technique.  It's the closest thing out there to the original Street Fighter II except for Street Fighter III, and when you factor in the cast of nearly thirty characters, including some old favorites like Guile and Blanka, the arcade Alpha III proved to be far and away the best Capcom fighter around.  Now, there are some people (myself included) who'd argue that there have been some wonderful additions to the Street Fighter franchise over the years that make going back and playing the original versions a bit tough.  Air blocking tends to be a good thing, for instance, and who doesn't get a huge adrenaline rush upon having successfully countered an opponent's move?  These are all possible in Alpha III, but only if you choose to give yourself access to them.  For each fighter, the game permits three fighting styles, termed ~isms~ and selectable when choosing your character.  X-ism is the closest to the original SFII, ditching alpha counters and air blocking all-together.  A-ism allows for multiple super combos, multiple combo levels, and unlocks air blocking and alpha counters.  Finally, V-ism is the same as A-ism except instead of super moves, you use the button mash-fest custom combo system from Alpha II.  It's your choice which style you'd prefer, and it's not necessarily the case that the added features of an A-ism or V-ism will always defeat an X-ism character.  One thing is for sure, though: Capcom thought of everyone in making this final entry to the Alpha series.   And they went even further for the PlayStation version of the game, equipping the title with enough options to make even Namco take note.  Available from the start were the typical arcade and versus modes, as well as a training mode featuring all the abilities you could want to train yourself in the way of the street fighter.  Unlockable, in addition to a few secret characters, was the dramatic battle mode which allowed for two on one fights, as well as a survival mode, a team battle mode, and a few others.  But the real area of interest was the World Tour, a mode of play in which you traveled around the world as one character, building up your skill level, learning new fighting moves, and gaining defense and attack power along the way.  There was a gradual buildup of difficulty in this mode, and making it through proved to be tough, but you could save your built up character to continue building it up later, or import it into other modes of play as a pseudo-new character.  All these modes added a tremendous amount of variety to Alpha III on the PlayStation, taking the title far beyond the barebones conversion we were used to, and they're all included in the Dreamcast version of the game.  In fact, everything, from the once hidden characters to the added options are fully unlocked from the start for Dreamcast users, so owners of the PlayStation version can ditch their copy in favor of the Dreamcast version, and not have to work to unlock everything.  Even better, you'll be on the receiving end of a superior version of the game if you do so.  Alpha III on the Dreamcast features improved animation and sound over its PSX counterpart, as well as the bare minimum of load time, and a new attractive interface to boot!  Capcom has also gone about bringing a wee bit of internet support to the US in translating the game from Japan.  By accessing the Capcom web page through the game, you can download a so-called master character against whom you pit a character you've built up through the game's World Tour Mode.  Currently available for download are super powerful versions of Chun Li and Dan, although Capcom plans to add more characters on a regular basis.  At 65 blocks, the characters take up a good amount of your precious VMU space, but there's no denying that this mode adds to the lastability of the game and gives you another reason to go Online while waiting for the true Online gaming to commence.   There are only a few things the game has going against it.  First off, it looks horribly dated, especially when compared to Street Fighter III or Marvel vs Capcom 2.  Don't expect the insanest of animation if you take the plunge.  The controller issue also rears its ugly head - my personal choice for playing the game is to use my Japanese ASCII 6-button pad, as it's quite difficult to play through the game with the standard Dreamcast controller.  Also, if you already have the PlayStation version, the upgrades included here may not be entirely worth the price of admission - and that's a big problem now that Capcom has delayed the game several months from its original date.  But if you don't have the PSX version, or if you're a Street Fighter fan who just has to have the very best, pick up Alpha III now.  Delayed however long it was, it's still the best 2D fighter around.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDCThere are some little elements that certainly could have been addressed before the game shipped, like the hard-to-see powerbar during sunset levels, or the awkward, unlabeled fighter list during the Vs. and Training Mode, but I don't want to close this review off on a list of negatives. Street Fighter Alpha 3 is definitely one of the best fighters on the Game Boy Advance to date, and shouldn't be missed if you're a GBA owner that has the taste for the successful Street Fighter action.", "date": "May 20, 2000"}
