Take Bust-A-Move II, for example. Once you start, it's incredibly hard to stop, especially when you're going head-to-head with a friend. Forget it, you're not leaving the house.  Bust-A-Move II should look familiar to anyone who's ever played Tetris. (And who hasn't, right?) Instead of items falling from the top, though, you shoot balloons from the bottom of the screen. Basically, you need to get three balloons of the same color touching each other to make them pop. If some other balloons happen to be clinging to those when they pop, they'll drop. The balloons are slowly working their way to the bottom of the screen as well. When they hit the bottom, you lose.  It sounds simple, and it is. That's the beauty of it. That, and the fact that the little dinosaur guys who shoot the balloons are so darn cute. There is some strategy involved, beyond just self-preservation. Popping your balloons can send extra balloons streaming over to your opponent's side, much to their dismay. It's great!  Bust-A-Move II isn't the best puzzle game ever, but it is loads of fun. And if you love cutesy Japanese characters, this title will have you captivated in front of your TV for hours on end.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
