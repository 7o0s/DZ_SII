A strange connection that's rather inexplicable. It's sort of a symmetry, a twisted love affair, an obsession that leads to the primordial core of videogames. It's like monkeys and videogames come from the same place. Yeah, I guess what I'm saying by accident is that videogames bring us down the evolutionary scale to the level of chimpanzees.    But what of it? Some games are unintelligent, violent and/or even primal, while others provide the childlike playfulness and silly creativity deep down inside us all. Ubi Soft's Ape Escape 2, the true PlayStation 2 sequel to the unusual and innovative PlayStation game, Ape Escape, gives players the latter, and it delivers it in droves.   Gameplay  Originally a platformer specifically designed to bring to fruition the full use of the Dual Shock analog controllers in the waning days of the PlayStation (1999), the Ape Escape series has spawned an original game, a semi-sequel, Japan-only game ( Piposaru 2001), and thanks to Ubi Soft's acquisition of the Sony-developed game for North America, we Yankees can collect all 300 monkeys in the full and proper sequel, Ape Escape 2.   The new sequel doesn't revolutionize the series in any way, but it does bring gamers a huge new game stuffed with more of everything, including some of the best monkey-movie spoofs in the short history of monkey-movie spoofs. Essentially an upgrade from the first iteration, Ape Escape 2 offers returning gadgets and characters, a few new characters, a few new gadgets, a mobile arcade-like menu system, and what seems like an infinite amount of collectible items. Ubi Soft's platformer once again utilizes the analog controllers to control gadgets, solve puzzles and pilot vehicles, and most importantly, it's expanded on the range and quantity of monkeys. Si!

Get The Guide! | Ape Message Boards   Following the story from the original, Ape Escape 2 finds newcomer Jimmy and resident stalwart Natalie running the professor's laboratory while he takes some much deserved time off gambling in Las Vegas. Young Jimmy is supposed to send some pants via a modern transportation device, but instead he includes the species-transcendent monkey helmets. And even though you might have thought Specter was dead, he re-appears, quickly commanding an army of monkey including five new powerful boss types for you to confront.     Jimmy is much younger than the original's Spike, and fueling his kid-like demeanor is Rachel Lillis, the same voice actor who performs the voice for Misty in the animated TV series Pokemon. The game skews a little younger in its approach this time around, with little baby Pipotchi guiding and helping newcomers in their plight against confounding puzzles and hard-to-catch monkeys. That, and the huge level of collecting in the game, point toward a 10-year-old's likes rather than a 17-year-old's tastes. But fear not, platform fans, because the game's stellar qualities outshine its kiddy dressing by a long shot. Making collecting innovative and addictive, Sony's development squad has turned the generally mundane task of collecting into the very best thing about Ape Escape 2.      The new gadgets are relatively fun, but they don't add to much new flavor to the game's already zesty repertoire of weapons, tools and the like, and they're by no means stunning new additions. Like before, players acquire them in a progressive manner throughout the game, and each one is configurable a la The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's control scheme, enabling players to attribute each to a face button. The Banana-rang and the water cannon do interesting things. The Banana-rang is a boomerang that stops at the end of its arc and emits a banana scent, which naturally attracts the sneakiest of monkey, right? Fueling this gadget is a ~hunger~ characteristic in each monkey's data screen with a rating of up to five digits. So, if a really hungry monkey is around, the Banana-rang is an appropriate tool to use. The Water Cannon doesn't blast monkeys off their feet like I had imaged. Instead, it's used to solve puzzles and the like. Both are solid additions, they're just not super new inventive ideas. Returning gadgets include the Monkey Net, Stick, RC Car (three kinds), Running Hoop, Monkey Radar, Slingshot (with three different kinds of shots), Helicopter and more.   After the first five or so missions, Pipotchi heads off to let you confront monkeys on your own. Later on he returns to help, and you'll have to save him from at least one boss. The range of bosses is amusing this time around. There are five major ones (six actually, since you fight the Yellow Monkey twice), plus you'll face off with Specter twice. The bosses comprise a more balanced set of challenges than in the first one, which as I remember, was quite a difficult bunch to beat. Each one can be beat by a number of different means, and naturally, as players progress, they'll get harder.    Set using a third-person perspective, players control Jimmy with relative ease. He's got a real nice double jump; he can swim, walk, run, shimmy and more. The camera generally keeps things in order, and if the game is to be slighted, it's because of the camera, which often snags on something or doesn't give the best perspective quick enough in a tight situation. Players will notice the camera's inadequacies most during boss fights. It's still a pretty damn good camera system all told, but it's not perfect and overall, a quicker, more nimble system would work better.    Level design wise, the game provides an excellent mixture of physical platform elements, while also giving players lots of physical puzzles, stuffing tons of hidden items around every corner, and it constantly keeps things fresh with each new weapon. Each level offers something to like, from the monkeys hidden in paintings, monkeys with guns and grenades, monkeys hidden in Frozen Carbonite and more. Players find themselves swimming, riding giant dinosaurs in lakes, piloting monstrous mechs and more. Ubi Soft's game offers about 12-20 hours of play, depending on your level of skill, and for those sticklers who love to get everything, there is a ton of monkeys hidden throughout each level (20 levels in all) that require you to return with your new gadget to capture. A few of the level titles convey their references quite well: Enter the Monkey, Castle Frightmare, Panic Pyramid, and Moon Base, to name a few.     The monkeys, however, are at the center of the game's madness, and the range of 300 monkeys is extraordinary, comprising a level of charm and character with which few games can compare. They're organized by a few criteria: Speed, hunger, alertness and aggressiveness. Each one has a personality type (speedy, lazy, silly, sad, lonely, etc.), name and a color of pants. The pant color indicates their personality too, be it speedy, grenade throwing, slow, or the like.    But it's the animations of each one, combined with their funny names that coin their special breed of charm. Beday is a monkey who sits atop a water fountain and he says I've been sitting here for three days!; Ookus is a monkey who resembles a certain Star Wars creator, and there's more: Monk Quixote (~I hate windmills~); Van (~Where did he Gogh?~); the dancing Pelvis (~He has just left the building~); Vincent (Royale with Cheese); Oozie (~Have you met me little friend); Ulysses (~I want another Banana Shake now~); MegaMonkey, Ape-01, Lunch, Scottie, Bones and hundreds more. The movie spoofs range far and wide, from Star Wars, Rocky, Pulp Fiction, Star Trek, Titanic, Natural Born Killers, to any Jackie Chan film, Peter Pan (Captain Ook who hates monkeys), Terminator, The Matrix (Neo says ~There is no banana~), and Space Odyssey 2001 to name a few. Even videogames and TV shows come under fire, including spoofs on Mega Man and The Land of the Lost. In the modern age where collecting has grown tiring and even to a certain extent, old fashioned, Ape Escape 2 relishes in collecting, making it incredibly tempting, challenging and captivating.   The menu system and mini-games require a bit of attention here. Somewhat like the first, players move their characters around the HQ/menu center. Jimmy runs from save/load data screen to the Level Select-Launch Pad to the Mini-game Section to the Archives and the Gumball/Reward Center, and it's all quite cute. The gumball/reward section is neat for a while, but it quickly gets tiresome. Plugging in seven or eight coins, hitting the button, walking over to the chute, smashing open the ball and then walking into the item is a bit of work for one item. If there were 50 items, well, that would be easy, but this game is bulging with extras.    To wit: It offers 300 monkeys, music themes from each level, hilariously sad fables with grim endings, comic strips, artwork, renders, and more. The level of collectibles is ridiculous and over-the-top, so if you like this kind of thing, you're in luck. If not, you can't really skip it, because you'll eventually need to collect cookies and coins to replenish your health. Kinda sneaky, and for some, annoying and tedious.     The mini-games represent a certain fetish that's hard to ignore. The list includes Monkey Dance (players control the monkey's arms to perform different dances, such as the Charleston), Monkey Soccer (create a team from any of the monkeys you have collected, name them and play in a pretty decent little game of soccer), and Monkey Climber (players use the analog stick to swing a rope; it's kind of like Donkey Kong, Jr.).       Graphics  Known as Sarugetchu 2 in Japan (that's ~saru~ meaning ~monkey~ and ~getchu~ as in ~get you~), Ape Escape 2 is honestly all about gameplay. Graphics and sound genuinely come in a distant second place here, and so, sadly, there isn't too much to highlight. That's not to imply the graphics and sound aren't well done, far from it, but visually and aurally, the game is simple, traditional and unsurprising.   Ubi Soft's hilarious little platformer is, for all intents and purposes, a visual enhancement over the first game, with better, sharper graphics, improved particles, and an overall cleaner look that's now an expected element in any PS2 game. The game runs at a brisk framerate, with little slowdown, and the pastoral and primary-colored landscapes follow a cartoon-like visage. The effects differ. The water effects are OK, while the flashy capture particles and lighting effects are exceptional, at least for this game. The animations are all excellent, and they're what make Ape Escape 2 so consistently eye-catching.   Overall, the graphics are not the game's strong points, buy they do have they're good qualities. They're cute, built with quick, good-looking animations, and they get the job done in traditional platform fashion. Simple and good.    Sound  Like the graphics, the sound is basic. It's not unimpressive, but it's not stunning. Essentially, the sound does what it's meant to do. The kiddy Pokemon voices will go over with mixed reaction from the crowds who play it, but they don't by any means distract or detract from the game. Because of the game's unrelenting charm, players an genuinely sucked into the sounds of the various monkeys, with all of their oohh-oohhing and aahh-ahhing, screeching, and the like -- they sound cute if anything -- so it's hard not to like what one hears. The game is only offered in mono ansd stereo, so techheads won't be able to swoon to sweetly to monkey yelps via their stereo systems.   Musically, Ape Escape 2 sounds as if a giddy keyboard player warped back in time to the Genesis and Super NES days and used an old-school Casio keyboard to etch out these simplistic, catchy and NutraSweet sounds. A few are very catchy, but most float right on by on the ordinary train.Ape Escape 2 defies the current logic behind Sony's upcoming heavy-hitter platformers. Unlike Jak II or Ratchet 2: Going Commando 2, Ubi Soft's game remains original and innovative in its use of a cocktail of good tools, gadgets, solid platforming elements, and interfaces. But more than anything, the inescapable level of addiction in COLLECTING monkeys is the overriding reason to not just rent, but to buy and cherish this game. While those other games move away from collecting as the primary objective, Ape Escape's whole raison d'etre is to collect, and what fun it is. As far as platformers go, Ape Escape 2 does relatively little more than its predecessor, but its brand of charming, hilarious monkeys and the enormous level of collectibles of simians and rewards offer a genuinely loveable game for any age group. I strongly recommend that you pick up the North American version as soon as possible and go ape!", "date": "Jul 1, 2003"}
