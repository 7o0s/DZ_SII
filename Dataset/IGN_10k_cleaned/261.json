But Torus and GT Interactive have created a game perfect for the Dukester, in portable form. Let's just say this: Duke Nukem on the Game Boy Color rocks. Features  16 levels 25 different enemies Side-scrolling action Tons of weaponry One player Only for Game Boy Color   What Torus has done is base a Game Boy Color game based on the original PC series of Duke Nukem games. Duke didn't receive his true attitude until he moved to the third dimension, so the team added a bit more firepower and grit that wasn't in the original sidescrolling series. And the game has been programmed specifically with the Game Boy Color in mind, so the color palette is definitely being milked as much as it can be.  Duke's main weapon is a standard shotgun -- this thing doesn't run out, but it's only good for slow bursts. As you progress through the levels, you'll pick up a machine gun or flame thrower...but ammo on these babies is limited. Run out, and it's back to cocking your shotgun.  And what's having ammo without anything to shoot? You're lost on a spaceship, having been kidnapped by aliens for your superior mind. Conveniently, you manage to escape, find a shotgun, and now you're on a rampage to get off that flying bucket of bolts.  You'll have to find your way out by climbing ladders, jumping platforms, grabbing onto ledges...and yes, blasting an onslaught of aliens, zombies and the like.  Some levels also put you in veryMetal Slug--like situations, including behind the wheel of a mini-tank, and you'll have to make your way through the level blasting dinky aliens with the mammoth cannons. Wait until you wrap your paws around the gatling gun on level 2...  As side scrolling platformers go on the Game Boy Color, this is definitely one of the best. The animation of Duke is really slick, there's plenty of variety between levels, and the levels...well, they're huge. Thankfully you can save your progress in one of eight locations on the battery-backed cartridge, but there are no continues. Run out of lives, and game over pal.   The only downside is slight sprite glitching and slowdown when you've got more than four enemies on-screen. It's an effect that brings us back to the days of the NES. It's no big deal, but something like that just isn't expected in this day and age. Digital sound is a bit scratchy, but it's few and far between -- unfortunately, you don't get any Duke-isms as you blast your way through the game. Honestly, if anything's missing from the game, it's the trademark Duke one-liners. I'm really surprised how well Duke Nukem came out on the Game Boy Color -- despite the step backward in game design for this character, Torus managed to put together one of the best side-scrollers on the Game Boy Color thus far.  I miss the digitized speech (and it really should be in there, I don't care what the excuse), but there's not much else that you can complain about in this game. Great stuff, folks.", "date": "Sep 29, 1999"}
