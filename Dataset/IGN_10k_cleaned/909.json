The 2D side-scrolling racer, while simplistic in design, was one of the very best games the system had to offer thanks to clever and addictive gameplay mechanics that did their best to mimic reality despite the limits of the technology. It looked great for the time, felt great for the time, and was a whole lot of fun.   Now Nintendo has contracted developer Left Field Studios (Kobe Bryant's NBA Courtside) to create the 64-bit update to the Excitebike franchise. The California based software house has not only perfectly recaptured the spirit of the classic for this jaw-dropping N64 adaptation, but upraised a fantastic 3D engine around it, and doused everything with buckets of wonderful new extras too. Extras like a superb physics engine, unequaled graphics, deliciously deep control, a tempting four-player mode, dead-on audio and enough courses and bonuses to keep gamers racing happy for a long time to come. All of this comes together for what IGN64 feels is the best Nintendo 64 racing experience to be had thus far, rivaling Nintendo's own Wave Race 64.  Features  Track editor enables players to build courses from scratch with plenty of jumps, tabletops and dips. 20 tracks with six stadium, stunt tracks, and six outdoor rally tracks. Realistic physics engine.  Authentic rider animations for crashes, jumps and knocks. More than a dozen outrageous tricks. Several types of motorbikes. Adjustable camera angles for capturing the best racing and stunt action. Four-player simultaneous support. 4MB Expansion Pak compatible for optional high-resolution mode. Licenses include Bell Helmets, Thor, Scott USA, Shoei, and FMF.  Classic Excitebike included.     Gameplay Excitebike 64 plays and feels exactly as you'd hope it would -- just like the original, only now it's all in full 3D. The bikes are maneuvered with the analog stick, the A button accelerates, and the B button brakes.  Back is the classic turbo option, which is now mapped to the Z-trigger. And these are the basics. Using just the stick and these buttons, you should have no trouble completing races, and even ranking high in some of them. As the courses increase in difficulty, though, you're going to need to dig deeper into the subtle extras of the control scheme if you're to have any chance of competing. If you examine the Tutorial mode -- and you should because it's very helpful -- you'll begin to understand just how important these extra options are. You'll learn how to use the R button in order to position your bike while in mid-air. Once you've mastered it, you'll be able to better prepare yourself for sharp turns by angling your bike to land at the proper angle. You'll also learn about the extra turbo boost. At the top of any given jump, you can double-tap the Z-trigger for an added boost to your bike's power. This is hugely important to clearing big jumps or regaining your speed after you've landed directly on a slowing bump. You'll also learn how to use the R button in conjunction with the B button to skid around corners -- another must in making sharp turns and staying in the race. And these are just a few examples of the totally intuitive control setup that makes up Excitebike 64 -- a scheme that is both reminiscent of the classic game and at the same time significantly more extensive in order to stay true to the 3D environments that surround it.   The title features several different modes of play including Season, Exhibition, Time Trials and Special Tracks. Season Mode is Excitebike 64's main challenge and features 20 courses to hammer through, but only five available at start. Once you've raced through the first five (or Bronze Round, as it's called) and survived, you'll be able to progress to the next five (or Silver Round). Once you've beaten Silver Round, you'll unlock the next five races (and the game's Soccer Mode, which is multiplayer only). This continues until you've managed your way through the remaining tracks.   The tracks themselves, which increase in difficulty as you advance, are positively unique and brilliant from beginning to end. Left Field has delivered a delicate balance of realistic in-door stadium tracks and over-the-top outdoor courses. Indoor tracks generally brandish a standard, but fun selection of dirt jumps, sharp turns and mud puddles, and much more arcade-like outdoor environments often boast gigantic chasm jumps, lots of hidden shortcuts, and even areas where you can sky-ride over cranes and moving trains. Each track is varied enough so that the racing is never dull. The outdoor environments in particular are wonderfully creative; you can race through deserts, jungles, caves, construction zones, washes, forests, and more. Course design is clever and rewarding so, for example, if you're skilled enough to land perfectly on an upraised steel beam in the Construction Course, you might find an entire secret area that you didn't know existed just beyond it.   Excitebike 64's sense of speed is solid, and it mixes well with the high-flying action of the title. You can't catch big air, after all, without lots of speed. The z-trigger turbo boost keeps the races moving and Left Field has implemented a simple, but effective stunt system that features upwards of 30 mid-air tricks that are executed using the c-down button in conjunction with other buttons and the analog stick. So, it's possible to pull off Nothings, Nac Nacs and the like by pressing, for example, c-down, up and down. The stunt system isn't quite as satisfying as Wave Race's as many of the maneuvers can be executed very easily, but it gets the job done all the same.  The title features several Special Tracks that are unlocked by completing various tasks. The tracks include Desert, a randomly generated desert course in which you must race to a series of bonfires located atop hills before the competition can get their first; Stunt Course, an open stadium filled with jumps that serves us the perfect spot to practice stunts and rank up points; Original Excitebike, the classic 2D racer that inspired this 64-bit update; Soccer, a multiplayer mode where two or four-players can play the sport of Soccer using dirtbikes (probably inspired by the identical Buck Bumble multiplayer mode); Hill Climb, a splendidly addictive mode where the only thing you have to do is make it to the top of a series of hills -- the problem is, of course, gravity, which knocks your bike over whenever it gets the chance; and Excite 3D, the 3D update to the original Excitebike levels. This mode is quite welcomed because not only can you play the levels in full 3D, but you can switch to an isometric view as well by hitting one of the c-buttons. Each view has a different feel to it and both are very entertaining.  Multiplayer Excitebike 64's multiplayer mode is a lot of fun as it is essentially the single-player action multiplied for more people. The top physics and look of the game remain intact. While Exhibition races in multiplayer are fun as you can fly through all of the single-player tracks, the real draw comes in the Special Tracks. Uphill Climb, Soccer, and the Stunt Course in particularly are loads of fun with two-players and everything still runs with a respectable framerate. With four-players on-screen, the fluidity is a bit jerkier, but it's still very playable despite the impressive physics and architecture sometimes being pushed.   Track Editor The game features a simplistic track editor feature that, while limited, works quite nicely. Using it, you're able to create your own in-door track within a pre-set value of space -- generally the size of your typical in-door level. The trackExcitebike is one of Nintendo's classic franchises so developer Left Field Studios had a lot to live up to when creating this 64-bit sequel. The good news is that it only takes 10 minutes with this game to know that the team at Left Field has done its homework.  Excitebike 64 not only lives up to the classic it was inspired by, it takes it all to the next level with a fantastic 3D engine, delightfully realistic physics, intuitive control, brilliantly detailed graphics, ingenious subtleties and tons of options. An excellent selection of varied tracks will keep the single-player mode going strong and multiplayer nuts will go wild over the Up Hill Climb, Soccer, and Stunt Track modes. This game has it all.Simply put, Excitebike 64 and Wave Race are the best racing games available for Nintendo 64. If Left Field can pull this off for Nintendo 64, I can't wait to see what it has in store for Dolphin! You're a schmuck if you don't run to your nearest retailer and snap this one up right now.", "date": "May 2, 2000"}
