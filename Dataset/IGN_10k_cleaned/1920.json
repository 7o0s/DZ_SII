I used to play a lot of pinball, and still do when I can -- unfortunately, I'm gainfully employed at this point, and I generally play my best pinball when I'm broke and out of work.  Before I got a job at IGN, I played some downright brilliant games of Bride of Pin-Bot and Dr. Dude at the Gig Harbor WA Regal Cinemas -- shouts to the crew from the Secret Society, wherever you may be.  Anyway, point is, I know what makes good pinball.  KISS Pinball is not good pinball.  Dump the ten bucks you'd pay for this game down a real pin, if you can find one anywhere near you.  Gameplay  Two boards and a few different play settings (tournament mode, different difficulty levels) await you.  This would not necessarily be so lean a selection if the game weren't so fast and the scale of the boards so small.  Your control over the ball is not all that fine, thanks to the quick movement of the ball and the camera -- since the board is about 2-3 times the size of the viewable area, the camera moves to follow the ball, and you're always losing sight of your flippers.  This wouldn't be such a problem if the game were paced a little slower, but in this case the ball and camera move faster than is easily discerned.  The graphics engine also hampers gameplay at times -- I registered severe slowdown in multi-ball, with only two balls on the board.  Multi-ball also kills the scrolling camera, which focuses on the flippers while there's more than one ball to keep track of.  Hence, it's hard to prepare for a falling ball or properly aim your shot at one of the ramps hidden up beyond view.  Graphics  This failing on the part of the engine is strange, because it's not drawing anything particularly taxing.  The board and ball are of middling resolution, nothing surprisingly sharp to speak of, and while there are plenty of animating elements scattered around the boards, that still shouldn't account for such drastic slowdown.  I do like the black-and-white recreation of the animating digital readout, that's great fun, but charming frills can't make up for a game with serious, fundamental technical flaws.  Sound  It has KISS music.  This is evidently the premier selling point of the game.  Interpret this depending on your fondness for the music of KISS.  Beyond that, the sound effects are standard issue and sampled at a rather iffy level of quality.  The voice samples in particular lack an impressive degree of fidelity, although perhaps that's meant to recreate the feel of a real pinball machine.  I would have thought that the band's signature guitar riffs at least would have some weight to them,  10-dollar game, gets a 10-dollar review.  If you absolutely must have console video pinball, go hunt down Last Gladiators or Necronomicon, the first-rate pinball games developed by Kaze for the Saturn.  They're better-balanced, better-looking, offer more boards, and are otherwise many times better than KISS Pinball.  Their only possible failing is that they do not have KISS in them, and whether or not that is a negative quality is a matter of perspective.Alternatively, find an arcade, a bar, a restaurant, a movie theater, a bowling alley, or whatever other sleazy pinball-housing venue you can find, and spend some change on real pinball.  That's what I'd rather do.", "date": "Apr 30, 2001"}
