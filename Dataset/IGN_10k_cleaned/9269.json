Whether it's the latest blockbuster failing to live up to its pre-release hype or the look on your girlfriend's face when she unwraps her birthday present, only to discover it's another weight-loss DVD, meeting expectation is sometimes harder than keeping David Bentley under control when he's wearing an England under-21 shirt.    Shingo 'Seabass' Takatsuka had a mountain to climb when creating the next-gen versions of Pro Evolution Soccer, then. Last year's Xbox 360 game delivered a high-definition experience but fell short with respect to PES's trademark realistic gameplay and sharp AI. It was by no means terrible - as you can tell from our PES6 review - but it wasn't the Pro Evo we've come to know and love over the past few years.   Catch out the opposition with a quick free kick.  A year on, however, and the essence of what makes PES so undeniably superb - the instinctive controls, the way you almost feel at one with your team when you're playing well - is very much back in evidence. Indeed, playing next-gen Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is a warming, blissfully familiar experience that will make you wonder if you've accidentally slipped the old version of the game into the drive.   That's not to say Konami hasn't moved the series forward. In fact it's a noticeable improvement over last year's next-gen effort for a number of reasons. Firstly, the loose controls have been tightened up and are much more responsive, providing greater on-the-ball and close control. The AI - the foundation upon which PES has been built for so long - is markedly better too. Your players make more intelligent runs, they work together as a team more proficiently and the opposition puts up a much better fight, especially on the higher difficulty settings against the best teams.   The enhanced AI is undeniably the result of PES 2008's much-lauded TeamVision feature, in which the opposition learns and adapts to the way individuals play the game. Having said that, the AI still feels more like an evolution rather a revolution, which is no bad thing. Defenders will track back more aggressively if you continually attack in the same way and, likewise, they'll take advantage of weak spots in your defence unless you adapt to the way they play. However, it's not so overwhelming that you need to change your tactics every time you run out onto the pitch.   Penalties aside, set-pieces are the same as ever.  In practice it's probably the most authentic football experience yet, not just on next-gen but even compared to Pro Evo on PS2. Whether you're playing a slick one-touch passing game or using the strength of big defenders to push players off the ball, everything feels spot on. Your players react the way you'd expect them to, not just as a team but also as individuals. Rooney is a bruiser on the ball and can ride the challenges of most defenders and still net a goal from 35 yards. Fabregas, on the other hand, occasionally needs protecting from overly enthusiastic opposition but technically he's one of the best players in the game, making rarely a stray pass even under pressure.   Nowhere was this level of authenticity more evident than in the Euro final we played between England and Portugal. With England dominating the centre of midfield, Ronaldo darted along wing before cutting into the box. But, as Ferdinand and Terry closed in to cut out the run - and with Ronaldo almost certain to lose possession - the Portuguese winker faked a foul and dived to the ground. Rather than award a penalty though, the ref was well-positioned and gave the filthy cheat a yellow card for his play-acting. Admittedly he was instrumental in getting Gerrard sent off five minutes later but, for that precious moment, justice was served.     On the subject of dives, there's already much debate on whether or not they should've been included. The fact is they don't play a huge part in the game and much like any other new feature in PES you really need to learn how to use them effectively if you're to get away with it. Even then it doesn't always work so, in that sense, cheating is just another (very small) weapon in your tactical arsenal and, as such, the only sure-fire way to score and win the match is to play well.   As well as smarter players out on the pitch, keepers have been improved between the sticks. A proficient shot-stopper is more likely to palm the ball behind for a corner rather than knock it back out into the six-yard box (and into the path of an opposing striker looking to snatch an easy goal). They work with their defensive line much better too and, on a number of occasions, we witnessed a centre-back covering the goal line after the keeper had come out too far and fumbled the ball.   Dirty cheat. Thankfully diving doesn't affect the gameplay that much.  Set-pieces are pretty much identical compared to previous PES incarnations: free-kicks can be taken quickly or, alternatively, you can take your time and play around with the set-up. Corners, too, are taken in exactly the same way, but penalties are slightly different. To take it's business as usual, the camera sitting behind your player. But, if you're playing alone and are controlling the keeper, the camera is more dynamic, positioned to the side of the goalie on the line, looking out at the penalty taker. It doesn't affect the way you save a shot - move the d-pad or stick to dive in that direction - but it sure looks a lot nicer.   And that is really the best way to sum up Pro Evolution Soccer 2008. It's very much business as usual, but with better graphics. On that note, it does look decent - not incredible but certainly a step in the right direction. Player likenesses are a bit hit-and-miss - Ronaldinho is on the money but Frank Lampard looks like Stuart Downing and vice-versa. The crowd is pretty ropey too, but you only ever really notice during replays and some set-pieces.   The official clubs in the game look great. Shame there aren't more.  The other sticking point some might struggle with is PES's lack of official Premier League teams. With only Spurs and Newcastle on offer, a lot of English football fans may well feel put out playing as London North and Manchester Red. Personally it doesn't really bother me any more, because there are plenty of other licensed teams in the game and it's also incredibly easy to rename the teams and replicate the kits almost perfectly. There's even the option to use the PS Eye to take a snapshot of a logo that can be slapped on the chest of your collective team. Indeed, we took a pic of the Fly Emirates logo, tweaked the colours a little and had it on the shirts of Arsenal within a matter of minutes.Seabass and his team have come good, then. Next-gen Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 captures the essence of the original games perfectly, gives it an HD injection and takes the AI to the next level. Its by no means perfect: the frame-rate drops when the screen gets really busy, usually during a quick clearance when the box is flooded with players or, occasionally, during a replay. But, when youre actually stuck into the action, its likely you wont really notice or indeed care. Of course, some players will think that a drop in frame-rate on a machine as powerful as PS3 is an absolute travesty and, in some respects, theyd be right. But if a flaw as incidental as this prevented said players from buying PES 2008 altogether, theyd be missing out on the most realistic, intelligent and enjoyable football experience on console yet.", "date": "Oct 18, 2007"}
