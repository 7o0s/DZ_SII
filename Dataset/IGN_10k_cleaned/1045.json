It's not that I don't like Starcraft or anything, I just prefer games that let you focus on the fighting. Creating bases and mining resources is great and all but sometimes I just want to be given a bunch of soldiers and march them into battle. And I find that I can get deeper into the intricacies of a scenario when I can take time to think about my disposition and arrangements.  Shogun: Total War really is the best of both worlds. It combines a real-time tactical combat system with a turn-based strategic game. By far, the battle game is the better designed of the two sides of Shogun, but the turn-based management aspects are rewarding in their own right. All of the action takes place against the backdrop of feudal Japan. You and your rival daimyo will fight it out to determine who will eventually take control of the whole of Japan and be declared Shogun.  The heart of this game is in the tactical battles. With up to 10,000 units on the screen at once, Shogun is everything that Braveheart should've been -- lots and lots of guys running at each other with pointy things. The sheer sense of mass and chaos is fantastic and rendered better here than in any other game I've ever seen. Your armies will literally crash into each other and you'll begin to see the bodies start piling up. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of tactical sophistication to this game (although tactics at this period in Japanese history were fairly limited). You have several options for maneuver and setting rules of engagement.  The diversity of the terrain alone is more than enough to start your brain envisioning flanking moves and ambushes. The hills and trees here function like real hills and trees. If you have the high ground, you can see farther, your archers have better range and enemy charges will be reduced in strength. If you're willing to put the time and thought into it, you can take out a force much larger than yours just by using the terrain to your advantage. Best of all, the computer AI knows just how to use these features. I often marched my forces down the middle of the map looking for the enemy force only to have them come pouring out of the forests on either side of my forces. The only problem the enemy AI has is with bridge crossings. It's far too easy to lure the defending enemy into attacking you across the bridge. As long as your spearmen can hold the enemy still, your archers can reduce them to nothing in no time.   But the tactical game isn't perfect. There are a few formation problems. While it's pretty easy to arrange individual units, it's nearly impossible to move a whole army and maintain their facings and positions. At least it's impossible if you want to do anything than go straight ahead. There's a pretty good system for getting your units as wide or as deep as you need them, but there's no option whatsoever for travelling in columns. This would make maneuvering much easier and keep your troops out of each other's way. It would also speed up bridge crossings.  The battles are complimented by the more abstract strategic side of the campaign. Sadly, this is weakest part of the game. But that's a little like saying that The Shining is Kubrick's worst movie. Who cares, right? All of Japan is divided into tiny provinces. You begin the campaign game with a handful of these provinces already under your control. The challenge is to manage your resources and troops wisely enough to take over adjacent provinces and eventually, the whole of Japan. During your turn (which represents one season) you'll construct buildings, produce troops and move your armies across the map. There are also some limited diplomatic options as well that you can perform during the management phase.  The biggest difficulties here come from a lack of information shortcuts and a lack of dimension in the diplomatic model. There's no quick way to see what buildings and units each of your provinces are building at one time. Early in the game this isn't a big deal at all as you can check on each of your provinces individually. But later in the game, when you've got thirty or forty provinces, there's no way you want to check each and every one of them every turn. The addition of a production queue eases this problem a little but there really needed to be a single screen that shows what each province is doing. Better yet, a tiny graphic could've been added to the corner of the province so you could see what was going on without leaving the map itself.  The map itself has some problems too. It's not always clear which daimyo owns which province. The small minimap in the corner of the screen shows each region colored by ownership. It becomes really easy to see the overall strategic situation here but it's nearly impossible on the main map. Each territory has a thin colored line running around it to indicate ownership. This are really too faint to see and it can get especially confusing when the computer decides to place the dark blue and purple players right next to each other. I've neglected a province or two just because it didn't look like it was mine.  The campaign game also suffers from a lack of depth in diplomacy. You can't really negotiate specific deals with your rivals. About all you can do is suggest alliances and declare war. Your emissaries do serve some other useful purposes though. They can spy out enemy armies and buildings. The spying is better left to the shinobi. These guys can foment revolt, obtain information of the enemy or act as counter-spies to balance out similar efforts by your enemies. But, like the emissaries, the shinobi have no real control options. You just send them into a province and they start doing the spy thing. Whether you get the result you want or not (i.e. a peasant revolt or information on enemy defenses) is entirely up to chance.  The campaign mode isn't available in multiplayer either. This is kind of a shame but to be completely honest, once you play the multiplayer battles, you won't even care. The multiplayer battles are incredibly intense and full of options. You and seven other players can fight it out in a two team battle. Once you select one of the 85 maps in the game, you proceed to an army purchase menu where you spend money purchasing units. You can set the money level to create just about any size engagement you want. We typically have forty or fifty units of sixty men each in the late night battles we've had here around the office. And we've had lots of late night battles of Shogun. About the only problem with the multiplayer is that there's no easy way to set up battles with more than two sides. Other than that, it's pretty much fantastic.  Apart from some minor functionality issues (which we'll get to later), this game is exceptionally well produced. The menus, the introduction sequence and the numerous AVIs are very well polished. The game is also truly beautiful. The battlefields are rendered in full 3D with some fantastic environmental effects. You can play the game in deep fog, pounding rain or gently falling snow. Imagine your army sitting across a river from the opposing army -- the sky is dark and lightning flashes illuminate the nearby hills. And all the while 3D rain comes pouring down on you. Each raindrop or snowflake or arrow in the game exists in the 3D environment. Although there's no practical use for it, you can pause the game and move the camera right up to the arrows as the fly across the sky.  Given the incredible visuals here, I was a little disappointed to see that the units were all simple sprites. They don't look bad at all and I'm particularly impressed that they seem 3D when you're rotating the camera around. The big advantage to having sprites is that you can render up to 10,000 individual soldiers without choking your system. And that 10,000 number isn't an exaggeration; you can have a really ridiculous number of troops on the screen at one time without any real slowdown at all.  Shogun is as much a feast for the ears as it is for the eyes. Mmm...ear feast. The sounds of the battle are spectacular. The environmental sounds are nice, but what really gets you going is the music kicking in as soon as your forces meet those of the enemy. From here on you'll be greeted with the sounds of clashing weapons, shouts from your troops and the volleys of your archers. A voice gives you small updates on the action from time to time as well.  But there are problems as well. The boxed versions that we received were a little unstable. There were some minor install problems and quite a few crash bugs. Even with the latest drivers installed on my PC, I still had the game quit to the desktop pretty frequently during the campaign game. This was helped a little once I opted to reinstall the game. The full install takes up a whopping 1.4GB but it helps the game to run much more smoothly. All of the problems I had seemed to occur at the end of the year phase in the campaign game. I would be more forgiving except that the preview copy we've had since before E3 is more stable than the final version.  Still, Shogun is a remarkable game and definitely worth getting. So many historical wargames are inaccessible to the casual gamer. They're usually so complex that only hardcore grognards have the patience and understanding to get anything out of them. Shogun is the exception. It proves that a wargame can adhere to standards of realism and fun. It's a great change of pace from the genre's usual offering of Civil War or Second World War games. Hopefully it will convince more developers that you can make an alternative strategy game without having to rely on fantasy or science-fiction type settings.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jun 23, 2000"}
