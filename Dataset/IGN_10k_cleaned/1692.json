For those not familiar with the franchise, Wetrix for the Nintendo 64 was considered one of the most original puzzle games of its time and received plenty of positive reviews the majority of the gaming media. As the true sequel to Wetrix, Aqua Aqua takes the basic gameplay elements that made its prequel so well liked and has added a lot of neat new features and play mechanics.  Gameplay Once again, the game is played from a 3D isometric view with the similar goal of arranging 3D shapes that drop onto the playfield to form channels and mounts to keep water from falling off of the sides. The 3D shapes come in some very Tetris-like forms like straight blocks, L-shaped pieces, T-shaped pieces, and square bocks.  In addition to the falling pieces and water, players also have to contend with a variety of other pieces that will randomly appear on the screen. For instance, there are bombs that will fall that make holes in the ground, blocks of ice that will freeze the bodies of water, fireballs that can be used to evaporate all of the water that's directly connected to where it hits, and uncontrollable rain that pops up in the later levels. There are also green pieces that can be used to reduce land masses to make sure the playing field is more leveled and less prone to an earthquake, which can seriously screw up all of your plans by completely destroying large walls or lakes that you have composed.  While the basic idea of the game seems simple in nature, it's actually quite complicated and very difficult to master. And when you combine the game's wide array of pieces and items that must be managed, its relatively hectic pace and the fact that it has some control issues that must be dealt with, which come in the form of camera problems and some difficulty with placing pieces exactly where you want them because of the camera problems and the imprecise control, Aqua Aqua is a game that might turn off a lot of first-time players.  But for those willing to put some time into it, they'll find that this is a very rewarding puzzle game. The Story Mode adds a lot to the single player experience that wasn't evident in Wetrix and there's a nice tutorial that must be completed in order to even try it, which really helps players get acquainted with the game's play mechanics. There are also bosses that must be defeated by scoring a defined amount of points during a specified time limit and there are some added bonus items that can had by getting four squares in a row on the bingo-like grid on the screen.  The place where this game really shines brightest is in its highly addictive and incredibly enjoyable multiplayer mode. It's a tremendous amount of fun and when you pit two players against each other that really understand what they're doing, it can be insanely challenging, a bit frustrating, but most of all, loads of fun.  Graphics Puzzle games rarely show off the true power of the system that they're on and this is definitely the case with Aqua Aqua. The game's 3D polygonal objects and character models are very plain and unimaginative. There are some very nice special effects and cool lighting, but nothing here is going to make you believe that you're playing it on a super powerful 128-bit computer entertainment system. All the same, it doesn't look horrible and definitely gets the job done.  It would have been nice if there were more camera angles and if it were possible to rotate it to get a different look at the board, because it can be difficult to place pieces correctly if your view is blocked by a larger object in front of where you wish to drop the new piece. There is a nice camera angle that lets you see the action from the perspective of one of the little dudes, who are called Aquas, but it's completely useless for playing the game.  Sound The new age techno music in the game can be completely mesmerizing and the sound effects are very crisp and clear and the voices are quite cute and entertaining. There's not a lot more that needs to be said.Having never played Wetrix before playing Aqua Aqua for the first time, I didn't really know what to expect and must admit that I just didn't see what all the hoopla had been about. But after giving the game some time and getting deeper into it, I quickly found that Aqua Aqua is a very entertaining and addictive puzzler. If you're looking for a puzzle game on PlayStation 2, your first choice should be Aqua Aqua.", "date": "Jan 2, 2001"}
