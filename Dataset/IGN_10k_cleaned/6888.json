I played that game for a solid week and didn't get a single minute of pleasure out of the whole ordeal. You can imagine my reaction to finding Return to Krondor sitting on my table the other day. The box looked okay, but I wasn't at all excited about the prospect of diving back in. Once I did, however, I was pleased. This game is really a lot of fun. The story, by Raymond Feist, is interesting and the game mechanics make a lot of sense. Too often RPGs like this suffer either from shallow plots or shallow game logic. This one doesn't. Although there are things that could be improved (a lot in some cases), the game was very satisfying.  The Tear of the Gods, a divine relic of tremendous power, is what you're after. The big villain, named Bear (or ~that big bastard~ as he is often referred to), is after the relic for his own evil purposes. The trouble is that the Tear was on a ship that was attacked by pirates. The ship was sunk and now the Tear lies at the bottom of the sea. You have to get to the Tear first. That's really the whole story but getting from A to B isn't going to be that simple. Along the way there are numerous, mostly plausible, plot twists. What do the vampires have to do with the pirates or the sick cows? If you can figure it out before the characters do, you're a genius.  There are only five player characters in RTK. You don't get the opportunity to create any of them from scratch but you will get a chance to develop their individual skills and strengths as the game progresses. First, you begin with James; an ex-thief turned palace flunky. His thieving skills are really only useful in the earlier parts of the game. As the game progresses, his fighting skills are much more important. He soon meets Jazhara, the new court mage. Together they make a formidable pair and form the nucleus around which you will build the rest of the party. A knight fills the role of heavy muscle; a priest later replaces him. The final member of your party is another mage. The character roles are a little out of balance in this game. Since the two mages are hopeless in pressing the flesh, the thief and priest must take on the role of warriors. It seems to me that their other talents fall by the wayside. As the characters rise in level, you will find yourself reinforcing this emphasis on combat.  The turn based combat system in RTK is simple yet it possesses a surprising amount of complexity and depth. Luckily for us, much of this complexity is hidden in the programming. The game takes care of critical hits, flank attacks and blocking without any input from the player. These factors all work behind the scenes and lend a strong sense of realism to the battles without adding the headache caused by too many rules. The multiple camera angles are a nice touch. The low-level perspectives really involve you in the action. When you're standing right beside the characters, you really feel like you're in the game. The higher angle views, while making it easier to move around and spot enemies, tend to distance you from the game.  Another intriguing facet of the game's combat system is the concept of ~fate.~ Each turn a random fate situation is generated either in favor of the ~heroes~ or the ~villains.~ These indicators range from attack or defense bonuses to extra attacks to a slight recovery of lost hit points. Characters may choose their own fighting style from turn to turn-from aggressive to conservative. Each style has certain bonuses or penalties. You may also designate a character to ~guard~ another character. He or she will then try to interpose themselves between any enemies attacking the guarded character. This order is very useful if your mages need a few rounds to cast a particularly powerful spell.  The richness of the fighting system makes the shallowness of the magic system more irritating. The spells are arranged in six different paths (fire, storm, mind, etc.). Mages can use four of the paths and priests can use two. For reasons already stated, you're rarely going to see those priest spells. He's needed too much as a fighter (in all fairness, this is a position he fills better than you could hope). Since the two mages are hopeless as fighters, you'll need to rely on their magic constantly. Unfortunately by the time they reach higher levels, most of their spells are same and the characters therefore seem pretty much interchangeable. While this is a practical asset in a battle-after all, you can cast the same spells twice a turn now-it tends to detract from the depth of the game.  I was also disappointed with the visual manifestations of the spells. For the most part these tend to be glowing balls that fly from the caster's hand towards the target. The only thing that differentiates one spell from another seems to be the color of the glowing ball. There are some neat after effects-like colored auras around the victims or such-but the visual part of the magic system fails to deliver. I remember my disappointment at seeing the ~Beast Within~ spell for the first time. The description for this spell says that it transforms the caster into a butt-whompin' monster (that's the gist of it at least), but when I cast it all it did was make his face and hands black. Big deal.  The magic system does little better when it comes to range. Of the 60 spells available, I don't think I found a use for more than 10 at most. The Lightning Blade, which is almost the first spell anybody knows, was the workhorse of my combat strategy for the whole game. Not until I could cast the highest level spells, Hammer of Will (a mind control spell that targets all enemies) or Chaos Storm (a direct damage spell that leaps from enemy to enemy), was the supremacy of the Lightning Blade even in question. Taking into account the fact the higher cost of the bigger spells, Lightning Blade was still my ~go to~ move.  The alchemy system is the biggest hole in this game. It's almost as exciting and as practical as my real life chemistry lab was. The equipment is cumbersome and heavy which leaves less room for your characters to carry treasure and other, more useful, goodies. Another problem was that I never had enough or the right ingredients to make what I wanted. There are over a dozen different ingredients that you can use to brew your potions but why bother? There are plenty of ready-made potions lying all over the place. Nearly everyone you meet has a potion or two on them. You can take these potions once those people have no further need of them (i.e. when they no longer have any need for oxygen or the sun's life sustaining rays). My advice is to sell the bulky apparatus right away and use the profits to buy something useful instead.  In addition to finding potions everywhere you look, you find all the usual magic items you'd expect in a game like this - enchanted swords, elven chainmail (although there isn't an elf to be seen in the game anywhere - maybe it has something to do with their armor laying all over the place), cursed bows and the like. The really neat items are the rings. There are so many useful and interesting rings that each character eventually had three or four that I would switch around as the action demanded. Some offered increased attack or defense capabilities, some made spell casting a whole lot easier on the caster, and others increased the various side skills that each character needed to practice.  The two most important skills for the game are the Analyze skill and the Disarm Traps skill. The Analyze skill identifies magic items. The Disarm Trap skill is used, you guessed it, to disarm the various traps found throughout the game. I found this part of the game to be really inventive and enjoyable. Each trap has three components-a trigger, a mechanism and a delivery method. You first need to identify the type of components your trap has-tripwires, pressure plates, needles, blades, etc.-and then determine which of your 3 lock-picking tools is best for the job. You have a lever, a ratchet and a pair of cutters. Each tool has a greater or lesser chance of disarming each type of component. A lever might work well on the poison tanks but fail when used on springs and gears. This you'll only learn through experimentation with different types of tools and different types of traps. And the experimentation can be very deadly.  The ~evil~ inhabitants of this world are what you might expect-skeletons, goblins, necromancers, brigands, and such. These for the most part don't seem to offer a lot of surprises but the various human individuals are well developed. Each person possesses a definite and distinctive personality. The emphasis given to groups of people is also refreshing. The societies, clubs and guilds in this game make the whole game world seem like a real place. The Nighthawks, who want James dead, are dark and mysterious.  The Mockers are James old gang of street toughs and thugs. Then there's the Wreckers' Guild, a group of magicians who specialize in salvaging sunken ships. To me that's such a cool idea and it really pays off later in the game. On top of the occupational classes, the individual nationalities have their own unique characteristics. Haldon Head is a perfect little New England town, right down to the accents of the inhabitants.  The story line is linear with one or two definite objectives for each section of the game, but there are a few substantial adventures outside of the main story line that you can explore. While not necessary to finish the game, these side quests are as fun as the main action of the game and pay off with big rewards both in experience and loot. Beyond the side quests, the game designers came up with the bright idea to have the main story line split into two parts early in the game. You switch back and forth from one group to another as the two story lines drift back towards one another until they converge at the climax of the game. Switching back and forth between the two gives you a fresh perspective and keeps your interest level high. It also strikes me as more realistic as the party is trying two different approaches to achieve their objective. That just makes more sense to me.  While I don't think I'm going to rush right out and give Betrayal at Krondor another chance, Return to Krondor really delivers. I can forgive its shortcomings-the lack of any practical variety in the magic system or the characters-for the sake of its strengths-a satisfying, intelligent story and a really superb fighting system. Gameplay is frustrating at times but you'll get the hang of the interfaces soon enough. Although the story might not be any fun to read, it's a heck of a lot of fun if you're actually playing it. For those of you who might be turned off because of the poor magic system, I should say that the game offers three playing options that affect the balance between the game's emphasis on combat and magic. I was playing on the balanced level, which supposedly offers an even taste of each. You can always weight the game more or less heavily to the use of magic as you preference dictates.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jan 29, 1999"}
