Though this probably means very little to most of you, to me personally, being an Englishman and all, it would be the main reason to choose this over, say, ISS. Imagine the little old lady next-door excitedly changing bank accounts after being offered one with a more favourable pension scheme. What this means, in real terms, is that the English team members all use their correct names. Since I normally use them in these games, being patriotic and all, this is a nice touch that adds to the realism in a way not normally found in a handheld title. If you're not English, it's something you'll probably not even notice. Features Multi-lingual selection screens Practice, Friendly, Cup and League options Extra Time or Golden Goal On-cartridge battery saves tournament progress. Only for Game Boy Color.  Of course, the actual game itself is far more important  which, for UEFA Soccer, is no bad thing. The engine is pretty fluid and the players handle well, with responsive controls that allow you to pass, shoot and tackle with ease. It could be said that getting hold of the ball is too simple, and that the opposing goalkeeper doesn't present enough of a challenge  but that's only in comparison to ISS; and besides, these features make the game more enjoyable in many respects. Headers and such like are also easy to pull off, the aerial action adding to the 'arcadey' feel. Auto-player-selection systems are usually incredibly annoying  though here it works surprisingly well, always switching at opportune moments. The one complaint is the speed of the game, which can get painfully slow at times. It's never jerky: your players just occasionally move at a crawl. It can't be down to a clever fatigue system, since it sometimes happens right at the start of a match.  As well as the standard friendly option, you can enter a favourite team into a number of different cups and leagues, playing them off against others from their region, the rest of the world, or your own selection. The variety of different tournament set-ups is very impressive: UEFA never feels like a game that has been simplified for the handheld, which is a rarity with sports titles. You have a fair amount of control over your team in terms of formation and tactics, though the choices available are not quite as comprehensive as those in ISS. A simple practice mode, useful for whittling away those short breaks, rounds the package off nicely.  Infogrames titles always have great graphics, and this is no exception. The sprites and colors are clear and crisp; and despite so many being present at once, the game never gets choppy. I also have to mention the incredibly attractive front-end, which is colourful and easy to navigate. Overall, it's far bolder and brighter than ISS. In terms of sound, the game is perfectly functional, with a by-the-numbers tune for the menus and a neat effect to simulate the roar of the crowd taking the place of ISS's dreadfully ill-fitting music during the match itself.   So, it's a good game. It plays differently to ISS, but is great fun all the same. Whatever you do, however, don't bother buying an extra copy for your mate  UEFA Soccer has no two-player option. This is almost criminal in a soccer title; ISS proved it could be done; and what is the point of a game that is competitive by nature failing to offer players realistic, human competition? The mind boggles.   Ultimately, UEFA Soccer is solid and workman-like. It isn't a bad game by any means, being nice to look at and a lot of fun to play. Better than ISS in some ways and inferior in others, it's the issue of multiplayer that pushes UEFA into second place. There's no excuse for the missing link-cable option  releasing a one-player sports title is like playing football without a spherical ball; sheer insanity.Note: UEFA Soccer 2000 is currently only available in Europe  Infogrames has no plans on bringing this game to the US.
