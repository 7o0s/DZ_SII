Two years and four months of work later, Rebellion's port of that surprisingly enjoyable twitch shooter is finally out on PlayStation 2. But somewhere along the development line fifty points of worth got thrown out the window. What began as sleek and fast somehow became a clunky, boxy, arid and generic first-person shooter with exactly one redeeming quality: multiplayer.   If Internet packets are still delivered to and from your computer via dutiful pigeons, do not bother picking up Black Hawk Down. If your online hookup is slamming, however, check this one out for some totally chaotic multiplayer matches.   Singleplayer BHD tries to incorporate rudimentary squad-based mechanics and character development into a purely arcade shooting experience. It focuses on the patriotic exploits of tank-like American heroes in an AI-free Somalia. Though the PC game also featured that kind of no-brain-necessary killing, it did so with style and grace. The Comanche powered graphics engine was no slouch in 2003 and Black Hawk Down's ultra fast ground-pounding highlighted by the occasional on-rails segment made gunning down tens of thousands of militant Somalis fairly enjoyable. That is no longer the case.  Without a shred of style, singleplayer BHD PS2 has been propelled back into the ice age of FPS gaming. We can partly attribute this one's complete lack of audio / visual quality to it attempting to remain a straight port. Someone, somewhere, decided to try and net all the sweeping landscapes and cluttered locales of BHD PC and cram them into the PS2, which obviously did not work. You cannot pour five gallons of water into a container built to hold little more than a cup, after all. The fact that somebody tried is commendable, but the results are still messy.  Since most of this port revolves around the same ranged combat of the original, the PS2's low resolution graphics, chunky framerate, sluggish turning and careless distribution of the color beige diminish the otherwise intense experience (for however old it might be). Think of it as all five gallons of the original, but with no actual container, and so the game suffers dramatically.  OMG! They're Shooting Lasers!  BHD also has no storyline, but it does offer a rather pointless upgrade system (allocate stars here to buy this or improve that). Unfortunately, the base game is easy enough so none of that actually matters. Not even the squad system is important.  Go ahead and dish out commands to your boys. Give me ammo! Give me health! Open fire! Cover me! Regroup! Wait! None of it freaking matters. The option to snap a headset on and belt out the same pointless orders into the microphone is neat, but it doesn't impact gameplay at all. It's best to just run forward killing. So get over it. Get over all of it. In fact, don't even bother trying to get over it, just get around it and play online with us.  Even though a BHD user can only host an eight-player match, right now there are about 10 - 15 servers running 32-player games online. These are officially hosted and ranked. Most are dominated by Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch modes, but it's not hard to find the occasional Team King of the Hill game running. Performance is pretty damn good on those, too. But really, any match is enjoyable.   Given a decent host, BHD runs fairly well. But since there'll be far fewer 32-player servers online at any given time, pickings might be a bit too slim for some gamers. Even considering that, the insane chaos of larger matches is something that shouldn't be missed by online shooting enthusiasts.  Black Hawk Down doesn't have the balancing of Quake III, nor does it have the accessibility of Unreal Tournament or the teamwork of Battlefield. It's more like this giant bowl of totally random stuff -- 32 people in some nondescript environment get to go bananas (basically). This makes the game a disaster, but a fun kind of disaster. The shooting works, the action is fast, the weapons are outrageously unbalanced, none of the environments make any real sense, and half of what your character is capable of doing doesn't really matter in application... But running around like a madman throwing grenades and shooting people around corners is pretty darn fun. Well, most of the time, at least.  Deathmatch is a little too crazy. Team Deathmatch is nice, but lacks the cohesive collaborative slaughter of something like Unreal Tournament. King of the Hill is enjoyable, but an abundance of explosives makes that mode a little infuriating. Flag Ball (like steal the bacon or one flag CTF) and Team Tag (keep the marker) are enjoyable in passing. But CTF... CTF is the money.  Dig this. Each base contains several flags. Multiple flags can be running at one time. There are also extra spawn points that can be captured. So in 32-player games four dudes might have a few flags, ten might be killing each other in choke points, a small handful could be sniping, and another few could be trying to capture spawn points to give their team an advantage. Players might blink in and out of existence like crazy when they spawn or die and some people will teleport across the map due to lag, but the MP CTF is still fun. Unfortunately, that's about it. There's this online tracking tool that accumulates a bunch of numbers and there are 20 ranks to move through, but there's no real benefit attached to any of that. You're pretty much just playing CTF and running around like a maniac. Once that get olds, BHD will get thrown into the closet.", "date": "Jul 29, 2005"}
