Medal of Honor Underground came the closest, but it didn't have the four-player mode, it didn't have the stealth, and it didn't have complexity. Last year's Tomorrow Never Dies was a total flop, and didn't even come close. While this year's model, The World Is Not Enough (TWINE), captures some of the flavor from the movie and mimics several of the brilliant scenarios from Goldeneye, Black Ops either doesn't have the same level of programming manpower as Rare, or the skill.   Whichever way you look at TWINE, the game does deliver a cachet of bright spots, makes use of some inventive gadgetry, and grows more complex and entertaining in each and every level. Let's be clear, TWINE doesn't come close to Goldeneye, and it's entirely different than the superior Nintendo 64 version, but it's better than Tomorrow Never Dies. Where does that leave us? TWINE is a solid action game with hints of goodness here and yonder, and it's worthy of any spy-lover's time.   Gameplay TWINE follows the storyline of the movie of the same name, and bookends each level with significantly lengthy cuts from the movie to create a mood and sense of danger, to set the tone and to close that segment of the game. While the game is only 11 levels long (yes, it's short), about half way through the game the levels grow more complex. I found that instead of simply plowing through a level with guns a'blazing I had to stop and think about my mission. Not much thinking was involved, mind you, just a little. But it was enough to get that spy feeling.  I was encouraged to use the dozens of great Bond gadgets, and even resorted to stealth in a few of the levels. Goodness gracious me! Actual stealth gameplay!   Players start a level by listening to M, hearing from Q (and EA actually got John Cleese to do the voice-over) and being introduced to the gadgets in that particular level, and then hearing a little cheesy sexual innuendo or pun from Money Penny. It's oh-so-posh a front end, but it's less excessive than last year's, and it essentially uses multimedia to deliver the same kind of content that players were presented with in Goldeneye. They get mission objectives, guns and gadgets, some background info, and a little kiss on the cheek before being sent out into the fire.   One big difference from last year's version is that the game design (front end and level design) is simply better. It's simpler to use Bond's intercom, it's easier -- and faster -- to select and use weapons and gadgets. And players will find that the oft-interruption from M creates a little tension and fun into the mix. Also, players are presented with a better control scheme -- square and triangle toggle through weapon selection, ~X~ is fire, R2 and L2 are strafe, and ~O~ opens doors. To grab a weapon, you simply walk over it.   The game engine is the same as the one used in Tomorrow Never Dies, but it's been reworked and strengthened to incorporate several improvements over last year's bomb. First, the aiming mechanism is very accurate and is relatively smooth. Players will find that 98% of the time they shoot an enemy in the head, it'll kill them. Occasionally the shot misses, but the accuracy isn't worse than any other FPS I've played lately. Second, the game is a first-person shooter, not a clumsy third-person hunchbacked lama like last year. Remarkably, character movement is quick, responsive and nimble, and for a PlayStation game to handle this kind of floating-point processor intensive stuff (considering that PlayStation software and hardware don't support floating-point processor math), is quite a trick. There are problems with the game, including collision detection problems with inanimate objects and non-enemy characters, and the like, but the bulk of the game's problems aren't located in the gameplay department.    Here are the 11 level names and some of the basic tasks and unique qualities found in them: Courier -- Kill bad guys, find briefcase, escape from building using briefcase.   King's Ransom -- Great use of Grappling Hook Watch. Cold Reception -- A new look at skiing in Bond, good use of sniper rifle, and the use of the inflatable vest, from the movie. Russian Roulette -- Gamble $25,000 and manipulate bad guy AI around.  Night Watch -- Some stealth required; use of fingerprint scanner.  Masquerade -- Some minor smarts required. Use of fists, ID cards, protection of Christmas Jones, and some timing required.  Flashpoint -- Timing definitely required, saving of hostages, and a direct rip off of Goldeneye's Cuba, Control Center level in which you have to protect Natalia (Christmas) from a brutal onslaught of enemies while she's working to crack a code.  City of Walkways -- A protection and attack mission with a considerable amount of sophistication. First you protect Christmas and Zukovsky from a slew of enemies, and then you use the mini rocket launcher to take out two of three helicopters, two with hanging tree cutters, just like in the movie. You then use a gas valve and a flare gun to take out the third helicopter while fending off gunmen. Nice. Turncoat -- The subway mission in which Bond must plow through easy-to-hit gunman and then diffuse a bomb before catching up with Bullion, Zukovsky's turncoat insider. Fallen Angel -- You're unarmed but somehow unwatched. Find your weapons, lots of keys, free M, and take out Electra's body guard and then Electra, if you can... Meltodown -- You have several objectives while in the submarine, but the central ones are to find and kill Renard, free Christmas Jones, and escape from the sub before it blows. Then unwrap your busty Christmas present. Yuck, yuck.    What TWINE does well is make use of lots of gadgets. In every level you'll use at least one of two, and in some you'll use as many as four or five. TWINE actually uses more gadgets than Goldeneye, even if some of them are a little trivial. Here are some of the notable gadgets and guns that you'll use in TWINE. The guns also grow more and more powerful as you get deeper and deeper into the game, too. The pinnacle is single-hand rocket launcher, which enables you to take down helicopters. That just feels good! Flashlight Flashbang  Night Vision Glasses Grappling watch Finger Print Scanner Tranquilizer gun Micro Camera Telephone Bug Credit Card Lock Pick Inflatable Jacket VLF (Very Low Frequency) Disruptor Cell Phone Stunner Rocket Launcher Flare Gun  Pen Explosive Wolfram P2K Kazakovich KA-57 Grenade Launcher Ingalls Type 20 Radiation Detector   In the end of every level, you're judged by: Enemies Eliminated, Efficiency, Accuracy, Health, Time, Score, and Ranking. Players are encourage to play through on the harder difficulty levels to open up newer secrets and to fight off even more difficult enemies, and while you're simply blasting away at better equipped baddies, the game is so short it's worth doing it again.   There are a few standout levels that really make this game unique, and I want to talk about these because they are different from Tomorrow Never Dies, Goldeneye, and unique unto themselves. Russian Roulette isn't actually a level so much as it is a virtual gambling game buried inside the FPS. The level is very easy, except for the gambling. The weird thing is that I spent more time trying to win money (I needed to earn $100,000) than I did playing in any single level in the entire game. And, what's more, I didn't mind. I had a blast gambling, but it was way better gambling than playing the rest of the level. It does say something about the game, though, doesn't it? Night Watch was a great level. It required sneaking and stealth. I had to get from point A to point B, and there was a tons of rooms to explore and I had to tranquilize or beat up the guards every time. What's more, is that I was put into the position of, ~What do I do now?~ And I felt ~smart~ when I figured out how to beat the level. (OK, it's easy to make me feel smart.) Still, the conspicuous lack of direction was nice, and there is nothing like this on Medal of Honor Underground, which is far more linear. Masquerade and Flashpoint: The whole bit about protecting Christmas Jones here is straight out of Goldeneye, and while it's not entirely original, it was a challenging and enjoyable level. Also, the use of night glasses and straight up fistfights was fun.   The level City of WalkwaysTurncoat and Meltdown are also relatively original and require more than just your basic gameplay knowledge. Again, taking out the helicopters with rocket launchers was lots of fun, but also destroying the last one, with a wrench and a flare gun was quite inventive. It was almost new. Also, the bomb detonation levels are a little too simple for my tastes, but they are a step in the right direction. I'm used to dying a lot and thinking a little more before taking out a major bomb. Lastly, the radiation level area was just plain neat. It wasn't complicated, hard, or long, but it was just cool to use a gadget for something completely new.   Oh, and multiplayer modes. The lack of even a two-player multiplayer mode totally sucks. Sure, two-player games aren't as fun as four-player games, but this game by the same name on Nintendo 64 has a four-person multiplayer game that's near awesome, and this game has nada. Hmm...which to buy?   Graphics While the gameplay is a few notches over Tomorrow Never Dies, only one aspect of the graphics are: the textures. TWINE's textures are almost decadently wasteful. Even an EA representative told me that it's too bad most people won't even see them (because you'll be buzzing through the level as fast as possible). The varied textures and great assortment of windows, artwork, and color use is truly fantastic compared to any PlayStation game.   As for the movies, they work perfectly. They wrap each level up with the real deal and add the kind of excitement that the game lacks into the fold. As for the loading times, they are also pretty damn good. After the first long loading time, no levels are over about 15 seconds.   That leads us to the grade school animations. After the great textures, we get the absolutely horrible character animations. The complaints are numerous: simple, repetitive animations; too few character models (there are about two guard types and no more than two woman types); and character movement is so bad that these characters truly look like they're from the late '60s puppet show, Thunderbirds!. The best example is the Russian Roulette women. Walk up to one and you've met 50% of the women in the level. These gals are all Stepford Wife clones! Second, press O to talk to them and they automatically pull an invisible loose hair from their back. Every time. It's scary, and it's so lame it's just funny to watch. Lastly, Denise Richards' character model is HORRIBLE, she looks like a badly wounded Barbie Robot puppet from a bad LSD trip. I'm not even attracted to her, but my senses are clear -- she's been visually mauled. Bad Black Ops!   Sound There was an attempt to use voice-overs in this game, and the final judgment is 50/50. The guy who does Bond is simply off. He sounds like he's saying ~Bund.~ Q, John Cleese, as himself, is perfect. Most of the voice-overs are good -- Q, Jones, and even Electra is at least OK. Some, however, are bad. Some of the actual voice-overs can't be heard near the end of the game because of weird glitches.   The music, I simply must point out, is soooo overdone, it's silly. How many times should we hear the damn Bond theme song? It's like because EA paid to use the music, they shoved the darn song and its variations straight down out throat, over and over and over again. Sure, it's cool we get to hear the Bond theme, but jeeeeze, guys. Overdose is too nice a word. Drowned is more like it. In the end, The World Is Not Enough is not a horrible game. It's not remotely as good as the Nintendo 64 version, but it's certainly a major improvement over last year's shank-fest. (And it's not even remotely close to Goldeneye.) The developers at Black Ops tried hard to do something new, and in some cases, the levels show a glimmering of something cool, something slightly different, something spy-like and attractive. Mostly though, TWINE is a short, rudimentary shooter with nothing more than a few good gadgets and a great license backing it up. The lack of a multiplayer game is a shame, too. If you have to play Bond, play the Nintendo 64 version. If you only own a PlayStation, rent this first and see what you think.", "date": "Nov 9, 2000"}
