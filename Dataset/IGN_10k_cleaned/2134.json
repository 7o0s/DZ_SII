Wander carefully through the minefield that is videogame fandom and every so often you'll step on a proper Claymore of a Monster Rancher fan, a violent defender of the glory that is Tecmo's unusual breed-and-battle simulation.  Like so many sims, this is not necessarily a game for the masses, but those who like it tend to really, really like it.  And one of those may turn out to be you.  Monster Rancher bears a superficial resemblance to Pokemon, with a core of ain't-they-cute monster combat, but the RPG framework thereof is replaced by a more conventional simulation interface, and its signature monster-spawning gimmick is still great fun.  You can pull monsters out of an ~encyclopedia~ database if you like, but the real fun is using your collection of CDs and DVDs to create a stable of monsters.  Swap a disc in and out of your console and data therefrom will form the basis of a new monster.  That is, of course, just a gimmick, though -- the lion's share of your simulating time is spent raising and fighting with your monster, compared to which the action of creating it takes up just a few moments.  There's a good deal to do here, although the sim experience differs in several important ways from earlier Monster Rancher games, and the new cel-shaded graphics are, of course, terribly cute.  Monster Rancher fans should expect a different experience from what they're used to, but not in an unwelcome fashion.  Gameplay  Once you give birth to your monster, via your favorite disc of the boring old Encyclopedia, it's off to your training grounds to build his skills.  Curiously, Monster Rancher 3 discards the old device of your ~farm,~ which actually makes the Japanese title ~Monster Farm~ a bit of a misnomer.  Instead, you keep your monsters in the open, guiding them one at a time, with a variety of options and opportunities that affect their development.  Each week, you have several choices -- exercise one of their stats, rest the monster, feed them, equip them, or take them off to a battle tournament.  Exercise puts a monster through a cute little cutscene where they perform some little task, hoping to succeed and build one statistic or another.  Food also builds stats, and the balance between nutrition and taste affects a monster's performance and attitude.  Equipment can personalize your monster (you can clothe them with a wide variety of widgets that become part of their realtime character model), as well as affect performance.  And of course, rest is rest.  Battle tournaments, though, are the big deal.  Your goal is to work a monster up through the ranks by winning battles at the Tochikan Festa.  Lesser tournaments are worthwhile as well, building up a monster's skills and occasionally netting you cash and prizes.  Combat is now an odd blend of action and strategy (reminds me of Ring of Red, strangely enough), wherein you maneuver on a linear battlefield divided into three different range zones.  Certain attacks work from a particular range, so you can use simple positioning tactics for offense and defense, in addition to your active attacks and passive defensive qualities.  Combat is dead simple in comparison to the business of raising your monster, though.  There is a ridiculous amount of depth to the factors that affect a monster's growth and development, especially over their lengthy lifespan.  All kinds of random elements appear during training -- other breeders will want to fight you, you'll buy and discover all kinds of different items, new training grounds reveal themselves the world over (complete with their own array of battle tournaments), you can explore the area for new items at the turn of the seasons...and so on, and so on.  Some features from earlier Monster Ranchers are missing, like the ability to interbreed monsters, but nobody is going to complain that there isn't enough complexity here.  What could inspire problems is the pace of the game -- you do have to spend time dealing with loads, repetitive cutscenes, and somewhat slow conversations -- but that's the way the simulation bounces.  Or something like that...  Graphics  This is as cute as Monster Rancher has ever been.  Some of the monster designs may not quite be my cup of tea, but the series still has plenty of enduring icons, and they look lovely in cel-shaded 3D.  The framerate is perfect in battle and during the training sequences -- more than a little thanks to the relatively simple backgrounds, perhaps (lots of sharp edges and basic textures), but the world still looks good, and cohesively so.  The variety of environments is substantial, too, from the pleasant sylvan atmosphere of Morx to deserts, frozen wastes, and more.  The combat sequences are Monster Rancher standard -- the animations may be a little hokey, and the effects cartoonish, but they're part of the series' style, and they're fast enough to keep battles moving smoothly.  If we had to sit through heart-stoppingly beautiful half-minute Final Fantasy-style attacks, that would probably get a little trying after a while.  As it is, combat looks good enough and proceeds at a fast pace, which means you can get on with the business of raising your monster (what the game is really about, after all).  Sound  Not a lot to listen to here, although many monsters make a pleasant variety of happy chirping noises.  The musical score is very basic, and there is no voice acting -- perhaps thankfully so in that last category.  The English translation is better than in earlier preview versions, but it still gets a little stiff from time to time, and the original script itself can't have had all that many inspiring lines.  You do a lot of trash-talking with fellow monster breeders, but most of it remains on the level of ~Yeah!  I'm gonna win!~  Ah, if only I had my old copy of Dragon Force... But never mind.  Monster Rancher 3 delivers where it counts, with the deep breeding simulation that fans of the series have grown to love.  The combat system and brief cinematic interludes are just there to provide a goal for the core activities of the game, as well as break up the less action-oriented sequences.  Your goal is to win battles, but the lion's share of what you do is the training that gets your monster into fighting form.And like any simulation, that process can grow powerfully addictive (or a thorough turn-off, but taste is always a factor when it comes to judging these sorts of games).  Monster Rancher 3 makes the important mistake of not forcing you to do too much of the same thing for too long.  There's a routine to fall into for raising an effective monster, but it's frequently broken up by random events, with a good ratio of effort to reward to those who take part in extra battles, tournaments, Ran Ran quests, and so much more.The final caveat, of course, is that I cannot assure anyone that they will actually like this game.  It's very good at setting out to do what it wants to do, but some players may not want to have anything to do with.  In that sense, it's very much like another fine Tecmo simulation, Gallop Racer.  Also like Gallop Racer, though, the open-minded owe it to themselves to at least give this game a shot.", "date": "Sep 27, 2001"}
