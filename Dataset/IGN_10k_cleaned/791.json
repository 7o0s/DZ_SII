Nothing's more exhilarating than splitting your hand with two aces showing, nailing 21 with two flips of a card  or even cashing out on a full jackpot on a four window machine.  It's the sense of accomplishment, the sense of beating the odds, and the sense that you've won a buttload of money. But you know, when you reduce casino games to the form of a generic collection of handheld titles, the essence of what makes the games ~fun~ is completely eliminated...and you're just left with an empty shell. And even though 3DO's and Digital Eclipse's Vegas Games is a plentiful (albiet problematic) compilation of gambling games, it still doesn't remove the fact that when you don't have the cash, you don't have the fun. Features More than 20 casino games Password save Only for Game Boy Color  For what it is, Vegas Games does give you a lot of bang for the buck. There are more than 20 different games in here. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration  there's really only eight: Keno, Money Wheel, Baccarat, Slots, Video Poker, Craps, Roulette, and my favorite...Blackjack. The 20 games come from the multiple slot and poker machines, as well as computerized and ~real~ Keno. It's still Vegas  you need money to play. At any point in the game, you can go into the casino's ATM and deposit or withdraw your earnings. You start out with five grand and go from there. If you want to save your game, you have to deposit your cash and grab a password. Up to three other players can come into the game, but you'll have to play hot-potato with the system when it's their turn. And that gets confusing enough on top of the clunky interface, which I'll get to below.  The game also doesn't have a battery back-up  a shame, since Vegas Games keeps track of your earnings at each table. The password only saves your total cash -- once you turn off the system, the statistics disappear. But that's not the only problem with this game pak.  The design of each casino table is a mixed bag. They all look great, but each features the same real problems  a clumsy interface that takes a bit to get used to, and  more importantly  no sense of victory when you win big. I can get over the interface, since it's all a matter of following the cursor and remembering which button chooses the chips you want to use. But when I win Blackjack, I want to actually know I've won. If you're like my friend who can't tell that a 9, 5, and 4 showing is 18 for example, you'd never know that you beat the dealer's shown 8, 7, and 2, since the game never, ever, ever tells you you've won. Same thing with all the other games  there are no flashing lights, no loud bells, no nothing when you win...in any game. It's very unsatisfying. It's almost as if the design team ran out of time designing the games, only completing the bare minimum before working on ~frills.~ They got a few animation sequences in there, like the rolling tumblers of the slot machines, and the spinning roulette wheel  but others seem a bit rushed. You never see the dice roll in craps, for instance. I can appreciate the fact that some people enjoy playing these games without the risk of losing their houses, but I just can't see myself playing Vegas Games...ever -- beyond this review, at least. As a casino compilation goes, it's standard, maybe just a little less than that. But as a fun Game Boy Color game? Not even close.", "date": "Mar 18, 2000"}
