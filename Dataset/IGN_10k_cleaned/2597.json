The Game Boy Advance title's simplistic fun, until it's over way too soon. This game was rushed out well before it was ready for primetime...it definitely needed a few more weeks in the shop. Features Eight arenas Fifty Monster Trucks Championship and Arcade Modes Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  This game pits you in a no-holds-barred demolition derby between four Monster Trucks in enclosed arenas. The challenge is to be the last truck standing in each of the battles, driving around picking up weapons to unleash on the other drivers. Your vehicle's separated into seven sectors...each part can be independently weakened by your opponents' firepower and brute force. Take too much damage in the rear, for example, and you'll have to protect that area from further whacks to that side. Since these are Monster Trucks, obstacle destruction is encouraged...and by crushing parked cars and knocking over lampposts, you build up your power meter...fill it up and you'll go into Mayhem Mode, charging up your vehicle to make you nearly invincible for a good portion of the battle. Though the game's perspective is at a mostly top-down viewpoint, arenas can go up and down, providing several opportunities to pull off some airborne tricks for extra points. At the end of a battle, the points you've earned can be translated into money for better parts installed on your truck. The more you spend on your vehicle, the better you'll handle out in the arena.  But that's pretty much the whole Monster Jam deal. When you've unlocked the hidden arenas and trucks in Championship Mode, you can go back and play with them in the single round arcade mode...but this mode doesn't offer anything different that's already been done in the main game. The game is actually a lot of fun, until you realize that the Championship Mode is over in a little more than an hour, and that you can't play against any human opponents anywhere in this cartridge.  If you're going to create a four-vehicle car combat game, multiplayer support is a must. Monster Jam: Maximum Destruction has the foundation to be an excellent fun car combat title for the GBA, but the gameplay can only go so far with three computer controlled drones to battle. There isn't a whole lot to this game as it is, but the fun would have exploded (that's a good thing)  if the designer included link cable support in the design. Would it have killed Ubi Soft to hold onto the title for another month? What was the rush of getting this game on shelves in April, anyway? An hour and a half of playing through the game's championship mode, and it was all over. Monster Jam won't last more than a single sitting...which is why link cable support should have been mandatory in this Game Boy Advance title. Once you've blown through the game's Championship ladder, there's nothing else to uncover in this design. It's a fun trip, but it's over way too quickly.", "date": "Apr 5, 2002"}
