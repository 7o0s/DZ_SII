The answer is The Gladiators of Rome. I'll be honest with you, the concept of getting into an arena and fighting to the death is certainly an appealing one. Who can resist the urge of pumping the crowd, hearing them roar, and beckoning you to deliver that final, killer blow? Sure, it sounds good on paper, but the good folks at Cat Daddy Games didn't really take the time to make this game good, let alone great.    The concept is simple. You begin with a small amount of money that is yours to spend as you see fit. You will more than likely spend most of your cash buying a hardcore gladiator who looks tough and can get the job done. Well, they all look pretty much the same. They're all the same blocky, generic, poorly modeled and animated characters, save some different clothing and weaponry. Once you have selected your gladiator, you are then advised to equip them with a stronger weapon than their default armament. There are 5 weapon categories including clubs, maces, slings, axes and swords. Within each category are two further options than the default weapon, for a total of 15 possible weapons. Each class has the same model, so even when one does upgrade their sling for example, it will look identical to its predecessor. After you select your gladiator's weaponry, you have the option of training them.   Now for the ~fun~ part: grab your gladiators and throw them into battle! Weeee! Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Let me outline in great detail how your men go about combat. Simply right click on the gladiator of your choice to bring up a menu of options. You can attack, defend, deliver a killer blow, incite the crowd, use a special attack, move, or sprint. When it comes right down to it, you basically only have 4 options for attacking. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the animations and representation of combat weren't so dull and, quite frankly, lame. Once you have selected the character you want to attack, your gladiator will do so, in a similar fashion to that of Diablo. However, once he has delivered the one attack, you must then wait for a time bar to fill up before you can choose another action. This puts a sudden halt on gameplay as there is no continuity. There is really nothing deeper than the simple ~point and click~ objective.    The gameplay is as deep as timing your attacks so they coincide with when your opponent doesn't defend. This may sound like the principle of any action game, but the entire game is based on random chance and gross unpredictability. If pointing and clicking wasn't bad enough, try doing it when you have more than two gladiators to manage. You must now be constantly clicking and clicking, sometimes not even realizing what action you selected, simply to avoid being caught standing there by one of your (often many) opponents. As more and more characters are in the arena at once, another problem presents itself: movement. Unlike other real-time strategy games where you can simply click where you want your character to move, you must first select the option ~move~ or ~sprint~ from the actions menu. Not only does this slow down gameplay, but it's one more thing you need to worry about, and shouldn't have to.   The graphics in The Gladiators of Rome are at best sub-par. Low polygon count is most prevalent not only in the characters but in the stadiums and audience renderings. There is very little attention to detail: the ground is a dull brown with little texturing to speak of, the crowd barely moves, and the backgrounds are uninspired and generic. There are only 3 possible resolution options: 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768. Even at the highest resolution the graphics remain rough and blocky. Particle effects are not handled particularly well. Dust and blood seem to be some of the only effects that were implemented into the game, and neither looks all that great. Blood will splatter for a brief moment before disappearing, and no matter where you may strike your opponent, the quantity and location of the blood exiting your victim's body remains the same.   The animations are jerky and unnatural. The characters have an extremely low polygon count, giving every action the appearance of forcefulness and rigidity. This is especially noticeable when you have your gladiator deliver a killer blow, only to see the dagger repeat what a battle with your friends might look like: your sword traveling beside your friend's arm, not even looking like you made contact with his body.    The sound department is particularly disappointing. In a game where atmosphere should be predominant, one struggles to comprehend why certain sound effects are used at the times they are. There is too much randomness to the entire sound presentation. The music that plays in the menus is jerky and repetitive (in all honesty that is the best way of describing it). There is your standard trumpet fanfare that one might expect to find in a game of this type, but it is composed poorly and implemented sloppily. The in game music is not in the least bit dynamic, as the same repetitive piece plays in the background throughout an entire battle. If you are victorious, a short victory fanfare is played. The brutal screeching sounds of said fanfare are almost sweet, as they are the sign of the end of another laborious battle.    The clashing of swords and the grunts of the gladiators quickly grows tiresome. The gladiators never actually say anything. The closest they come is making a loud ~UGH~ sound when they're mercifully killed (if it's painful for me to play this game, they must be suffering being in it). The developers took care in ensuring that you pay special attention to the audience. The more involved the audience gets in the battle, the more money you are able to earn when the match is won. The crowd will yell various taunts and encouragements at random, yet there is little variety. There was one battle when all anyone ever said was ~to the lions!~ and ~show him what you're made of!~   What did you think of Gladiators of Rome?   When all is said and done The Gladiators of Romeleaves much to be desired. Playing the game is more of an effort than an experience. The general sloppiness of the game and its presentation prevent the player from becoming immersed, when immersion is integral to this kind of game. Perhaps if the Activision spent a little more time at the drawing board, they may have produced a game that succeeded at what they hoped to accomplish. Until then, I think I'll just watch Russell Crowe take on 5 guys at once. He's got finesse. I went into this review with little to no bias. I was actually looking forward to playing a game from this modified genre of action and real time strategy. But when it comes down to it, the game is simply not fun. There is too much of a clash between real time and turn-based strategy that translates into a magnitude of frustration.", "date": "Nov 26, 2002"}
