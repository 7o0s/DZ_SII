Mario Party 3 is naturally just an extension of the first two and offers the same large selection of Nintendo's popular mascot characters. It offers the same type of gameplay with little new additions, and the real reason to pop this cartridge in your Nintendo 64 is only if you have three other friends playing with you. As indicated by the word ~Party~ in the title, it is a cartridge you shouldn't dare boot up alone.   Features   70 brand new mini-games   Five differently themed boards: ice, sea, desert, and more  Improved Battle Royal mode with more items than ever before  Dual-specific map mode   New mascot characters including Waluigi and Daisy   Four-player support  Save to EEPROM    Gameplay There aren't many new surprises in the gameplay area if you're a fan of having ~Mario Parties.~ The fact is, Mario Party has been and likely always will be about the mini-games. It is in their mini-cleverness and variety that you often find loads of fun (especially after a few drinks...of Kool-Aid, kids!). But first, lets consider the features that Mario Party 3 offers this time around. Firstly, you'll get a few new characters to choose from. Namely, the lanky, evil Luigi twin, Waluigi, and somewhat tomboyish, Daisy -- characters Camelot introduced into the limelight with Mario Tennis. Of course, they are novelty additions, as one character does not benefit from strengths over the other.  You can use all these characters in Party mode and the single-player Story mode. Specifically, you can select the number of turns to be played, board maps, handicap levels and more in Party mode. You also have the ability to play the Battle Royal Maps with up to four players or a two-person head-to-head Duel Map. For Story mode you're led on a quest by the precious Millenium Star, and must play the board it chooses for you. There are three levels of difficulty including easy, normal, and hard, but that's about all you can set. Within Story mode the Battle Royal Map revolves around a 15-turn game with no handicap, while the Duel map has 20 turns. The difference between Battle Royal Maps and Duel maps is as follows:   Duel Maps are on-on-one game boards where you can use partners to attack your opponent. Place first in most mini-game battles to claim victory. To win you must simply knock your opponent's stamina down to zero. This is what you use your partners for, as well as protecting yourself. Each partner has their own attack, stamina, and salary ratings. Attack power tells how much stamina they can take away from your opponent, while the salary rating is the number of coins you have to pay your partner each turn. If you run out of coins, your partner leaves, thus decreasing your chance of winning. Battle Royal Maps are free-for-all boards where the victor is decided by who collects the most stars during the round. At the end of the game, 15-turns, you will receive a star rating based on how many stars you hold. If you have the bonus setting on during this rating session you can earn extra stars if you moved the most spaces, won the most mini-games, or collected the most coins. As you can imagine, this can drastically effect the outcome of the game.    Getting back to an actual description of the general gameplay, though, it really should be stressed that Mario Party 3's main appeal is the fact that it has 70 all-new mini-games. They are the lifeblood of this series, and as usual there are plenty of them, which feature clever, button-mashing, analog stick twisting mechanics. And they aren't all easy either. One mini-game demanded that you control a giant robotic water spider. To make all four of its legs moves you must quickly press the analog stick up while pressing the B-button, then down and the B-button, then up and the A-button, then finally down and the A-button -- repeat, repeat, repeat. So, this isn't necessarily just for ~children~ as some might pin it to be. If you gather three of your good friends, have a few drinks (again, we refer to Kool-Aid), and throw down the gauntlet, you will probably enjoy yourself quite a bit.   With that said, though, that's probably the only way you're going to get a big kick out of Mario Party 3. It's pretty much the same as the first two incarnations. There are a few new additions to the maps such as the ability to use items. You can buy items at shops on the boards with the coins you've earned and use them to increase your dice roll, unlock new paths, set traps, and more. Outside of that, it really is the same game. If you enjoy playing all the new mini-games in each series, it may pique your interest, but otherwise don't buy the game looking for any major revamps.   Graphics The graphics are hardly improved over the previous versions. This title uses the same bright colors, low-resolution textures, and choppy animation that the rest have. All the mini-games are set in their own unique backdrops, and run very smoothly. Still, if you're looking for fancy visuals you're not going to find the cart to be crammed with real-time lighting or high-polygon models. Try to focus on the fact that the mini-games rule.  Sound The music is just as outdated as the graphics. It may be one of the last games released on the N64, but it sure doesn't sound like it. It has a few tiny voice samples and plenty of redundant MIDI sound tracks (around 20). All of the sound is very cute, as you might expect, and does the job of keeping your ears occupied in the cheesiest of ways. I can't say I was thrilled with Mario Party 3 at first. I made the fatal mistake of trying to give the single-player story mode a chance. It's a decent way to practice, but it's INSANE as to how much watching you do. You even WATCH your opponents play mini-games all the time. Also, moving around the board becomes very tedious and boring quite quickly. So, as far as single-player goes, I think it'd better be classified as a tutorial mode. The multiplayer mode is where all the fun lies. Gather up three guys around the office, throw in some unsaid aggression, and the fun factor immediately goes up. This is what Mario Party has always been about. So, while there's nothing really new about the franchise there are 70 brand-new mini-games. For me, it makes a very worthwhile rental with some friends. I would only consider buying this if I had three siblings who were addicted to the N64 or had a family that would benefit from it. I suggest you take the same approach.", "date": "May 30, 2001"}
