Collections of remakes can also theoretically be good. Frogger 2 and Pac-Man: Adventures in Time were fantastic. And companies like Namco and even Atari have had great success in the past with some of their respectable efforts. The remake extends ideals and design principles of the original from which it draws inspiration with new environments, new twists, new puzzles, and a new presentation, while the compilation assembles these remakes, or even just enough of the original classics, to itself become enjoyable and worthwhile.   In order to succeed at reviving classic games, either a vast quantity of product or appreciable quality in chewable amounts must be delivered. Because crafting a quality title in today's market generally means needing it to be more than glorified paddle tennis, it's far more likely developers and publishers will rely on quantity to sell. That's what Atari did with its Anniversary Edition (twelve games included) and its Greatest Hits. The company included a slew of old favorites barely touched up to be presentable and earned dollars off of nostalgia and amount.   This latest assemblage of old games gone 21st century offers neither quality nor quantity. Atari Revival is three titles, each archaic and fleeting.   I'm not going to stroll down memory lane regaling my audience with grandiose tales of how I'd spend many an hour diligently battling away in front of the 2600 despite searing eye pain, because truth be told, I did not. At the time I was far too busy learning how to blow things up with my best friend to care even remotely about early gaming. So let's get to the point and make my stance clear: I'm not going to give Pong an 8.5 in graphics because it's ~an accurate recreation of the original.~   Atari Revival is one box and three games: Combat, Missile Command, and Warlords. Even though each title takes up some 450MB of CD space, I'm sure there must be some way to compress them all onto one disc and present them via a unified menu system. As is, each game is its own product, thus depleting the overall feel of the package, and substantially lowering the presentation score, which would have benefited significantly from being able to switch between the three during play (somewhat justifying the compilation and indicating that an effort was placed in developing Atari Revival).  Three products means three summations. Enjoy.   Combat  Why remake an old game when stealing and befouling its name is so much simpler? In Combat, a game not at all similar to the 2600 original pack-in, players must pilot a hover tank and navigate maze-like zones with intentions of escaping through a black, interplanetary portal. Clearly the fundamentals of the first game have remained intact (stuff is on screen and it gets shot).  In fact, Combat has less to do with its ancestor and more to do with the PSX's own Assault Rigs. What that game did in 1996 (I believe), this game does worse, or should I say did worse -- Combat was actually released last winter.    I don't even know what the hell it's about, so there goes the story. No worries, I can say with utmost certainty that the title is rendered to approximate three dimensions! The flat, blocky, blandly textured and unarticulated worlds are designed so poorly that it's nearly impossible not to crash into half the walls or fall off every other edge that drops into oblivion. But in fairness, this is probably more appropriately attributed to the game's abhorrent control. Hover tanks aren't very good at maneuvering. All that inertia means 90% of play is involuntarily sliding about. Granted, if implemented properly, inertia-sliding around a tight corner and laying out a few enemies could be raucous fun. Such is not the case. Not firmly depressing the ~emergency break~ means careening into opposing walls, or just straight off the game world itself. The latter happens far too often. Ramps and elevators are the bulk of what comprise nearly every level of Combat, thus making the game a slow, awkward, and painful emergency break ridden exercise in tedium. Then even if a turtle's pace is taken, the result will be getting shot a gagillion times...dying.  The game's worlds are separated into levels. Saving can only occur between these worlds, and not the levels themselves. Here's the fun part, there are ten levels per world. Losing at nine means restarting at one.  Psygnosis' Assault Rigs was mildly enjoyable, for a time. But Combat is more of a repetitious and bland desecration of its heritage than anything. Atari would have been better off making a Sims-esque game and dubbing it Combat.     Missile Command  An asteroid is barreling toward Earth! Whatever shall we do? We'll all be crushed! But alas, doomsday is not fast approaching. We may all be saved yet! It turns out the asteroid is actually the base of operations to an aggressive alien race intent on leveling our planet with wave after wave of destructive missiles. Hooray, we're saved!   The old: Missiles fall from the sky of a flat screen and with the blast radii of a limited number of intercept missiles, you stop them from destroying the surface.  The new: Same exact concept, only now delivered in gloriously ugly 3D. Point the mouse and hit the keyboard to fire missiles. This game is so wretched in appearance that I actually found myself time and again going back to the classic play as an escape. Truly horrible, horrible stuff.  Even with the newly added CG cutscenes, an ever so slight sway to the game screen, and some ridiculously hard boss encounters, the redundant nature of Missile Command makes it little more than an enjoyable free Java applet or Windows pack-in game to compliment Mine Sweeper.  Point accumulation is one thing, and I can respect that, but forcing us to play this style of game against graphics a mule with a paintbrush attached to his nose could best is just wrong. So even though it'll tire after an hour, go classic and don't go back.    Warlords  Warlords is about some guys standing atop their towers and deflecting fireballs at one another with floating shields that rotate around two faces of each person's tower. Yeah, it makes sense if you really look at it.   Screw the premise, Warlords, which still retains its Pong plus tactical violence appeal, is the saving grace. It is enjoyable, especially in multiplayer where I can envision it quickly becoming the next big interoffice fad. The many and often sudden power-ups keep the game fresh and lighting fast. It's part Arkanoid and part competitive sports. Handfuls of fireballs fly about the screen; the objective is to bounce them at opposing towers, slowly picking away at their defenses and leaving their guy vulnerable to attack. Losing a tower perched dude means losing.     What did you think of Atari revival?  This game is also the prettiest of the lot. Sometimes the backgrounds can interfere with the play making it hard to see what wall portions an enemy has left and even where their shields currently are, but those are small prices to pay for the general visual splendor that changes over the game's ten themes. Honestly, I did not win Warlords. The later levels can get damn hard, and playing, even for a games publication, hardly qualifies as work.     Look at Atari Revival as three separate games, each about six and a half dollars. Look at it as one $20 title with three modes of play. Look at it as it compares to other compilations from other competitors. Look at it as a bit of nostalgia, not intending to compete or find place in this modern day, but rather to merely offer something relatable, likable, and memorable to some of its players... However you ultimately decide to view Atari Revival, one thing should be undeniably clear: The game is substandard. It's like burning dinner one night, putting the charred food into the refrigerator and then pulling it out a week later only to burn it again before serving. It's like a clip show for a terrible television program that highlights some of worst, most unfunny, and generally boring episodes of the season. It's like remaking the Transformers, but then making it some kind of terrifying Digimon.Compilation packs of oldies are a tricky affair, because really, it's possible to get more and better in the form of mini-games included with already awesome titles like System Shock 2 or Shenmue. So as I stated far above, when a compilation is done, it must be of supreme quality, or supreme quantity to be of any worth. Atari Revival offers neither the sheer amount of classic games to make it worthwhile, nor a significant degree of quality in any of the remakes to make the package as a whole justifiable. I will now and forever defend Warlords as decent amongst its peers, but even it can't sanitize the utter garbage it rooms with. For five dollars less, Atari also offers the Anniversary Edition. It may not have revamped and broken glitz, but it has a good twelve classics worth playing.The moral of the story? Cramming three games into one box only works if the three games on their own are of any value. In the future, take one CD, put as many games on it as it'll hold, revamp as much as possible in the Pac-Man: Adventures in Time/Frogger way, and then sell it.The selling comes after the making of something good...
