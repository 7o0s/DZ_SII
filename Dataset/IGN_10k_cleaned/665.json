Yoda Stories is one of the technically lamest and structurally annoying Game Boy games ever developed, and not even the wildest Star Wars nut will want to play this game for more than two minutes. Features: 15 levels Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Yoda Stories was originally a PC game among the LucasArts ~Desktop Adventures~ line of product. In the game, you play Luke Skywalker during the time of his Jedi training (between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi). The Game Boy version is almost a direct port of the PC version, right down to the ridiculous choppy graphics (which I'll get to in a second). If you think you can squeeze an ounce of fun out this game, forget it.  The story goes a bit something like this: Yoda senses a disturbance in the force, and sends Luke on a mission to rescue Han Solo and his captured Millennium Falcon from the stormtroopers on Tatooine. Here, Luke must skitter around the desert, flipping switches, carrying items from one place to the next, and wiping out sandpeople and helmet-heads.  Once that's complete, it's off to find the empire's hidden battle station...and so on. There are 15 redundant and dull adventures to solve, where the only skill is holding onto your patience and sanity.  Skywalker and crew jump around the playfield like waterbugs skimming across a steaming pond. Trying to follow the bad guy sprites is enough to induce a migrane as they pop back and forth from one square to the next. Animation?  There is none, my friend, apart from the simulated lightsaber ~fanning~ when you attack a bad guy. Enemies simply disappear from sight without even a ~poof,~ so it's extremely difficult for your brain to decypher whether or not the enemy hopped away or vanished.  This simplistic graphics engine made a bit of sense on the PC, since the tile-based graphics made it possible to randomize the map layouts and adventures. But as far as I can tell, there is no randomization going on in the Game Boy version, defeating the purpose of the hopscotch tiles. What's worse is that it's difficult to control Luke as he pops all over the place. Controls are slippery, and that's being nice in my description.   And what seems like salt on the wound, throughout the game you have to listen to a cycled loop of the Star Wars theme done in the standard Game Boy FM composition. After one minute you're hitting the Start button to find the option that'll turn off the tune. But wait...there isn't any option. The only way you're going to get rid of that looping music is to turn down the volume. If you do that, you miss out on the admittedly well-sampled weapon effects. Great interface, guys.  Yoda Stories is a wasted effort that could have been a lot better if the developer gave the game a more appropriate, scrolling graphics engine on the Game Boy system.  The design is another bag of chips, since it was originally just a quick-playing desktop toy for PCs, not an elaborate adventure for console gamers. That's two huge strikes against the game right there. I gave the title one point just for the fact that the game has decent audio samples from the movie. My advice? Put this game in a landfill far, far away and leave it there.", "date": "Jan 29, 2000"}
