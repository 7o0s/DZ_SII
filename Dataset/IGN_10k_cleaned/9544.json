What the point of it is. And, sometimes, you're simply left to wonder  as even after playing it you're still at a loss for the reason. Arctic Tale's existence is just that kind of questionable. Here we have a game that's been adapted from a movie. Not uncommon. But it isn't adapted from an animated Disney flick, or something done by Dreamworks  it is, instead, based on a documentary from National Geographic. There's a way to get the kids excited. Boy. And that same sense of pointlessness extends into the design itself, as it's very hard to find any kind of excitement in the way this adaptation was executed.    You are a bear. An Arctic-dwelling polar bear, young and untested, venturing out to explore the world for the very first time. Only there's not really all that much world to explore  you were born in a drift of snow, and the environment surrounding you on all sides is a drift of snow. You set off to find adventure, and food, and fun. And all you find is snow. Endless plains of snow.   It's accurate to the film, I suppose, but nowhere near intriguing as a game  because really, the core of what you do in Arctic Tale is walk around plain white landscapes. You feel like you should be searching for something, or someone. But you aren't. The goal of it all is just to survive, enduring the harsh of the cold for as long as possible.   You've never seen so much white.  Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? It doesn't take long for that sense of pointlessness to settle in, as you watch a heart indicator in the upper-left corner of the screen slowly drain away over time, and drain more quickly if you try to do anything too active, like running. You find bits of food (that look something like pizza slices) scattered around the environment, and each of those gives your heart meter a small boost. And you find paw print icons ~hidden~ around as well, in plain sight, and gathering those unlocks pictures in a photo gallery and later ~chapters~ of the adventure, which all play out like the first chapter anyway.    Things get a little more interesting when you get the chance to control the two other optional animals, and when you stumble upon some of the many mini-games that break up the monotony of exploration. The other animals are a walrus, who can swim to explore underwater areas but is lumberingly slow to control on land, and an arctic fox, who is much faster than his counterparts and has the ability to hunt down rabbits.   And the mini-games are vaguely varied, but again not all that engaging  there's an Ice Sliding design that plays like the old SkiFree game from a bygone era of Windows Entertainment Packs; an Ice Flow mini-game that plays the same way, only with the screen scrolling up instead of down; a very simplistic take on the popular Olympic sport of curling that uses the arctic fox as the stone; and a handful of others that are operated by simply mashing the L and R buttons over and over again.   Nothing that takes advantage of the DS system's touch screen tech, which speaks to the truth of this game being a pretty direct port of the version also appearing on the Game Boy Advance. You'd think that three years after the introduction of the DS studios would be at a point where GBA ports didn't happen anymore. And you'd be wrong, because they're still going strong.   And it's a shame, too, because there are even a lot of simple, uncomplicated things this game could have done to make itself a little more engaging. The top screen, for example, holds an almost ever-present graphic of the Arctic circle's sky. Pretty, but nonfunctional. It could have instead been used to hold a map of the current environment  the map exists, you can see it if you pause the game, but you can't keep it pulled up while you roam around.   And come on, guys. These are polar bears! Brutish, beastly animals. I understand going the cute, family-friendly direction and keeping kosher with the license, but still there had to be a more interesting and exciting way to present the signature creature beyond actually docking the player health points for trying to run fast. Missed opportunities all around.So, in the end, we're made to wonder just what the point was. Arctic Tale is slow-paced and mostly boring, which is likely in keeping with its roots as a documentary film, but doesn't work at all in the form of a game. You've got to take some more creative license when you've got this kind of license. As it stands, you'd be better off just watching the film and being done with it. Or, since even the Arctic Tale film has been getting mixed reviews, just avoiding the brand altogether.", "date": "Nov 16, 2007"}
