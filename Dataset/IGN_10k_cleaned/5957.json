That being said, unless you're a huge fan of the beat-em-up genre and cannot exist without trying every title ever released, don't bother with this one. A combination of loose controls, a confusing camera, bland graphics, and uninspired sound mar the few good ideas that were actually implemented though never fully realized.   Let's begin with the story. At the game's opening you choose to play as one of five characters, three male and two females, who all have different special moves and starting stats. Were you to choose Raven, you'd quickly become puzzled by why exactly he has an Irish accent and is insistent on saying the Irish version of the s-word at just about every opportunity. Quite often, in fact, he'll say it twice in one sentence, adding to the game's completely natural and not-at-all forced gansta' 'tude. Oh wait. No it doesn't.   After you picking a totally hard/badass character, you quickly discover that you've been betrayed by one of the four other characters. As many such stories go, you wind up seeking vengeance, hence the game's title. So, you set out to find who screwed you over while battling Zanetti, the town's mob boss, and his thugs along with various street hooligans and police officers.   You'll quickly become acquainted with the owners of The Hole, a local bar in the Downtown St. district of Las Sombras, the city in which you'll dole out your thuggish acts of retribution. There you'll meet Tracy who gives you hints about how to progress through each of the game's chapters, as well as Melvin, the bar owner. Melvin will give you side quests which you can complete for cash rewards, let you learn new moves once you've leveled up enough, and sell you alcohol so you can regain health while gettin' sloshed yo.   Gameplay  For the most part, this game is about fighting. Lots of it. In fact, the game offers absolutely no drawbacks to brutally murdering everyone in sight. Shortly after you begin and wander into the Gas Station district, you'll find several NPCs meandering about. If you walk up to them, they'll tell you some meaningless tidbit of information and then present you with the option of fighting them. Of course, being the ridiculously thugged-out vengeance-filled total badass that you are, you choose to fight. After you turn their face to pulp, you can loot their corpse and then leave. In fact, you can do it repeatedly by continuously returning to the zone. The NPC will be back, and you can kill and rob him all over again. Wonderful.   The most badass crew in the universe. There are two types of fights in Beat Down: regular street fights against trash NPCs and one vs. one fights against characters important to the plot or characters you can recruit. The regular street fights pit you most often against a group of thugs where your task is to reduce everyone's health bar to zero then loot them. In some instances, if you're threat level with the police or gangsters is high enough, characters will randomly engage you when you enter a zone.   One vs. one fights are initiated the same way as against trash NPCs. However, once you choose to fight them, a special title screen comes up to announce the fight. For example: a title like Raven vs. Mike or Javier vs. Ames (yes, Mike and Ames are totally thuggified names) would preface the thuggirific beat-fest. The ensuing screen shows both characters squared away against each other much like before a Tekken or #&*%ing Virtua Fighter match starts. Both characters have power bars at the top of the screen and a pride gauge underneath. The goal of these battles isn't to necessarily kill the opponent, but to reduce their pride gauge to zero. This is accomplished, like so many other things in Beat Down, by smacking your enemy in the face. Once the gauge reaches zero, players can initiate a negotiation screen where several options become available.     The first is the recruit option which imports the enemy into the player's gang. Thereafter, it's possible to call the recruited opponent via cell phone and get them to run around with you to help hit people in the face. When a call is placed, players will either have to fulfill certain conditions, such as paying that member or making sure other specific members are in the party, in order to get them to join up. Once any special conditions are met, players run to a specific location on the game map to pick up their new partner. Two such hard-boiled gangsta' thugs may accompany you at any time on your quest to kill as many people as possible.   Your gang members fight automatically when you get in random NPC fights, and display a decent amount of A.I., though not much. They'll throw an occasional punch or kick, but generally the focus of any fight is on you and it's your responsibility to wipe everyone else out. If you get beat in a one vs. one fight, your partners will step in to take your place, essentially functioning as extra lives. If everyone gets wiped out, the game presents a convenient option to just start the entire fight over.   There's also a poorly implemented feature where you suffer psychological trauma from a defeat. This can only be alleviated by curing yourself at a clinic or beating the person that beat you. In the meantime, while you're under the trauma's effects, all characters in the game will call you a dirty variant of ~weakling~ and refuse to initiate combat. Intense.   The second option to end a one vs. one fight is to rob your opponent, which is great for getting mad cash to buy tons of hot digs, med packs, or new weapons. Honestly you never really need to buy weapons or med packs, since they frequently drop off of fallen NPC fools. Clothing, on the other hand, is a totally different story.   In order to reduce your threat with the police and thug gangs, you need to change your appearance. Reducing your threat level means you won't be recognized as quickly, so you'll have less spontaneous fights as you travel across the tiny game world. There are actually an impressive amount of clothing customization options for your character, but perhaps none more appropriate than dressing up your hardcore thug in purple jean shorts, fishnet armbands, jean shorts and pumps. That sort of gear screams both ~cool~ and ~completely insane ultra-super-killer.~   About to get beat down. Get it? (It's the title of the game) In addition to clothing you can actually cosmetically alter your character at hospitals. It's possible to change a character's face, eyes, mouth, eyebrows, facial hair, and even chest hair. Options even allow for putting a female face on a male character. Yea, we know, it's totally badass.   Once you change your appearance you may think you're in the clear for a while, but you'll find your threat gauges fill up way too fast to make costume changes effective. Every time you see an NPC they'll toss an insult at you and fill your gauge up by a large percentage, quickly putting you back at 100% threat. NPCs seem to enjoy informing you that you resemble what they regularly squeeze into a toilet bowl, which is just plain lovely.   The third option to end a one vs. one fight is the interrogate option where you force defeated opponents to spill their pathetic guts. While in some cases it's necessary to employ this tactic to advance the plot, more often than not the NPC gives you a game hint you already know.     It's much more entertaining to use the next and final option: beatdown. Since it's the title of the game, players might expect something spectacular, and surely those that love completely pointless violence will be pleased. Initiating the beatdown option will show your character using one of the game's various weapons, a knife, wooden board, pipe or bottle, to absolutely annihilate the downed opponent until blood sprays on the screen.   Killing, recruiting and interrogating enemies will result in experience points. Periodically your character will level up, awarding you three points to assign to either your stamina, which boosts your health, attack, which makes you inflict more damage, or technique. Increasing your technique allows you to learn new moves, more easily decrease opponents' life gauges, and lets your weapons go longer without breaking.   Your combat moves themselves are surprisingly varied, with a wide array of punches, kicks and grabs at your disposal. There's also the obligatory health draining super-move. Unfortunately, you'll never use most of them, since throws are ridiculously overpowered, and why bother punching when you can smash an enemy with a pipe? The possibility of an engaging combo system is undercut by the existence of far more powerful and easily accessible alternatives.   Controlling your character in combat quickly becomes a pain, since the camera will frequently get stuck on walls or just point the wrong way. The game has a hard time deciding exactly who you're targeting, and will frequently direct your character's attacks in the exact opposite direction of your opponent. In a group battle you'll target whichever enemy is closest but quickly become disoriented since you can't see the entire screen anyway and attempts to reorient the camera only complicate things further.   Graphics  In terms of graphics, this game is terrible. It looks as though somebody smeared Vaseline across all the game's textures, every environment looks practically identical, and objects frequently clip through walls or completely obscure the camera. Character models are mind-rottingly boring. In fact, the same model is used for every police officer in the game except for two or three.   Yep, the backgrounds are that exciting. Also, hairy backs rock face. Each section of the city has its own distinct 35 second music loop, each track of which begins to drive you insane after 25 seconds. Since there are only seven major hubs in the game, all of which are incredibly small, your only option is to destroy your television's speakers.   Sound  The voice acting is equally atrocious, showcasing just how bad brainless, forced thug dialect can get. Imagine the following line in a poor Irish accent: ~You don't know shite about shite~ and ~Prepare to open the gates of hell,~ and you might get an idea of how bad it is.   Perhaps the most entertaining feature of the game is the ~bad trip~ effect, which activates when your character consumes low-quality health medication or too much alcohol. Under this effect, every battle plays out in extreme slow motion. Though it seems like this effect was intended to be negative, it actually makes fights easier and adds some much needed style.  If any of the features described above sound cool, they're not. Playing through this game is an exercise in the most extreme forms of repetition. Fight, kill, fight, kill, fight, kill, and on it goes. It never gets better, it never gets worse. It's the same thing over and over.If you absolutely love pointless violence and cheesy, forced atmosphere, then by all means pick this title up. Otherwise, stay extremely far away. In fact, stick to Streets of Rage 2, that game is way better.To sum everything up in the words of one of Los Sombras' friendly police officers: ~Stinking worthless piece of $*^t, take this scum and throw away the key!~Oh and one more thing, there's a multiplayer mode where two people can engage in the one vs. one type battles. It stinks.", "date": "Aug 24, 2005"}
