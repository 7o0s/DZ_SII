There's been Super Tetris, Weltris, Wordtris, Hatris, Columns, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Baku Baku, and the list goes on and on. While there's no doubt that some of these games were a lot of fun, most of the successful ones only offered slight variations on the Tetris theme. The further developers got from Tetris, the more annoyed people got  until now. In their weird new Wetrix, European designer Zed Two has managed to break the Tetris mold while still providing gameplay that is both addictive and absorbing.  It's going to take you a little while to understand all the nuances of this game, but here's the basic run-down. You have a square plot of land that you must keep watertight by building up walls out of the pieces that fall from the top of the screen.Shortly bubbles of water will start falling that will fill up your receivers. Any water that's not penned in by blocks will begin to leak off the sides of the screen. Once you loose a certain amount of water (measured by a meter on the right side of the screen) your game is over. Every now and then a flaming fireball will descend, evaporating any water in the penned in area that it hits. Other pieces include bombs which destroy a large section of your screen, down arrows which lower anything they hit back down to ground level, and ice cubes that freeze all of the water on the screen making it impossible to gain points in that area. While I realize that this may not be the easiest to understand explanation, the game itself is fairly easy to follow and after a few games you'll soon have the hang of it.  Actual play is pretty straightforward. You either use you mouse or joypad to move objects around the screen or you use a definable set of six different keys on the keyboard to move objects up, down, left and right while rotating and dropping them.  In multiplayer games you'll also have two other keys that select which opponent you wish to dump on and a separate button to do the actual dumping. Sadly, all of the control formats are a little bit hard to get used to and the keyboard control never felt right to me no matter how much I played. While this won't matter to most single player games (who doesn't have a mouse?) it really sucks in the two player split screen mode where keyboard is going to be a must for one player.  Wetrix's looks are a mixed bag. While the design of the game is very strong (based on the N64 title that was so incredibly beautiful) the actual graphics are grainy and coarse. Still, it's never a problem to tell what's going on and the backgrounds and special effects are very nice. Sound is particularly good for a puzzle game featuring a soundtrack that never got on my nerves and powerful voices for all of the major events in the game. Don't expect any frills here though. If you're not playing, you'll be watching a demo or siting on a menu.  For all its presentation drawbacks, Wetrix is still a brilliant puzzle game that is sure to keep anyone who's willing to learn how to play busy for hours. If you've been waiting for something a little bit different to keep you challenged, this is the game for you.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 26, 1999"}
