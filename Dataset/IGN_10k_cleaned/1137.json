Each store I visited had stacks and stacks of Tennis for the Game Boy in the bargain bin for a measly five bucks. Five bucks for a classic Game Boy game, one of the first games ever released for the black-and-white system. And after playing games like Virtua Tennis on the Dreamcast and Mario Tennis on the N64 the past few weeks, I've been in a sort of tennis mode. So I picked up a copy. Hey, it was either that or a Big Mac Value Meal. And I'm glad I didn't load up on the McDonalds grease - Tennis is a great buy for a fiver. Features Four difficulty levels Link cable support for two players For Game Boy, special color palette on Game Boy Color   When the Game Boy was released back in 1989, the expectations for handheld games was a bit on the low side - the only real competition at the time were those old Tiger tiled LCD games. That said, you shouldn't expect a whole lot in terms of options on this game. It's a straight one-on-one game with four difficulty options (which makes the game faster and the computer AI harder). It does support the link cable so you can play Tennis against another person on another system - and it works flawless.  The gameplay is pretty tight, but very unforgiving. You really have to be on the ball, otherwise it'll hit you instead of the racket. You have a regular shot and a lob at your disposal, and you can direct the shots where you want them to go. And if the ball goes over your head, a well-timed button press will cause your player to smash the ball...hopefully onto your opponent's side of the court. The only real downside is that you cannot dive for the ball like in other tennis games, so if a ball gets too far away you cannot perform the last-ditch dive attempt. Ah well.  What's really interesting is the fact that the Game Boy Color supports Tennis. Built into the hardware is a set of color commands - when it recognizes Tennis, it builds the game using 10 different colors. It's not as pretty as some games that are written specifically for the Color handheld, but since the game looks like it was made for the Game Boy Color it's more welcoming to play.  Tennis can still hold its own even after all these years. It lacks the options like a Doubles mode, but it's still great fun to play. Other handheld games, like Pocket Tennis Color on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, have advanced the sport on the portables...but just wait until Camelot one-ups this one with Mario Tennis, to be released in the next few months.   What can be said other than...for five bucks (ten if you get two copies), you can get your hands on a really solid Tennis game on the Game Boy system. It's not going to overwhelm you with options, but that's because it's 11 years old and didn't have much to compete with in terms of portable tennis games. Highly recommended.", "date": "Aug 3, 2000"}
