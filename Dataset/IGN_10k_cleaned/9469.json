Imagine: Master Chef is a quaint and cute little cooking sim, as far removed from any popular sci-fi first-person shooter franchise as a game could get. And while it's unfortunate that its odd name evokes again a wistful dream that just isn't going to come into reality, the game itself, for what it is, is not that bad at all.   The Master Chef, here, is a little blonde girl named Lisa. She's learning how to become a cook for the sake of her father  away on a prolonged business trip, Lisa promised her dad that she'd be able to make him a special dinner on the long-awaited night of his return home. As that night is coming soon, Lisa's begun to take daily cooking lessons from a famous celebrity chef, Rachel Jones, and is slowing learning her way around the kitchen.   Imagine: Master Chef plays out a whole lot like last year's kitchen sim, Cooking Mama.  In both that game and this one, you're tasked to prepare a variety of different dishes in a virtual kitchen, and each part of the preparation process is translated into a brief mini-game design. Cutting carrots becomes quick tapping on the touch screen. Mixing up cake batter becomes guiding the stylus in a circular motion. Flipping flapjacks is a quick push forward, and so on and so forth. It's pretty simple stuff.   It's always better with a little more ketchup.  And it's made even easier by the ever-present assistant up on the top screen, as chef Rachel Jones is always there to give you tips, suggestions and often step-by-step guidance. It's difficult to make a mistake if you just follow her directions  though you could purposefully add too much pepper, mix ingredients too vigorously or overdose on ketchup if you really wanted to. You'd get a bad score if you did that, but you still could if you liked.   And really, even trying purposefully to mess things up won't ever make you fail outright. That could be considered a negative to some  there's little consequence to burning your toast, or adding far too much mayonnaise to your fried egg and chili dog souffle. Master Chef almost forces you into success, perhaps for the purpose of continuing its off-the-wall plot.   Because things don't stop at the cute story of a girl learning to cook for her father. There are, on top of that, magic falling stars, enchanted dollhouses and stuffed animals that come to life and talk to Lisa in her spare time. It's sad, in a way  this girl's parents are almost always absent, so she spends all her time either learning cooking skills to impress them when they are around, or else carrying on extended conversations with her fluffy bunny Hopper. It wouldn't be so distracting, except the conversations really are extended  you'll spend sometimes several minutes just hammering the A Button to scroll through the nearly endless text boxes that pop up as the characters exchange inconsequential dialogue with one another. The characters are cute, and it's nice to have something of a story to keep things moving in-between cooking exercises, but this is a case of an interstitial story being overdone.   Mini-games, as always, round out the gameplay experience by supplementing Lisa's cooking lessons with simple card-matching games, or virtual dish-washing simulations. These, and Lisa's every-once-in-a-while excursions outside into the surrounding environment of Happy Town, further flesh out what could have been an endless string of days slaving over a hot stove, so they're also welcome. And they're not as obtrusive as Hopper the animated stuffed rabbit constantly yammering on about magic and wishes.Ubisoft has a history of doing this. Of taking a game originally meant to stand on its own, and re-branding it to become a part of a slapped-together ~series.~ Imagine: Master Chef has, really, nothing to do with the other games in the new Imagine line, and should instead be judged alone, on its own merits. And there are many. This cooking sim adventure is cute and well presented, with a visual style that's appealing and gameplay that's easy to pick up and learn. You might even gain some applicable real-world cooking knowledge by playing along with Lisa and chef Rachel Jones, as the processes of preparation presented here are almost always shown from first step to last. So Imagine: Master Chef is better than its branding, and proves a worthy rival to Majesco's Cooking Mama. Consider this game for the cooking-crazed, DS-owning kid in your life  just don't mistake it as having anything to do with Halo.", "date": "Nov 9, 2007"}
