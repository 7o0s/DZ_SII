How do you follow something like that up?  Well apparently, with a drill toting man in a space helmet.  Mr. Driller may not have state of the art 3D polygon rendering, motion-captured animation, or even legs, but he's more than capable of handling himself in this slick port of Namco's amazingly addictive arcade puzzler.  Mysterious colored blocks from underground have ravaged the humble city of Downtown.  So many of them, in fact, that the city is buried and no one can get around anymore.  Someone is definitely needed to sort out this mess, and that's where our hero comes in.  Mr. Driller is a grizzled veteran of the drilling trade, and he wears his pink space-hat and baby blue pants like the consummate professional that he is.  Armed only with his handy little tool, he sets out to bust the blocks and discover the source of all this trouble.  All story aside, the gameplay can be summed up fairly simply, like most puzzlers.  You have a large field of blocks of differing colors.  You start at the top, and your goal is to get to the bottom without getting squashed or running out of air.  Sounds easy, right?  Not quite.  Like most things, the devil is in the details in Mr. Driller.  You can drill up, down, left, and right, as well as having the ability to climb a height of one block.  If blocks of the same color are next to each other, or land next to each other when crashing down, they ~glom~ into one larger block.  Drilling any part of the larger block will take out the entire block, simultaneously bringing any other blocks on top of them crashing down.  If a block falls and lands on a block of the same color, the two blocks fuse together and disappear.  Suffice it to say, you have to keep a heads-up at all times while working your way down.  Aside from the colored blocks, there are also brown ~X~ blocks.  These blocks take five shots to get rid of, and every time you destroy one with your drill, you lose a significant part of your precious air supply.  Fortunately, these brown blocks also follow the same rules as colored blocks when they fall, so some clever digging will destroy them en masse.  Still think you can handle it without trouble?  Well, maybe if that was all there is to it, but I haven't gotten to the real trick yet.    Naturally, since you are underground, your air supply is limited.  You start out with 100 ~points~ of air, which is a full supply.  However, as soon as the game starts, the air meter begins to tick down, and the race is on.  Scattered throughout the board are little air powerups that restore 20 ~points~ to your air gauge.  The key to mastering this game is in picking up as many of those air powerups as possible on your way down, while avoiding being squashed.  If you wait around too long for the blocks to settle, you'll run out of air.  Act too hastily, and falling debris will probably squish you.  It is in finding this frantic balance between stop and go that the genius of Mr. Driller lies. Namco has never been one to bring a game home without some extras, and Mr. Driller is no exception.  Aside from the slight graphical improvements, which in all honesty are fairly negligible, two new modes of play have been added to bring the total to three.  Arcade mode is, of course, the game found in the original arcade.  You select one of two boards (beginner and expert), and attempt to reach the absolute bottom.  The beginner board asks you to plumb to the depth of 2500 ft, while the expert board commands some serious skills to reach 5000 ft.  You are given three lives to accomplish this task (although this can be increased in the options).  Beating that expert board is no mean feat.  Every 500 ft, the look of the playing field changes cosmetically as well as becoming a bit more difficult to traverse.    Survival mode plays the same way, except there is no end in this mode.  There are three different difficulty levels here, each one more treacherous than the last.  Add to this the fact that you are only given one life, and you've got a bonafide challenge.   Plenty of fun can be had here, making records and challenging your buddies to shatter your score.  After playing through the arcade mode, you will probably spend the majority of your time playing this mode.    The final mode of play is the time attack mode.  Here you pick from an initial group of four courses and attempt to beat the time record for each.  If you succeed in doing this, you will unlock a few more courses to try and beat.  The only difference in time attack is that air supply is not a concern; you have unlimited air.  Instead of picking up air powerups, little clocks are scattered around, each of which shave a second off your time.  The trick to doing well in time attack is to blaze as fast as possible through the screens, making sure to collect every clock powerup.  The frantic nature of this mode makes it quite a bit of fun, as you will escape an avalanche of blocks by the skin of your teeth on several occasions.    As far as aesthetics, Mr. Driller obviously doesn't flex the power of Dreamcast, nor does it have to.  What you get are nicely detailed, very colorful 2D graphics with interesting backgrounds, all displayed in a sharply high resolution.  It's not much, but for what it is, it's very effective.  As well, you can't deny that Mr. Driller is a pretty funny, if overly cute, little guy.  The music is as the graphics; it's not outstanding, but as puzzle music, it is pretty good and not too distracting, if a little cutesy.   Mr. Driller is fast, frantic, and most importantly, addictive like you wouldn't believe.  Even as a full priced game, it would be a keeper, but at its value price, it's an absolute steal.  Not only is it a fresh idea, but it also actually works.  If all titles that proclaimed innovative qualities were as fun as this, we'd be in business.  For fans of puzzlers or anyone really, this game is highly recommended.    -- Shaun Musgrave, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 29, 2000"}
