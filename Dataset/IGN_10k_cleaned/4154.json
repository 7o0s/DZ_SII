You almost want to marvel in its horribleness; the way the sprites all clump together in big, ugly blocks; the way the control responds like an old tree sloth; the way you want to kick in your TV in anger. Revolution X isn't the worst game ever made, but it sure comes close.  Revolution X is your basic track-based shooter, much along the lines of Project: Horned Owl or Area 51, except there's no light gun here, only your slow-as-molasses sight, and there aren't any aliens either, only Aerosmith. What, did they lose a bet or something? You know they're kicking themselves over this.  The graphics are bad, even for 16-bit standards. Even when Aerosmith aren't playing the music is awful. I really can't stress enough how bad this game is. Maybe ten or twenty years from now, people will look back on Revolution X and compare it to some of the really bad 2600 games that everybody loves today. You know, nostalgia and cheesiness and all that. Then again, maybe not.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
