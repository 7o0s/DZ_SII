Unlike the entertaining Asphalt 3, NitroStreet is a dedicated street racer at its core, loaded with a garage's worth of licensed cars like a Nissan Skyline and some underworld flash. Set in an ever-expanding city full of bright lights and treacherous curves, NitroStreet Racing is a solid thriller that should keep mobile racers glued to their handsets for a few weeks.   NitroStreet doesn't undergo an entire open world makeover like the recent addition to the Burnout franchise, but it does push back the horizons. The city is loaded with racing events like drag races, crash contests, and straight up heats around the block. To enter an event, you must drive to the starting point, which is indicated on your overworld map. Once you pull up to spot, you see the parameters of the event and then you're off.   Winning an event has two rewards. The immediate gratification is cash, which can be used to buy new cars in the garage as well as update your current menagerie. You can make cosmetic changes, such as adding neon lights to the underbelly, as well as tweaks to the engine and performance. But after amassing a series of wins, you unlock the next area of the city, which is split into five different areas, each with its own events and sights. These dual rewards guarantee that something is always opening up as you play, giving you a constant sense of satisfaction. That's important for any game -- but very critical for a mobile game.   The events themselves are fun, but I admit that I enjoyed just zooming around the city and seeing the scenery. A mildly open world mobile racer is quite an achievement. But gawking has its benefits. Learning the city layout, even a passing knowledge, gives you a leg up in the races. Mind your manners while cruising the streets, though, as bouncing off enough commuters draws the ire of the local law enforcement. This isn't an integral part of the game, but it's a fun little afterthought that gives you something to do once all of the races have been won or if you don't want to commit to an event at that given moment.   NitroStreet benefits from Gameloft's exquisite production values -- color choice, excellent 3D, solid frame rate -- but I want to note how strong the controls are for this game. The cars auto accelerate, as expected, but the cornering is just so tight. The braking and boosting is also remarkably responsive. Busting around corners isn't overly tricky, so if you do crash, chances are you just need a little extra practice or take another sightseeing tour.  NitroStreet Racing is a great new racer for Gameloft. Everything is exceedingly well done, from the licensed car models to the layout of the city. If you have a handset capable of running 3D games, the smooth shifter is well worth the download.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
