Or so says the official KOEI ad campaign promoting its latest action/simulation title Naval Ops: Warship Gunner. The second installment of the Kurogane no Houkou series (the first was the Japanese-only Warship Commander), Micro Cabin's charming combination of high seas warfare and simplified strategic ship building does a great job of achieving two of the three commands highlighted above.   And though the game may not have a large amount of speed when compared to other action titles (yes friends, depth and authority have definitely been accounted for), KOEI's attempt at naval combat and construction still manages to come through with more good than bad. But then again, we're getting ahead of ourselves. And before we start handing out a bunch of congratulatory handshakes to the production staff and their buddies; we should do a little explaining first.   Story  Set during World War II, Warship Gunner begins with a two-ship convoy of destroyers being sucked into some kind of nether-dimensional vortex. Thrown directly into the middle of a naval battle between two unknown factions, the convoy loses one ship as they're immediately cast into fighting. After the smoke clears and the remaining destroyer can speak with the survivors, the truth is finally learned: this world that has captured them is a mirror image of earth. And with identical city names, countries, and technology, life is almost indistinguishable from our own. That is, with one little difference -- World War II isn't happening.   In its place the player is confronted with a situation just as dire. Enslaved by a ruthless pact of aggressors known as ~The Empire~, this alternate earth has been almost completely conquered. Fought off by a small band of military specialists known as ~Freedom Fighters~, the powerful dictatorship of ~The Empire~ is just a few skirmishes away from gaining total control of the planet.    But that's where you come in! Agreeing to help ~The Freedom Fighters~ with their struggle by joining their navy, the story continues as you assume the role of a confused captain trying to make sense of his awkward situation. As the plot continues to unfold after the completion of every mission, the true nature of ~The Empire~ and its plans for the world become frightfully clear. That revelation, however, we leave for you to discover on your own. But its ultimate conclusion and the path you'll take to get there was a definite bonus for a game we didn't expect to have it.   Gameplay  Unlike most action titles in today's market, Warship Gunner offers two distinct elements of gameplay. The first, and most immediate, is a third-person naval conflict mode that pits your ship against an entire enemy fleet. It's here that players will spend most of their time and here that will no doubt pull in the masses. The second component is a far more deliberate and strategic ingredient that reminds us more of KOEI's other maritime battle game P.T.O. IV. Allowing users to purchase upgrades in innumerable categories, players will be able to build their ship into whatever war machine they so choose. It sounds great in theory, but the execution isn't quite there.   The main issue comes by way of the automatic build feature and the ability to buy pre-contracted ships. So while its fantastic that there is such an abundance of goodies to pick up throughout the campaign (800 ship components, including 200 aircraft and 400 armament types for the curious), the need to design an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction isn't as splendid -- you can have the computer do it for you regardless. In fact, it's entirely possible to complete the game on the hardest setting with nothing but pre-built and auto configured war craft. Why worry about upgrading your transportation when the computer can and will do it anyway?    That's not to say that doing it on your own doesn't have its advantages: because it does. It's only by successfully assembling the right components can gamers build ships that successfully mix all elements into one total package. Steering, power, speed, and defense are all affected by the numerous pieces available for purchase in the port shop and for gamers who spend the hour it will take to understand this building feature you can create some truly devastating combinations. Or so it tells you on the ship evaluation screen.   Once put into practice, however, it's quickly realized that the only stats that matter are offensive and defensive attributes. As steering upgrades make a minimal difference and the speed of the game is always on the slow side, no matter what kind of engine you use. All in all, the flexibility of having a creation mode was an awesome touch, but the actual impact of your effort turns out to be nothing more than a tool for beating personal bests -- not mastering any real gameplay elements.   When you're at sea, be it with a custom battleship or a pre-built destroyer, Naval Ops is certainly more acceptable. Utilizing every possible button the Dual Shock 2 has to offer, Warship Gunner's controls are surprisingly responsive. Steering is handled with left and right on the digital pad (or you can use L1 and R1 as alternatives) while adjusting your ship's speed using the up and down function. Engaging in battle is just as simple with the left analog stick manipulating the aim cursor and X functioning as ~Fire~. Square and Triangle cycle through your ship's armament and pressing Circle activates a first-person precision mode for more accurate firing. There are other button combinations as well -- like the binoculars mode via the right analog stick or the ~Intercept~ option that's activated with R2 (helpful for fighting off torpedoes). It may sounds like a lot to digest (and it is), but after a few tutorial missions it's all second nature.    What makes the gameplay particularly compelling is the variety of different missions. Breaking away from the standard war game type, Naval Ops offers a range of combat objectives. Escort operations, defensive stands, offensive campaigns, and even boss-like battles against super ships become the order of the day. Some of these missions are extremely difficult too, and part of the game's appeal is that you'll need to devise separate strategies for every section. As we mentioned earlier, though, your ship has little to do with success if you continue to use the pre-built selections -- Micro Cabin could have been onto something if the design of your ship had a bearing on the different mission type; which just isn't the case. All one has to do is make sure you have at least one of each kind of weapons and a healthy defensive plan and your brains should win you the day. A plan that remains true for the majority of the experience.   In the moments when players find themselves separated from the strategic elements of battle, the final stages of Section D instead place them in the middle of an all-out war. A host of boats, submarines, airplanes, and other instruments of destruction populate the ocean like flies to rotten meat. These levels are completely frenetic and make for quite a good time.   Graphics  From destroyers to cruisers, battleships to carriers, the craft in Naval Ops are crammed with a myriad of details and discernable features -- or at least, in terms of objects it is (the textures themselves are a little muddy). Regardless of how many guns, radars, and towers may be stuck on the hull of a given ship, though, Warship Gunner's engine manages to show each and every one of them. And during the later missions when the ocean is overflowing with ships, gunfire, and floating mines, the images created can be pretty impressive.    Also impressive are the special effects. With chaff, sparks, and smoke billowing out of every firearm in the sea, the notion that you're in the middle of a war is rather apparent. Airplanes fire tracers, torpedoes produce small wakes, and quick flashes of light emanate from other ship's cannons when viewed them from afar. To be perfectly honest, Micro Cabin has done a bang up job of getting a lot of objects and particles on screen all at the same time, and for fans of videogames that overwhelm you with details, this should satisfy them quite nicely when they reach the final stages.   Unfortunately all these features come at a price. Bogged down by an unsteady framerate and choppy camera angles, Naval Ops consistently misses the mark in terms of the smoothness of animation. Particularly noticeable when fighting next to land, Warship Gunner's worst moment is not in the midst of battle, but surprisingly when navigating the status screen of your ship while docked. Bizarrely robotic when adjusting the angle, the camera literally stutters with every manipulation and follows the same preset pattern every time out. If the fly through is going to be stay on rails, why is there such a problem showing it to us in silky manner? Talk about your strange caveats.   Sound  Warship Gunner has a few select orchestral pieces that really capture the feeling of sailing the open sea. From the opener to the epic march that plays during your missions, the quality of the music is definitely worth its weight. It's just too bad that there aren't that many to listen to. Tipping the count with only five or six songs maximum, the forty or so missions in Naval Ops will begin to sound the same after the first couple of missions. Pretty disappointing -- we would have liked to see what the composer could do with 15 or 20 songs.   On the speech front, each mission is book ended with various bits of information to get you started and notify you when you're finished. There are several voice actors throughout and none of them repeat any of the same sentences. It's nothing spectacular really, but it gets you from point A to point B; and in a game like this, that's all that matters. The sound effects are just as competent and seem to be captured right from Das Boot. But of you're looking for DTS surround or 5.1 cut scenes, you'll need to keep looking.Despite its difficulties on the design front, Naval Ops: Warship Gunner finishes the day with more pluses than minuses. An intriguing experiment that gets 2/3 of its ambitions correct, the chances that it'll appeal to war game fans and maritime aficionados are pretty strong. And who knows? With two Naval Ops games already produced by the guys at Micro Cabin and strong support by KOEI, there's a chance we could see a third on the horizon sometime soon. We can only hope that as far as the ship building aspects go, that the third time will be the charm.", "date": "Jul 1, 2003"}
