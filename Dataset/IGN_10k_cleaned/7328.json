{"name": "B-Boy", "name_review": "B-Boy Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/09/b-boy-review-3", "text": "Ever since PaRappa the Rapper thrilled Western audiences with its new-fangled rhythm-action gameplay back in 1864, we've been massive fans of the genre. Curiously though, it's still by and large remained firmly at the back of the shelf labelled 'niche' - which is hardly surprising when you consider that some of our favourite genre entries include the bizarre-o likes of Ouendan and Gitaroo Man.   Several developers have made tentative steps in a bid to bring the genre to the masses, with varying degrees of success - let's be honest, Britney's Dance Beat was no Guitar Hero, but thankfully Guitar Hero was. Now though, Sony and FreeStyleGames are ready to have a crack at penetrating that mainstream audience with B-Boy, a break dance-centric hybrid of rhythm-actioner and fighter.   Featuring real-life B-Boys, including the noted Crazy Legs, the game is Sony's attempt at injecting a bit of that old GTA-trademarked urban cool into the genre - meaning hip hop beats, oodles of graffiti sprawl and lots and lots of street talking. If that's enough to get you excited then great. Unfortunately, the inherently repetitive nature of rhythm-action games means that style will always be king and, no matter what innovations are thrown at the genre, you'll be buggered if you don't care for B-Boy's world.    In fairness though, FreeStyleGames has done its damndest to freshen up your average poke-a-button-to-the-music gameplay. Favouring on-the-fly mechanics - rather than, say, Space Channel 5's 'Simon Says' turn-based structure - you're tasked with becoming the best damn street dancer the world has ever seen. Following the game's equivalent of a career mode (there's also a free play-style option if you're after something a bit more immediate), you take challenges from your B-Boy opponents in a bid to win the various medals up for grabs in each competition, with success furthering your progression through the ranks.   By stringing together your four basic moves - six step, windmill, top rock and baby freeze - you compete for medals such as Flow (how seamlessly you transition between steps) and Rhythm (how on-beat you manage to remain). Each challenge consists of a number of rounds (against varying quantities of opponents) with medals switching possession numerous times as you dance. As winning criterias are met, the medals pass from neutral possession into a challenger's hands - it's up to the next person to do better, grappling it back into neutral territory then finally into their pockets by the end of the contest.   Encountering new challengers unlocks new moves, which need to be practiced back at your HQ - or the Lab, as it's known. As you get better at each, you'll learn further transitions, all of which can be pieced together for super dance combos, guaranteed to wipe the floor with your foes. Actually constructing a routine is a fairly simple endeavour: basic moves are mapped onto the main buttons with special moves and transitions activated using a combination of button and d-pad presses. This is actually one of B-Boy's strong points, with its fighter-like control system proving immensely satisfying as you memorise potential movement combos and pull them off triumphantly in the heat of battle. Even better, rather than just being limited to a quick tap of, say, triangle then square, some of the more complex manoeuvres require additional, almost mini-game-like input. The most obvious of these being the 'freeze' movement set, which requires you maintain your balance by tapping the shoulder buttons.    In fact, maintaining your flow is pretty much the key component of B-Boy and it's accomplished with the game's most traditional nod to rhythm-action titles of yore. As you dance, a circle constantly rotates around your feet. As it spins, small notches appear around its edge - the idea being to tap one of the shoulder buttons as a notch reaches the circle's end point. The longer you keep this up, the longer you'll keep moving. What's more, you can further impress the crowds by activating your movement transitions at the end of each music bar, represented by the blue notch. Again, all this adds another welcome layer to the usual tap-along rhythm action mechanics, meaning B-Boy never falls into the monotonous brain-dead repetition trap of titles like Space Channel 5 (God bless Ulala).   However, the circle system isn't ideal by any means: as your main rhythm indicator is constantly tethered to your feet in the game environment, rather than being a bit of HUD furniture, it's not always easy to follow what's going on, thanks to the constantly shifting and zooming camera angles. It's particularly frustrating to lose your perfectly judged flow when the camera slips behind a piece of scenery, obscuring the most integral item on the screen. Of less significance, but still important in a game like this, the (admittedly excellent) motion-captured dance moves don't always match your button presses. In order to maintain the realism and fluidity of the dancers' movements, the game registers your taps, but doesn't act on them until the end of a music bar. The upshot is that you never really feel like you're entirely in control of your character - and that's an issue in a genre where immediate feedback is integral to your involvement in the game.  All that aside, B-Boy is a respectable entry in the rhythm-action cannon, thanks to its refreshing degree of depth and a couple of unique gameplay twists. However, although certainly enjoyable, there's a bit of a caveat here as far as a recommendation goes. As we mentioned earlier, how much you take to the game is likely to come down to your personal interest in the world of B-Boys and its surrounding culture. In a genre where style always wins out, no matter how sophisticated the gameplay mechanics might be, B-Boy's a tough one to judge. Truthfully, we found the game's generic urban stylings lacking the sorts of charm and personality that generally provide that all-important hook in its genre brethren. However, we're man enough to admit that if B-Boying's your bag, and you're ready to hit the dance floor, there's enough on offer here to put a skip in your six step.", "date": "Oct 9, 2006"}
