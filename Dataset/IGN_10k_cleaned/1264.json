We've received EA's debut of F1 2000, Psygnosis' F1 '99, F1 World Grand Prix, and now Ubi Soft's entry.  After awhile they all start to look the same, and only gameplay and feature lists divide them.    Upon firing up this title, I remembered that Ubi Soft also did Monaco Grand Prix for the PlayStation, and had some hopes that this would have a solid simulation mode.  The first thing I got after the intro video was a ~Press Start~ screen and a language selection.  With each button press I hear a sound effect of an F1 car screaming by.  Cute the first time, but it gets annoying as it is implemented throughout the interface.  A small 'blip' effect would have worked just fine for me.   Ubi Soft offers an arcade game and a simulation game, the latter being subdivided into simplistic and realistic physics modes.  I spent a fair amount of time on all three.  First, let's tackle the arcade game.   As you might expect, physics are VERY relaxed in this mode.  Turning the car is easy, and slamming into other cars causes no damage.  You start at the tail end of the pack and your job is to get as far forward as you can within 3-5 laps (depending upon the track length).  There is no true in-car view in arcade mode.  The closest you can get is a view looking over the driver's helmet and over the front wings and wheels, which is ok for arcade mode.  You can also drive from above and behind the car in typical arcade game fashion. As you approach cars, a window comes up showing a 'radar' view of the relative positions of the cars in front of and behind you.  This is reminiscent of the Daytona USA coin-op games that Sega did.  As you pass each car, a point bonus is added.  You are also on a checkpoint system so you can't just mosey along and expect to complete the race.  From what I can tell, impacts with other cars cost you in terms of the point bonus you get when passing them, so passing clean is recommended.  Shortcutting chicanes works for the most part so of course you can do cheap passing as a result.    In this arcade mode, the game unlocks sets of tracks from easy to difficult and you work your way through each one.  I consider this part of the game to be fairly fun, and I think for someone who wants to learn the F1 courses without actually worrying about a realistic driving model it would be very useful.  You could definitely watch a TV broadcast at that track and understand what was going to happen next.  Having reviewed dozens of F1 games across platforms, I know the courses all too well, and if anything, the simulation-based urge to brake early and drive correctly handicapped me in the arcade mode, but I overcame it and became more successful.   The meat of the game, as one might expect, is the more realistic season and single race modes using one of the two more realistic physics models.  You can pick from any driver or team from the 1999 season, meaning you don't get Indianapolis and Alex Zanardi is still driving at Williams.  For Villeneuve fans, he's driving that dual-paint scheme BAR car that scored no points, unlike this year's much-improved car.   The game lets you set up your car with a circular menu showing setup options for wing angles, brake bias, steering lock, fuel, ride height, gearing, tire type, and suspension stiffness.   Once you decide to race at a track either in season or single race mode, you do have the opportunity to use the ~Free Session~ option to pound out laps and tune the car setup.  This lets you get IN the car as opposed to the arcade view, which does not (although the other views are available).  The first things you notice are nicely sized mirrors with fully rendered behind views.  You also have a moving steering wheel (no hands, though).  A simple LCD gauge shows your speed in mph/kph and the gear you're in.  While using cockpit view, you get no tach, either in the car or overlaid.  How this could have been left out is beyond me.  The engine sounds do not change in pitch noticeably enough to let you know when to shift, so you either take a wild guess based upon the sound of the engine, or you keep an eye on your speed and wait 'til it stops increasing in a particular gear.  If you choose an external view or the over the helmet view, you are treated to both a working tach AND TV-style overlays showing split times and gaps between you and your opponents, as well as the status of those who have retired from the race.  But the people who want the tach the most are those who want to drive in the car in full simulation mode.  Anyone who has tried a different F1 sim knows that you have to have some kind of an RPM indicator, whether it is lights on the wheel or a tach overlay.  We are robbed of one here, so I see no value whatsoever in shifting manually in the cockpit.   One neat game mode provided in this game is ~School mode.~  This mode enables you to drive on any circuit and help you find your braking and acceleration points.  It uses a horizontal bar gauge which has a vertical line halfway through it.  As you get close to the braking point for a turn, the bar begins to fill, left to right, with yellow.  When it hits the line in the middle, it turns red.  This is your braking point.  The yellow part is just to get you READY to hit the brake.  As you get to your acceleration point at the apex of the turn, a green arrow appears on the road and the sign above the gauge goes from ~Brake~ to ~Go.~  This is pretty useful for those who want to spend their time simulation mode and learn the tracks, although looking at the bar while trying to take a snapshot in your mind of where that braking point is can be difficult.   Once you decide to race, you can hop in the car and do some free practice before qualification.  The garage screen for setups is outside of the racing graphics engine so you do have to wait for several seconds of load time to go back and forth to make changes.  When you DO make changes, you have to deal with a circular menu system that you rotate to bring the proper menu icon into the three o'clock position.  After you stop, the game takes a second or two to load the image of the current setting, and only THEN can you select the menu item to activate the controls for changing that setting.  This is frustrating, especially because you don't have an obvious indicator of when you've really selected it to move to the setting.  I've stabbed at buttons with futility while expecting that the game was keeping up with me. You can save your setups, but you only have three slots on the memory card to do so, and you may not name them.  It isn't too bad if you can come up with three approximate setups for any given track, such as a fast track, a slow track and a wet track, for instance.   The setup changes do make a noticeable difference in vehicle handling, particularly in corners, and wing angles make the most difference.   Once on the track, you are positioned behind and above the car, showing heat haze effects, which are rather neat.  You then need to get yourself to the proper camera view and then begin driving.  If you stay behind the car, and you're driving in rain, a mesh-style spray gets kicked up behind you.  If you drive from the behind-the-helmet camera, you'll see that the driver's head gets shaken around quite a bit, he leans into the turns, and even the mirrors in the cockpit still work.  Although I love in-car views the best, I left the game in automatic shifting and drove my races from the behind-the-helmet camera so that I could get race stats.   One noticeable and unique graphics feature is that when it's raining, objects often appear blurry, similar to the heat haze effect.  This definitely makes it feel like you're looking through a sheet of water and I haven't seen an effect like this on the PlayStation.   As for the driving itself, the controls are fairly tight but a little bit sloppy for small corrections going down a straight. In addition, putting a wheel off into the dirt will cause you to lose speed.  Cornering hard while hopping a curb can easily spin you out, as can wet conditions.  Braking too hard locks up wheels and causes tire smoke to billow out behind you.  Using the entire track (as anyone who wants fast times should) is very difficult because of the small null zone in the middle of the wheel travel that makes the car twitchy.  It takes some practice to get used to the feel of the car.   Once you get into a race situation and you're ready to qualify, you get the Formula One mandated 12 laps to get your best time.  This is where things start to get ugly.  At Brazil, in the rain, I managed a 1:25 lap, which I didn't think was too bad given that laps in the 1:15 range are expected in dry conditions.  This was good enough to place my Ferrari third on the grid.  However, once I went to the race, I quickly fell back as the other cars were putting in 1:18 and then later, 1:16 laps!  It was still pouring rain, and these guys were going faster in the race than they were in qualifying, while I was still going the same speed!  Needless to say I was angry with this.   Furthermore, I believe that a racing title based upon a racing series should let you know during each session how you're doing relative to your opponents.  What is the point of a practice session if you don't know what time range you should be shooting for?  It's nave to think that you would be shooting for the real world time in these games, especially with the different difficulty levels.  But you don't know until qualifying whether you're even in the ballpark.  And if you botch qualifying, there's NO warm-up period before the race.  You can go into the garage and change things (it doesn't remember the changes you made in qualifying), but you do't have any chance to test them out to hit near qualifying times of your opponents.  And of course, even if you did, it wouldn't matter because those guys are going to be going faster than they were qualifying anyway!  These are game killing problems, in my opinion.   Damage is an option you can turn on, and your tires will wear.  As they do, a little diagram of the car in the upper right of the screen will show the damaged parts of your car (including tire wear) turn yellow, then red.  You can eventually burst a tire, although the only hint of that is your crew chief yelling that this is what happened.  Worn tires or a ripped up front wing will cause massive understeer through the corners, so even on a short race you'll have to pit to fix it.  Flag systems can also be turned on, and stop and go penalties are enforced.   Pitting is automatic.  You don't have to worry about pit lane speed limits as the moment you enter the pitlane you lose control of your car and the only thing you can do is ask for repairs, fuel and tires.   The AI of the game is about average.  Half the time they are smart enough to go around you or back off, and other times they happily rear end you.  I've been punted into the weeds often enough to curse the AI, but other times I've made mistakes and spun and the cars go around me properly and actually make me think they are intelligent.  I guess I'd have to say they win no real awards here, but they aren't totally dumb, either.   Frame rates are high except for at race starts when the cars are all packed together and the game is positively sluggish during a wet weather start, but other than that I think people will be happy with the graphics engine as frame rate goes.  Pop up does happen with distant objects and objects that are well out in the periphery of your vision, so again this isn't a big concern.Overall I'd have to say that while the game is a competent F1 racer for the PlayStation, it does very little to stand out from its peers, and has faults in it that should have been noticed by even a moderately knowledgeable F1 fan.  The gameplay could have made this game stand out, but the timing problems of the AI hurt this game badly.", "date": "Sep 21, 2000"}
