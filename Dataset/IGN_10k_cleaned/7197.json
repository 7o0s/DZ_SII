Sick of her do-nothing kids always layin' about all lazy. It's time for her to retire, but she'll have to pick one of her young'uns to take over the family truckin' business. By golly they'd better get their butts in gear, or she'll have to take a switch and tan their hides!   Big Mutha Truckers is a Southern siblings' squabble on the open roads of Hick State. It's a driving game where you race for cash, riding in your rig against rival relations for the right to be named Momma's favored son.   The Trial by Truckin' begins with a choice, picking which of her oafish offspring offends you the least. Cletus is a typical redneck, toothless grin making his consumption of 'shine all the more quick. Earl is a generous fellow who's never met a sandwich he didn't like. Rawkus aspires to be the Samuel L. Jackson of the South, and Bobbie-Sue's defied all odds by making it past 16 and not yet getting pregnant.   Momma gives you a flatback full of beer and 60 days - parlay that load into as much cash as you can, and try not to get arrested, wrecked or hijacked along the way.   The game world is presented sandbox style. You choose your destination, driving anywhere you please at any time. Making it to one of the game's five cities allows you to sell your stock, earning a profit best used to reinvest. No use hauling an empty trailer, so you should always buy a new supply of goods.    Economics play a role, as prices and demand for different items fluctuate from town to town. You'll need to buy low and sell high, remembering to save some dough for refueling and repairing your rig.   With only a handful of possible stops, big mutha truckin' can get pretty repetitive. Like a trucker in the real world you'll soon learn all the roads and towns by heart, and listening to the same music on the radio every day doesn't help much either. There's an opportunity for added excitement, but the driving experience is pretty tame - other drivers are polite and well-behaved, even if you crash headfirst into them.   The police don't take so kindly to that, but they're hardly any threat at all. Swapping paint with Johnny Law brings up a pursuit meter that means game over if it fills, but getting away is simple to do. Biker gangs present a challenge, but you'll have to make a focused effort to anger them - like most everyone else on the interstate, they'll normally give you a wide berth.   The majority of the adventure is lather, rinse, repeat - driving from town to town, buying and selling, making slightly larger profits each time. Making it through the full sixty days is a test of patience. If you'd like to break the monotony, there's Mission Mode.   A priest needs to get to church on time. A porcine pig-napper needs a getaway driver. A tanker full of homemade hooch has sprung a leak on Sunday. Mission Mode gives your trucker a goal and says go - it's a welcome diversion from the main truckin' trial, but takes place in the same locales.   Multiplayer rounds it out, as two gamers can man 18 wheelers head-to-head - but both will need their own game card.    The overall experience is solid, but not awe-inspiring. Raylight Studios' graphics engine does well in presenting the Deep South in 3D, and the control isn't difficult to handle. You may find yourself jackknifing across the median more often that you'd like, but you won't mind - especially if you're a member of the Big Mutha Truckers target audience.  Big Mutha Truckers is a Wal-Mart game. Meant to be rolled back, marked down and bargain binned. Sitting there in Middle America, it knows its place. It shares its shelf with Deer Hunter, or Cabela's latest adventure.  It's there to promote an extra purchase when buyers arrive to pick up Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector (now on DVD).It's a game not meant for serious gamers. Big Mutha Truckers has a more mainstream role, intended for the good ole boys who've grown up shucking their own corn, fishing from a john boat and firing rounds of buckshot. Everyone else, its not for you  so keep on truckin'.", "date": "Sep 7, 2006"}
