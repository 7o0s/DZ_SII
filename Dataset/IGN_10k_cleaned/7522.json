Following in the wake of Vivendi's mobile Naval Challenge, Naval Battle offers more than just traditional Battleship-style strategy. The game includes no fewer than five modes, offering up special weapons, different sized grids, and a full campaign mode that stretches across four different admirals. There's an awful lot of game here, but it all boils down to whether or not you were in the market for Battleship in the first place.   The campaign mode, the biggest draw of Naval Battle, tweaks the original formula by offering eight different types of ships. You place these in your grid, and start trading salvos. As you land strikes or just keep in the battle, you earn chances to use special weapons, such as radar, a whirlpool that swirls around a three-by-three grid, and a torpedo that races along a column until it hits something. It's useful weapon for clearing entire sections of the board. Napalm is also a handy weapon -- if the attack strikes an enemy vessels, the fires rage turn after turn, slowly consuming the target.   Salvo is a faster-paced variation that allows you one shot per undamaged vessel during a single turn. At the start of the game, you choose multiple points on the enemy grid, then let loose with a volley of shots. When you manage to get a hit, you can use the next turn to surround that one square with shots, determines the orientation of the ship. This ended up being my favorite mode, as I could rip through a game quickly, and the tension of watching your opponent pick out multiple squares can be agonizing.   Traditionalists will enjoy seeing the original mode. Naval Battle also offers mutliplayer on Bluetooth-enabled handsets, as well as basic pass-the-phone functionality.   Naval Battle looks good, thanks to the multiple settings -- such as an iceberg-filled sea or the violent Pacific -- and some fairly detailed ship models. As expected, Gameloft's use of color is always tip-top. The admirals all have that Gameloft look, which you're undoubtedly familiar with by now -- some liken it to a French anime. Each special weapon has an individual animation. The game is accompanied by a solid score with some nice effects.  Naval Battle is the best version of mobile Battleship, surpassing even Vivendi's enjoyable Naval Challenge. The additional game modes, the extra weapons (something that Naval Challenge also had), and the solid graphics make this a treat for strategy fans. It plays to a certain audience, but does so quite well. If you haven't already picked up a Battleship-esque game already, Naval Battle is the best choice.", "date": "Nov 7, 2006"}
