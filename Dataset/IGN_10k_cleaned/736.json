{"name": "DDR 2nd Mix: DC Edition", "name_review": "Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/25/dance-dance-revolution-2nd-mix-import", "text": "was (and still is) one of the most popular arcade games in Japanese game centers because of one very important factor: it takes the action away from the on-screen personas and puts the player in the spotlight. A DDR arcade machine is like a miniature stage, with flashing lights, enormous subwoofers, and a raised platform for the player to dance on. If you're easily embarrassed, this is not the game for you (especially when surrounded by giggling Japanese schoolgirls), but if you like putting on a show for a crowd, this is your dream game. While Jaleco attempted a shameless ripoff with the atrociously bad Steppin' Stage (which is headed to Playstation 2 -- joy), Konami has proven itself to be the master of the musical genre with the Dreamcast port of Dance Dance Revolution 2nd Mix.  While the port loses a bit of the arcade version's raw spectacle, the core gameplay of looking like a badass while shaking your butt to Tubthumping has come through 100% intact. But first, let's get one thing out of the way: you need Konami's official Dance Dance Revolution controller (available for $60 from fine importers everywhere), or the game completely sucks. Yes, it's even worse than Virtual On without the sticks, or House of the Dead without the gun. Konami's controller is a 4x4' mat that you put on the floor, and, well, dance on (remember to remove your shoes first).   All right  once you've acquired both mat and game, you're quickly on the way to one of the wackiest gameplay experiences ever created. From the start of the game, you select a play level, and pick one of a dozen songs to dance to. Each song's difficulty is represented by golden feet  a one-foot song is simple enough for beginners, while a six-foot song requires you to be taking speed. I sure can't do them.   The music starts, a badly-modeled polygonal dude pops up on screen and starts grooving, and then dozens of arrows begin scrolling upwards. Your goal is to step on the arrows on the pad, in accordance to he on-screen arrows. Simple, no? But once you get into the three-foot-ranked songs, things start getting wild, and the game requires you to hop on two arrows at once, or alternate between both sets of arrows. The result is you hopping around like a madman, much to the amusement of any onlookers. For the ultimate challenge, you can buy two pads and do the much-feared ~Double-Pad~ dance routine, or challenge a buddy for double the humiliation.   Unlike the first Dance Dance Revolution's stale-sounding soundtrack, DDR DC's music kicks some major ass. Thanks to a deal between Konami and Intercord/Toshiba EMI, around ninety percent of the tracks come off the bass-heavy Dancemania CDs that have been ripping up the charts in Japan. With tunes that range from disco to soul to floor-shaking techno, DDR is a game that must be played loud.  If you just can't get the hang of the later stages' breakneck pacing, you might want to check out the Practice Mode, where you can slow things down to a more manageable pace. You can also create your own dance steps by placing arrows in ~edit~ mode  and best of all, if you save 'em on your VMS, you can plug your own moves into the arcade version. Too cool!   As your gameplay skills increase, you'll find yourself developing your own dance style  while some Japanese players simply step on the corresponding arrows without much body movement, others really put their soul into it, and put on a damn good show in the process. And as is the case with real musicians, practice does make perfect.   Aside from the rather crap-looking player models (and a blatant lack of VGA support), the only other niggle I have with DDR DC is that DDR Third Mix has been out in Japanese arcades for quite some time, and a product that combined both 2nd and 3rd mixes would have been quite feasible (especially with the high capacity of the GD-ROM). Ah well  that just gives Konami the opportunity for expansion discs, I suppose.   When all is said and done, DDR DC is the ultimate cult game, falling into a niche that will probably never appear in the United States. While some folks just can't handle the high-speed stepping action and dismiss DDR as a ridiculous fad, open-minded gamers who take it for what it is  an over-the-top game that demands physical skill and a certain amount of player wackiness  will adore it. This particular fruitster gives it a thumbs-up.  -- Colin ~Keep on Movin'~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Feb 25, 2000"}
