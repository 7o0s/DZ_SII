With its sweeping cinemas, detailed character designs and a whole bucketload of options, it's hard to recall the days when small sprite characters and 16-bit soundtracks ruled the RPG roost. Enter Final Fantasy Anthology.    Bundled in one package, Final Fantasy Anthology boasts both Final Fantasy VI (formerly on the Super NES and known as FF3 here in the States) and the never before released Final Fantasy V, as well as a music CD compilation of fan-elected music tracks from each of the titles. But what can these two, seemingly antiquated games possibly offer that hasn't already been done better in the two 32-bit Final Fantasy titles? Oh, only some of the best storytelling, characterizations, and gameplay ever to grace consoles since the inception of console RPGs.   Still doubtful? Read on.  Graphics Most fans of the series will remember just how revolutionary the Final Fantasy series was back in the days of the Super NES. Most notably, Final Fantasy VI did things, visually, that seemed to stretch the boundaries and technical limitations of Nintendo's 16-bit machine. From the ultra-detailed backdrops in the opera house to the incredibly expressive character designs, it was hard to find a more beautiful role-playing game until the arrival of the 32-bit machines.   But now with present day 3D polygonal characters and motion-captured animations, it's hard to not look at these games and realize just how far we've come in terms of technology and graphics. Is it possible to bear 50-plus hours of pixelly sprite characters scrolling across flat, primary-colored landscapes without yearning for the lush CG environments afforded by 32-bit?   Answer: Most definitely.   While Square has pegged on brand new CG rendered opening cinemas for both games, the inclusion feels little more than a token gesture to show gamers how the games' characters MIGHT look if they were redone for some next-generation system. They're pretty and placating for the brief time they're on screen, neither cinema really represents either game as well as the real in-game graphics do. And if anything, the cinemas serve as stark contrast to the game graphics, which will be a shock to those who've never played either FFVI or FFV.   Though beautiful and stunning in context, both Final Fantasy V and VI were forced to rely mainly on gameplay and storyline to immerse players. Instead of simply using characters to visually act out their emotions (though you'd be surprised just how expressive they can be, especially in FFVI!), Square had to lean pretty hard on using sound, dialog and atmosphere to draw gamers in. From the genuine relationships that develop between the different characters in FFVI to the desperate quests of the chosen warriors in FFV, you won't find it difficult to get past the simplistic graphics or seemingly out-dated gameplay conventions and become involved in each game fast. Using the Mode 7 graphics engine from the Super NES, the further you progress into each game you'll often find yourself dazzled by rare moments of real visual beauty during each game, which is true testament to how well both adventures have withstood the test of time.  Sound Just like FFVI and FFV's graphics, both games' musical scores are still just as surprisingly catchy and moving as they were several years ago when they were released. Sometimes strikingly delicate and other times simply functional, there are so many classic tracks that it's easy to look past the ones that haven't survived the ages as well. Not to mention that many of the best tracks have landed on the music CD packed in with the games, what more could you ask for? Sound effects? Though sounding a little dated in some cases (some of the effects heard in battle sound like ripping paper, instead of a real sword slash), nothing can beat Kefka's maniacal laugh in FFVI or Hydra's desperate yelps in FFV. And considering the system that both games were originally programmed for, the feat is even more astonishing.   You'll also find that there's plenty of similarity to even the latest Final Fantasy games. Most notably the battle music has almost remained the identical, including the strange be-bop tune that loads up during most scenes involving Chocobos. Just try keeping your eyes dry during the scenes that utilize the track ~Parting Sorrow~ in FFV (sorry, don't want to give any spoilers as to where it's used!) or ~Epitaph~ in FFVI. With so many memorable tracks spread across FFVI and FFV, you can almost say that the music has surpassed the graphics in both games and still does to this day. In fact, there will be guaranteed moments that feel as if the soundtrack is using CD technology in order to re-create tracks that sound incredibly orchestral.  Gameplay The one aspect of Final Fantasy Anthology that will never seem out of step against present-day standards is gameplay. Square's inclusion of both FFV and FFVI was a wise choice in that each game encompasses incredibly unique features that have been used, mimicked and aped by other RPGs to this date. From the clever and challenging Job System found in FFV to the Esper system used in FFVI, if you've never played either game before, you'll be surprised by how many later titles have used these conventions.   The Job system shows an inkling of where FF Tactics originated, while the Esper system has made appearances under different guises in games like Wild Arms (tweaked and called the Force system) and Suikoden (a variant called the Rune system). In many ways, playing through FF Anthology will be like being introduced to the basics of role-playing all over again, but you'll be able to glimpse how many of the precedents for these present-day conventions were born. Final Fantasy V One of the three Final Fantasy games never to make it across to US shores, Final Fantasy V has been thought of by some fans as one of the best of the series. Though rough in some of its game design (point-to-point quests with very little variation) and with a seemingly over-simplified quest (bump into three warriors and then save the world), there are so many things that make FFV just as epic and grand an adventure as any other Final Fantasy game.   As the game begins, you assume the role of Bart, the traveler, who inadvertantly stumbles into a disaster waiting to happen. Along with Reina (a princess), Faris (the sea-faring pirate with a secret) and Galuf (a feisty old warrior with amnesia), you discover that the world is in danger of losing its four most basic elements: Wind, Water, Fire and Earth. As you travel the world in order to protect each of the crystals that represent the elements, your adventure takes on a grander scope and spreads out to different planets and worlds. While the quest, itself, remains very straight-forward, there are plenty of twists and quirks in the storyline to help you to identify with each of the characters. And the satisfying translation maintains a good breadth of humor and whimsy, giving each warrior a fully fleshed out personality, complete with individual histories and heritage.     But, the most notable feature within FFV is the Job System., which enables you to pretty much customize your characters as you go along. With up to four characters in your party, you'll discover Crystal Shards which grant your characters the chance to switch ~jobs~ ranging from Red, Black, White or Blue Mages to Knights and Ninjas. Much like FF Tactics, each job contains Abilities, which are available to the character immediately, such as the White Mage's ability to use healing spells. As you fight, you'll earn ABP (ability points) which count toward the job you have equipped. When you've amassed enough ABP, you'll clear a level of that specific equipped job and gain the skill to use certain earned Abilities even if you switch Jobs. Therefore, if you have Ninja job equipped and you clear the first level with your ABP, you'll earn the chance to use the Dustb special Ability no matter which job you have equipped. Sound confusing?   Don't worry, once you get the hang of it, the Job system becomes incredibly engrossing and actually adds a whole other dimension to the game. In fact, you'll need to master certain jobs in order to battle against some of the hidden or optional bosses in the game (just try defeating Shinryuu in the last dungeon without the Ninja or Lancer jobs under wraps). Add in a variable ending, some very clever secret sub-missions and one of the best villians/anti-heroes in all of role-playing (Gilgamesh!) and FFV is undoubtedly worth every minute of the 40-plus hours it will take to completely beat it. Taking into account that this is the first English release for the game, FFV alone should be enough to warrant FF Anthology's purchase - but there's more.  Final Fantasy VI Considered by many diehard RPG fans to be the brightest jewel in Final Fantasy's crown, Final Fantasy VI is deserving of the praise based on characters, storyline and the ungodly amount of sub-quests, secrets and options that pack this 50-plus hour quest. When the game was released back in '94 on Super NES, Final Fantasy III (as it's known here in the States) represented everything an RPG should be and bumped up the standards in gameplay by including an inventive Esper system that nearly doubled the amount of options characters had in and out of battle.   Another feature strongly tied to FFVI is the incredibly large cast of characters available to join the player's party, including Terra, a mysterious young girl with unspeakable powers, and Edgar, the engineering emperor. While each character's story comes into play at some point in the game, it is ultimately Terra's game. Discovered deep in a mine, Terra is the key to what is happening in the world of FFVI. A thousand years after the War of the Magi has nearly destroyed the world, civilization has reached a prosperous period where technology has replaced magic. After Terra is found, her green hair and ability to use magic (an ability lost on all humans) make her the target of an empire seeking to revive the ancient art of spell-casting in order to conquer the entire earth. And it is from this point that players are basically plunged deep into a world full of romance, intrigue, danger and adventure.   Using some elements from the former games in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VI basically took all of preceding RPG concepts and either came up with something completely new or refined them enough to make them its own. There's so much to say about FFVI that it's difficult to squeeze it into a shared space with FFV. But it's the sheer amount of stuff within the game that makes it truly outstanding, and this was seemingly the first time that so much freedom was given to players in an RPG. From the non-linear feel of much of the quest to the absolutely staggering amount of secrets to the individual abilities that each character has inside and outside of battle, this is one game that never ceases giving, even until the end.   One of the more memorable systems within FFVI is the Esper system. By using it, you can equip certain ~spirits~ or Espers which can then gain levels by earning Magic Points in battle. When your Esper gains levels, you'll then be able to cast specific spells or magic. While this may sound like a rehash of FFV's Job System, the challenge in finding all the Espers is not. And once you take into consideration all of the other specific abilities inherent in each individual character, the game really opens up and feels almost like there's too much stuff to collect, learn and master.   But, when all's said and done, it's the storyline that determines the fate of an RPG; whether it transcends its technical limitations and goes on to be remembered for years later. FFVI is exactly this type of game, with its intricately detailed plot, criss-crossing character relationships and involving human (melo)drama. A game of this caliber has yet to be matched for the ground it succeeded in breaking both in its gameplay, real connection with players and its scope. It's been a long time since I loaded up either of these games. Whenthe real opening screen of FFV came up onto my screen, the small spritecharacters and pixellated logo almost made me break into giggles at howoutdated the whole thing seemed. But the moment I took control of Bartand rode my Chocobo over to the meteor crash site, I knew that theinitial impression was fleeting. Since I'd only played FFVI and notFFV, I was completely taken by surprise by how deep and involving everyaspect of the game was. From the highly addictive Job System tofiguring out how to equip my Mime, I really enjoyed this game for thefull 40-plus hours it took to beat it. Though I was more familiar withFFVI, it had the same effect on me -- even five or so years after Iplayed through it the first time. The history of console RPGs and Square's role within it is the crux ofwhy FF Anthology is such an important collection to be re-released onPlayStation. While some may snub the package as a way for Square tocash in on the recent Final Fantasy hype by sloughing off old gamesthat were already translated and ready-to-go, this would be missing outon the chance gamers have with FF Anthology. Final Fantasy V and FinalFantasy VI both have enough of those treasured definitive gamingmoments during each quest to last through this current generation ofsoftware and probably the next. Who could resist the charm of Shadow(FFVI) or the genuine bond felt between Reina and Faris? Eventually Ieven found myself liking these games more so than FFVIII. Though thegraphics will pale in comparison to those found in Square's latesteye-candy fest, its gameplay and characters remain as fresh as theywere when they were released. This is the type of experience thatcannot be beat even by many of today's RPGs and for the package andprice, it shouldn't be missed out on by anyone calling themselves afan.", "date": "Oct 8, 1999"}
