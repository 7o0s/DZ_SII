Recent innovative and sometimes brilliant games such as Rez, Guitaroo-Man and even to a certain extent Music Maestro sold poorly, sending the message to developers to quit their music-making ways for now, and thus directing the small but rambunctious music-loving community of gamers back to the import aisles.   For a big company like Sony Computer Entertainment America, however, music -- and music games -- is where it's at. SCEE, which built much of its marketing campaign in Europe on the cool, music-playing abilities of PlayStation back in 1996-1997, created an immensely sleek perception of the PS back in the day, and now on PlayStation 2 it's hooked up with Harmonix to create the sequel to its rhythm-based music game FreQuency, aptly dubbed Amplitude. The sequel is packed with a massive roster of modern day bands, a wider range of musical tastes, more levels, better graphics and online play. In short, it's a classic sequel.   But what it really means is that SCEA has responded to the game's enthusiastic fans with a deeper, more robust title, a game that is simultaneously hip, underground and aimed right at hardcore gamers, while delivering a broad enough appeal to casual players -- via simple gameplay and tons of popular bands -- to fit perfectly into SCEA's continued marketing efforts to be perceived as cool, hip, urban, the whole shebang. I don't really care how it's perceived to be honest, or how ~cool~ it is; all I know is that Amplitude is as addictive and compelling as they come, and it's great rocking fun.   Gameplay  I'll admit this right up front: I was never very good at Dance Dance Revolution. I'll admit another thing, too. I never really tried, or cared to. And it's because I fear looking incredibly stupid on a dance pad. I can dance just fine on the dance floor and look plenty stupid there, thank you very much. But what I always liked about DDR was the musical energy and excitement the game generated. Playing musical games on consoles, therefore, has been much easier, because looking stupid didn't mean doing it in front of more than, say, two to three people tops. That was the biggest stumbling block for me for arcade dance games and it's pretty much all but gone. What I have learned from all dance game experiences is that they all take practice and that, at any one time, everyone looks stupid at first.    SCEA's recent Amplitude has given me reason to look stupid, but I'm enthralled with the idea. I welcome it with open arms. Why? There's something about this game that's both intuitively unique and unexplainably addicting. Tapping a button to the beat of song isn't a new idea, but Amplitude enhances the concept, indulges us with layers of song (drums, bass, vocals, keyboards, etc.), and then places those songs in a colorful, psychedelic set of environments, providing a healthy set of options, gameplay modes and online play to round off the equation.    Amplitude starts off where FreQuency left off. Harmonix's innovative FreQuency laid down an excellent blueprint for this sequel to get a good start, and with its cohesive set of electronica and hip-hop, it got players hooked. Amplitude builds the whole thing wider and higher. It plays identically to the first: Players start down a track of nodes, hitting the correct buttons in turn with the rhythm, switching tracks to link their musical scores to different aspects of the song, and in essence re-creating the make-up of the song in an order entirely based on their liking, or at least their ability. But it improves the interface, creates more customization (using ~FreQs~), adds multi-person off-line play (using the multitap), and provides multiple online play modes.    Harmonix has altered and tweaked the game in this sequel to make it easier and simultaneously harder to play. The improved presentation helps newbies a lot but it's also a genuine improvement. ~FreQs~ are customized characters that represent them in solo and online games. This whimsical little character is basically a graphic embellishment that looks cool (or stupid) on screen, but it essentially jams on a small portion of the screen as you play. You edit it before playing; the editor includes parts for heads, faces, torsos, arms, legs, and logos, differing from robotic limbs to huge gorilla arms to a wide variety of goofy bondage masks. It's dorky fun to be sure, being able to customize these little guys, and the style of characters is a bit weird, but it is one more way to get players involved. Plus, I could make a bald, skinny white guy who looks just like me and I was happy.    Staring up a game unveils the newly designed playfield, which is now more of an integrated whole, a continuous environment, a sort of living urban dance club/city. Unlike FreQuency's closed tunnel, these tracks are now set in a five-part freeway of sorts, which can bank and turn in all directions as it travels through the animated city around it. The player's cursor is a now a ship. It flies above the track and zaps the nodes on the freeway as you progress through a song in either a closer, first-person view or a distant third-person view. Visually it's different, but play-wise it's the same. Using the Dpad or left analog stick, players flip back and forth between tracks, searching for active tracks, gems to zap, and once they grow better, linking the tracks for multipliers. Just like last year, you can use the face buttons or the three shoulder buttons. Though given the intensely fast, hypnotically rapid pace, I highly recommend players get accustomed to and perfect the use of the shoulder buttons, seeing as how two hands are better than one.    The harder part comes up quickly. Whatever level of difficulty you start on (the game is split into four difficulty levels, Mellow, Normal, Brutal, and Insane) and the farther into the game you progress, the more difficult it becomes. That's par for any game. The standard, sort of default mode is Normal, and even about half way through it, this level of difficulty level gets harder, with the last levels growing intensely difficult. Graduating to Brutal is very impressive, and playing through Insane, well, that's just insane, and it means you're a master -- and it also means you're way beyond the help of a regular psychiatric facility.    What makes Amplitude difficult in a dissimilar way (and in a very good way) is that the songs are all based on different beats and rhythms, so that progressing from one song to the next requires different beats and in some ways, headsets. You'll need to restart, re-set and re-think your beat/strategy on each song. One of my favorite songs from the 1980s, Herbie Hancock's ~Rockit~ is in this game, and it's a perfect example. It's very difficult to play even though I know it well. It's filled with quick stops and starts, scratches and offbeats, taking away from a sooth fluid set of buttons to punch. Other songs, such as Pink's ~Respect~ and Mekon (with Roxanne Shante)'s ~What's Going On?~ are both amazingly good songs to flow to. I like the Hancock's song better in real life, but in game life, I prefer the other two.    This brings a major point. Amplitude is a deeper, wider, more fulfilling version of FreQuency, and the only complaint that anybody can seriously justify is they don't like the list of artists on this new roster. But that still isn't a very good one. My argument against that is simple. I could care less about 90% of the songs on this list. In fact, I hadn't even heard of most of these bands, or their songs (that's cause basically, if these bands aren't the White Stripes, The Hives or The Flaming Lips, I'm not paying attention...but that's another story). Anyway, my honest opinion is that once you play only 10 minutes of this game, no matter what your musical aptitude is, you'll become addicted, or at the very least, you'll really like the game. I quickly fell in love with the songs because I was able to play them, and their remixes are good. A great example of this argument is David Bowie's contribution. I couldn't care less about it, and I'm a long-standing Bowie fan. But it works extremely well in the game, and I'll play it for hours and enjoy it. I may not buy any of these albums, but they're insanely good songs to play to, and that says more about the game's inescapably great playability than anything else.    The new styles of music are clearly oriented for a larger music-consuming public, while FreQuency was a little harder edged, a little more scratchy and sound effects heavy. I prefer listening to the songs on the first game, but these newer songs, with their pop, hip-hop, and alternative flair, still drive the game, and since Amplitude is so well designed and so fun, it seems like it hardly makes a difference. I wonder what would happen, honestly, if Harmonix put into their next game songs that I actually despised. Would it be fun to mix and re-mix them anyway?   Players can still remix songs, all of which works like last the way it did in FreQuency. What I like is that players can remix songs in either the regular player more, or access the remixes in the difficulty setting and play them as the game levels.    A big addition to Amplitude are the bonuses, power-ups and course alterations. While re-creating their songs, players earn powerups that enhance or alter their game. For instance, one can pick up a slow-mo item (which slows the song's pace, giving you the ability to play through a difficult track for a short period of time), Score Doubler (which does exactly what it sounds like), Autoblaster (which annihilates an entire track), Styler (which enables a kind of scratching ability), and several more. These add variety to the gameplay if you pay attention to them. The course alterations are different. While playing multiplayer, you can mess up an opponent's track, causing waves, or swerves to throw them off kilter and thus making it difficult to play well. Another addition is to the track itself. In later levels of the game, courses turn left or right and arch up and down downward, creating new levels of difficulty, since seeing over the hump of the track slightly disables the player from seeing what's coming down the pike.    Multiplayer and Online play brings new elements to the game's depth, longevity and playability. Players can vie online with either broadband and dial up capabilities, and using the peer-to-peer connections, players won't have to depend on a massive set of servers to boot up again or spell each other when too many people are playing. A nice Find function has been added to online, so if you connect online, and want to search for a friend, you simply type in their name or ~FreQ,~ locate them and join into their game. Offline, players can vie against as many as three other players (four total), using the Multitap. These games are intense and at times difficult, but winning one is very rewarding.    We were able to play Amplitude online with Sony testers and other editors before the game shipped to retail. The lobby is easy to use and the online capabilities didn't provide any major glitches. You can find games easy enough, and the connections, whether they're broadband or dial-up, function just fine. I suspect there will be some slowdown during the multiplayer games (because there always is) or difficulties in connecting, but from what I have played, I didn't encounter anything of the sort.   Online functions include Multiplayer, Remix and Dual. Multiplayer enables from one to four players to combat against each other, each sticking to one path and trying to rack up as many points and combos as possible. Remix enables you to play other people's remixed songs, which will be selected by SCEA folks and placed in a repository, filtering out the crap ones, of course. And Dual is kind of like the game of Horse. You play against another person; each of you trying to perform the path better than the other person, until one person inevitably earns too many letters.    The cooperative two-player Remix Mode should be very popular. Two gamers can collaborate on a remix song, mix up multiple tracks simultaneously to complete it, and perhaps even stumble on some new sounds. They can then upload or download their mixes and share them. A player's FreQ shows becomes their identifying icon, which means people will be able to match up with others of their skill levels faster, or recognize their friends faster, or even establish an identity and reputation more substantially.    Graphics  Frequency is what I like to call pure eye candy. It's not a game that requires a whole lot of visual detail, or even much in the way of graphics at all. In truth, this could easily use straight black and white vector graphics, and it would work just as well. But that's not the case, Amplitude is, in fact, a much prettier game than its predecessor, and it's also presents itself better.     Amplitude still delivers a Tron-like, digital environment, a digital city of sorts, but the tunnel players drive though before has widened out into a city, and as players beat songs and progress through the game, each of the tracks is linked visually to another, so that each section feels like a smaller part of a whole.  The size and scope of the environments are much larger than what was shown in the original FreQuency, and a lot more is going on. There is lots of stuff to watch, such as your FreQ in a display (which you can make smaller, larger, or eliminate), videos on buildings, flashing signs, and other Las Vegas-like blinking signs, buttons, and other doo-dads. But the fast is, most of the time, you won't even be looking at the backgrounds, cause you'll be so focused on the nodes on the tracks.   So yes, the graphics have improved substantially enough to more than notice. There is a lot more to look at, more animations on screen simultaneously, and a solid framerate running at all times. Load times are quick and switching from menu to menu is instant. I have only encountered a few framerate chugs here and there during intense gameplay sessions, but very, very few. All in all, visually, it's an excellent game.    Sound  Admittedly on the surface, this new selection of bands is less ~hardcore~ than the last, which presented itself as more underground DJ-style mosaic. This is a little bit more like of those compilation albums that collects all of the most popular bands from a particular time period and lumps them all together into one big pile. But this roster is far more than that. It's clear Sony wanted to broaden the age groups, ethnicities, and cultures of all people playing Amplitude, and with songs from old fellas like David Bowie and Herbie Hancock, and young punks like blink 182, Garbage and Weezer, they have rounded this thing out well.   The list of bands is quite substantial, including songs from blink 182 (~The Rock Show~), David Bowie, Pink, Dieselboy (a remix of Styles Of Beyond's ~Subculture~), Freezepop (~Supersprde~), Garbage, Logan 7, Mekon, Quarashi, Weezer, Herbie Hancock (~Rockit~), Papa Roach, Baldwin Brothers (~Urban Tumbleweed~), Production Club (~~Rockstar~), Manchild (~Nitrogen Narcosis~), Mekon (~What's Going on?~), P.O.D. (~Boom~), a special remix by The Crystal Method, and more.   What's especially cool for stereoheads is that Amplitude gives you a choice of listening to the game in Dolby Pro Logic II, unlike FreQuency. The sound isn't naturally as great as Dolby 5.1, but the sounds are crisp, loud and clean, creating a hiss free sound environment -- and another noticeable improvement.What's funny about Amplitude is that on some days I shred. While on others I completely suck, and the harder I try on those sucky days, the worse I get. I'll tell you this too. If you saw any of the movies I posted for the preview, they sucked ass, and I'm not proud of them, but the game takes practice and time, and you really need to familiarize yourself with them to get really good. I have done just that.Amplitude is an excellent game, on par with any of the best musical games you can think of. It's chock full of artists, so you're bound to find something to like. It's also better presented, organized and looking than FreQuency, including ~boss~ fights (harder songs at the level's end), deeper gameplay, and it's both easier to get into and harder to master (thanks to the harder songs and difficulty levels). And perhaps its best quality is that it's online, making it the only musical online game for the PS2, which adds a great deal to the current slate of online titles. For anyone who loved the first, this is a no-brainer. For music and rhythm fans, this is a sure bet, and for gamers in general, Amplitude is an incredibly compelling, addictive game. I strongly recommend it.", "date": "Mar 24, 2003"}
