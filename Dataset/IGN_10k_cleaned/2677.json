From the moment the company first previewed it at our offices, I was excited. ~If only ASC gets these gameplay bugs fixed, it'll be great,~ I said to no one in particular. Imagine my disappointment when I got the final game and found the ~gameplay bugs~ to be the gameplay. Aaah! One takes place 40 years in the future. Protagonist John Cain awakens in an unfamiliar apartment building with his left arm replaced by a huge gun, confused and rightfully upset. As he leaves the building he is chased by unknown military personal bent on killing him. As game premises go, this is a good one. And, as graphics go, One is great as well.  One begins with John running down a long platform high up inside the apartment building, with a helicopter just visible outside the windows. The helicopter begins shooting, and it just looks awesome. This first level is a perfect example of how good One can look. The explosions are incredible, the lasers are sharp and crisp, and John's movements are lithe and realistic. Unfortunately, this is where the good parts of One stop.  Running down a corridor is fine, but controlling John Cain in any other environment is a challenge. His movement is almost too loose, resulting in missed jumps that should be incredibly easy. After dying numerous times on something that shouldn't be a problem, the game begins to get frustrating.  Which leads me to One's main problem: it's too damn hard. Any good game has a steady learning curve: it's easy at the beginning, so you get to know the control and how the game works, and then  steadily gets more difficult. One starts tough and gets worse. But the really mean thing about One is the way you die. One makes you learn to do new things so you will have to die 20 times to figure it out. And the save points are spaced incredibly far apart so you have to keep starting over. Note to future developers: this is not fun.  Finally, One seemingly has been designed to make it impossible to see what's going on. Whenever something big blows up (which is often) the screen shakes like in a movie. This looks impressive enough to the person watching you play but it makes it difficult to see what's going on. Add to this some screen-filling explosions and the camera's tendency to get stuck behind solid objects, and you're falling off narrow catwalks left and right.  One could've been a great game. It has the basic idea down, and the mindless shooting can be fun. But when the game goes out of its way to make it hard for you to play, it really sucks.  Adam Douglas", "date": "Dec 11, 1997"}
