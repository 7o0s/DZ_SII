The disc-based peripheral allowed the system to support games pressed onto CD-ROM media, and those games that shipped on disc instead of the traditional Turbo HuCard often benefited from significant boosts in graphics and sound. That's the case for Gate of Thunder -- because compared to the side-scrolling shooters on the Turbo system before it, nothing looked or sounded quite as good as this.   In fact, Gate of Thunder sounds spectacular. Its soundtrack is amazing, and fully capitalizes on the potential of the CD media it was developed for. Most will likely be stunned to hear how good it sounds, especially if you've never played a Turbo CD game before. It's rock-based, heavy on the guitar, fast-paced and full of rich bass.   Still shots do little justice to Gate of Thunder's dynamic scrolling backgrounds. Though your thumbs won't be treated as nicely as your ears; Gate demands quick action on the triggers to keep up with everything the alien enemy forces are dishing out, unlike some shooters which only task you to constantly hold down a single fire button while dancing and dodging around unfriendly attacks. Here, Thunder asks you to juggle three different alterable aspects of your ship on top of the normal mayhem.   The first aspect is its speed, and three different settings are available there -- normal, slower than normal, and way faster than normal. You can toggle between them, and you don't have to collect any power-ups or anything like that to activate the feature -- speed-switching is always available, and you can always adjust your ship's maximum velocity to your liking, adapting to different situations as they arise.   The second customizable feature of your ship is its direction of attack. While your main vessel will always fire its weapons straight ahead to the right side of the screen, a double-tap of the ~shoot~ button will make your accompanying options turn around and fire behind you. You can send some ordnance out to cover your aft, switch back to fire full force to the front, switch back to attack behind again... and so on and so forth, as often as you want.   Finally, there are three different styles of primary weapon that you can swap at any time after you've collected them as power-ups. The starter gun is a straight, no-frills laser, but you'll also come across a wider-ranged green wave projector and an explosive Sheller called the Earthquake. Most other games in the genre allow only one active weapon at a time, and will usually replace your current gun when you grab a power-up of some different type. But Gate of Thunder stacks them all up, keeping any extras in reserve for when, and if, you choose to toggle over to them.   So there's a lot of variety and possibility in Thunder's gameplay, and you feel more engaged in piloting this ship than you would behind the flight stick of others. There are only seven levels to fly through and conquer, which is a bit disappointing, but also about on par for shooters of the time. Plus, if you find yourself getting cocky at having too easily cleared the game on Normal, there are additional maddening levels of challenge to face. Hard Mode makes things quite a bit tougher, and the even more insane Devil Mode will likely have you tearing out your hair in clumps.Gate of Thunder's soundtrack is explosive, and is amazing even all these years later. Gate's gameplay, too, separates it from other side-scrolling shooters by keeping you more engaged, with more choices to make in the middle of intense firefights -- will you take things slow, or set the ship to maximum speed? Will you attack all out in front, or split your focus to cover the rear as well? The choice is yours!", "date": "Nov 8, 2007"}
