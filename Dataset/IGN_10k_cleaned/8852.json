{"name": "Obscure: The Aftermath", "name_review": "Obscure II UK Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/02/obscure-ii-uk-review", "text": "Once upon a time, if you were a college student, the mere act of even thinking about waggling your wand in a lady's magic cavern would pretty much guarantee a visit from your local friendly psychopath for a quick correctional course via a selection of lovingly sharpened blades of justice. Well, in movies at least. Now though, horror's all about psychological terror plus protracted torture - and the videogame genre is no exception.   In fact, the only game to revisit the heady days of teen dismemberment in an educational setting was the original Obscure - a somewhat low-key title from French developer Hydravision. It was an enjoyable if relentlessly, half-knowingly, naff take on the slasher genre which just about managed to hold its head at shoulder height with the heavyweights of the survival horror genre - thanks, in part, to its entirely co-operative two-player story mode.   All hail the omnipresent traffic cone!  Three years on, the surviving students of the first game have returned for the obligatory sequel, having left the accursed halls of Leafmore High behind for the hedonistic delights of recreational drugs and unabashed bonking at Fallcreek University. Of course, in time honoured teen horror tradition, it's not long before the past catches up with them and all hell breaks lose on campus. The moral? Drugs and sex are bad.   If that sounds like a fairly generic premise, it is. Obscure II certainly won't be winning awards for its stunning characterisations and earth-shattering plot twists - mainly because it doesn't have any. You'll spend most of your time being whisked from various survival horror staple locations - school, hospital, spooky forest and so on - eagerly awaiting the plot to kick in. You might also wonder when the scares are going to start but - spoiler! - they don't. In fact, there are so many brightly lit environments, constant atmosphere-undermining quips and daft enemies, you might as well be playing Big Ted's Adventure in Picnic Land.   This bit's good. There's a boat and everything.  That's never really a problem though, given how self-aware Obscure II is. It knows it's a cheesy horror romp and quite happily nicks entire set-pieces from classic movies of yore - there's even a chainsaw-wielding maniac in a wobbly shack, for goodness sake. Chuck in some hilarious translation clangers - making Resi's ~master of unlocking~ sound positively Shakespearian - and voice acting not so much phoned in as scrawled in crayon on a Post-it, then mailed Second Class, and there's something almost irresistible about Obscure II's daffy charm.   Luckily though, there's more to recommend than vague ineptness: Much like the first game, Obscure II's wild card is its co-operative mechanics. Each of the game's six characters has their own unique 'abilities' and Hydravision has managed to fashion some incredibly nifty puzzles around each. In the roster, you've access to ledge-shimmying acrobatics, lock picking, cryptology, hacking, super-strength and, er, ferocious sucking. Abilities play out as an entertaining mini-game when called upon - whether it's some minor QTE action when clambering along high ledges or jigsaw-style evidence reconstruction - and offer a nice change of pace from the more prominent running around and shooting angry pork chops in the face.     Wherever you go, you always have two characters to keep an eye on and, thankfully, when soloing, AI is smart enough to stay out of your way when exploring and get stuck in when you're up against the game's various deadly mutations. Each location features an area where all current survivors congregate and, at various stages, you're required to switch around your party to tackle obstacles ahead. Thankfully, these hubs are sensibly placed so you're never subjected to endless backtracking when you reach an impasse with your current selection.   Shannon's special ability: dressing like a tart.  It's possible to switch between your two characters with a simple tap of a button and this becomes essential during Obscure II's more involving puzzles. For instance, one section sees you manually rerouting steam valves then switching to your second character to slowly edge to safety. Another sees Sven, the strongman, shifting boxes to create bridges while Corey, the monkey boy, leaps, jumps and clambers round to reach the elevator controls on the other side of the room. Invariably, these are the most satisfying, rewarding elements of Obscure II and some smart puzzle design really makes them work.   Of course, a second player can take control of one of your team-mates at any time and join in the fully co-operative campaign mode. Needless to say, it's a lot of fun and really adds to Obscure II's appeal. What's more, Hydravision has tackled some of the more serious issues with the original game's co-operative mode - namely the horrendous camera. While you'll still occasionally have to grapple with the odd epileptic fit, this sequel employs a much more sensible system which switches focus to the currently active character, while still enabling player two some degree of control if they skulk to the periphery. In other words, chances of being mauled to death off-screen while your team mate pauses to scratch their bum are much slimmer this time around.   Carelessness costs lives!  Still though, Obscure II isn't without its faults. For a start, a combination of rigid linearity, plentiful health and ammunition, plus generally easy combat encounters makes for a relatively unchallenging romp and it's unlikely you'll want to return after your first sub-ten hour play-through. More significant, though, is the absolutely awful save system. Save points are sparse at best and can only be used once. The lack of any logical checkpoint system means that one cock up can result in having to replay large sections of the game, which is inexcusable, frustrating and really takes the edge off the otherwise enjoyable mechanics.Ultimately, Obscure II sits in that grey area of recommendation. It's generic, daft, devoid of personality and occasionally broken. On the other hand, it offers an enjoyable distraction, some smartly designed puzzles and an engaging two-player co-op mode. In other words, if you're after a healthy ten-hour distraction, revel in cheese like a midget in fondue or want something to do with a friend that doesn't involve alcohol and Truth or Dare, you could do much worse. It's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 in a world of Hostels - but, sometimes, that's no bad thing.", "date": "Aug 2, 2007"}
