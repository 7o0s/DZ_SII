Not because it's a bad game, and not because it's a puzzle title, although that doesn't help, but for two other major reasons. First, it's an unknown quantity (What the hell is FantaVision, anyway?) that can't be easily identified when glancing at the box; and second, it uses so little of the PS2's polygon pushing power that it doesn't really usher in the next generation of games with a whole lot of gusto. So, poor little FantaVision, a mesmerizing, alluring light show of a game, may just be like one of those billboards you see in the freeway  you see it once and pass on by, never really sure of what the message was.   Gameplay The fact is FantaVision is sort of like rockabilly music. It's fun, colorful and really gets you going, but you'll quickly want to hear something else. (Just imagine listening to more than three rockabilly songs in a row and you'll get the point.) Most puzzle games have this trite sort of one-dimensional quality, but what they have gobs of to counter it is drug-like addicting gameplay. FantaVision sort of has it, too.   But let's get to the game (I mean, tell me what the hell is FantaVision, anyway?). In FantaVision, players use a cursor that floats in mid-screen to connect like colored fireworks that shoot into the air from outside the screen. A line from the cursor moves in 360 degrees and using the left analog controller, you line up similar colored fireworks, and then set them off in the sky for points. It's actually quite fun. Essentially, the more you connect the more points you earn. Just imagine if you had redesigned the old game Electrobright into a videogame -- you'd get this.   Connecting fireworks, that's pretty much the basis of the game. These lovely little flares shoot up from the ground over a night sky and you set them off, and the more fireworks you light off at once, the more points you earn, but also the prettier the screen. It's quite dazzling in a simple kind of way.   Here comes the hitch. The game is much trickier than that. Its gets quite challenging, even hard, and for some, downright discouraging. There are at least six different kinds of fireworks  Peonies, Daisy Flares, Willows, Flashes, Wides, and Multi or Wild Flares. Each has a slightly different visual and functional quality that effects gameplay. For instance, Peonies explode in regular circular forms, but Willows are those fireworks that explode downward, kind of like a willow tree's branches and leaves. Willows are great to chain with because for one, the reach down toward the bottom of the screen, where the next wave of flares come from. And when a new set of flares comes onscreen, you can set off your willows and thus set off the new wave (if they are the same color), for extra points. Multiflares actually break apart into smaller flares that can be set off again. These are great for multichains, too. The object is to recognize the kind of firework and use it to your advantage.   Then there are different chains. Lighting off more than one flare is considered a chain. The higher the chain count (10, 14, 19, etc.) the higher your score. There are daisy chains, Stars, and Starmines, among others. Using multiflares, players can connect different colored flares, such as red flares with green flares, or blue flares with green flares, and so on. Multicolored flares are key to earning high scores. The gameplay part of FantaVision requires skill, timing, and quick reactions. FantaVision is definitely a quick-eye-hand coordination game that'll rattle your carpels in no time.   FantaVision will either catch you or leave you dry instantly. There is very little gray area where you sort of want to play. It's simple and somewhat addicting in the single player mode, and what's nice is that Sony Computer Entertainment America added a two-player mode in the US and European versions of the game, so the slight addiction is even greater. The two-player mode pits human vs. human with a single vertical line splitting the screen. What's neat is that the line moves to one side or the other depending on how well you're doing. So, you pull off a major set of chains and watch the line widen your side of the screen for even bigger points, and this narrows your opponent's real estate. The two-player mode is FantaVision's saving grace -- it's challenging and fun, and you simply have to play just one more game.   Graphics FantaVision is very simple, graphically. There is no stunning mountain of polygons to blow you away. The screen is black with night, and shows a variety of backgrounds from a city at night, complete with glimmering lights from buildings and houses, or later in, you actually move through space amongst space stations and nebulae. However you dice it, it's usually black and simple. The fireworks are the other 50% of the graphics. They are either red, blue green, or a combination of the three. The highlight of FantaVision is seeing the fireworks swiveling up into the air, holding and gently descending before they explode in a massive 20-chain. And that's it.   Sound To be honest, the sound is weaker than anything else. It's not only weird old cheesy Japanese-like AM radio, it's clear that the music was conspicuously composed that way. It's synthy supermarket, elevator muzak, and it's truly not meant to be heard. Instead it creates a breezy little white noise in the background. The other part of the sound is the announcer who calls out the kinds of chains you earned. He does his job, and you can hear him. It works.FantaVision is one of those games that appears every once in a while and that is comprised of surprisingly originality. But it doesn't set your soul on fire. You get the feeling that somebody really wanted to create a fireworks game, perhaps for years he or she was brooding over the idea, and this is how it turns out. And hey! You get to control fireworks. And hey! It's not such a big deal...The fact is the level of addiction just isn't that great. It's not as big as Super Puzzle Fighter, or Tetris, or Devil Dice, or anything of that caliber. It's fun, but you quickly get over it.Strangely, as Sony's sole first-party game on the PlayStation 2, it's absolutely the most underwhelming, least power-hungry, least impressive tile of the bunch. And I don't know about you all, but if you don't mess with the handicap switch in options, you won't get very far in the second level. It's damn hard. By the way, I like FantaVision, it's a fun little game. But it could have appeared on any system, not just the PlayStation 2, and have looked just as good. And that's the real weird thing, after all of Sony's hoopla about the PS2's phenomenal power, its first PS2 title in the US is the exact antithesis of power or dazzling technology. If anything, FantaVision is more like a light show game demo (like Super Electrobright!), rather than a proper game.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
