The magic and mystery coated series, created by now-gazillionaire J.K. Rowling, sold in the millions on paper, delighted millions on the silver screen and, thanks to Electronic Arts, achieved mainstream success on the digital front, too.Last year's Eurocom-developed action-adventure Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets followed the second chapter in the lucrative franchise, skipping right over the first. This meant that the three people who never read or saw the first Potter were left somewhat in the dark in regard to how the wizard Boy Who Lived got his heroic start. It's with these three people in mind, no doubt, that EA returned its attention to the beginning of Harry's adventures.The Sorcerer's Stone follows the same formula that made Chamber of Secrets enjoyable -- which is, incidentally, to control as closely to Nintendo's classic Zelda games as possible. In some cases, it is a success. Exploring Hogwarts remains entertaining and some of the puzzles the serves up are satisfying, if easy. But this Warthog developed prequel makes few advancements over its predecessor and in fact mucks quite a few things up, from overall story flow to framerate fluidity, both of which have taken a turn for the worse.The Facts All-new 3D adventure that chronicles the events from the first Harry Potter book Control Harry Potter through famous franchise landmarks including a fully modeled Hogwarts Learn a variety of magic spells which can be used to solve puzzles and fight enemies Do battle against grotesque bosses ripped right out of the book Compete in intense matches of Quidditch Ride Potter's broomstick around Hogwarts Game uses art assets from Chamber of Secrets so that the characters and locations look similar No more load times -- the world blends together seamlessly without pauses Single-player gameGameplayThe Sorcerer's Stone videogame closely follows the overall storyline of the first novel, with some liberties here and there for good measure. The tale unravels through slow-going in-game cut-sequences. It's in the first of many such scenes that players meet the fluffy-haired giant Hagrid as he walks Potter through Diagon Alley, the shopping center of choice for magical folk everywhere. The story elements in the title are made all the more believable due in large to great voice dialogue, which is well acted and crisp. On the opposite end, the sequences seem to lack any real driving background music and as a result can feel almost mute and the animation is not nearly as smooth or seamless as it was in the year-old Chamber of Secrets.  On top of everything else, the direction is spotty. A character in a cut-scene may animate to no voices for a few seconds before dialogue finally begins, for instance, and it's these seemingly little things that make the big differences in overall presentation.  Potter gets his wand and he eventually arrives at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a near-scale sized replica of the castle and grounds, and it's here -- this hub world -- that the bulk of the game takes place. The gameplay dynamic is for the most part unchanged from Chamber of Secrets. Potter goes to his classes, where his teachers assign him goals from finding ingredients that will help him mix potions to retrieving special magic books or artifacts that conveniently (or perhaps inconveniently) rest in a nearby dungeons. The boy wizard will learn new spells, which can be intuitively assigned to the face buttons a la Zelda; he will do battle with enemies; solve puzzles using magic and potions; duel against boss-type characters; and even play Quidditch. Gamers can also collect 101 wizard cards scattered throughout the school to gain stamina.Control feels mostly tight. Potter is easily manipulated around the environments. Platforming is made less frustrating due to an auto-jump feature that activates when appropriate. Assigning spells is a breeze. The shoulder buttons can be used to adequately lock onto enemies and look around environments. Meanwhile, puzzles and boss encounters are usually well implemented. Potter may have to use a spell to light up an environment so that he can see where he's going, he might have to fight off a wave of enemies or he might just need to make his way across a series of dangerous looking platforms without falling to his death. Each is entertaining and usually satisfying for different reasons, but the camera system can and sometimes does malfunction too, which causes temporary visibility problems, and these can be frustrating.On a bright note, developer Warthog has mostly eliminated the bloated load times that connected parts of Hogwarts in Chamber of Secrets. When Potter makes his way through a doorway now, the next room pops into view without pause (though the game does make players sit through animated sequences that show Potter slowly opening and walking through doors in an attempt to mask load times). Animations or not, the world definitely feels bigger and more sewn together than it did previously.Sadly, that is about the only technical improvement introduced over the previous game. Worse, The Sorcerer's Stone is actually technically inferior in most other respects from the visual presentation (which we'll detail in our graphics section) to an overall general lack of polish. During our play through the game, we encountered several different glitches. In one, the camera spun wildly around and caused our character to disappear and reappear on the screen. In another far more serious bug, the camera caught on a wall as we flew around Hogwarts and though our character model continued to soar into the distance, the camera did not move with him. We had to reset after we accidentally flew Potter behind a castle wall where we became completely blinded to whatever might have been happening. The game seems to employ very poor AI, too. In one case, a prefect who was supposed to be looking for Potter walked right by him -- less than a foot away -- without so much as blinking. GraphicsThe Sorcerer's Stone uses many of the same art assets that brought Chamber of Secrets to life. Logic dictates then that this follow-up, with a year to advance the technology, should look better. Somehow the opposite is true. Warthog's prequel actually looks significantly deteriorated.  Players familiar with Eurocom's game would be able to walk around Hogwarts and recognize many of the locales in The Sorcerer's Stone as structurally and texturally unchanged. We did. And yet, the crispness of textures has seen a noticeable downgrade. The animation of characters appears far more jerky and untamed. And the fluidity has been shot directly in the gut, going from a smooth 60 frames per second on GameCube and Xbox last year (less on PS2) to sub-30 frames. Gamers are bound to wonder, what the heck happened? We're not sure, but it's a big disappointment.That noted, this Potter adventure is far from ugly. Hogwarts -- gargantuan -- is still very reminiscent of the movie version complete with rotating stairways and illuminated dungeons. Potter, Ron and Hermione all the look the part, as do nemesis characters like Draco. The game occasionally dazzles with real-time lighting effects, projected shadows, reflections and transparencies, and the particle system gets the job done. Locales are extremely varied, from the greens of the Quidditch field to the wooden-floored classrooms and stone secret passageways. The graphics will definitely impress in some instances. And yet, anybody who played Chamber of Secrets will likely notice and take issue with the difference in visual polish. The title only runs in progressive scan on Xbox.SoundSolid. The voice dialogue in the game can drag out a bit, but it is well acted and very crisp. The cut-scenes are far better equipped because of the quality of the voice work. Some of the lines are a bit overused and occasionally out of place, but these are minor complaints. Sounds effects, from the whoosh of the wand to the playful growls of miniature creatures, are on par. Meanwhile, the music is clear and usually fitting, though occasionally subdued, if not downright mute. Definitely a mixed bag, but for the most part the good outweighs the bad.As someone who's read all of the Potter books and watched all of the movies, I have to admit that I'm not nearly as impressed with EA's adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone as I was with the job it did with Chamber of Secrets. This Warthog-developed prequel in many ways feels like the digital equivalent of a Ron Weasley hand-me-down. The story is the most dated, the art assets re-used, and gameplay mechanics re-used, and all with a serious hit in graphic quality, a truth that really disappoints. Worst of all, the game's general lack of polish also means that it's buggy and sometimes employs questionable character artificial intelligence. And yet, this isn't a bad game either. Control -- as Zelda-inspired as ever -- is tight. Some of the puzzles are fairly clever and satisfying. Boss fights are entertaining. And as always, the simple act of exploring the vastness of Hogwarts, now without load times, is very engaging.I think that die-hard Potter fans will be able to forgive the shortcomings in search of a fun adventure, which is definitely in place, if a little hidden. But given all of the drawbacks I can't recommend The Sorcerer's Stone as I did Chamber of Secrets, and I think anybody new to the Potter universe would be far better served with Eurocom's superior title.", "date": "Dec 10, 2003"}
