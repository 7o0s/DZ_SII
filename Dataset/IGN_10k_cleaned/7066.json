You follow the adventures of Stahn Aileron, a down-to-earth country boy who has (of course) decided to seek fame and fortune in the wild, unknown world. And being of typical, lack-of-foresight hero-stuff, Stahn decides to start off by stealing away aboard a dragon ship (a huge biomecha flying transport) manned by a trigger-happy crew who guard a mysterious cargo. Yup -- you are quickly discovered by that crew, but instead of being tossed off the ship, you're set to mopping decks. As salvation of sorts arrives in the form of an attack upon the ship, you flee and find yourself in a cargo hold with the aforementioned cargo  a talking sword, or Swordian. So starts a long and twisted adventure with many a convoluted turn.  Graphically, Tales of Destiny is a solid effort. The introductory cinematic is truly stunning, and well-worth watching through  even though it really doesn't do too much to set up the story for you. The actual in-game graphics, however, are somewhat disappointing. You either maneuver from a 2D top-down view seen in many a classic Zelda title, or fight in a 2D scrolling plane, in an odd (but ultimately effective) RPG meets Street Fighter view. The majority of the game is in one of these 2D views, with the exception of when you're walking on the overland map. Then, you maneuver a 2D sprite over a 3D polygon globe which rotates beneath you as you explore.   As mentioned earlier, battles are fought in a 2D, side-scrolling plane in a quasi-real-time format. You control only your character, but maneuver him in real-time as the battle rages. You can choose three ways of attack: normal, special move (gained by going up in levels), or magic. Combining joypad directions and the attack buttons produce different actions such as thrusts, slashes, and guard positions. Attacks all take a certain amount of time, during which you are unable to initiate another maneuver. Once your attack is finished, though, you can again choose another move. All the while, your other (computer-controlled) party members battle gamely on with a fair amount of intelligence. As you progress through the game you learn new and more powerful spells -- a definite key to advancing beyond some of the tougher battles.   Another strong point of the game is the musical score. The game comes with over 90 musical tracks, most of which are extremely good and well-suited to the situations they're linked to. An added bonus is the fine-grained control you're given over the sound and music playback in the game. The game configuration screen allows you to watch a real-time level meter, spectrum analyzer, and set reverb effects to your personal preference. All this in addition to the normal level setting for music, sound effects, and voice. Playing Tales of Destiny is an interesting experience. On the one hand, you find yourself engrossed by the story, and quickly lose track of time. The interface is easy-to-use and never gets in the way, and the music and sound effects are extremely well-done. That said, there are certain quirks that gnaw at you as you continue playing. First and foremost is the feeling that you're playing a Super NES game from years ago. This feeling comes directly from the exclusive use of hand-drawn 2D art throughout the game. Although this art is top-notch, it doesn't make for any advances beyond what we saw on the Super NES years back. It may seem somewhat elitist, but many gamers today do place a huge emphasis on the graphics of a title, and Tales of Destiny just seems... well, old. Another aggravation is the manner in which combat takes place. Note that I'm not speaking of the actual battle screens or combat interface, but instead, how combat is initiated. In Tales of Destiny, you fight either when you see a creature on the screen and come into contact with it, or when you step on a seemingly-empty square and trigger a random encounter. There are two problems with this approach. First, the random combat encounters happen far too often  even more than in Final Fantasy VII, if that gives you an idea. Second, it's the lack of consistency between the types of encounters is aggravating. It's frustrating to see a creature on the screen, cleverly out-maneuver it and avoid an unwanted battle... and then promptly step into another random, unseen, and unavoidable encounter. Although I personally prefer seeing the creatures on the overland map, I'd be happy if the game just used one paradigm or the other. In the end, though, the game's the thing, and luckily this is where Tales of Destiny shines. From the first moment, you're drawn into a fun, fast-paced, and challenging game that keeps you always wanting to go through one more door, or open one more can of worms. Although I can nitpick at the graphic look and occasionally awkward Japanese to English translations, looking back I realize I got sucked into the game and had a great time. And what more can you ask for, really? Highly recommended, as long as you're a fan of the classic Super NES!", "date": "Feb 13, 1999"}
