But now that has all changed.  Clive Barker's Undying is now available, and the results are every bit as scary and enthralling as any of his movies or books, and in some cases even more so because you're intimately involved with the action as it happens.Hopefully you've all had a chance to read the PC preview of Undying by now, so I don't have to delve deep into the back story or Jeremiah's ~family problems.~  What I will say, though, is that I'm personally glad the folks at DreamWorks Interactive decided to heed Clive's advice and go with the period-fitting, curly-locked Patrick Galloway as the main character rather than the bald-headed, tattooed Magnus.  I don't think a burly, bald, tattoo-laden protagonist would have fit in well with a game set on an island off of Ireland at the turn of the 20th century.With that said, it's obvious that not only did he lend his name to the title and influenced the main character, but Clive Barker was also intimately involved with the entire game design process.  While the creepy, spine-chilling storyline is obvious Barker, he also had quite a hand in the pacing and atmosphere of the game.  Unlike most first-person shooters, Undying isn't about constant action and mouse clicking.  As any horror fan will tell you, it's scarier waiting for something to happen.  This isn't Quake or Unreal -- baddies don't jump out at you constantly.  This game is all about atmosphere, and part of that atmosphere is keeping you edgy just waiting for the next beastie to jump out and claw off your face.  That's not to say there's not plenty of action in the game. While there were a few times in Jeremiah's ransacked, desolate manor where I found it tedious to traverse from one end of the mansion to the other, I was still tense and on edge because I was primed for a Howler to slip in through the window at any moment.Speaking of waiting for creatures to leap out at you, I was genuinely impressed with the AI in Undying.  Some creatures, like the Howlers, attack in packs, with one grabbing your attention and distracting you while the others flank you and rip at your back, while other creatures, like the mindless skeletal warriors, come at you head on with little care for their well-being.  This approach to different styles of combat makes it feel like you're actually fighting a variety of different creatures rather than just the same AI wrapped in a different skin.  Creatures will also dodge, spin, and generally try to stay out of the way of your direct line of sight so as not to open themselves up to an easy shot from your pistol or a shocking blast of lightning.While, for the most part, gameplay is similar to any other FPS, Undying mixes the action up a little by not only offering a wide variety of creative weapons -- from the requisite pistol and shotgun (but with ingenious ammo types such as silver bullets and phosphorous shells) to more esoteric armaments like the iceball-lobbing Tibetan War Cannon and the extremely powerful but close-ranged Scythe -- but you'll also find eight spells along the way that serve both defensive and offensive purposes.  While at first I thought this dual-hand approach would be awkward, it was actually quite reassuring to carry around a trusty gun in one hand while my other hand dabbled in the arcane arts.  The control system was easy to get used to, with the left mouse button relegated to my chosen weapon and the right button to casting spells, and the mouse wheel used to cycle through either your technological armaments or your magical tricks (or, in my case, both, as I had the spells cycle with mouse wheel up and the weapons with mouse wheel down). The system turned out to be really quite elegant, and my early doubts were belayed after my first few brawls in the game.What isn't quite so graceful is the aiming system.  Unlike many other shooters, your bullets don't strike your enemies if they're ~close enough~ to your aiming reticule, and long distance shots aren't guaranteed to hit.  You will miss, sometimes even when you're sure your foes are right in your sights.  But this only makes the game feel more realistic as, for the most part, you're dealing with turn-of-the-century guns that really weren't all that accurate to begin with.  You'll rely more and more on your spells as the game progresses, although I was a bit disappointed that increasing the power of a spell with an amplifier didn't seem to make the spell all that much more powerful.  For example, a level five lightning bolt didn't seem to do all that much more damage than a level one lightning bolt, but the spells were cool nonetheless, and the variety of spell types -- from magical shields to raising the dead to fight on your side -- really offered up a lot of different ways to approach combat.One of the most useful and interesting spells is the Scrye incantation, which you begin the game with.  Scrye allows you to see events that happened in the past and/or in other dimensions, thereby giving you almost two places to explore in each level.  This spell really did a lot to enhance the eerie atmosphere of the game, and there are a lot of places where you'll see some truly freaky stuff if you've got Scrye activated, but may completely miss if not.  Like I mentioned earlier, Undying isn't about constant action and endless mouse clicking.  There are quite a few puzzles as well, especially of the jumping variety, but none are all that hard, and some are actually quite fun, especially in the floating ethereal city of Oneiros when you often have to make a leap of faith and just hope a walkway appears below your feet.  Unfortunately, even with its deep storyline and gothic atmosphere, Undying does suffer from the ~locked door~ syndrome, and several times in the game you'll reach a door only to find you have to go searching through the house to find the appropriate key.Since it's built on a highly modified version of the Unreal Tournament engine, Undying is pretty as well as a lot of macabre fun.  The natural environments are a bit blocky, but the indoor environments are realistic and creepy, and the striking lighting effects really add to the unnerving ambiance.  Levels are small, which makes navigation easy, but it also means there are lots of breaks in the action as you wait for a new level to load.  All in all though, the load times aren't all that bad, and there's usually plenty to do before you hit another load spot.  Another nice graphical touch that enhances the mood of the game is the realistic cloth modeling system.  Imagine the difference between walking down a flat, dark, lifeless hallway and one with wafting muslin curtains blocking your view of the other end of the hallway...yes, this game will freak you out.  Of course, this graphical power comes at a price, and if you don't have a fast system you won't be able to run Undying at high detail with a good framerate.Creature and character models are sharp and fit the game well, and there's a wide variety of enemy types, so you won't fight the blue, red, green, and gray version of the same baddies over and over again. While the interior settings look great, objects such as chairs and tables are fixed in place, making it so you can't interact with the environment.  The only visual problem I had with Undying were texture seam problems, as I could often see the background shining through where two textures met.  Since Undying is so story-laden, you can expect a lot of the plot to be unveiled through in-game cut scenes.  These are very dramatic because the screen switches to a letterbox mode and, while your feet are locked in place, you can look around the environment since they're rendered in-game.  You'll mainly be talking to servants, Jeremiah, and his departed family members in these cut scenes, although I did find it funny that many of the servants were still hanging around the mansion after the recent hauntings and sightings of supernatural creatures that would like nothing better than to suck their brains out through their eye sockets.  I guess the local hired help isn't of the smartest stock...While audio often gets overlooked in games, so much of the tone of the game is set by the audio that it's hard to do when speaking of Undying.  The audio engineers paid particular attention to the sound design of this title, as Undying employs great use of audio, from the well-acted voice work to creepy sound effects to the background music full of gothic chants, violin trills, and deep drum beats.  Undying takes full advantage of 3D sound setups, and you can tell where your foes are just by listening, making your ears equally as important as your eyes.  Many events, such as when to use your Scrye power, are triggered by eerie whispers or muffled voices, making the sound work in the game that much more important.All in all I was really impressed with Undying's style and gameplay.  Although it's a rather short single-player experience, I had a great time playing it through the first time and I'm already going through again to look for things I might have missed the first time.  Mechanically it's not the best shooter around, but the atmosphere and edge-of-your-seat suspense more than make up for the slightly awkward controls.  I can't think of a game that's made me feel so much suspense and freaked me out as much. If you're looking for a deep, chilling shooter with a lot of weapon and spell variety, you should be very happy with, as well as horrified by, Clive Barker's Undying.  -- Tal BlevinsAbout the Macintosh VersionLet me start this Macintosh review of Clive Barkers Undying with a big thanks to ASPYR and Westlake Interactive.  Without ASPYR, we  wouldn't have this game on the Mac, or other great titles like Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and the upcoming Jedi Knight II, to name a few.  The talented people at Westlake Interactive have done a great job working with ASPYR to make the gaming experience top-notch for us Mac gamers. If you want to see more great game titles brought to the Mac, support ASPYR and buy these games when they come out.For those of you new to Undying, here is the Cliffs Notes version of the story:  You are Patrick Galloway, gifted with an ability to use arcane magic and a trusty six-shooter in nineteenth century Ireland.  You are exploring the mansion of a friend who has asked you to help him discover the source of growing evil in and around his great estate. Your explorations will unfold a tale of mystical and dark powers that have corrupted your friends family and turned them against you. Your goal is to find clues to the origins of the dark magics, acquire spells and weapons to aid you in your quest, and stay alive, which  won't be easy.Based upon the Unreal engine, Undying will appear familiar to many gamers, but the design and game play here are very different that the first-person shooter experience in Unreal.   This single person game is more subtle and more story driven.  From a Mac perspective, you will want to use a two-button mouse, or a mouse with a scroll wheel or new scroll pad.  You are often using both of your characters hands to ward off oncoming evil and attack them at the same time.  The game really gets going after you leave the grounds of the mansion, and thats where you will start encountering so many different types of monsters and spirits that you will need your controls set up in a very orderly manner to properly switch spells, weapons, and inventory items in a split second and often all at the same time. I ran Undying on a B&W G3 350MHz (they recommend 400 MHz min) with Rage 128 Video card and 640MB of Ram (they recommend 96MB min), and the game is just this side of playable on OS 9.2.2, with many features turned down or off.  If you have a system close to this one, I strongly suggest turning all the details and shadows way down or off completely.  While the game seemed to run fine while fighting one or two monsters at a time, any more than that will severely tax a low-end system to the point of jumpy frames that can often get you killed.  Higher-end machines, particularly ones with nice new graphic cards, will see the full features of some nice texture work on this game.  I found I could save my game in OS 9 and switch over to OS X (10.1.5) and pick up the game where I last saved and keep going in the new OS. My initial impressions without running a frame-rate test made me feel that the game feels smoother in X than in 9, which may or may not be a question of optimization.  But it was especially nice to know that for anyone who hasnt upgraded to OS X yet, you can still start playing this game and know that you can keep going when you finally do switch, and you  don't  have to start over from scratch like Ive had to do with other older games.The sound effects and art really create a feeling of suspense as the game moves along, which kept me on the edge of  my seat. The ambiance of this game is terrific, with lots of convincingly spooky mansions, crumbling crypts, and murky underground sewers.  On the downside, the game play is a bit linear, and circumventing the intended path may leave you stuck or force you to spend too much time backtracking.On the whole, I really liked this game after I got used to the controls.  The levels are intriguing and well-designed, aside from a bit of the locked door syndrome that plays out a bit too often in the beginning of the game.  The weapons are fun, from pistols with silver bullets to Tibetan war cannons that shoot a sort of freeze ray. The spells are cool; I particularly like the Skull Storm, which I swear conjures the skull of Curly from the Three Stooges  (Hold down the activate key for a long time to see what I mean!).  Play this game with a two-button mouse and a good speaker system turned up to let the wonderful sounds of rumbling thunder, distant howls and insane laughter scare the Undying out of you.", "date": "Aug 13, 2002"}
