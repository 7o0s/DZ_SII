{"name": "Auto Assault", "name_review": "Auto Assault", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/02/auto-assault", "text": "Over the past few years, NCSoft has cultivated a clever strategy; while Lineage II is very popular outside of North America, they've been generally avoiding developing and publishing standard fantasy MMOs. Instead, we have City of Heroes, Guild Wars (with no monthly fee and gameplay that blends fast multiplayer action with CCG strategies), Tabula Rasa, and Auto Assault. For better or worse, AA isn't the ~Interstate '77 Online~ that many had initially envisioned -- a wasteland full of mutants, guns, and beefy cars. It has that, but in the end AA is more conventional than its trappings suggest. This isn't a bad thing, since it's a refreshing change from swords and sorcery. But you may find yourself wishing that Auto Assault had a little more depth and variety.   There's plenty of substance in the backstory -- the terrain and factions of AA aren't just pulled wholesale from Road Warrior or Mad Max. The Humans, Mutants, and Biomeks each have their own histories and overlapping conflicts. One-fourth of the manual is dedicated solely to talking about the world of Auto Assault from the perspectives of each faction. The humans went underground for decades to avoid the aftermath of the destruction they'd initiated. Those left on the surface turned into Mutants or Biomeks. The former is tribal and spiritual while the latter is militaristic and heavily modified by technology, as their name implies.     Unfortunately, most of the lore goes by the wayside, since little of it will affect the gameplay. The character classes are functionally identical across all three factions. You get different descriptions and titles tailored to the style of the faction, but class behavior is different only so far as racial abilities are different. For example, the Biomek vehicles have more hitpoints, the Humans get small energy shields, and the Mutants have some regeneration. Now, I don't necessarily expect one faction to operate differently from another. But if a fighter class is a fighter class is a fighter class, I think the game should be honest about that. If there are differences, like in say PlanetSide, then it makes sense for the class descriptions to read differently across each faction.   While faction choice mostly means the same game with three different sets of clothing, there is still a ton of game to be found no matter which group you choose to call your own. You'll be doing a load of collection, delivery, killing, and some recon quests, which you'll either find pleasingly accessible or frustratingly shallow and repetitive, depending on your tastes. If you're the type who likes to sit down for several hours and go questing, you'll probably be under whelmed. If you prefer something you can play for an hour, maybe two, without having to get committed to a particular activity to the point where you can't even risk getting up to answer your front door, then you might find AA more satisfying than World of Warcraft or EverQuest. Like WoW, quests can be managed solo for quite a while before you need to start grouping -- which is a good thing, because there aren't a whole lot of people playing. You can run around by yourself, picking up loot and shooting stuff, which is pretty fun as long as you don't go for more than a couple hours.     And unlike other MMOs I've played, Auto Assault encourages wanton destruction. When you're driving around, virtually every object in the world can be blown to bits. And this is actually practical as well as stress-relieving, since you'll often get rewarded with crafting ingredients. The mechanics of crafting will be pretty familiar to anyone who's tried it in other MMOs: create an item many times to increase your skill, up to a point where you have to find a more challenging item to increase your skill. However, AA's crafting system has prerequisites. Before you can craft devices like healing items or buffing items, you have to get to a certain level in one or more ~lower~ abilities, like creating armor or projectile weapons.    Eventually, you'll work your way down to some pretty exotic stuff. But it takes a while since some of the ingredients will be pretty exotic, and the game's low population doesn't facilitate trading of popular, obscure ingredients. You may have to spend a considerable time scavenging the wasteland, a problem that's complicated by a complete lack of health regeneration. Also, you'll find gear in the field and from mission rewards, to the point where crafting sometimes feels like wasted effort. At the beginning, you'll get training kits. But you quickly have to start reverse engineering items, or buying broken items at the salvage yard, to increase your skill. Unfortunately, a functional item doesn't indicate what ingredients it's made of, so you may break it down to increase your skill, only to find that you don't have the ingredients to put it together again (or a high enough crafting skill). Fortunately, you have a generally high chance of memorizing the item's ingredients and making it repeatedly, instead of having to constantly find and break things to increase your skill by single increments. Then again, the item can only be created from memory a few times before it just disappears from your list. I'm sure there's some reason for doing this, but it doesn't make a lot of sense in the game's context.     Sure, if you're a healer class, getting back to fighting shape is not a big deal. And if you chose the fighter class, you'll typically soak up a ton of punishment anyway. But if you choose something that requires more finesse, like the stealthy guy or the pet summoner, you'll find yourself having to stop short and run back to town for repairs. There's a wide variety of healing items out in the wasteland -- there just isn't a lot of them, and you'll be burning through them like Rolling Stones concert tickets when the action gets heavy. You can buy the items in town, but it's not an efficient way to spend your money. You can call in an aircraft that will perform a field repair, but it gets expensive and has a long timer. You can call that same aircraft to haul you back to town, which is much cheaper. But then you have to wander all the way back to where you started, and AA can have you ranging quite a ways from the warm comforts of those magical repair stations that dot the land.   You can physically avoid melee attacks, but good luck dodging projectiles or laser beams. Ranged attacks use bog-standard RPG dice rolls to determine hits and misses, no matter how crazily you're dancing around to avoid the next hit. So when you're getting hit from multiple enemies, often with damage over time, fun hits a brick wall as you start mentally tallying up how much breathing room there is until you have to bail out of the mission and go running back to town with your tail between your legs. Sure, you can bring a healer along, but only if you can find one online who's also near your level and interested in delving into the same location. Thankfully, there's no experience point penalty on death. You may believe that death penalties are ~meaningful~ and make the game more ~challenging.~ I prefer not to be punished for trying to ~have some fun.~     And as you might expect, the overwhelming majority of this combat takes place in a wasteland of broken towns, irradiated watering holes and barren landscapes. I would liked to have seen some violently defended oases, protected by hostile robots or people, or some subterranean areas; but almost all of what I saw was gloomy, dilapidated, and desperate. Moreover, there's little resemblance to real-world locations. The world of Auto Assault is an enormous slab of land that doesn't look like any particular region of the world. While this makes the game more accessible to an international audience, I suppose, it would have been neat to explore a post-apocalypse middle America, Europe -- pretty much any place that would have been affected by global disaster. Instead, the people and places are created from whole cloth and are thereby much less interesting than they could have been. This is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game for me, more than the relatively conventional MMO trappings of questing, crafting, leveling, and paper doll itemization. While it would be an intimidating task to replicate a post-WWIII Los Angeles or New York, it would have been nice to see just a few familiar landmarks or stretches of land.     In the long run, Auto Assault isn't as ambitious as I'd hoped, to the point where it feels incomplete and sometimes generic. The player towns are small and character models crudely animated. There's no spoken dialog, either incidental or story-oriented. Some areas of the game aren't very intuitive, like the locker or the crafting system; even when you have all the ingredients to make something, you might not have the skill level, and you need to refine or ~reverse refine~ parts by talking to a specific person who's not available in each town. When you have everything you need, you have to stand next to a specific building to create it. Car engines have to be crafted near a reactor, for example, and a weapon can only be crafted if you're standing near a fabrication plant. At first, it seems as though you're supposed to walk into those buildings, which created several minutes of frustration when I couldn't find a door to get in. Because there are no doors. You just stand next to it.     On the other hand, NetDevil took great pains to keep the player oriented and transported conveniently. You'll have waypoints for missions, a waypoint you can set yourself just by right-clicking on the map somewhere, and dots on the map that indicate a likely location for your objective. If you find yourself out in the hinterlands and want to get back to town quickly, you can call in an inexpensive airlift that will arrive in ten seconds. You can also use this airlift to move from town to town, which you'll be doing as the missions become more and more spread out. Once you complete the mission, you'll get another map marker showing you where the quest giver is, and they'll be highlighted by a tall, white light in town. You'll very rarely be confused about where you need to go or who you need to talk to. Although quest givers will retain that white light even when they have a mission that's far below your level, and there's no indication that a given person might have a quest for you in the future. I found myself stumbling upon missions just by returning to some towns I'd visited before.If Auto Assault's mission content had a little more substance, and if its geography had more familiarity, then its conventional MMO level grind template would probably be only a small annoyance. But there's little to mitigate its lower ambitions, and the player ends up with a game that doesn't feel like it's crossed the finish line yet. With its lack of distinctiveness, it becomes the post-apocalypse MMO for everyone... and no one in particular.", "date": "May 2, 2006"}
