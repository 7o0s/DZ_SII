You've got Army Men games on the PC, Nintendo 64, PlayStation...soon to be Army Men games on the Dreamcast -- and now, Army Men on the Game Boy. Thos little plastic men really get around, don't they? Digital Eclipse handled the Game Boy Color edition of 3DO's action series, and the team has pulled off an absolutely fine game on the handheld. It's more along the lines of the console versions of the game more than the PC strategy editions, but the way it's presented Army Men on the Game Boy Color is its own design. Just picture a game like Ikari Warriors and you've got a great idea of what to expect from Army Men.  Features More than 20 missions Bazookas, grenades, mortars, rifles. Drive in Tanks and Jeeps Password save Only for Game Boy Color  As a sole plastic hero, it's your duty to run through the games 20+ missions, wiping out the Tan soldier threats out to put nice, wide holes in that little PVC body of yours. Most missions revolve around the simple act of wandering through the overhead map, destroying every enemy soldier in the area. There are really only two types of soldier to worry about -- the gunner and the grenader. The gunner's only really a threat when in a group, since your body can take a good beating from a barrage of bullets. But getting hit by a grenade takes off more than half of your available health, so you're going to have to learn where these guys are hiding, and make sure you're never at the business end of their pineapples. But with weapons like bazookas, flamethrowers, mortars, and grenades to utilize, you'll have plenty of opportunity to smell the burning plastic of your enemies. And occasionally, you'll be able to jump into a tank or jeep and use a little   The design is basic, but a ton of fun since you get to run around like a maniac with a rifle, blowing away everything you see. But there's a bit of strategy involved. In some areas there's a path of hidden mines, the only way you're ever going to safely get through is if you locate the minesweeper to uncover these buried devils. And since you only have three weapon slots, you can't pick up everything you see -- you'll never be left without the proper tools, you'll just have to find the items and juggle what you think you'll need in the mission.   It has to be said, Army Men features the best sound engine ever produced on the Game Boy Color. Throughout the mission you're offered a very simple, but appropriate, digitized drum rhythm for the background music. Whenever you pick up a powerup, finish the mission, or fail in your duties, you hear the voice of either your character or mission control in incredibly clear digital audio. What's more, it never slows the animation down -- they really found the Game Boy Color's sound chip potential in this game, and we hope the engine is used in future games.  The control is the only real problem with Army Men, but if you give it a few minutes you'll understand why the game controls like a racing game. In the default control scheme, you press forward to run forward, no matter what direction you're facing. Pressing right and left rotates your character clockwise and counter clockwise. If you prefer the Ikari Warrior-style control scheme, Digital Eclipse offers it...but in my opinion it's absolutely worthless -- they didn't balance it at all, since you can only face eight directions...you can't target your opponents well at all. At least in the default setting, it's simply a matter of rotating your character properly. The game does offer the annoying ~sore thumb~ syndrome -- your character isn't exactly the fastest thing on two feet, and you'll be subconsciously pressing the joypad harder to try and get him to pick up the pace.  From the bad rep the Army Men series was getting on the Nintendo 64 and PC, I was a little reserved in playing the Game Boy Color game. But I was pleasantly surprised -- the portable game is a heck of a lot of fun to play. It's not entirely difficult since you can get hit plenty of times by gunfire and find a health pack nearby almost like clockwork -- but after two hours of straight play I only managed to get through half the available missions. I also wish there were more opportunities to drive the vehicles in the game -- I only found two jeeps in the first 12 missions. If 3DO is continuing the series on the Game Boy Color, we've got two suggestions: two-player link cable support, and more variety in the missions. Otherwise, it's a fine Game Boy Color product and worth picking up.", "date": "Mar 17, 2000"}
