With a few notable exceptions there's been a lack of quality role-playing games for the system. Blame the inherent restrictions of the cartridge-based format if you like, but having such an important genre all but ignored has driven many gamers to other platforms. Now, as the N64 nears its last days, publisher THQ and developer H2O have finally released their long-in-the-making Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage. Set in an ultra-traditional fantasy world of knights and mystical wizardry, this title had the potential to satisfy the cravings of the Dungeons and Dragons crowd. While Aidyn succeeds in its quest to deliver a massive 3D world, it lacks in far too many areas to make this a worthy purchase for all but the most dedicated of RPG fans.   Features  Traditional fantasy-based RPG gaming  Entirely 3D worlds   Journal entries and theater mode to help keep track of quests  Choose to level-up by category  Normal and High Resolution graphics modes  For one player only  Memory Pak saves only   Gameplay Aidyn Chronicles begins by introducing you to Alaron, a willful young squire with aspirations for knighthood. An orphan taken in by the King, Alaron's tendencies for rebelliousness and unpredictability constantly get him in trouble both in and out of the castle. As your quest begins, Alaron is in search of a missing farmer, who was last seen heading into the wilderness outside the castle gates. Soon, Alaron is overwhelmed by a band of goblins that attack him with poison arrows, and he falls unconscious. After a series of frightening visions, you awake to find a mysterious healer who has nursed you back to health, only to inform you that your recovery is only partial - a poison still lies within you that no one in your kingdom can cure. Returning to your castle, the King commands you to gather a band together and set out for a nearby realm in search of the antidote. But what of your disturbing visions and the increasing reports of foul creatures in the lands that lie outside the castle? Can Alaron stop the oncoming threat of evil that threatens the land before the poison in his system ends his young life?  The game alternates between a basic 'Trek Mode' in which players guide Alaron from place to place and 'Combat Mode' when he and his party encounter enemies. Alaron also meets many of the strange characters that populate the world he lives in, from simple villagers to inhuman races. Conversations range from brief to pivotal, and in many Alaron must choose his words carefully to affect the best outcome. There are few true platform elements to the Trek Mode, with only basic directional movement and no jump button to be found. Players can rotate the camera when necessary, and hold down the Z-button in order to sneak up on enemies. As Alaron nears an enemy, the game switches to 'Combat Mode', revealing all the characters in the party and any nearby foes.  For those who haven't read our previous coverage of this title, the quirky battle system of Aidyn Chronicles deserves some explaining. While the battles are essentially turn-based, it's mixed together with real-time elements. As players enter battle mode, a radar appears showing the party characters in green dots and enemies in red. Each character takes a turn moving in real-time around a ring of diamonds which marks the limits of a single turn. Your characters and the oncoming enemies move towards one another until their rings finally merge. The size of the ring varies depending on the speed of your character and whether they are already engaged in direct combat with a foe. When combat finally occurs, there's no selection of moves to chose from; players simply tap the A-button to perform their primary attack. Magic-based attacks (and the use of potions) are available by pressing the C-up and down buttons and offer a more robust set of options.  The battle system is cumbersome at best, but it does allow players a greater range of offensive and defensive strategies. Quicker characters who can run behind an enemy and stab them in the back can often incur greater damage than a forward assault. After players have struggled their way through enough encounters, the battle system becomes more useable, but combat always feels as though it stutters when it should flow. Another frustration is that at the beginning of each battle your characters tend to start out at unpredictable distances from one another, forcing players to spend several opening moves gathering them back together in order to attack as a single unit. On the whole it's still as awkward and dissatisfying as it was in the earlier version that IGN tested. Worst of all is the fact that there is no proper training sequence to walk players through the basics of gameplay. Instead, players simply have to stumble through the battle system and experience points/character attributes system on their own. The instruction booklet and in-game help menus provide the minimum information necessary to play, but an actual training sequence is always preferable in such a complex game.  As with most 'traditional' RPGs, each triumphant battle earns your characters experience points, which you can use to increase their various attributes of intelligence, willpower, dexterity, endurance, strength, and stamina. In a unique twist, players can actually pay for training from specific merchants and tradesmen, exchanging a combination of cash and experience points to learn specialized skills. Players also collect gold and various items on their journeys, amassing wealth, unique weapons, and spells. Throughout your journey, new members come and go from your party, adding a welcome variety to the gameplay. Unfortunately, players have no say in which characters leave when a new member is added.  The world of Aidyn Chronicles itself is surprisingly detailed, with huge castles, sprawling forests, and bustling villages. But while almost every structure and room is accessible, too many of them hold nothing for players to find. No treasures, no enemies, no information to glean from non-player characters, but Alaron and his crew are forced to search them all the same. It is in essence, a vacant world. It leads to a lot of time wasted with nothing in return, lulling players into a monotonous daze. We consumed close to an hour searching empty rooms in the castle while trying to gather our initial party and properly begin the game. Hardcore RPGers with an unwavering love for the genre and the patience to match may be pulled into the epic plot and immense world, but most gamers will find the tedious pacing too slow to enjoy.   Graphics If Aidyn's gameplay is an acquired taste, its visuals are a bitter coating that only makes the game that much harder to swallow. Character models of even major characters are so short on polygons that they look almost freakishly deformed. H20 chose to render enormous environments in real time, with all the fogging, choppy framerates, and pop-up that comes with them. Even with the Expansion Pak, the High Resolution mode is only that much worse than Low Resolution (and the 'High Color' mode has - thankfully - been cut completely). Due to awkward level design and the fact that the textures offer so little differentiation, it's far too easy for players to become disoriented in Aidyn Chronicles. The compass offers some assistance, but the maps are too short on details to be of much use. Approaching enemies are almost impossible to detect due to the draw-in problems, and so the only way to avoid unwanted battles is to attempt to flee them (an action which can only be selected from within the menu system). Far too many of the polygons in even major characters are poorly matched and suffer from clipping. Add to all these problems a twitchy camera, which is overly sensitive to your characters' movements. It rotates wildly with every move Alaron makes and has a bad habit of flipping to meaningless, ultra-close zooms of random objects during important cut-scenes. However, there are nice touches like the subtle shift from night into day and frequent rains which add atmosphere to the game  Sound Aidyn Chronicles features a sparse, if adequate soundtrack. The musical tracks vary nicely from area to area and pump dramatically when you engage in battle. Footfalls, wolf howls, and other ambient sounds also help create atmosphere, but the overall effect is far from rich. While the music is suitable for each situation, too much of the game is spent with no musical accompaniment at all. With the frequently long stretches spent between encounters, the sound of your own footsteps can grow old quickly. All of the sound work fits nicely into the Aidyn Chronicles world, but it's spread out too thinly to add much to the game.Why, oh why have the N64's traditional RPG fans been forced to spend years waiting hopefully, only to be stuck with a game like this? Yes, this is an old-school fantasy RPG. Yes, you get to spend hours upon hours gaining experience points and leveling-up in hopes of creating an unbeatable party of characters. Yes, there is a massive, epic journey ahead for those who have the patience for the slowly developing story. But far too much of the game simply clunks along, obscuring the positive aspects in a haze of fog, blocky character models, and stuttering framerates. The battle system is the key to any good RPG, and Aidyn Chronicles' awkward combat system barely serves its purpose.If you are a diehard RPG fan who just can't live without Aidyn Chronicles, you'll probably learn to forgive its many flaws for the rewarding depth it offers. But personally, I'd rather spend my time on another game that's easier on the eyes and less trying on my patience - ANY other game", "date": "Apr 17, 2001"}
