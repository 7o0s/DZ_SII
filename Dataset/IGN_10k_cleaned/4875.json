Their early adventures, before they were mistakenly granted voices, included some of the best slapstick moments in animation history. Watching the two mortal enemies work each other over with household objects was a riot, and some of that charm has managed to make it into Macrospace's new Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase.   Features:   Maze madness  Grab power-iup items like hammers   Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase is essentially Pac-Man with a cat and mouse. Actually, with the isometric view, it's more Pac-Mania.   As Jerry, you must run around the maze picking up pieces of cheese that are subbing for pellets. There are no power pellets, per se -- but Jerry occasionally picks up power-ups that help him ward off the always advancing Tom. These power-ups include a hammer that can bonk Tom on the noggin, or a banana peel that trips him up temporarily.   A game like this lives or dies based on two factors: control and AI. Here's where Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase is a split decision. The control wasn't very tight, as Jerry sometimes missed turns at T-sections. Pressing the pad to turn just as Jerry passes the alley (as in Pac-Man) doesn't work. You have to press the pad to turn just prior to it -- and that takes some getting used to.    As for AI, Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase fares better. Just like in the old 'toons, Tom is not dumb. Sure, in the first few rounds the ol' cat isn't a brainiac, but after several boards, he gets pretty good at cornering you into a dead-end you have to slip down for that last bit of cheese. So, you must keep one step ahead of Tom if you want to survive later boards. If there's one bit of remaining cheese in a corner, lure him away before going for it.   Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase looks fine. It's bright and colorful, just like you would expect of a game based on a cartoon. The sprites for Tom and Jerry are big and detailed and they move with fine animation. There is a constant looping soundtrack that neither charms nor grates  Tom and Jerry: Cheese Chase is recommended for fans of both the show and Pac-Man. If you couldn't stand the isometric Pac-Mania, though, then steer clear. There are some slight control issues that must be overcome before you pick up cheese like a pro, but once you have it in your head you need to ~pre-turn,~ you'll find yourself having a reasonably good time -- and for just a few bucks.", "date": "Aug 3, 2004"}
