While a few of the N-Gage titles boasted near-PlayStation quality graphics, they also featured gameplay and controls that felt outdated and ill-suited to the new handheld. With only six titles to choose from, gamers felt short-changed as some of the most highly anticipated games didn't make the launch. One of the most sorely missed launch games was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, which is now being shipped to retailers a week after launch. It may be a little late for the launch party, but it will give players a reason to celebrate as it is the single most enjoyable N-Gage title to date.   Features N-Gage Arena play Two-player wireless challenges Five game modes Ten playable pro skaters Music from popular bands Impressive 3D graphics  Gameplay When Tony Hawk first hit the scene on the PlayStation One, it changed the way people played and designed skating games. It successfully recreated all the exhilaration of skating and served it up from the vantage point of the couch, where countless players trained their thumbs to perform amazing acrobatic feats. We feared that the excitement of Tony Hawk might be lost in its transition to the N-Gage, but thankfully developers Ideaworks 3D! have ported Tony to the handheld with much success. Now as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater debuts on the Nokia N-Gage, players can take their skilled thumbs back to the streets for a digital skating exhibition.  The highpoint in Tony Hawk is the freedom it offers gamers to skate wherever they want, come up with their own trick combos, and wreak enough havoc to leave the most insatiable misfit feeling content. Tony Hawk has five different play modes to choose from, which range from multiplayer, online, career mode, single session, and free skating.  The first mode players should become acquainted with is the free skate mode. In this mode there is no restricting time limit, and no mission objective to worry about, just you, your board, and your favorite skating location. This is an excellent way to practice tricks and learn the limitations of your skater. Some skaters are better suited for vert skating, and can catch enough air to pull off more than a half dozen tricks high above the ground. Other skaters thrive closer to the ground, grinding and pulling off street style tricks. The variety of available skaters gives players the ability to match their character to their individual tastes, and allows for mastery of multiple styles.   The courses in Tony Hawk are the stuff skaters' dreams are made of. Each course is brilliantly designed and offers a seemingly endless supply of objects to grind on, and jump off of. Courses offer plenty of variety and are accessible to beginners and experts alike. While a newbie might see a ramp and land a single trick from it, an expert would know that much more lies beyond that ramp and could perform a chain reaction of skating feats, from ramp, to rail, to pipe, to pool, racking up major points along the way. This excellent learning curve is present throughout the game, and ensures that a player never gets frustrated with a challenge being too hard, or too easy.   Tony Hawk also takes advantage of the N-Gage's cool wireless (simultaneous) two-player capabilities, and offers some very fun and competitive challenges. Multiplayer modes include Tag, Graffiti, Trick Attack, Horse Play, and Skate Race, all of which put two players in a head-to-head battle of skills. Multiplayer games are very fun considering both players are at a similar skill level, but if a novice challenges an expert there are no handicap options to balance things out.     Along with wireless BlueTooth full-screen multiplayer, Tony Hawk also supports N-Gage Arena play. This is a great place to turn if you want a little friendly competition from other Tony Hawk fans from around the globe. You can participate in the Trick Sprint competition, and race against the recorded data of other players to claim bragging rights. Anyone new to the Tony Hawk games should practice hard before entering in the Trick Sprint challenge -- there is definitely some very stiff competition out there. The single-player game's learning curve is out the window here; it's every skater for himself. There's also a very useful strategy mode, where players can get help with mission objectives as well as learn where to pull off the best tricks. A welcome addition to a tried-and-true PS One classic, the N-Gage Arena mode is a great place to showcase your own skills and pick up a few new ones.  Controlling Tony Hawk on the N-Gage is initially a little more challenging than its PlayStation counterpart, but feels more natural with a little practice. The difference is that the action buttons are smaller than the PS One buttons, and are closer together. Still, button placement works well on the N-Gage, as actions are centered around the middle (five) button, used for gaining speed and jumping, flip tricks are to the left of it (the four button), grabs are to the right (the six), and grinding is above (the one button). This allows access to all of the action buttons with a rocking motion of the thumb. Controls are effective, but don't instantly mesh with the player.   While the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a classic and will be an instant hit with those new to the series, Tony Hawk veterans might be put off by the age of the title. Since its release on the PlayStation in 1999, there have been numerous sequels in the franchise with extra content and subtle improvements over the original (manuals, most notably -- and too bad a skate park editor couldn't have been included), and by comparison make this version feel a bit outdated.   Comparisons to PlayStation sequels aside, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on the N-Gage is very fun, and the most accurate portable recreation of the skating game that started it all.  Graphics Tony Hawk offers some of the most impressive visuals yet on the N-Gage. With very big 3D environments, well-developed character models, and believable animations, players may believe this version is identical to its PlayStation counterpart. Only when you look at the two games side-by-side can you really see the differences in the two games. While the N-Gage version is slightly more jagged, has more draw-in, and doesn't have as high a framerate as the PlayStation game, the two look very similar.  In addition to the gameplay visuals, there are also full motion video (FMV) clips of the bands heard in the game for the player's watching pleasure. These are unlocked as you progress through the game, and showcase the N-Gage's ability to play video clips.   Skaters are subjected to very realistic, and painful looking game physics. When suffering a bad landing, characters slide and tumble along the floor with arm-flailing, limb-tangling realism. The essence of a painful landing has been accurately captured in Tony Hawk, and the occasional shower of blood serves well to punctuate it.   While maybe not as pretty as the PlayStation version, Tony Hawk remains to be a looker on the N-Gage.  Sound What would skating be if you couldn't do it to the angry and occasionally violent tunes of punk masters like The Dead Kennedys, and The Vandals. Tony Hawk sports one of the coolest and most skate-friendly soundtracks around. The fast-paced music is perfect to pump the player up for high-scoring run, or just to set the mood for destruction.   As the music plays in the background, your skater's yells and dull grunting accentuate it when they fall victim to the occasional nosedive, and faceplant. Cheering audiences also come into play in competition levels and let you know when you are kicking butt, or getting you butt kicked. Sound quality isn't as good as the PlayStation Tony Hawk, but even without the endowment of a CD drive, the N-Gage packs an impressive amount of music on a single game card. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater comes as a much needed addition to the N-Gage's library of games. It is without a doubt the N-Gage's finest game so far, and the most accurate portable recreation of the original PlayStation classic. It's hard to get tired of this game with its numerous multiplayer modes, online features, timeless Free Skate mode, and extensive Career Mode, but some people may be put off in playing the oldest version of Tony Hawk when the series offers more than four newer sequels on home consoles. While Tony Hawk is over four years old, it remains a must-buy for anyone unfamiliar with the series and anyone who is interested in having a version of the classic skating game that fits in their pocket.", "date": "Oct 16, 2003"}
