{"name": "Final Fantasy XI Online", "name_review": "Final Fantasy XI", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/23/final-fantasy-xi-8", "text": "Since its announcement in January of 2000, Final Fantasy XI has probably been one of the PlayStation 2's biggest wild cards -- a title that some questioned would ever see release in North America as plans for a localized hard drive seemed to increase and diminish with regularity. But even if the game were to make it to our shores how would it hold up to consumer anticipation? How would it compare to other more established massively multiplayer RPGs that had dominated the PC market for years? How would a classically lonesome fan base react to moving their passion to an online world? And most importantly, how faithful to the Final Fantasy universe would this online experiment really be?   Questions aside, transforming the identity of the most successful role-playing franchise on the planet is an enormous undertaking. In fact, changing the focus of any videogame sequel regardless of its status in popularity is a difficult assignment. Daunting as that fact may be, that's exactly the challenge given to Square Enix's veteran creative team of Hiromichi Tanaka, Koichi Ishii, Masato Kano, and Ken Narita when they were handed the reigns of the anticipated Final Fantasy XI more than four years ago. And though the individuals mentioned above have tackled some of the most beloved projects in all of console history (Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, and Final Fantasy VII to name but a few), none of them had ever attempted a title as epic as what lay before them. And none of them could likely imagine how important its release has truly turned out to be.   And yes, despite what you may have heard, an encouraging reception for Final Fantasy XI is absolutely essential. It's the crown jewel for Sony's $100 plug-in device and the benchmark that dictates the peripheral's North American future. Resident Evil Outbreak and Gran Turismo 4's combined support will do little else but supply hard drive owners with an appreciated bonus, where Final Fantasy XI positively needs the HDD in every respect. It even ships with the thing with no availability outside of the bundle. So if Sony and other developers are to continue down a similar path in the coming seasons, FFXI has to succeed with blockbuster-like numbers.    Luckily for all those involved, Final Fantasy XI has the potential to do just that. With its expansive focus, enormous environments, and unique premise to console owners, the game could definitely usher in a new era for box users. And while the game itself may not be the greatest MMORPG in existence (nor the strongest PlayStation 2 role-player), it doesn't halt the fact that FFXI is fun -- and when you need to sell a whole lot of product, fun is a great place to start.   Installation and PlayOnline  Final Fantasy XI uses the hard drive completely. As once you've installed the software onto the disc it's there permanently with no need to re-use the DVD again. For those of us who want to look at everything, however, the FFXI portion of the set does contain a nifty six-minute introduction movie that serves as the backdrop for the world of Vana'diel. It's a terrific piece of CGI animation too, and everybody who picks the up the game owes it to himself to check it out. The second disc is actually the more important one, though: as it sports all the PlayOnline goodies which, for those of you who are unfamiliar with it, is the online subscription service powered by Square Enix.    Due to security reasons, the PlayOnline CD is still required to be in your system the first time you power up the hard drive. The reason being that it's the utility that allows players to setup their network connections and finalize the installation of a few extras. Let it be known that as soon as you connect to the Internet, you'll have to immediately download the latest patches (PlayOnline ver.1.13.00 and Final Fantasy XI ver.20040305_0 as of this writing) which can take anywhere from ten minutes on a fast connection to all day long on a dial-up modem. Once the patches have been downloaded and everything has been updated, players will have to create an online id for themselves and register their products. This process should take no more than half an hour if you have a USB keyboard and maybe 45 minutes if you're using the onscreen GUI. It's fast, efficient, and user-friendly.   If players have never connected to the PlayOnlineservice via the PC Version of Final Fantasy XI before, then they're actually in for a treat. Far more than just a simple connection hub for FFXI and Tetra Master (more on that later), it's also an email server, a wallpaper download center and a chat utility. Additionally, gamers will need to use instant messenger and chat features to set up their buddy lists for in-game meetings and can even send out greeting cards for special occasions. It's entirely customizable too, with a long list of aspects that you can change and alter (including background music, sound effects, and appearance) and it definitely has a lot of potential for users in the future.   Though we have to admit that it's a mystery to us as to why the option to build a buddy list inside the game is so poorly put together. Unless you have someone walk you through the process, you'd think the process of adding friends you've met in Vana'diel to your catalog involves logging out of the game, finding them through PlayOnline, sending a request, and waiting for them to get back to you with the okay. There should be an ~add buddy~ icon somewhere on the list rather than having to play name tag (you can do it in-game, it isn't very clear). But at least the rest of PlayOnline's setup is better: with the latest news bulletins, server downtime information, and customer service support all entirely assessable from one handy menu. Best of all, the connect times are both smooth and fast on dial-up and broadband modems alike.    The Four Cities  If there's a single high-quality trait that all Final Fantasy titles are known for, it's their storylines. And while most persistent online RPGs are almost always devoid of story (steeped in lore yes, but legitimate plot threads? Rarely), Final Fantasy XI has been designed to excite new and old fans with its narrative-heavy backdrop. That said, franchise loyalists who have never played an online role-player before will probably find themselves disappointed with the amount of plot-related progression; as it's nowhere near as overt or in your face as what's found in typical Final Fantasies of the past. But that doesn't mean that there isn't a multitude of signature content just waiting to be found anyway. Crystals, Moogles, Chocobos, Marlboros, and just about every other familiar element of the series have been included in some form or another, and even the world-famous Cid makes an appearance as an engineer that provides story-related missions for your character.   The story itself is purposely veiled in mystery and follows the aftermath of a great war that took place twenty years ago. Following the battle of Light vs. Dark, an evil race of Beastmen took control of Vana'diel only to lose their grip over the last two decades. It seems that a normal everyday existence is returning to its native people once again as the various races seize control of their properties. But as more and more people flock to the cities and the Beastmen slink away in apparent retreat, new questions arise: Will the racial hatred that separated the various peoples of Vana'diel generations ago resurface? Will one of the newly empowered nations use its position to create an all-new worldwide empire of its own? Or is the Beastmen army planning something more sinister that what they've accomplished before? It's with these questions that Final Fantasy XI begins.    Now even the most committed players out there can expect quite a long journey ahead of them in order to find the answers they're looking for. As each and every one of Square Enix's 30 dedicated severs are packed with different political situations among the four main kingdoms. But regardless of who's in control when gamers first log on, the world's four main parties are always the same: The Kingdom of San D'oria, The Republic of Bastok, The Federation of Windhurst, and The Grand Duchy of Jeuno specifically. Though each kingdom will hold a different position in the struggle for power depending on which server your character plays (don't worry, you can change servers if you purchase a special item known as ~The World Pass~), they're almost always the same initially. San D'oria, for instance, is heavily populated with Elvaan royalty while the republic of Bastok is home to an interesting mix of Hume and Galka mine workers. Each region has its advantages and disadvantages to various character classes and races too, but it's up to the player to change how those influences are handled.   In fact, that's the whole purpose to Final Fantasy XI: taking control of the world in the name of your country. Though more specific storyline elements are eventually revealed (like the reason the Beastmen attacked in the first place, what's happening among the more important members of the government, and so on), it's the quest for your expansion that truly powers your character. Especially if you want to see the CG cut scenes and become immersed in what FFXI has to offer. Should you just decide to wander the countryside killing Moon Bats and Diving Beetles for experience and items, however, you can do that too.    Interface  With a game as big and complicated as Final Fantasy XI is, a solid interface is a powerful component towards making it work. And very much to our liking, Square Enix has ended up doing a wonderful job of creating just that: a manageable and intuitive GUI system for PS2 users of all backgrounds. Nearly identical to the PC version in every way, the console edition of FFXI provides players with tons of information while simultaneously supporting it with an elegant presentation. Players who have already enjoyed the game on their Windows XP system should also be happy to note that all the same commands and shortcuts that worked in their version work here as well -- with full USB keyboard and mouse support for those that prefer PC devices to Dual Shocks.   But even if gamers don't have access to USB keyboards and Mice, the Dual Shock controller works just fine. Though it does suffer from some speed issues when trying to give commands and attack enemies simultaneously, an eventual mastery of the embedded Macro system should remedy that after a few hours. And while it's true that the absence of letter-specific keys may limit how easily users are able to perform some of their more interesting character commands (laughing, crying, and saluting as examples), the important stuff -- attacking, casting spells, moving, and talking -- can all be initiated with just a few button presses. In the end, that's really all that matters.   Ideally, though, most PS2 owners will want to invest in one of those specialty controllers built specifically with MMORPGs in mind. Nyko's iType2 controller is a good choice for gamers willing to spend fifty bucks on a Dual Shock clone with a keyboard attached; while Logitech's NetPlay peripheral is an even better choice for twenty bones more. In fact, playing Final Fantasy XI with the NetPlay is so enjoyable and useable that it's hard to go back to any other combination afterwards (even PC users have to appreciate the advantage of having keyboard commands as a supplement to 3D analog movement). Rarely has the navigation in an online RPG felt so good.    But as easy as it is to speak with party members, manage your inventory, and give battle commands, Final Fantasy XI's interface does suffer from a couple of curious problems. Its targeting system, in particular, can be mysteriously wonky when cycling through doorways, portals, enemies, and NPCs. Even when hitting the X button, F8, or F9 (the commands used for targeting the closest CPU and human characters), the game will oftentimes mysteriously target something else at a greater distance. It doesn't sound like that big a deal in the beginning, but when you're in an area that's filled with an abundance of characters where time is of the essence, it can get frustrating to have to keep cycling through a couple of different people you weren't initially targeting in the first place.   Of course, the other big interface problem is the one we mentioned earlier regarding the building of buddy lists. It should have been an immediate in-game priority to make adding newly found friends to their directory as user-friendly as possible. But with the tool that allows you to do so buried in the chat feature, we can't help but find ourselves baffled. Hopefully this will be addressed in future patches and upgrades.   Races and Jobs  Like any online role-player, the world of Final Fantasy XI is defined by the people that play it; and Square Enix has provided its user base with plenty of options to prove that. In all, there are five different racial classes with two gender-neutral types and the ability to select male or female alter egos for the remaining three. Each of these ethnicities is gifted with certain strengths and weaknesses too, and can make fine additions to any party regardless of their origin. From our time spent with the PC version and now the PlayStation 2 edition, however, it appears that the Hume characters are still the predominant race of choice for most players (which makes sense, since they're the most well-rounded with no real strength or weakness in any direction). Simply put, the Humes are terrific starting characters for gamers that want to jump right in and go.    Beyond the normal human type class, though, is where your character selection becomes more interesting. The proud and slender race of Elvaan, for instance, can make strong overall characters -- even if their powerful magical attributes come at the price of low MP. The Cat-like Mithra, on the other hand, is incredibly fast and graceful and makes for an ideal base for players hung up on the thief and ranger mentality. Then we have the childish-looking Tarutaru, who are easily the best choice for would-be magic users and those who avoid conflict. Finally, we come to the brutish Galka; a huge imposing race that make effective tank characters for the warrior class. But regardless of which race you choose all of them are as balanced and different that we've seen in a game of this type.   Final Fantasy XI's real source of possibility, however, lay within its job selection. Initially limited to six types (Warrior, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, and Thief), the palette is already broad from the outset. And unlike most MMORPGs in recent memory, these various classes legitimately do play differently from job to job. So while you'll probably feel more than comfortable running into a battle with your enormous Galkan Warrior, you'll be a lot less likely to do so with your Tarutaru White Mage. Gamers have to play their characters just as they would in reality (yes, there really ARE such things as Tarutarus) and it adds a nice degree of skill and strategy to the approach.    But what makes these classes even better is the fact that you can change jobs at any time. Simply return to your house (called a Mog House) at any point in your adventure and tell your little floating helper you want a new profession. So while you may begin your existence as a Red Mage, you may opt instead to become a Thief; only later to be transformed once again into a Monk. Luckily, all those abilities learned will stay with your character permanently should you ever decide to switch back once again -- eliminating the need to re-level up a class after you've already exploited it.   Of course, once players fulfill certain requirements they'll also have the ability to take on sub-jobs. A secondary class of sorts, these sub-jobs will allow users to be even more powerful by providing them with abilities from both classes. As an example, a player that selects a Level 40 Warrior as their primary class and a level 40 thief as their sub-job will effectively be a Level 40 Warrior/Level 120 Thief. Not only will they have all the that powers their primary class, they'll also gain attribute boosts in certain categories as well.   If that doesn't sound like enough character customization, it gets even more intense later on in the adventure once you pass the 30th level. Upon doing so, you'll open up the possibilities of learning nine more hidden classes -- with the Bard, Beastmaster, Dark Knight, Dragoon, Ninja, Paladin, Ranger, Samurai, and Summoner all selectable professions. These new classes are particularly powerful, with our personal favorite weighing in as the Paladin; aka ~the tank with a healing ability.~ In terms of making your character as personal as possible, Final Fantasy XI passes with flying colors.   Quests, Skills, and Guilds   Though players can do absolutely anything they want over the course of their adventure, they can make a much more interesting time of it by accepting quests, joining guilds, and heading off on government-sponsored missions. It's through these actions only that users will be able to locate all the best treasures, fight all the biggest monsters, and move the storyline in a forward direction. To be truthful, it's the mission and quest structure where Final Fantasy XI probably fails to live up to its predecessors the most. Because, while its attitude and design are very much in the spirit of the games before it, the majority of its quests involve little else but running out and fetching items and moving them from point A to point B. Granted, that's always been one of the most tedious aspects of the MMORPG universe but we were hoping for a little more diversity.    That's not to say that Square Enix doesn't try to make the fetch quests more interesting, though. In one mission set in Bastok, for instance, the government asks you to destroy a colony of Quadav invaders from the Palborough Mines. But rather than just run down there and slaughter everything that moves and be done with it, you have to return to your superior with proof of your victory in the form of body parts. In another mission set in San D'oria, players will actually have to grow a certain type of flower in a gardening pot in order to learn an interesting secret about their home. Sure the missions aren't groundbreaking, but at least there was an effort made to mask it.   One aspect that we did have a lot of fun with, however, was the skill system. Available for use among the various guilds found in every town, the confines of your Mog House, or performed simply by doing them on the spur of the moment, the skill and craft ability allows players to further grow their character in ways outside of combat. Blacksmithing, alchemy, cooking, leatherworking, and a myriad of other such talents provide players with the means to create new items and upgrade their existing equipment. Some of them are even given particular mini-games like the gardening we mentioned earlier as well as the ability to fish and destroy rocks via mining. These skills won't transform you in this world's version of Kefka no, but they're just a few more extras that will keep you playing even longer.    Combat and Exploration  The world of Vana'diel is enormous. Already huge to begin with, the inclusion of the Rise of the Zilart expansion pack makes it even bigger. And we do mean big. From the Jugner Forests of Norvallen to the Pashhow Marshlands of Derfland, there isn't a bigger game available for the PlayStation 2 in terms of virtual square mileage -- and there probably never will be. Because of the sheer size of this world, however, it can sometimes get rather tedious trekking from one spot to another; especially in the early going. Because of this long traveling time, you're going to want to power up to level 20 as soon as possible (it's the required stage needed to earn your Chocobo's license) or better yet, save up Gil for teleportation. It's important to find alternate methods of transportation too, because unless you're wiling to invest the fifteen to forty minutes it takes to trek across some of the valleys that separate destinations, you'll likely grow frustrated (and we're not even counting the time spent from fighting enemies). Of course, there are other means of getting around other than teleport spells and Chocobos as well (airship anyone?), but unless your level is particularly high you can forget about using those privileges for a while.   Because of the likelihood that not everyone will be using Chocobos, you'll need to learn the right times and wrong times to join forces with another party. After all, having to travel several miles on foot isn't so bad if you have three or four Dark Knights watching your back. Of course, going from point A to point B and trying to keep your weaker party members alive the whole time isn't exactly enjoyable either. It's this slight aspect of strategy to forming alliances that makes your decisions as a leader (or a follower) so very important. Make the wrong call and you could find yourself either dead, or perpetually waiting for your newbie friends to catch up.    Make no bones about it, though; you will have to join up with other people if you're going to make it through the tougher areas -- particularly if you want to level up fast and defeat your enemies quickly. Using a system called Skillchaining, Final Fantasy XI allows its characters to perform their specialized weapon skill abilities in succession. Obtainable every ten or so levels, these skills are basically more powerful moves that are awarded for improving in certain job classes and are several times more powerful than a regular attack. Once going, you can do some pretty serious damage with the Skillchain -- wiping out just about anything that gets in your way with bigger parties (as many as 18 if form alliances with other groups) wrecking serious havoc. Luckily, Square Enix has employed a nice bit of balancing so that players can't abuse it and have restricted skillchains to certain requirements. Not only will players need to find the right combination of compatible skills in order to activate the chain, they'll also have to time their attacks precisely (roughly three seconds apart).   But skillchains are only a small segment of a much larger combat engine, as there is a whole mess of different factors to consider. Delays between weapon strikes, technique points (used for weapon skills), status ailments, magic points, and determining what elements to use on certain enemies are all constantly evolving decisions. When facing off against a gigantic boss monsters specifically, you'll need to employee every single technique and tactic you've learned in order to gain a victory -- if you're good enough to actually slay one of the mighty beasts then you should pat yourself on the back, because you earned it; as the bosses in this game are incredibly difficult. What's worse, is that if you're killed in battle you lose a percentage of your experience to the next level -- even resulting in the possible drop of a level if you're slain too close to an increase. Those are high stakes (and yet another reason players will have to care about their character).    Sadly, the battle system isn't everything it could be. For one, combat is entirely automatic -- all you have to do is select your target and let the computer act our whatever commands you give it while the delay number figured into your weapon determines the next moment you can strike. It would have been a lot more interactive and rewarding had the combat engine been more similar to the PS2's other persistent online RPG EverQuest Online Adventures and allowed you to initiate every strike on your own (or at least given you the option to choose between them).   Additionally, there are no advantages for high ground or low ground positioning for heroes or enemies alike, and when it comes to something like back attacks, sneak attacks, and the like, there just isn't any such thing (with the only exception being the Thief's job skill at level 15). In short, if you circle around and enemy and hit it on the back of its neck, it's no different than if you hit from the front -- and what's even more interesting is, that if you're behind and enemy and it swings its weapon at the blank space in front of it, it will still somehow hit you while behind it. Woudln't it have been so much more advantgaeous if your positioning helped dictate your damage?   Another sore spot for us was the A.I. Though it is strong in some areas (certain enemies attack based on their various sense), it can also be rather weak in others. It's not uncommon to run into a group of savage barbarian lixard guys only to have them stand around like you're not even there. Then seemingly out of nowhere, a little party of bats comes along and starts attacking. Call it a misuse of Hate (an emnity that encourages enemies to focus on you) or an intesting way of handling each monster's attack techniques, it still feels a little out of place. And yet the game still somehow remains incredibly fun and enjoyable.    Graphics  Hopeful PS2 owners that think that the console version of Final Fantasy XI will match the PC rendition in terms of visual quality should prepare to get their hopes crushed. Lacking any type of progressive scan support (though it does cater to 16:9 televisions), the game's one and only default resolution is the standard 640x480 (the Windows burn boasts almost twice that). That's not to say that Final Fantasy XI doesn't look particularly strong for a PlayStation 2 title, though, because it does. Particularly when battling it out against some of the more detailed boss monsters or exploring the smaller-in-scope sections of the world. It may not be on the same level of quality as Final Fantasy X or X-2, but it's a hell of a lot better looking than PS2 owner's other MMORPG alternative, EverQuest.   On the PC, FFXI's draw distance is an impressive feat. On the PS2, you could say that it's almost more impressive once you consider the textures and objects being processed on the inferior PlayStation 2 architecture. That said, players should still expect a generous amount of pop-up, draw-in, and other graphical glitches deep into the horizon as the game tries to keep up with everything that's going on. Good as it may be, there are some instances where the world is just too big for its own good. The same can be said for the framerate in spots as well, as cities in particular are the most prone to bouts of slowdown. On a more positive front, there are tons of different particle effects, lighting techniques, and shadowing going on at practically all hours and the occasional CG cut scenes are of the same high quality that Square Enix fans have come to expect. All in all, FFXI still boasts one of the most impressive graphical engines on the system.    Sound  We've certainly heard stronger scores in the life of the Final Fantasy series, but the joint collaboration of Nobuo Uematsu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Kumi Tanioka is still of strong caliber. More upbeat and synthesizer heavy than the tracks found in pre-X2 titles, the soundtrack supplements XI's theme of discovery, exploration, and progress very eloquently. We only wish that there were a few more memorable themes outside the introductory piece played in the background of the CG intro -- as it doesn't seem to get any better than that one.   Final Fantasy XI's audio effects, on the other hand, are absolutely brilliant. Recorded in Dolby Digital (DD5.1 for cut scenes) for the highest quality, every clank of the sword, slash of the knife, and crunch of the gravel has been brought to life with compelling accuracy. Though it should be said that players who enjoyed the vocal-heavy audio tracks of Final Fantasy X and X-2 may be disappointed to learn that voice-over in this follow-up has been limited to cut scenes only.Closing CommentsFinal Fantasy XI is probably a bigger love it or hate it game than even Final Fantasy X-2 was. Though it aims its sights high on enticing fans of the franchise to the online side of the pond, the fact remains that MMORPGs just aren't for everyone. Truthfully, some people are just more content sitting at home and curling up with their controller much in the same way that others do with a good book or tasty dessert. They simply don't want their Final Fantasy experience any other way.With that in mind, Final Fantasy XI is also one of the single most significant releases in the history of the PlayStation 2. Regardless of how many massively multiplayer games came before it and after, nothing this big, this ambitious, or this good has ever graced a home console before -- that's pretty important. And while EverQuest Online Adventures attempted the feat itself near the end of 2002, the differences between the two games are certain: EverQuest was an above-average port of a legendary PC title, while Final Fantasy XI is an excellent original experience made specifically for this audience. And at $12.95 a month (plus another $1.00 for the online version of Final Fantasy IX's Tetra Master card game and another $1.00 extra for each additional character) it had better be.Though, that doesn't mean that Final Fantasy XI isn't rough around the edges. It's lack of user-initiated attacks in battle mode, somewhat dimwitted A.I., and hefty $100 price tag will undoubtedly irk veterans from both the console and PC disciplines alike. But with hundreds upon hundreds of hours of always-changing gameplay, the ability to chat with American and Japanese PC and PS2 gamers constantly, five racial backgrounds, 15 different job classes, innumerable skills to be learned, the second largest pool of subscription-based gamers on the planet, and one of the most soulful personalities of any videogame franchise in existence, the risk and the price more than make up for it.", "date": "Mar 23, 2004"}
