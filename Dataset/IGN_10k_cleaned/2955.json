But apart from its excellent use of motion-capturing 3D players, the game is just too average and generic to cause any kind of stir in the Saturn's baseball library.The game has its gems -- selectable camera angles and a smooth 3D graphics engine are 3D Baseball's highlights, not to mention the cool tidbits of trivia that randomly pop up during a player's at-bat. Unfortunately, everything else this game offers has been done elsewhere, and in most cases, done better.Don't expect to swing a homer over the Green Monster at Fenway or the ivy walls at Wrigley Park, Crystal Dynamics lack of licensing gives us a choice of four generic stadiums: Burton Park, Crystal Yards, Willis Field and The Stadium. Players may come from the MLBPA, but they play for unnamed teams from their related cities.The game also has an extremely simplistic ~all or nothing~ batting system most baseball fans will frown upon. No check swings, no shot placements; just swing and let the ball fly. And fielding isn't nearly as tight as it should be. It's not easy to move your fielders in the way of a speeding grounder or maneuver under a flyball.The graphics and camerawork do produce an excellent foundation for a superb baseball game. It's just that the untweaked gameplay, generic teams and stadiums, and lack of any signature flair stack 3D Baseball as a standard baseball game at best. Maybe next year, guys.", "date": "Jan 29, 1998"}
