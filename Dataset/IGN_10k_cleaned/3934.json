Though expansions are sometimes hard targets to hit in terms of reviews, this one presents its own unique problems. To begin with, the game adds a wealth of new transportation options, letting the player immerse themselves in variable commute patterns and adjust the traffic flow through the city with a wide range of new road and rail pieces. In this sense, the game seems to take off in a much more simulation oriented direction. But the title also adds a feature that seems at odds with the idea of a real city-planning simulation. By incorporating loads and loads of vehicle-based gameplay, Rush Hour shifts the series more towards personality and character.  That both approaches could be combined under the umbrella of ~transportation~ is a testament to the flexibility of the design and the designers. Rush Hour then, seems like two expansions in one: a fantastic extension of the transportation options geared towards a more hardcore audience, and a neat suite of vehicular missions that are more lighthearted but still significant to the overall development of your city.  Of the two, I'm less divided in my praise of the new traffic simulation aspects of the game. Having balked at the automatic road placement of SimCity 4, I find that the new transportation options allow you to get even more control over the traffic in your city than is possible when you lay out the entire transportation network yourself. Not content to merely offer new road types, the designers have broadened the range of options for your transportation infrastructure.  New pieces allow you to create several new ways for your Sims to get from Point A to Point B. Whether they take the elevated rail or the new double-wide avenues, the Sims will find plenty of new options that don't merely duplicate other transportation assets. And since each of these options comes with a specific purpose and target rider in mind, you'll find yourself following commute patterns very closely and fine-tuning the flow using the various pieces available. Need to transition your above-ground rail network to subways? Need to build a big parking garage next to a public transportation building? Need to add one-way streets to ease traffic congestion downtown? Need to heighten a bridge so that ferry traffic can cross beneath it? All those options are available here and each has a definite purpose and a considerable impact on the traffic flow in your city.  The vehicle missions, though well conceived overall, are a bit more hit or miss. I love the fact that it lets you get down to a personal level in your city. Though there aren't any persistent personalities or characters (apart from your imported Sims who get the rare vehicle mission from time to time), the fact you can get a street-level view of your city (or cruise the rivers and lakes or fly over the buildings) gives the game a new human element. It's also a great excuse to see your city up close and personal. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Fsimcity4rushhour_092203_in013.jpg&caption= Though it had tremendous inherent ~gimmick~ potential, the inclusion of drivable vehicles is actually handled quite well. Far from simply offering players a convenient excuse to take a joyride through the city (which they do), the vehicle missions are wonderfully integrated into the basic gameplay of the core game. You won't be able to shut down traffic on the highway by causing accidents or anything, but you can have a serious impact on development within your city and reap rewards in the form of higher mayor ratings and extra cash.  Most missions come in two flavors: good and evil. If you're willing to take a reputation hit, the bad missions offer a great way to make some extra cash. It's perfect for those situations where you've started to run out of money and really need that $80,000 university. The reputation hit is a nice balance to this; it allows for some consequence for evil playing, but still gives you the freedom to be a total jerk and not ruin your city. The good missions typically only increase your mayor rating (although a few offer a small cash reward). More significantly, successful missions will improve the desirability of a particular area of the city and, every once in a while, offer up some new buildings.  But while the range of missions is really impressive there are some that don't seem to make much sense. A few times I've been asked to stop a gang of criminals before they leave town and while some of the regular chase missions are a real blast, why bother to offer missions where the escapee already starts on the edge of the map? It's quite frustrating to lose a mission before you've even had a chance to turn on your siren.  There are a few other aggravations to be found in the vehicle missions, particularly those for the cars. For one, I'd like a mini-map that shows a larger area. Given the game's automatic road placement for zoning, you can occasionally find yourself running in to dead ends as you race from one side of the city to the other. Smoothing these problems out often requires you to make several small connections between nearby roads.  You'll also find that it's damned difficult to negotiate areas near tall structures. Though the car still appears behind buildings the roads do not. A separate transparency effect, perhaps having the roads show up as yellow lines when obscured by buildings, would go a long way to keeping you headed in the right direction when you're behind a building. A handy feature lets you lock your car's steering so that it stays only on the roads but this makes it more difficult to pass by other cars on your way to perform some essential errand.  The tendency of road vehicles to pop in and out of the game is also a cause of frustration. Racing down the street behind vehicles that conveniently disappear moments before you crash in to them is fine, I suppose, but when you begin a mission and have a cement truck spawn right on top of your vehicle destroying it before you've even touched the controls, that's bad game design. And while it's nice that cars pull off the road to make way for emergency vehicles, the fact that they sometimes pull off to the wrong side of the road can lead to some unfortunate collisions. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Fsimcity4rushhour_092203_in022.jpg&caption= Though overall performance seems to have been smoothed over a bit with the expansion, there are still some moments where the game seems to chug a bit, even on high-end systems. Given the amount of information displayed on the screen, it's not too terrible in most cases. But it was easier to put up with erratic performance before the team added this reflex-oriented vehicle gameplay. The drops in framerate are more irritating now, particularly when you consider the quality of the high-detail graphics. Since you'll be focused on the cars and streets, the pixilated buildings aren't too much of a problem, but it still seems as if the game should run better given the level of detail.  Graphically, you'll be getting the same game you got last time. As an expansion pack, we didn't expect Rush Hour to offer much more in the way of new visuals and new sounds. There are new elements included in both areas of the game and they fit well with the overall style and approach we've come to expect. A new building style and several new bridge types give your city a bit more variety this time around while the new voice cues and other sounds for the vehicles preserve the tone and humor of the base game.  A playful sense of self-referential humor has always been one of the hallmarks of the series, and that trend has even expanded in Rush Hour. When a school bus crashes in to another vehicle, you hear the kids on the bus scream out in joy. The missions are also quite hilarious, both in concept and execution. You can win a hostage mission by flying over the hostage taker's mom's house. Apparently his demands aren't too ambitious since he's willing to release the hostages just because you managed to get his mom's house on TV.I'm a bit conflicted over the issue of a final score for this game. It adds plenty of new features on the management end of the game, letting those more studious players delve deep in to the heart of the traffic patterns in the city. Serious players of SimCity will definitely find a wonderful range of options here, both in terms of new pieces and new reports. The details here are almost overwhelming and it's a real tribute to Maxis that they've been able to take such detailed, complicated information and present it in as useful and intuitive a format as possible.I'm more divided on the vehicle missions. While I think they're a great addition to the series overall and have some compelling consequences for your city, the street driving offers some small but recurring frustrations. The interface for driving is fine as it is; what really bothers me is the odd tendency of vehicles to appear and disappear out of thin air. That, coupled with the buildings that obscure the road and the strange road layout of some of my cities, makes driving on the street much more aggravating than flying through the air or plying the waterways.Still, the new driving options are a nice consolation for those of us who'd still like to see more scenarios and directed challenges that involve the city as a whole. That, coupled with the new transportation options, make Rush Hour an easy sell for fans of the game. Even if you're not a fan of the series already, Maxis will be shipping a Deluxe version of the game that includes both the core game and the expansion and at the same price they're currently charging for just the core game. For forty bucks, it's not a bad deal.", "date": "Sep 22, 2003"}
