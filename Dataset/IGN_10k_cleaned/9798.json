And rightfully so -- the franchise's memorable characters and trademark wacky antics make Looney Tunes the ideal stuff that videogames are made of.   Although it could have easily turned into another face in the growing crowd of ~license~ titles, Looney Tunes Carrot Crazy -- Infogrames' first title in its multi-platform ~Games for the Next Mil-Looney-Um~ series (groan) -- arrives as a positive surprise. The nicely crafted sidescroller distinguishes itself from the fray of uninspired Game Boy platformers with pleasing graphics, enjoyable gameplay and surprisingly good music.  Features  Play as Bugs Bunny or Lola Bunny. Switch characters at any time. Features five Looney Tunes worlds to explore. Stars Yosemite Sam, Marving the Martian, Taz, Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck, and others. Two difficulty levels. Password Saving. Multilingual game and manual (English, Spanish, French). Compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color.   The Game Developed by French veterans Fernando Velez and Guillaume Dubail, Carrot Crazy pits players against a host of familiar carrot thieves. In the role of either Bugs or bunnylicious Lola, gamers fight their way through five different worlds, including Marvin the Martian's space station and a zoo starring the ever-hungry Taz. Like in its cartoon inspiration, Bugs and partner can pull off a variety of moves, such as using their ears to fly, smacking opponents with hammers or frying pans or temporarily walking on air. In order to defy the laws of gravity for a longer time, players pick up carrots or use so-called super carrots to get airborne. An especially wicked carrot variety, the hot habanero carrot will cause the rabbits to turn invincible and run about like crazy.  While the premise and gameplay mechanics don't exactly sound all that original, Infogrames managed to pull off a fun jump'n'run that sports a surprising amount of polish for a first-generation Game Boy Color title. Controls are dead-on, the characters are well animated and everything moves at a fast pace. Players can switch between the game's two main characters at any time (by pressing Select) -- and it's not just for looks. Whereas Bugs is able to push around objects (in order to reach higher-up places) and dig into the ground to access new areas, Lola can use an umbrella to safely float to the ground (as falling from a cliff could easily spell the rabbits' doom).  Infogrames also included bonus stages and special chase sequences for variety. Overall, Carrot Crazy doesn't really push the jump'n'run genre to new heights, but all the gameplay elements are in the right place to form a great gaming experience. The game's music, put together by Bit Managers, is worth special mention as the sound designers tried to push the envelope with different instrument sounds -- as much as the hardware allows, of course. Not to be confused with the many uninspired Looney Tunes Game Boy games out there, this one is well worth a look. Good job, Infogrames.", "date": "Jul 20, 1999"}
