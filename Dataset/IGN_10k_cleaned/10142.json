I still have good bit of faith in the opinions and decision making abilities of my fellow gamers and I just can't believe that anyone in their right mind would actually pick up GT Interactive's latest, WWII GI and really believe that it was a good game. Even so, just in case anyone looked at the box and didn't notice the circa '95 Build Engine graphics or actually believed the quote on the back of the box from an ex-Marine stating that the game, ~captures all the tactical military challenges of the real Allied Invasion,~ I'm going to go ahead and make sure that everyone understands that this is a game for making fun of, not buying.   The premise is pretty simple, if not exactly original  you jump into the role of a soldier storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. If you make it past the six or so soldiers guarding the beach (~all the challenges of the real Allied Invasion?~ I was pretty sure the Germans had a whole bunch of guys defending those beaches), you'll get a chance to explore the German bunkers, killing enemy soldiers as you go. There are two major theatres, each with seven missions apiece that take you through some of the major engagements of the war. Not a bad idea in theory, but WWII GI shows just how important practice can be when building a video game.  WWII GI is a disappointment from the moment you open the box. With a subject as rich in source material as World War II, you'd think that the development team would have taken some time to explain the historical significance behind each of the missions, or included a manual that described the real world parallels with what you were doing on screen. Nope. In fact, there was nothing in the box but the CD jewel case which included a small (29 pages of large type) manual that was completely unhelpful on just about every subject. Once in the game, you'll see no cutscenes, no movies and will read nothing of any real interest about the second World War. Bad.  The game's graphics are exactly what you'd expect out of a Build engine title  they suck. Everything is hyper-grainy, movement is blurred, and the effects are laughable. There's really not much more to say here except, if you've seen any first person game that's released since Quake, you're just not going to be able to play this game for more than 5 minutes without hating yourself for it. Sound effects aren't much better and consist of tired gunshot noises and speech that repeats every time you enter the same situation. The Sarge at the beginning of the first mission repeated his speech so many times that both Tal and Steve have it memorized just because they sit near me. Steve's still muttering to himself, ~What the Hell do I look like? A German solider?~ At least they didn't have to play this dog for days at a stretch. Let's move on.  The gameplay itself is terrible, but admittedly, not as terrible as I imagined it would be. While the control and movement is comparable to Doom or Duke Nuke 'Em, the level designs are actually pretty nice and do a good job of encouraging you to actually move like a soldier. If you don't keep your head down, it'll get shot off in a hurry. Still, bad gameplay with bad graphics in a good level is still a pretty big waste of time. The thing is, there's just no real reason for you to ever load this game up when there are so many good games available on the shelves already. The game does have a multiplayer mode, which boasts 30 different levels (the 14 from the single player missions and 16 multiplay specific) for you to go head-to-head against your friends in. But even though the game ships with these maps and three different play modes (deathmatch, capture the flag, and fireteam) the odds of ever being able to find eight people willing to load up this outmoded game with you are negligible. Multiplayer crap is still crap.  While all of these features add up to game that's simply not worth playing, there is one other issue that I had with WWII GI that moved me from simple dislike to absolute hate  the entire game plays in DOS. Don't get me wrong, I was plenty happy in the days of DOS gaming, and Windows definitely annoys me in many ways, but the battle has been lost. For a manufacturer to ship a DOS game these days is not only ridiculous, it's really irritating. Throughout the game I was plagued by problems relating to this issue  the game would crash out after completing a mission, I'd hit the Windows button on my keyboard instead of the Control key to fire and find myself staring at my desktop while my character got shot down by a roomful of Nazis. In order to play the game in its high-res mode (believe me, it doesn't make enough difference to mention), I had to track down a set of VESA drivers. By the time I got the game ready to run, I was thoroughly angry, a fact that was not made much better by actually playing the game.  As I stated when I got started on this thrashing, I don't imagine that there are all that many people out there who actually looked at this game as a potential purchase anyway. But for those who may be considering it as a way to while away a few hours, I highly recommend you find something else more entertaining to do like rolling in tacks or simply watching mildew grow on your bathroom walls. WWII GI is only for those who have no access to technology or a real masochistic streak.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Aug 10, 1999"}
