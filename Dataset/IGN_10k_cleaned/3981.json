Scooby-Doo is one of those franchises, and it's been proven time and again, at least on the Game Boy Advance, that any game design that features the characters and situations from the license typically ends up bland and unimaginative. Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem doesn't do anything to stray from this belief, as the third Scooby-Doo title on the GBA isn't much more than a scavenger hunt masquerading as a rudimentary platformer. Features Five ~episodes~ Two controllable characters Cartridge save (four slots)  The developers of Mystery Mayhem, Canadian developer Artificial Mind & Movement (previously responsible for Ice Age on the GBA) attempt to recreate the situations and ~humor~ of the classic 60s Hanna-Barbera series, right down to the forced laugh effect after what would be considered a ~joke~ in the text conversation. The addition of a laugh track is pretty clever. The rest of the game, however, isn't.  After stumbling upon a strange ghost infestation at Velma's favorite library, players control the pairing of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, who wander the areas together...and players can swap back and forth between the two pretty much at any time. At the start of the adventure, it's not clear why anyone would want to switch between the two because they both have the same walk speed and jump distance. But the differences become clear once the lantern's found, though; only Scooby can operate the lantern and illuminate darkened areas. There are different items tossed around the five different ~mysteries~ that can only be controlled by either Shaggy or Scooby, so it's important for players to be quick on the select button in order to switch between the two. Both characters act as the game's ~life bar~ of sorts; take a hit, and one character turns white. Take another hit, and both go white (and spaz out uncontrollably for a few seconds). After that, it's a lost life and it's back to the last checkpoint.  At first, the game is incredibly dull and monotonous because all the game lets you do is leap around the area, pick up Scooby Snacks, and power icons for the lantern, and hidden clues.  I think the biggest problem to Mystery Mayhem is the level designers' creation of absolutely massive scrolling areas that intertwine with doors leading to other absolutely massive scrolling areas. It's just tiring to backtrack through the same area over and over just because you didn't grab that needed clue icon. The game does get a little more interesting when Shaggy grabs what's known as the ~Tome of Doom~. This item doesn't come into play until the end of the first mystery, which is unfortunate since the game is amazingly boring before it's acquired. With the Tome of Doom, the game has a Ghostbusters feel to it because players can finally ~attack~ the aliens instead of continuously avoiding them.  But even with the offensive weaponry acquired later in the game, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem doesn't get that much more interesting because it doesn't a whole lot of skill in its gameplay. It's just a basic platformer with very little technique...you know the type: leap across chasms and onto moving ledges. It's very basic and brings almost nothing new to the table. Well, scratch that...the designers include a ~tactical~ gameplay element where players can sneak past sleeping ghosts by ducking behind pillars. It's cute, but once players score the Tomb of Doom, it's not something that's done much after that.  The actual engine used for the game has some decent merit; collision detection is nicely done, and the ghostly enemies are actually transparent. The animation of Shaggy and Scooby is actually well done, and follow the Hanna Barbera style extremely well. There are a few extra challenges beyond the run-and-jump action, like riding in a fast-moving book cart, but nothing overly taxing especially when these extra mini-games offer infinite lives due to their slight ramp up in difficulty. Mystery Mayhem doesn't create anything new or original for the troop, and it doesn't give players a good feel for the entire gameplay because it locks them out of the ~cool~ stuff until they finish the first mystery. Players might lose interest by then because what's before it is dull and tedious...the levels are not what you'd consider ~tightened up~ because they're extremely large and cluttered with passages to other large and cluttered levels. After the first episode the game does pick up with a little more variety, but it's not nearly enough to recommend. It's for die-hard fans of Scooby-Doo who must have everything branded with the Great Dane. Nobody else.", "date": "Oct 6, 2003"}
