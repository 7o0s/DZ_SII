Better than Super Mario Sunshine, Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Pikmin, and Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem. Better, in fact, than any Nintendo-developed GCN game. And it did so against all odds, amidst a series of internal company layoffs, of cancelled projects, and incidentally against the predictions of most critics. Not bad, huh?Depending on whom you ask, Metroid Prime is even today described as the best game ever created, an amazing transitional sequel for the franchise, or a surprisingly well-produced adventure game that should have featured dual-analog control. There are people on both sides of the fence, but few would disagree that the title was at the very least a success at recreating the series in the first-person perspective while remaining true to the play mechanics and smart level design that helped make Samus Aran a star to begin with. Whether it was the way the game easily handled platform elements where other first-person games failed, or the stylistic heads-up display that put you in Aran's suit, Prime felt fresh and groundbreaking.Metroid Prime 2 Echoes, in every way an extension of that winning formula, does not. As a result, anybody who played through the original game will already have a very clear picture of what waits in this anticipated sequel: more of the same. Yes, that means an identical control scheme and similar level structure, pacing, weapon and upgrade advancements, and Morphball-based puzzles. And despite an updated graphics engine, even the visuals look closely related to those in the title's predecessor.That feeling of totally new, of completely fresh, is subdued. But this is the truth and in the end all that matters: if you can look beyond that, you're going to discover that Metroid Prime 2 Echoes is still one hell of an engaging, thrilling, and wholeheartedly entertaining sequel. It plays just as well as the original and in some ways better. It is at times cleverer, more difficult, and even prettier. And there are still some surprises to be found hidden around corners and behind locked doors. Which is why, like the original, it's one of GameCube's best titles.The FactsAll-new adventure starring Nintendo mascot and bounty hunter Samus AranExplore Aether, a planet caught between two dimensions: the Light and the Dark WorldJoin the Luminoth to fight against the evil Ing, a beastly race from the Dark World that threatens the LightTravel between the Light and Dark World, solve environmental puzzles, battle enemies, unlock new areas, and moreSearch the planet for upgrades that can improve Samus Aran's weaponry and gadgetryFight a wide assortment of challenging boss charactersMore third-person Morph ball-based puzzles than ever beforeA lengthy single-player quest promises at least 20 hours of gameplayNew four-player compatible multiplayer modeUnlockable art assetsRuns in progressive scan modeDolby Pro Logic II compatibleRequires three memory blocks for savesLet There Be DarkMetroid Prime had an amazing opening. Space bounty hunter extraordinaire Samus Aran landed atop a desolate space station and fought off Space Pirates before the entire structure exploded. The complete segment, dripping with atmosphere, proved to be the perfect setup for the quest that followed. Prime 2's beginning is disappointingly far less dramatic. A well-orchestrated real-time cut-scene illustrates Aran's approach to the largely unexplored planet of Aether. An electrical storm damages the heroine's ship and she's forced to set down. You take control from here.Samus has come to the planet to aid the Federation Troopers, whose own ship is abandoned somewhere nearby. The Troopers, you learn, followed a group of Space Pirates to Aether, but before they could pursue the enemy they were attacked and slaughtered by an unexpected foe, a nasty race of dark creatures from another dimension. Aran comes upon the dead soldiers shortly after the game begins and downloads a computer log that triggers another cinematic of the attack. The game's story is driven by an assortment of other in-game cut-scenes -- much more than the original offered -- most of them polished and intriguing.From the very beginning, Echoes successfully recreates the overwhelming sense of isolation that has been with Samus through all of her adventures. She's alone. Nobody's backing her up. Either she gets the job done, or she dies. The creepy mood is set in stone after Aran predictably loses all of her gear again. Not a technical malfunction, as in the first game, but a theft. Shortly after the bounty hunter encounters a mysterious anti-version of herself known as Dark Samus, a group of the beastly Ing creatures surrounds the character and literally steals most of her weapons and gadgets. When the smoke clears, she's left only with her Morphball ability and her trusty Power Beam. Echoes isn't Resident Evil, but we found ourselves spooked by some of the title's dangerous locations and situations all the same. And the ambient soundtrack from composer Kenji Yamamoto, full of both subtle tracks that feature heartbeat rhythms and grandiose battle music, drives the eerie theme home.There's definitely a formula in place and Echoes doesn't often stray from it, which may upset some gamers hoping for an entirely new take on the franchise. Samus loses her gear. She has to find it. And in the meantime, parts of this massive, gorgeous world remain locked to her. Only after Samus bests some large and challenging bosses and solves some truly clever environmental puzzles do these added abilities and items become available, at which point she can access more locales in the world. Same as before. There is a lot of backtracking in Echoes, which has been a point of complaint for some critics. But in our opinion, this is part of the franchise's charm, just as backtracking has always been engraved in the Zelda series. It's knowing that there is a cliff that can only be reached by using Aran's Grapple Beam, and then wondering where the Grapple Beam is hidden, that will both intrigue and drive you. It's classic Metroid design and Retro Studios has once more executed on it triumphantly. The result is a game that's nearly as fun and enjoyable as the first, an achievement in and of itself.Echoes is not a first-person shooter. That is to say, it's much more than that. You explore Aether in first-person mode, but can switch to a third-person view via Aran's Morphball at any given time. The play is a combination of first-person shooting, platforming and exploration with third-person Morphball puzzles. Retro created a surprisingly capable control scheme for the first Prime and that configuration is carried over, largely unchanged for the sequel. It works very well, especially where platforming is concerned. Jumping from platform to platform is more intuitive than in any other first-person style game that comes to mind. A system enables the bounty hunter to target and stay locked onto enemies while strafing around them. But there is no dual-analog control. And to be honest, there are some cumbersome moments because of it. A couple of mechanically difficult boss fights in particular would have been less so had we been able to look and run at the same time. Retro, if you're reading, hook us up for the inevitable (and already anticipated) Revolution sequel. Or at least give us the option.This worthy sequel revolves around the concept that planet Aether exists in two dimensions. The Light World, inhabited by the peaceful, Chozo-like Luminoth, and the Dark World, which is overrun by the evil Ing. The Luminoth and Ing have been at war for a long time, but recently the dark creatures have gained an upper hand and are threatening to topple the balance of the dimensions and eliminate the Light once and for all. It's up to Samus to right the balance and destroy the Ing before they can do more damage.LoadingPlayWhich brings us to the major differences between Echoes and the original Prime: the new world, the new dynamic, the new weapons, and the new upgrades. Retro's unbelievably talented artists have gone to work to make Aether an organic, curvy, detailed world filled with the little extras that truly bring it to life. Each locale, from the rain-drenched swamplands of Torvus Bog and the futuristic, industrialized corridors in the Sanctuary Fortress to the vegetation-filled pathways in the Agon Wastes, is simply breathtaking. Walkways are intentionally cracked and broken, with protruding trees and rocks. Holograms float in the air. Waterfalls shimmer in the distance. The sun glares down upon the horizon. Or flashes of lightning temporarily illuminate the environments.Aether is divided into Light and Dark halves and Samus must travel to both in order to advance through the game. The areas in the Light World are described above. The Dark World can be summed up in a word: purple. Although the alternate dimension houses some clever puzzles and some truly remarkable boss fights, we oftentimes found ourselves preferring the Light World locations for their variety and for their beauty. Much of the Dark World looks the same, which is a complaint, and the area is generally more difficult, too, which means that at times we actually dreaded going there, especially when we were already low on energy. Still, Retro has smartly created puzzles that involve both dimensions. Successfully navigating both the Light and Dark Worlds in order to, say, raise a bridge in one dimension so that it also moves in the other, paving the way to progress onward, is extremely satisfying.The same can be written of Aran's major new weapons. The Light and Dark Beams are powerful new guns that enable the bounty hunter to dispose of enemies and solve puzzles. The Light Beam can more easily destroy Dark World creatures and vice versa, just as the Dark Beam (which, by the way, is the ugliest weapon in the game; the shimmering purple textures that surround it don't look so hot) can remove specific barriers, raise levers and activate machines, and vice versa. The dynamic works well and once you understand the formula you can more quickly advance through the game. For instance, while the Power and Dark Beams might cause little damage to an enemy Ing, the Light Beam would quickly obliterate it. The catch is that, for the first time, you can run out of ammo. The good news, however, is that it actually doesn't happen very often, especially if you wisely conserve Dark and Light matter so that you have it when it's necessary. Both of the weapons have useful secondary charge functions, including a burst shot for the Light Beam and the same for the Dark, which emits a projectile that more or less freezes opponents. Samus eventually gains more weapons, one of which combines the power of Light and Dark, and is equally impressive for reasons of its own. Unfortunately, though, many of the old favorites are gone. The Ice Beam, for example. The Wave Beam, too.Also gone are the X-Ray and Thermal Visors from Metroid Prime, but in their place are two brand new ones that are sure to please for entirely different reasons. The Dark Visor, which is gained about halfway through the game, enables Samus to see objects and enemies that exist in the alternate dimension. The spectacularly stylized display, surrounded in a television-quality grain filter, highlights enemies and objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye in a pinkish hue and naturally it looks gorgeous. The Echo Visor actually turns sounds into visuals, and it too is amazing. You will probably flip on the visors just to marvel at them. We did.Aran's suit upgrades are just as impressive. A new multi-target Seeker Missile enables the bounty hunter to simultaneously lock five different enemies or objects, and many of the environmental puzzles make use of this truth. The Gravity Boost gives Samus a temporary hover ability while underwater. The Power Bomb will explode just about any object. And of course the Screw Attack is intuitively injected into the play experience, allowing Samus to corkscrew up walls and to otherwise unattainable areas. All of these upgrades have a bearing on Aran's physical make-up. The character model looks more detailed and sexy than ever before from the start. But as Samus gains new suits -- the Light and Dark ones to be specific -- she grows grittier still.Metroid Prime 2 is more difficult than its predecessor. The game is challenging from the start and it only gets harder. And partly because of that, it is on occasion also more rewarding. The beginning of the game feels roughly as difficult as a point halfway through the original Prime. Although at least one boss fight is unfairly made more difficult due to a lacking save point, most of the time the bosses are just hard. To tell you the truth, we died playing some of the bosses three or four times before finally discovering the routine and then capitalizing on it. The larva boss Chykka was a particular thorn in our side. And we won't even go into the final fight. After the bouts are over, there is a real sense of accomplishment. In addition, some of the regular enemy characters are menacing and impressive, too. The Ingsmasher, a gigantic statue-sized entity powerful enough to shake the screen, hurls dangerous shockwaves at Samus. Another hovering drone can actually cause Aran's suit to crash, just like a computer. The hunter's vision will skip, go into black and white and you'll need to reboot the suit with a combination of buttons. It's extremely creative, and we're only detailing a small portion of the enemies in the game.Meanwhile the puzzle challenges, be them in first-person view with the help of a visor or special weapon, or in third-person using the Morphball or Spider Ball, which still kicks as much ass as ever, are all fulfilling. Prime 2 isn't easily beaten, either. The game will run you a commendable bare minimum of 20 hours and we wouldn't be surprised if some gamers put in double that.Echoes has a multiplayer mode, too, which is sure to extend the replay value of the game for some. Up to four players can duke it out in a standard deathmatch-style competition and true enough, Retro Studios has tried to Metroid-ize the feel and function of arenas. There are Morphball Cannons, which launch Samus across chasms and up to second-tier levels. There is a Death Ball that immediately eliminates any opponent you happen to roll into. And you can even hack the suits of your foes, temporarily disabling some of their functions. And to top everything off, there's also a treasure hunt mode in which you compete against friends in a collect-a-thon. The multiplayer mode runs smoothly and as far as four-player split-screen goes, it really isn't bad. But at the same time we simply don't feel that Metroid Prime needed a multiplayer mode to begin with -- the series has succeeded on its single-player merits for more than a decade. Despite Retro's attempt to put a Metroid spin (pardon the pun) on the multiplayer mode, in the end it's still just deathmatch, and deathmatching doesn't work so well when you can always see exactly what your opponent is doing. And there's no getting around the fact that the multiplayer mode feels archaic compared to the onslaught of online-ready fragfests available to owners of Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2 consoles.Naturally, the game runs in progressive scan mode and Dolby Pro Logic II so that it both looks extremely crisp and detailed and sounds fantastic in full surround. Retro's artistic sense is impeccable. But the developer's engineers are technical wizards, too. Not only does the game spit out huge, detailed locations filled with textures that offer more clarity than those in the original, and with more enemies on-screen, more advanced particle and lighting effects, and even some reflections and transparencies to boot, but it does so while retaining a fluidity of 60 frames per second. There are couple drops here in there, especially in the mesmerizing Sanctuary Fortress area, but for the most part it's an amazing accomplishment -- again. And of course the sound effects and music fit the mood. A futuristic voice now announces that new data has been added to Aran's logbook. Enemies growl and whine realistically. Bombs explode and weapons thump with a real umph. And it's also separated nicely. The only thing missing, in fact, is more voice dialogue. Not for Samus, per se, but for some of the other characters. True to Nintendo form, the Luminoth have one or two sound samples that repeat when they are talking, and then text does the rest. For a game with such high production values, more speech would have been nice to complement the superb visuals.Metroid Prime 2 Echoes proves that Retro Studios' first game was not a fluke. This long-anticipated sequel to what I consider to be one of the greatest games ever made arrives as one hell of a great new installment to an already-outstanding franchise.Echoes isn't exactly a groundbreaking product. The feeling of originality, of freshness, that overwhelmed me as I played through Prime is not present in this sequel, and that's mainly because Prime 2 doesn't stray from the winning formula. It strictly adheres to it, in fact. That's a little disappointing. But at the same time the end experience is every bit as amazing as the first, which means that if you loved the original game then you're going to love this one too. And if you hated it, well, you're probably not going to have a sudden change of heart now.Prime 2 succeeds because it successfully recreates the Metroid experience in 3D. It succeeds for all the same reasons that the first did, and no new ones. The wide-openness of the huge, gorgeous world. The gargantuan number of hidden upgrades that promise access to areas unreachable. The intense boss fights. The intuitive first-person platforming elements and the challenging third-person environmental puzzles. And most of all, the exploration factor. Just getting to know the world is immensely enjoyable and extremely rewarding. Did I mention that the game is artistically and technically head and shoulders above most games on the market, competing systems included?I have a couple of minor quibbles with the Echoes. The Dark World is less compelling than the Light World. The lock-on system is not without problems. A dual-analog control setup is long overdue, at least as a secondary option for those who might prefer it. And at least one boss fight was made unfairly more difficult due to the lack of a nearby save point.But everything said and done, this is still one of the best games to come out in the last couple years and in many ways it stands side-by-side with Metroid Prime. Some gamers may actually prefer it.And what it boils down to is this: if you're okay with Echoes being an extension of the first game and not a revolution, you're going to flip out over this sequel.Our highest recommendation.", "date": "Nov 12, 2004"}
