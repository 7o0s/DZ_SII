We pretty much considered it the top PC game we'd seen that year--intense action, amazing sound, and a sense of being in the thick of historic drama. For some reason, fighting Nazis never gets old, especially with the backdrop of Europe. Technically, not every German soldier was necessarily a member of the Nazi party, but it's fun to pretend when you're filling them full of lead.  Recognizing a good thing when they saw it, Activision was quick to bring the developer, Infinity Ward, into the fold. We assume they're working on the inevitable sequel, while Gray Matter developed the expansion pack, United Offensive. These guys did Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and many of them come from Xatrix Entertainment, who did Kingpin and a several Quake and Quake II mission packs. Lots of experience with the Quake engine, and it shows. Although the Quake III engine United Offensive is based on is about five years old--prehistoric in gaming terms--it holds up amazingly well, and Gray Matter even squeezed out an awesome particle system, flamethrowers, controllable vehicles, partially destructible environments, and more.  Let me tell you how the particle system adds to the game. ~Particles in this sense refer to smoke, flying debris, fire, dust, and fog. It's hard to imagine the battlefield now without the enormous pillars of dirt towering into the air during artillery bombardments; trails of thick smoke tracing a bazooka round from launch to target; bursts of smoke rising out of a tank cannon after every shot; cloud dust getting kicked up behind vehicles; and the explosions. The explosions are really cool. If you have the right sound system, your neighbors will be banging down your door. The whole screen shakes, too, so you get really rattled when those planes fly overhead and try to bombard you. Combined with the partial destructibility, you can make a satisfying mess of the battlefield.    Controllable vehicles are also quite awesome here, although, sadly, there is only one mission where you'll actually get behind the wheel. Not only that, but I was able to coast through that segment without reloading a single save game. It was fun, but all-too brief. Thankfully, vehicles have been implemented in every multiplayer mode. You won't necessarily see them on every map, but there are several to go around, with beefy tanks, Jeeps, and tank killers. You control the wheel with the WASD keys and the turret with the mouse (assuming it has a rotatable turret). It takes a minute to get used to, but those of you who've delved into MechWarrior should find it instantly familiar.  But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's go back to single player. The thirteen missions are evenly divided between the Americans, British, and Russians as before, and it will probably take you about ten hours to plow your way through. Also as before, each of these campaigns is capped by a finale that you may find either thrilling or frustratingly difficult. While each of the finales is distinctly different, the common theme is throwing a large amount of combined arms at you (artillery, aircraft, tanks, infantry). A very large amount. You'll be dealing with a ton of bullets flying your way from multiple directions  For the most part, though, the rest of the game is well balanced for difficulty and tension. The thing about United Offensive, and much more pronounced than in Call of Duty, is constantly spawning enemies. You won't be able to crawl your way through the game, pick them off, and make your way to the next point. Pop a guy manning a machine gun nest, and someone else will scramble to take his place about five to seconds later, coming seemingly out of nowhere.      While I can appreciate prioritizing a machine gun nest, these guys will keep pouring out of houses and around corners indefinitely, until you physically cross a boundary that triggers your squad to move ahead. It keeps you moving and keeps the tension high, but this kind of scripting feels artificial. It also makes it so that the enemy AI doesn't have to be very tight, since they can make up for simplified action/reaction by just throwing a bunch of guys at you. The Germans don't fall back when you advance, or move to alternate cover when you get a good angle on them, like they would in Far Cry. There's also a lot of crouching on open ground and some generally suicidal behavior that breaks immersion.  The thing about constant reinforcement wouldn't be so glaring if there weren't a few areas where the actual point was to dig in your heels and shoot them until they stop coming. There are a few sections where it will be clear that this is what you're supposed to do, and a timer will count down until reinforcements of your own arrive, but I particularly recall a section in the Russian campaign where I was capturing a courtyard, and there was no path to advance until I'd killed a magic number of Nazis. Such is the double-edged sword of scripted design, I guess, and the seams are starting to show, especially in light of a completely open geographical design like we saw in Far Cry. There's a lot of arbitrary path funneling in United Offensive, whether it's minefields creating a narrow vector or debris obstacles that have settled just so, forcing you to go left through this door instead of right around that tank.  I should also mention that there don't seem to be any significant improvements to your squad's AI. The AI does a great job of storming and infiltrating, but defending doesn't seem to be its strong point. There will points where you'll burst through a door or around a corner and find yourself sailing into a hail of gunfire, but you can't backtrack because someone is right behind you. It would be nice to have some collision nudging in these situations. When I had to defend a chateau against a counterattack, one guy defended a doorway in close-quarters combat--while armed with a bolt-action rifle. Since I couldn't nudge him and I don't have the ability to give commands, I could only sit and watch while he got cut to ribbons. Not groovy. Grenade tactics could also use a little tweaking.    Still, it's Call of Duty, and what it does best carries through to the expansion, with Gray Matter adding all of the things I mentioned at the beginning. You get huge incursions, vicious enemies, and that sense of historical drama; bombed-out cities, with tracers flying everywhere, everyone shouting, explosions and screaming all around, ricochets skimming past your ear, huge, screen-shaking bombardments, rattling machine guns, cracking and echoing rifle shots, rising smoke, rumbling tanks, wailing fighter planes. There is no WWII gaming experience quite as drenching as Call of Duty, despite its glitches and the disadvantages of linear scripting.  The single-player maps are quite linear, though, and the triggers and scripting are more noticeable and less compelling than they were when CoD came out a year ago. So in that respect, UO is almost too much of a good thing, with a punishing amount of munitions coming your way. In the kill zone of the Kursk plaza, you'll have to protect two soldiers attempting to cross right through the thick of it by finding a perch and picking off a constant wave of enemies while guys in gun nests or armed with rifles and machine guns are shooting back at you; on the heels of that, you'll be escorting a sargeant through basically a wall of lead, with a guy popping in with an MG34 who wasn't there a moment before. That's to say nothing of the American finale.  If UO had cranked down the intensity while maintaining the tension like CoD did, it would have been a more gratifying experience. I can understand wanting to up the ante, but having to dodge aerial bombardment while waiting for and taking down a string of tanks with an 88 (an enormous artillery cannon), while being shot at by a dozen encroaching Nazis while waiting for reinforcements while running back to grab more health while hoping you can both get back to the 88 in time for the next take but dodge the next wave of bombs is a bit exhausting by the time you finally succeed after the dozenth save game reload.      Multiplayer takes care of the linear thing quite nicely, though. First of all, it's frenetic in that patented Quake way--you never stop moving, your trigger finger gets ultra twitchy, and each fight is a burst of crazy violence. (Blood is disabled by default, presumably to make the Teen ESRB rating). The eleven multiplayer maps cover a wide variety of locales, from bombed-out city streets to villages with green, rolling hills reminiscent of BF1942. The Berlin map has a frankly huge sewer tunnel system, allowing you to effectively avoid tank, and snipers to a lesser extent.  In general, United Offensive does an excellent job of blocking the usual sniper tactics. You can't often hide in the bushes or climb up into a house and go to town. You can't easily sight the opponent's spawn point or dominate a choke point single-handedly. The level design is consistently awesome and balanced. I like being a jerk of a sniper sometimes, but it's a real buzzkill when you can't go more than twenty feet or ten seconds without getting popped ingloriously from a mile away. Also, the Kill Cam goes a long way towards preventing the assassins from getting comfortable, since it replays the last few moments of your death from their point of view, which usually gives away their location.  In addition to the usual deathmatch, team deathmatch and CTF, there's also Domination and Base Assault. Unlike the UT2004 version of Assault, each side has a base they have to hold against attack while simultaneously attempt to capture the enemy's HQ. In Domination, there are five locations you have to capture by defending each for an extended period of time. It's not like Team Fortress where you just run over a flag to take the point. You have to earn each one while surviving tank bombardment. In the Domination map we played, the points were five bunkers ringing a snowy village with more nooks and crannies than my messy-ass desk. Each bunker has a small underground section that allows you to avoid getting hit in the face with a tank shell.   United Offensive represents some the best of what a heavily scripted game can do. It probably also represents the most that can be squeezed out of the venerable Quake III engine. The first mission of the British campaign has you manning bomber turrets, and you've probably seen the screenshots and video clips by now: it's gorgeous. They've really outdone themselves. Still, in apparently attempting to trump the original in drama, they too often end up pummeling the player with an avalanche of combat targets. If you dug Call of Duty, you'll dig United Offensive, but get comfortable with the Quicksave and Quickload keys.", "date": "Sep 14, 2004"}
