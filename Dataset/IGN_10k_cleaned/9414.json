In comes Mutant Storm Empire, the follow-up to the successful Mutant Storm Reloaded. Once again, you are tasked with using the thumbsticks to move and fire as enemies come from every side. And while the concept may be getting a little tiresome at this point, the latest Mutant Storm does enough interesting things with its level design that it's still fun to play.   Those who played Reloaded will find some significant changes when they pick up Empire. Where Reloaded has you warping through a succession of rooms, Empire features full levels, where you travel through corridors for longer play. You're given six hit points per level. Take a hit and you don't die, you just lose a hit point. Lose them all and the level ends. Hit points only heal once you beat a level, so you'll need to tough it out to get through some of the tougher areas. Instead of the typical power-ups and smart bombs, you have on supergun that does massive damage. However, you have little juice in the guns and it only recharges at the end of a level.   The restructuring of health and power-ups make a major difference in how Mutant Storm is played. There's more strategy involved, particularly in the use of your guns. And while you easily get surrounded, knowing that you won't instantly end your game with one hit can make you a bit more fearless than you might have been in Live Arcade's first Mutant Storm.    What really stand out for Mutant Storm Empire are the levels. While there are just four levels in each of the four worlds, they are colorful and inventive. The second world, which takes place underwater, is particularly fascinating. It's here that you do battle with the literal translation of a sperm whale. His one weakness is his giant glowing balls. Kill him fast or you will face off against his unsightly green secretions. No joke. Another level has you pushed along a lengthy corridor as rocks roll towards you. The rocks work on a light physics engine, so that they bounce in directions based on how you shoot and generally move as mindless rocks making their way down the same path you're on.   Co-op play is available for those who like shooting with a friend. Oddly, you can choose to play any level in co-op whether you've beaten previous stages or not. The number of enemies does not change in co-op, but you lose your super weapon and both players share the same six hit points. Still, it's very easy to blow through on co-op. While the single player is not very tough, co-op is an absolute breeze unless cranked to the highest difficulty.   Mutant Storm Empire is a fast and sometimes stressful arcade shooter. It's more vibrant and at times more intense than its predecessor. That said, it lacks the intangible addictive quality of Mutant Storm Reloaded. Once through the sixteen stages, I had little desire to go back and play again. Sure, it was worth experiencing the first time, but a short game like Empire needs to be fun to play over and over again. I appreciate some of the changes made over Reloaded, but the old room-by-room standard seemed to work better in many ways.  At 800 Microsoft Points ($10), Mutant Storm Empire is a bit pricey considering its short play time. I am the rare person who played more of Mutant Storm Reloaded than I did Geometry Wars. I know, call me crazy. So, from a fans perspective, I can really appreciate the attempt to expand the Mutant Storm franchise beyond Reloaded. All-in-all the series is better for it. But somehow lost among the changes was the replay appeal of Reloaded. Still, if you are itching for another Robotron-inspired shooter, Mutant Storm Empire has enough fun elements to make it well worth playing.", "date": "Nov 3, 2007"}
