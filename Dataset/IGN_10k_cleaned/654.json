Perhaps you've yearned for a worthy dinosaur-related computer game after the disappointing Trespasser? Maybe you're searching for a fun and creative way to study for your paleontology exams. Whatever your reason for being here, we won't tell -- after all, Carnivores 2 isn't half bad...  Like the original Carnivores, developed by Ukraine-based Action Forms and released under the WizardWorks moniker, the sequel places you in the role of a hunter stalking creatures a bit bigger and tad more dangerous than deer. Capitalizing on this daring impulse are companies like the DinoHunt Corporation who will drop you on the planet FMM UV-32 where you can hunt real dinosaurs. But unlike the original title, the rules have changed a bit. At the beginning of the game, players are given 100 credits to rent a planetary location, purchase weapons and buy any extras to aid in the hunt. Naturally, a hundred credits won't buy much, so you can't start off with anything more dangerous than a simple handgun or a crossbow. Extra points are awarded for killing (or tranquilizing) specific dinosaurs, and the more points you collect, the more dangerous the next locations will be. To offset this increased danger, you'll get more weapons and handy toys such as radar, cover scent, camouflage or double ammo.  The five locations are roughly four times bigger than the maps in the original Carnivores so the replayability factor is much higher. Ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages will undoubtedly enjoy exploring the vast grounds, which include swamps, beaches, jungles, small villages and deserts. In total, there are roughly a dozen herbivores and carnivores to hunt, ranging from the rhino-like Chasmosauras and stumpy Stegosauras to the Velociraptors and the granddaddy of them all -- the T-Rex.    Graphically, the environments and the dinosaurs themselves are quite attractive, especially for a value-priced product where there's often a limited development budget. Highly detailed dinosaurs roam the scenery with convincing animation. The lush landscapes are also realistically portrayed -- rippling translucent water, real-time lighting, sunlight that impairs vision and a backdrop of moving clouds. To deliver this visual splendor, the game supports 3D acceleration, with resolutions topping out at an impressive 1600 x1200 (16-bit color). Although some of the trees get a bit pixelated in close proximity, it certainly doesn't take away from the overall effect.   As much as Action Forms boasts about how savvy the dinosaur AI is, this is one of the major weaknesses in the game. Very rarely did I feel like I was being hunted by the beasts themselves -- one of the main reasons why you'd play this game instead of another. Even while constantly running and not using any camouflage, carnivore attacks were extremely rare. I would've liked the option to hunt smarter, tougher beasts. How cool would it have been in Carnivores 2 if you thought you killed a Ceratosauras, only to look over its motionless corpse and then it opens its eyes and lunges at you in one final desperate attempt? Or how about breaking a quiet moment in the bush when a pair of Velociraptors pop their heads through the trees? What about other fatal obstacles -- falling rocks, rough waters, quicksand or a rapidly-approaching storm that leaves you defenseless on a dark island? It's these minor details that can make a good game a great one.   Carnivores 2 is an enjoyable action game at an affordable price, and it's a perfect mainstream title for ~non-gamers~. It's one of those diversions you would probably play only for a few minutes at a time (nothing wrong with that if you consider how many times you've played Solitaire, Tetris or Bust-A-Move while on the phone with a buddy) but do yourself a favor and forget that it's ~another hunting game~ and if the $19.99 isn't enough incentive for you, download the free demo from our download site.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Jan 26, 2000"}
