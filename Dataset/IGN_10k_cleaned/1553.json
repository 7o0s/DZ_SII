And you like your games to be hard-core non-stop action fests that bust your fingers and crank your adrenaline up to the boiling point. You're an action man, and you're looking for something hard, raw, and pure in brutality. But you didn't think you'd ever find it on a puny little handheld. But it can be done. Knuckle up -- Blade has come.   Features  Based on the dark Marvel Comic and Wesley Snipes action film Fierce and bloody combat with guns, swords, and fists Unique level and difficulty structure Only for Game Boy Color    Back with X-Men: Mutant Wars, we were saying that the Game Boy is screaming out for a killer fisticuffs game like the old Double Dragons, the Final Fights, the Streets of Rage. All of the games that tried to pose themselves as brawlers got the beat-down for sad gameplay and boring action. And then out of the darkness comes Blade, made by the same company at HAL Corp with Activision as that X-Men title, but somehow a thousand times more raucous, more aggressive, more violent. Toe to toe with the classics, Blade would get hurt bad by the big boys, but out here in the portable game skyscape, it stands tall and cracks heads with technical fighting style.   Taking a good stance somewhere in between the Snipes flick and the graphic novel series, Blade includes shots and material from the movie but presents it with big, vivid graphics and comic text strings. They've even got Wesley on the box instead of some mock-up render poser. The game's graphics are a scant too blocky and colorful to really do great brilliant justice to either the comic or movie in most cases, but it certainly fits the bill fine, and in some cases, the graphics are surprisingly detailed. The enemies look weak and ill-drawn, but Blade himself has the look of a killer in all of his forms, looking particularly lethal brandishing a sword. And some of the background detail is well beyond whatever I would have expected, like the moving trains in one stage's background or the gory smeared walls spelling out the word ~blood~  Just looking at the graphics, you get the feeling for how this game might play, which would be blocky and chunky and yet potentially brutal and hairy. And that's what you get. You plow through enemies by pressing the buttons fast. The game doesn't really even have a jump button -- as sometimes in a fighter, it's just fun to jump around. It's just round after round of enemies to pulverize by button-mashing, and frankly, the game's basic controls aren't so smooth or fun.   But what you wouldn't expect is that this game is chock-full of technique. Blade has so many more moves than Haggar or Billy Lee ever saw. What the game lacks in intuitive gameplay it makes up for with disciplined techniques. You can attack with daggers, spin-kick through crowds, and hurl the incredible Glave. Granted, a good half of those moves are just specials or cheesy finishers, but many of Blade's moves really deepen the gameplay. Getting surrounded by tough foes can be a pain, so toss one enemy into the other guy to take both out together. Or land a good gut punch to wind your vamp foe and set him up for a heavy blow. And if somebody pulls a gat out of their holster, rush them down and drive a Tornado Kick in deep through their foolish head. And instead of a standard jump button, the developers have instead gone with the block and parry key. Usually, this is a grave mistake. Think Mortal Kombat. But in Blade, the block serves plenty of purpose, setting foes up for angry counters. Good gamers will quickly be able to master the block, knowing exactly when to and not to use it, looking carefully at how the enemy is posed to see if there's an opening for a devastating finisher.  And that's just the brawling stage. There's also a shooting game and a swordsmanship test. Each of these still has buckets of techniques to master in order to get through the game. Kind of like the brawling stages, the gun game is limited in movement -- Blade can't even track across the screen, so instead of a mercenary Cabal gunman, the Daywalker is a sitting duck in the middle of the screen. But learn a few tricks of the controls, and suddenly Blade has a full range of quick-draw marksman moves that give him the fighting edge again. And the sword battles, which come up against beastly bosses, are just as complex as you could crave from a sword battle, with parries and up-slashes, and charging swings. In fact, it's so much to keep up with and learn that one of the game's faults is that it's missing a training mode so you can master your moves in any of the three types of stages -- by the time you get up to the different type of battle, the switch in skills give no quarter to the inexperienced.  In terms of structure, HAL Corp. has come up with some real shrewd methods. The difficulty structure is really ingenious -- By choosing your starting stage, you choose the difficulty through the entire game. Starting at stage one and crawling all the way through the game's dank levels makes for an overall easier game, but if you play from stage three on, every level is considerably more difficult than it would be if you started from square one. The game's engine can't handle many enemies on-screen, and bigger, more animated foes take up even more horsepower, but the baddies tend to pull out more impressive moves, land more blocks, and trap Blade in juggles. It's sort of unfair that the game doesn't back bad guys off of juggles to at least give players a chance, but if it were you, there would be no mercy, so it's a taste of your own medicine. And besides, there's a password to save progress. The game is still aggressively tough in the boss stages, sometimes almost unjustly so, but that's the way some of us like our pain. The only issue with the lay-out is that there are power-ups and specials in stages, but you don't get to use them until after the stage has been passed. By the point, players have easily mastered all of the techniques and moves of the game -- and they better have, because there's no way to get through this game without knowing your stuff -- so by the time you get the reward health and strength, it's not so much use anymore.     First impressions aren't kind at all, but Blade eventually breaks through. It's got kicks, it's got swords, it's got guns. It's one of those games where, when you're playing through, your mom comes in and asks why you simply don't just use your gun throughout the whole game instead of fighting all the time with your hands, and then for the first time ever, you say to your parents, ~bite me~. This is a fighting game -- hard and fast, senseless and violent. It's got graphics that bleed.We've waited an eternity for a kick-ass brawler on the Game Boy Color, and while Blade may be settling for second-best compared to the killer fighters on the Genesis, SNES, Neo Geo, and in arcades back when fighting with fists was lifeblood for gamers, it still has enough punch to throw down.", "date": "Nov 30, 2000"}
