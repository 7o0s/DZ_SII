At least in the US, it's been sitting on a shelf somewhere in Nintendo of America's office waiting for the best time to ship. And in this case, the time was the first airing of the F-Zero anime on the Fox Box. Which is why the game, while certainly a worthy sequel in the F-Zero franchise, does feel a little aged for a Nintendo release. The classic F-Zero fanatics will definitely dig the new tracks and challenges since it builds off the great GBA launch title F-Zero: Maximum Velocity; just don't expect a whole lot of innovation beyond some gameplay tweaks and a broader level progression. Features Story, Grand Prix, and Time Attack modes Link cable support for four players Cartridge save (two slots)  Ever since the fast-paced, futuristic racing series made its debut on the Super NES system with the original F-Zero, every succeeding Nintendo platform -- with the exception of the Game Boy Color -- has received its own title in the franchise. F-Zero: GP Legends marks the first time the series has hit a system twice in its lifetime...at least in the US. And this game continues the series legacy of not a single bad apple in the bunch. GP Legends still keeps the action going with quick and smooth races and challenging race tracks of varying difficulty.  So what we have in F-Zero: GP Legends is an upgraded Maximum Velocity. The racing mechanics have been tweaked for the better, mostly, since Maximum Velocity did have a somewhat high difficulty curve compared to the original F-Zero. Controls pretty much remain the same from the previous game on the GBA; the game still requires a lot of shoulder-button leans into sharp turns as well as the racing mechanic that makes faster turns possible by tap-tap-tapping the A button. The boosting has been tweaked for the new game to make controlling the vehicle a little more intuitive; by tapping the L and R buttons at the same time, the vehicle will go into a ~boost mode~ for a few short seconds. Had the GBA offered one more action button the game would probably have offered more direct ~on-off~ boost control, but as it is this workaround does its job, even if the game limits the amount of boosting you can get on a near empty energy tank.    The charm of F-Zero is how well the game pulls off its Mode 7 engine, and the art that goes into portraying the many different futuristic environments. Even though GP Legends is pulling off many of the same techniques as the original F-Zero launch title of three years ago, it's still pretty impressive to see the dual-layer tracks move in perspective when taking the turns. One of these days Nintendo's going to figure out how to move the action between the upper and lower plane, but as it stands the racing takes place exclusively on the upper platform. That doesn't restrict the variety of tracks, though, and the designers manage to put a few doozies in GP Legends.   The races in GP Legends try to give the same feeling as the GameCube and Nintendo 64 F-Zero titles by noting that there are as many as 30 different racers on the same track. GBA limitations, unfortunately, keep the on-screen action to four racers at once, so this ~thirty racers~ element seems just a little fake. And though you have ~attack~ options like the console game, they don't come into play as frequently as they should...it's very difficult to successfully take out somebody using these abilities.  The game does have the unfortunate status of shipping well after the high-profile GameCube continuation, F-Zero GX, and you'd be nuts to expect a GBA rendition of that game's caliber. Still, the developers of F-Zero: GP Legends try to incorporate the GameCube title's focus on character by directly linking the GBA game with the recently-aired anime series. The Story Mode progression gives eight characters from the series its own set of missions, but they really don't mesh very well with the racing since the only thing that really changes from mission to mission is the location; it's clearly hard to offer up a lot of gameplay variety in a limited Mode 7 graphic engine.  But luckily, players aren't restricted to the story mode since GP Legends also features a fully established Grand Prix mode. It's pretty straightforward but it definitely gets challenging and tougher to win the deeper you get into this challenge. There's also a new Zero Test series of short track challenges that puts your boost and cornering skills to the test, and this mode could take several days to master. There's also, naturally, Time Attack mode, with a Ghost Save recorded for the best time for one track. And then, there's the multiplayer options requiring multiple cartridges, as well as a single cartridge option that gives players a taste test with one track that can be sent to cartridge-free GBA systems. Unfortunately, since this game was finished months ago and shelved well before the release of Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen, there's no Wireless Adapter support. Admittedly GP Legends has this overwhelming ~been there, done that~ feeling, especially for those who've played through Maximum Velocity. It's the main reason why this game doesn't score quite as high as the original GBA release did. But it's still a solid and well-designed game, even if it simply adds a few tweaks and cutscenes to an already great GBA title. At its core it's fast and challenging racer that's still fun as heck...and it's a welcome addition to the F-Zero series.", "date": "Sep 21, 2004"}
