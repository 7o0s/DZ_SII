Well, simply put, Irritating Stick is a videogame version of that carnival game where you slap down a buck and try to maneuver a metal rod through a metal maze without touching the sides. More accurately, though, Irritating Stick is the US localized version of a Japanese PlayStation game based on Dengeki Iraira Bou (Irritating Electric Stick, for those that need the direct translation)  a gameshow in Japan where you really do get electrocuted if you touch the sides.  The problem here is, most of the game's charm (if you can call it that) is based on the gameshow in Japan, which, chances are, you've probably never even knew existed. In the show, contestants try to get their rod through the maze  all the while an obnoxious color commentary guy screams at them to psych them out. And with the threat of pain always looming in their hands, it can be stressful for the participants  and humorous for the viewers.  The Japanese PlayStation version attempted to recreate that tension with a running commentary from an obnoxious commentator, as well as adding Dual Shock rumble effects for when you do hit the sides. But it isn't quite as ~fun~ to play as it is to watch.  With the US localized port, gone is the Japanese guy screaming in your ear  in his place is a mellow announcer actually congratulating you on your success. Weird...guess we Americans can't handle the insults. Gameplay  Okay, so what do you have to do in the game? Simply move a dot (it's really a rod that you're looking at head-on. But it looks like a silver dot in the game) through an electric maze using the controller. You can move it slowly or quickly by ~changing gears~ with the controller buttons (essentially you shift between five different speeds). And that's it  the only thing that changes is the look of the maze.  It's a little more controllable with the Dual Shock controller, especially when you hit the sides (where you're offered a violent rumble effect).  There are many different options in the game  including a random maze generator, which gives the game unlimited playability. But come on, the game's the same in whatever maze you're offered. Graphics:  The 3D engine is nice and detailed, though most of the power isn't used until you've hit the more expert courses where you have to maneuver through rotating spikes, around a slot machine, or around a female robot's breast (yep, I'm not making that one up). When you hit the side of the maze, you're treated to a specacular explosion cloud, and then you're offered a replay of the last few seconds of the match from a different camera angle. It's gratuitous, but pretty neat. Sound  Like I mentioned above, throughout the game a very ~American~ announcer calls out to you, saying stuff like ~Way to go!~ or ~Woah, what's going on?~ He doesn't offer too much character to the game  unlike the Japanese version of Irritating Stick, where the guy screams his head off. On the music front, it's very mellow and the beat paces you through the match. Not much to write home about, but no complaints here. Overall:  You can run down to your local toy store and buy the real thing for about 10 bucks, and as goofy as it is, the real thing takes even more skill to keep the rod from touching the sides. A videogame version of a silly carnival game? What's next, 32-bit Whack-a-Mole? This game is what we at IGN call ~Windberg Friendly,~ in honor of our extremely talented Database Administrator. Why? Irritating Stick a quirky game that appeals to gamers with tastes that go beyond the standard fare. Personally, as much as this game challenged me, and as much as I kept trying to get through the levels, I saw absolutely no reason why I would actually run down to the store and shell out cash for something like this.Irritating Stick may have appeal in Japan, but here, I only played it because I had to.", "date": "Feb 5, 1999"}
