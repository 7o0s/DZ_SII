The visuals are fine, the control is solid, and there are loads of gameplay options and some neat play mechanics being used, but the experience is almost completely devoid of what we like to think is a very important part of any game -- fun.   Gameplay It didn't get this way because there wasn't a lack of effort by the game's developers, Team 17 Software, who is probably best known for its popular Worms franchise. For the most part, Stunt GP seems to be a well thought out videogame and it definitely has a lot of things going for it.  First of all, everyone loves radio-controlled cars and this game is packed with some of the coolest looking ones that you'll see in a videogame. There are more than 15 different vehicles in all and each of them has different Stunt, Grip, and Power ratings that help make them each feel unique to drive. Things are even diversified even more when you head into the game's Championship mode where you can do things like select the team sponsor, buy different cars, and customize your vehicle by upgrading various parts.    On top of all that, the various tracks that you'll get to race on, of which there are around 24, are pretty damn cool. The tracks are based in some really unique environments and features lots of nice twists, turns, and loops.   The game also does a good job of making the player think, as you have to properly manage your boost because it'll cause your car to run out of power at a higher rate, which will in turn force you to make more pit stops. Likewise, doing tricks earns you cash that you can then use to buy the upgrades that'll become a necessity as you enter the harder races.   The general racing control is more than passable, as well. It's more of a pure-arcade racing style than something like Re-Volt was for the PC and Dreamcast, but it works well considering the game's track designs, with all of its big twists and turns, wouldn't lend itself well to something that has more real-life racing physics.    So, what's wrong with the game? Well, for one, the trick system is weak. The number of tricks that you can do is pretty much limited to things like rotating and spinning and you'll typically feel hands-off when you're doing them. The tricks feel a bit too scripted and it's not possible to adjust or correct them mid-air like in games like SSX or Rumble Racing.   Furthermore, the game really feels slow and because of this it lacks excitement. Even in tight races, which you'll get a lot because the AI is actually quite challenging, there's not really a good feeling of tension or exhilaration. Simply put, Stunt GP is pretty much devoid of fun and this is for both the game's single and two-player modes.   Graphics All this really saddens me, because I really wanted to like the game. The theme is really cool and it actually puts forth some fairly nice visuals. You're not going to look at Stunt GP and think it's some graphical beast that's a huge technical achievement, but you will look at it and think that it's a very pretty game.  The game's environments are vibrantly colored and there a lot of nice little special effects to be seen such as smoke clouds. There's also very little slowdown in the game and the framerate, while not 60, seems stay at a very respectable 30 frames per second at all times.   Sound The sound, on the other hand, is flat out unimpressive. The music is completely forgettable and the engine noises are more annoying than anything else. All the cars sound basically the same, which means that they sound like a bunch of buzzing bees. And as you can imagine, this isn't a good thing. A lot of what makes me so disappointed with Stunt GP is the fact that it was actually a game that I've been looking forward to for quite some time. It's been on my ~to-play~ list ever since it was first announced for Dreamcast and it seemed like it would've been a fun game given all of the stuff that it offers in terms of the number of cool cars and tracks and the bevy of neat play modes. Sadly, it has proven to be a humdrum experience and a game that we suggest you pass up.", "date": "Nov 17, 2001"}
