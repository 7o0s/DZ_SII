{"name": "Dr. Sudoku", "name_review": "Dr. Sudoku", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/22/dr-sudoku", "text": "Sudoku is a word that's quickly becoming this century's ~Scrabble,~ but without all the messy legality wranglings of a trademarkable word. Every newspaper in the world prints up one or two Sukoku puzzles a day, and for many people addicted to the challenge, one or two puzzles a day just isn't nearly enough to relieve the Sudoku itch. There are plenty of other non-newspaper outlets for Sudoku challenges, including virtual ones like the one that Mastiff has produced for the Game Boy Advance. Dr. Sudoku is everything you'd expect out of a version of the puzzle that doesn't use a pen and paper - hundreds of puzzles and a custom puzzle creator are the highlights of this budget package. It's not as accessible as a paperback book bought at a dollar store, but it's a far more compact way of getting your Sudoku on.   But what is Sudoku? Simply put, it's a number puzzle where players use the given clues to arrange numbers one through nine in each row, column, and every three by three grid in a nine by nine game board. No number can be duplicated in those locations, which means there's only one answer to each sudoku puzzle. It's a simple concept with a gazillion different ways to play, and each puzzle's ranked in difficulty based on the clues given from the start.   A sudoku challenge needs about as much processing power as an oven timer and as much memory space as a phone redialer, so the fact that you're getting several Sudoku puzzles on the Game Boy Advance isn't really all that impressive. Impressive wouldn't be a word to describe this package: adequate is. Dr. Sudoku has a streamlined user interface to make entering numbers one through nine on a 81-square grid as easy as a few taps on the D-pad and A buttons. The designers add in a simple tutorial for those who don't ~get it~ right from the start, and for those that know the game the developers make it simple to put tiny numerical notes in the squares.   It might be a little too handholding as the game will always alert players when a duplicate number's been entered into a slot, and refuse to enter that number into that square when it happens. This definitely works well for people with horrible sudoku-based organization skills, but as a recreation of the newspaper experience it's not entirely accurate. And for those who might want to take their learned sudoku skills from Dr. Sudoku to the paper form, the fact that the game held their hand throughout the challenge may make the transition a little awkward.   The create-a-puzzle mode's pretty cool, though, as players can lay out their own set of numbers and remove enough to make twenty of their own challenges. The game will keep a constant eye out to check if the puzzle is solvable in the form you lay out. But since there's no link cable option, the puzzle created stays in the cartridge used - this would have been a prime opportunity for a download play option to cartridge-free GBA systems.  I honestly don't think it's possible for a Sudoku compilation to floor GBA owners, because youre pretty much going to experience everything that you're expecting to get. Dr. Sudoku is a fine collection of puzzles that'll last you a very, very long time  a thousand predefined puzzles and an extra 20 custom challenges to create makes this title one beefy package. It's not a better option than snagging a five dollar book and a ten cent pencil, though.", "date": "May 22, 2006"}
