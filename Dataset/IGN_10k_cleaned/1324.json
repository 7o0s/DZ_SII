The success of Baldur's Gate left little doubt that there was to be a sequel. There were whispers and ~off the record~ comments about it at E3 1999, a great behind closed doors showing at E3 2000, and as it loomed closer and closer over the horizon the last several months, hordes of in-game screen shots saturated popular gaming websites. But, until someone actually played it, the questions still stood--is it any good? Did they do it again? Is Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn better than Baldur's Gate? After weeks of intense play, and countless hours mercilessly stripped from my life, I can triumphantly say, ~Yes! It is better~...and there are many reasons why.   Seeing as Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a sequel, it picks up right where Baldur's Gate left off. Well, almost. When you wake up, you find yourself locked in a cage, subject to ghastly experiments performed by an evil wizard. You are a godchild, son of the God of Murder...a title not likely to make you many friends. While the wizard is distracted by an attack on his stronghold by assassins, Imoen, your childhood friend, escapes from a neighboring cell and sets you free. You can't remember why you're even in the dungeon, but you know you need to escape. Old friends are trapped in neighboring cells, and once you set them free, it's a hard-fought quest to escape from the jail. The beginning sequence alone can take hours and it's entertaining, but to be truthful, it's nothing outstanding. Get past the first area and you emerge in the great city of Athkatla, the capital of Amn. This is where it starts getting really superb. The city of Athkatla is massive, absolutely huge, and you can spend 60 hours (at least) just doing side quests within the city, simply enjoy exploring around.  I can honestly say that Baldur's Gate II is better than Baldur's Gate, or nearly all other RPG's I can name, not simply because it's a few years newer, and not just because of enhanced technology, but because of superior design and effort. Aside from basic gameplay mechanics and general plotlines, BG and BGII share few similarities. They are two very different beasts. They are both RPG's--yes. They both use the Infinity engine--yes (except now it's much prettier and believable). And, admittedly, they are both AD&D. However, they have made so many great changes that it's made me cranky each time I've thought about sitting down to write this review--where do I even start?   Why not with the graphics? They're gorgeous. The comparison between Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II is astounding--like looking at a still oil painting, and then turning to see the scene in living motion on a big screen TV. City commoners have lives, stained-glass windows shine like prisms on church floors, statues hold spinning orbs of fire (which reflect over everything in the room), clock gears grind and groan. What we began to see in bits and pieces in Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale now arrives in full glory and force, as they have mastered the effects and capabilities of the Infinity engine. The resolution is bumped to 800x600, though 640x480 is still available, and this by itself makes a very noticeable difference. You can play the game at even higher resolutions, though it's not recommended because it makes everything so small. Environments are fascinating, and they range from marble churches to dense rainforest. Spell effects are 3D accelerated, and many environments now have moving features. The movies are also high quality--not quite up there with Diablo II, but still very respectable. Overall, it's an impressive visual display.   Anyone who plays an RPG knows that the characters are at the heart of the experience.  Because of this, you can spend hours on character creation. Really. There are now three entirely new classes, three sub-classes (~kits~) for nearly every class, and even a new race. Half-Orcs make for superb ~kill-'em-all-and-let-God-sort-'em-out~ fighters, and are ridiculously tough. The new classes are potent and deadly. The Monk specializes in unarmed hand-to-hand combat (Bruce Lee fans look no further), Barbarians berserk wildly into battle, and Sorcerers don't need to memorize spells. Instead they intuitively know and use them from raw talent. To name just a handful of the kits, Fighters now have Wizard Slayers, Rangers can be Beast Masters, Paladins have Undead Hunters, and Thieves can opt to be Assassins. The kits are powerful, and most players will find that they will gain much more using a kit rather than sticking to the plain-vanilla standard class. With all the new choices, it's much easier to create a character that's uniquely you, and one that accurately reflects your play style and preferences. Alignments haven't changed, but you can now choose a few new weapon proficiencies, the sexiest being the Katana. It will be a popular pick, but it's stated quite clearly throughout the game and manual that magical Katanas will be exceedingly rare--and, honestly, they are. The cool factor on the Katana is way of the scale, but having a skill without a weapon to utilize it is useless, so sticking to something more practical, like the long sword, will probably be more effective for most players. Finally, and certainly not least important, players can now choose to wield two weapons at the same time. Now you can be like that wacky Blademaster in the fantasy movie Willow. If you spend some weapon proficiencies in two-weapon style fighting, you can use the extra blade with less of a penalty. It hurts early on to be without the extra defense that the shield provides, but later on in the game a quick, burly fighter can slash through a group of Ogres like a hurricane.  Players of the original Baldur's Gate can also import their previous party into Baldur's Gate II and continue the adventure. This is sure to be a hit with the more hardcore RPG crowd.   Baldur's Gate II is easily the longest game I've ever played. There hasn't been an RPG this long since Daggerfall. The number I keep hearing from PR people and Bioware/Black Isle designers is 200 hours, but I've got a feeling it will be much more than that for your average player. That's not even counting folks that will want to replay the game with different characters. Many gamers will want to replay at least a portion of the game after they beat it simply to see what other races, player classes, and kits feel like. At certain critical points in the game, a single decision can have a profound affect on the outcome of the game, so players will undoubtedly want to replay those situations and try something different. Any way you look at it, as far as bang for your buck, you aren't going to beat 200 hours of gameplay for fifty dollars. It all comes down to quests.   Computer role-playing game quests and dialogues are usually very predictable. Avid RPG gamers almost immediately know exactly what they are supposed to do or say in a plot-critical situation--you do the ~right~ thing to get the reward. Baldur's Gate II is nothing like this, and I love that. There were many situations where I was confronted with a decision that I had a terrible time figuring out what the best answer was. It was never as cut and dry as, ~Join the good guys or help the bad guys.~ Once, I took a break to make a sandwich after being posed with such a question, and I caught myself standing there thinking, ~What should I do?~ That's roleplaying. That's how it should be. Even after I made a decision, I still wouldn't know if I made the ~right~ one. Or, even if there was a ~right~ choice. Baldur's Gate II is still not a completely open-ended RPG--it's very, very difficult to play a truly evil character and still survive--but it's a very healthy step toward that goal. A word on quests: after reading my preview of BG2, one reader wrote to me saying he couldn't stand the way Baldur's Gate handled quests. He felt, in particular, that it wasn't always clear where at any moment you were supposed to be and which quests were ~plot critical.~ This is simply not the case in Baldur's Gate II--it's always clear where you need to be, whom you need to speak to, and what you need to accomplish. And, if you forget or if you've taken a break for a few days, you've got a running journal and quest scroll that you can always refer back to. Bioware handled the problems and shortcomings of Baldur's Gate nicely, particularly in this case.    Outstanding voice acting has been a hallmark of RPGs produced by Bioware and Black Isle, and of course, Baldur's Gate II is no exception. The characters that join you throughout your journey all have a distinct style and voice, and it's the phrases, arguments, and battlecries of the party that get you so attached to them. Just as Baldur's Gate had it's own famous catch phrases like ~Go for the eyes, Boo!,~ Baldur's Gate II has many of its own. The only major disappointment is the lack of many more new voices for use with character creation. Although, you are able to import your own sound and voice files if you feel venturesome.    The music is tightly interwoven into gameplay, and it's obvious that designers wanted to give it high priority and visibility--much more so than in Baldur's Gate. The songs are dramatic, brooding classical pieces of the style that you'd find in a medieval themed movie. The sound effects are all generally good, though they aren't as much of a focal point as the music. If you've got a sound card that supports Environmental Audio, the echo effects in the cavernous dungeons are quite convincing.   The sheer variety of monsters is astounding. Because they opted to use the Infinity engine, they were able to use all of the monsters from previous Infinity engine games. On top of the already dizzying number of monsters that entails, they've added even more. Many of the new monsters are physically huge, towering over your party. The Giants alone must be three or four times taller than your character, and Dragons take up half the screen!  Enemy Mages cast deadly, high level spells, which makes for some hairy Mage vs. Mage spell battles. Later on, you'll find your high level Baldur's Gate II characters battling demons and other hellish creatures that would have slaughtered your entire Baldur's Gate party.   The further and further you delve into the lands of Amn, the more and more obscenely powerful your Mage's spells will become. Mere fireballs look weak in comparison to incendiary clouds, death fogs, and bolts of chain lightning. From the very beginning Mages are capable of summoning powerful animals  such as Wyverns and Dire Wolves. Later, Mages are capable of unleashing Fiends and Cacodemons. Wish spells grant your wizard whatever he commands (though watch out what you wish for, because it might come true!). Near the end, powerful Mages can kill with a single word. Clearly, Mages are very powerful classes in Baldur's Gate II, but designers were careful to keep them within balance. Mages can now summon familiars (magical animal servants), a feature that pen & paper AD&D players have wanted in CRPGs from the beginning. Familiars are well implemented, and while they are of limited strength, they are always a laugh to talk to  particularly those that are of evil nature. Familiars range from house Cats and Rabbits to Pseudo Dragons and Imps, depending on the spiritual alignment of the Mage. If the familiar dies, though, the Mage loses one point of constitution permanently.    Thankfully, multiplayer play is still strong and enjoyable. It will be a big hit on the LAN party scene - playing cooperatively is a blast. Just make sure you plan multiple sessions, as it's a little big for one sitting, or 10 for that matter. Players wanting to play by themselves through the game with a party entirely created by them can also use the multiplayer function. It's easy to get a highly powerful party going comprised of only your characters, but you will miss out on a few of the side quests that depend on having particular characters in your party.   Because your party starts off at such a high level, even the weapons found fairly early into Baldur's Gate II are much more powerful than the best weapons of Baldur's Gate. In addition to the new types of weapons available, namely the Katana, you can now purchase gem bags and scroll cases to store your booty. This comes in handy on those extended dungeon crawls. Weapons and armor show up accurately on characters on the main screen and all of the magical items have interesting histories and descriptions written about them. It must have been a massive undertaking to add this many items into the game, and it certainly paid off.   Something must be said about the manual  it is enormous. Weighing in at a beefing 263 pages, it is a spiral-bound tome. Most of the manual is taken up with the explanation of all the spells, but it also includes very adequate amounts of information on every other aspect of the title.  Performance is respectable, but not flawless. For instance, on a Pentium2 450, the game ran fairly smoothly in 800x600, but did tank a bit in intense battles involving a lot of spellcraft or dazzling backgrounds. On a slower machine you may want to switch to 640x480, and faster machines should be able to take advantage of better visual effects. Bugs were nearly nonexistent, showcasing further the attention to quality that went into the title.  Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is not as beautiful or artful as Planescape: Torment. It's not as revolutionary to the genre as the original Baldur's Gate. Though, truly revolutionary titles are so rarely polished and well groomed that I can count the few that come to mind on a single hand, and artful, well-written games aren't always as fun or long. In many ways, Baldur's Gate II is the culmination of the powerful RPG renaissance that's been driving the genre over the last several years a rebirth that originally started with its predecessor, Baldur's Gate. It redefines attention to detail, game balance, longevity, and spit and polish. It's not overbearing in its creativity, and it's not paper thin. In the end, it's simply a superb role-playing experience--one of the best. There's not much you can compare it to.  Baldur's Gate II has no peers. It commands your attention and will command your life for months. It's exactly the RPG I've been waiting for.   -- Erik Peterson      Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Baldur's Gate is a very worthwhile download for the more casual RPG fan, as I would suspect the majority of cellphone gamers are. If you're looking for a huge, deep RPG, you probably know that you beter start looking at your PC or at a game like Fable. But if you want an adventure with definite D&D trimmings that can be consumed in bite-sized portions, look to Baldur's Gate. Think of it as a companion piece to your PC and console RPGs, a way to take swords and sorcery on the bus. It has a good length, decent graphics, and smart game play.", "date": "Oct 10, 2000"}
