{"name": "Neves", "name_review": "Neves Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/neves-review", "text": "Neves (Seven spelled backwards) is a familiar real-world tile puzzle game that challenges players to piece together seven specifically shaped angular tiles to form a given shape. It's not exactly Sudoku, but it's a puzzle that's pretty popular in Japan, and it's popular enough (and lacking in intellectual property licenses) for a development team to build a Nintendo DS version for an on-the go edition. Neves is straightforward and challenging with dozens upon dozens of puzzles to solve. Its biggest problem - apart from the truly dreadful soundtrack playing in the background - is that it's priced way too high to be recommended. What's released at 30 dollars retail should really be $20 bucks maximum.   The Nintendo DS game is relatively simple production: after a basic training level showing how you use the touch screen to slide, rotate and flip tiles around the playing field, you're left to work your way through the list of pictures - anything from bunnies to numbers to Japanese characters - to match the image with the seven different tiles by - you guessed it - sliding, rotating, and flipping them. You can play the puzzles in three different ways: in three minute time limits, in a seven-move limit, or simply no limitations at all. The ~no limits~ way lets you play the game at your own pace, but it'll never keep track of just how well you performed in the task - at least the time limit and seven-move mode notes some sort of ~high score~ progress.   Neves is good fun, but a little too much for the wallet at $30.   It's basic but there's definitely this simple appeal about Neves, and it's been well-developed for what it is: really easy and responsive controls, and tons of puzzles to complete.  There's even a competitive edge involved with its single cartridge two player mode where you battle in a three-puzzle challenge against another system. The developers try to get right down to the action with a barebones presentation for the ~casual~ crowd, but unfortunately the experience is butchered with one of the most annoyingly blaring jazz soundtracks heard in a videogame. It wrecks the game's ~simplistic~ approach, and the tunes just sound awful and wouldn't be good for any game. There's a volume control on the DS for a reason, and this game needs it.Fun? Yes. Appealing to the casual crowd? Yes. Worth a purchase? Yeswith a ~but.~ Neves is a addictive puzzle game that's not the usual DS fare, but it's just ten bucks too expensive - this game needs to be at the ~simple fun~ price of Brain Age and Tetris and other basic Nintendo DS games. There's nothing in Neves that justifies its higher pricepoint, and it's a little greedy for Yuke's to assume what could have been a design included in a larger collection of puzzles can stand on its own as a high price DS game. Wait for a pricedrop, then pounce.", "date": "Nov 13, 2007"}
