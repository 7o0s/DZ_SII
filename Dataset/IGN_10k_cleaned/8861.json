Arriving this week for a mere 400 Microsoft Points ($5USD), virtual athletes around the world will surely restart their button mashing training regime, but this time around, I don't recommend players do much mashing, at least not on any buttons.   For the few readers unfamiliar with Track and Field, the game revolves around one to four players competing in six events--the arthritis-inducing 100 Meter Dash and near impossible Hammer throw, among others. In order to progress to the next event, players must meet a qualifying score in each event, lest the Game Over screen rear its ugly head. By pounding on the game's Run buttons, players aim to get their athletes to a level of speed and power attainable only by the modern world's impressive gallery of steroid-using athletes.   The fundamental problem with Track and Field on Xbox Live Arcade--more specifically, the problem with playing the game using the Xbox 360 controller--lies in the lack of proper button sensitivity. Although every button in the game can be re-mapped via the game's Settings menu, none of the buttons are sensitive enough for the game's main selling point--button mashing--to take effect. It simply takes too much effort to mash buttons in this game. By default, the two Run keys are set to A and B, so I tried moving them to the shoulder buttons. No good. Bumpers? Negative. Left and right on the controller's d-pad is always available, though these keys also required too much force. Sure, button mashing is supposed to be exhausting, but the process of experimenting with button configurations just to render the game playable was quickly growing tiresome.   Button mashing begins with 100 meters. In the end, I--along with the other Editors, whose collective excitement at playing this classic game was also draining away faster than Barry Bonds' hopes of passing a urine test--opted to go with another of the game's default control settings, one that is available independent of any changed button mappings--the left analog stick. Wiggling the stick left and right is a great substitution for mashing actual buttons, and I quickly found that rhythm, not necessarily quickness, worked well in upping the speed of my athletic avatar. Simply hold the controller as normal and use your thumb to alternate quickly--but not too quickly--between left and right. Not too much exertion, but just enough to get your athlete properly pumped up to do well in each event.   Additionally, due to rhythm taking precedence over wrist-shattering quickness, gamers should find that they won't have to slam on their analog stick as roughly as they would the buttons; which is good, since I'm pretty certain that ruining analog sticks isn't high on any console owner's list.   Though fully playable over Xbox Live, I found playing Track and Field to be most enjoyable by experiencing the game properly: in a crowded room crammed with friends. Laughter, popping knuckles, and groans accompanied by lots of wrist massages add to Track and Field's competitive yet friendly atmosphere. The only thing missing is the NES version's power pad. In the spirit of setting goals and then surpassing them, the game's Achievements emphasize meeting certain benchmarks in each event. Finishing the 100 Meter Dash in less than ten seconds, jumping a certain distance in the Long Jump, and killing the Easter egg bird in the Javelin Throw event are all accomplishments that will net gamers a fair amount of Gamer Points.   Of minor note and annoyance is a timing bug that exists when registering player initials. If players take longer than around ten to fifteen seconds to enter their names, the game will enter a pack of letters for each player and start the first event. One or two players will usually have enough time to enter their data properly, but with three or four, this ~bug~--probably left over from the game's arcade timer system--becomes quite aggravating.Despite not retaining its classic precedence for how button mashers should be played, Track and Field remains a decent party game to this day, as the analog stick is a good substitution to using buttons. It's still fun, but not as much as it was during its old school days.  Gaming's standards have gone through a lot of changes since then, and chances are, so have yours.", "date": "Aug 6, 2007"}
