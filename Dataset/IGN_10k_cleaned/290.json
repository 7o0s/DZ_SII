{"name": "Industrial Spy: Operation Espionage", "name_review": "Espion-Age-Nts", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/06/espion-age-nts", "text": "After a noticeable dearth of decent titles in the Land of the Rising Sun, Japanese gamers set their gameplay hopes on the upcoming action-strategy-fest from NEC, Espion-Age-Nts. Backed by a heavy advertising campaign, the game looked like a solid mix between the Metal Gear Solid and Rainbow Six models, stylistically backed by boatloads of Anime characters and plenty of missions. Then again, it's from the people who brought you Sengoku Turb -- and we all know how well that one turned out. In any case, the final version is in the hands of Japanese gamers, and it's time to sit down (with our Japanese dictionary in hand) and give it a good, solid run-through.  Here's the story: it's some time in the future, and a series of troublesome mega-corporations have teamed together to rule the world. Of course, evil companies can never play nice, and they rely on a series of shifty special-agent folks to backstab each other. Or, as the game's intro states, ~It's the why addicted themselves to conspiring with industrial spy organizations and increased such plot in force.~ Uh, okay.  In any case, you're the boss of the Esipon-Age-Nts, a jolly group of bad boys (and girls), whose specialties range from electronics to explosives. Picking the right agent for the job is the key to success here  while an all-rounder will be able to get you through most sticky situations, you'll want to have several specialists on your four-man teams. For example, the ten-year-old boy-genius Archangel can hack computers like a bat out of hell, but don't expect him to last a second in a firefight [Ed's note: Unless, of course, it's with the Power Students...]. And if one of your agents dies in the midst of a mission, it's back to the title screen  you'll have to restart and go at it all over again.  The game's main screen brings back memories of the Epyx classic LA Crackdown on the Commodore 64  each agent has their own screen, which can be enlarged into a bigger viewing window by using the triggers on the Dreamcast controller. Each view corresponds to a security camera in the building, and there are occasional fuzz-outs where you're blind to your agents' activities. Pressing the A button brings up a menu where you can instruct your troops where to go and what to do. Orders can be given in real-time, though pressing the pause button brings up an overhead map so you can think things out (and it's a godsend, especially in the timed missions).  The typical Espion-Age-Nts mission involves plenty of hacking, pseudo-stealth, and cold-blooded ass-whuppin'. Unfortunately, all control is done on a room-by-room basis  don't expect Tomb Raider-style third person control. Combat is also reduced to its basics, and battles are performed via menu selections, in RPG style.  Also true to its RPG roots, Espion-Age-Nts gives each character a set number of hit points, and ~skill points.~ These are used for special events such as lock-picking and hacking, and regenerate over time. I know all this sounds cool, but is it fun? Kinda. It's certainly not up to the brilliance of Rainbow Six (or most of the squad-based combat games out there, for that matter), and there are plenty of flaws, including dirt-stupid artificial ~intelligence.~ In one instance, one of my characters was walking down a hallway, and was about to step over a barricade. Suddenly, a guard walked out a nearby door, and instead of attacking, walked right through my character and into another room. What's up with that? Most guards don't even bother to follow you, and turning tail and running two rooms away guarantees a successful evasion. Not much challenge there.  And apparently, there wasn't much of a challenge presented to the art team behind this one, as the game's visuals won't be winning any awards, either. This looks like a bad N64 game, with drab, low-polygon environments, ho-hum special effects, and character models that are less than stunning. We understand that the polygon count had to be kept down, since four gameplay windows are running simultaneously  but there's no excuse for Espion-Age-Nts looking as bad as it does. And don't get me started on the music, which consists of some of the crappiest PCM tunes I've heard since the Genesis version of Virtua Fighter 2.  So is there any major reason for you to call up your local importer, and snag a copy of Espion-Age-Nts? Not really. In the later missions, there's a somewhat interesting sci-fi angle, which adds hypnosis attacks and other abilities that border on the supernatural  but considering the ho-hum, played-it-all-before gameplay, you'd be better off holding off for Rainbow Six to make its Dreamcast debut.  -- Colin Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 6, 1999"}
