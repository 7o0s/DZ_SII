After jumping through time in the excellent TimeSplitters 2 and battling space pirates in Metroid Prime, owners of Nintendo's little box will now be able to join the Allied troops on their quest to free Europe from the Nazi occupation. An almost 1:1 port of this summer's PlayStation 2 version, Medal of Honor is a valuable addition to the GameCube lineup in that it broadens the platform's appeal to older gamers, but it's far from perfect.  The Facts  Six WWII missions with 20 levels of gameplay  Based on actual World War II events Over 20 authentic WWII weapons, including the Springfield Sniper Rifle, the Panzershrek rocket launcher, and the classic Browning automatic rifle Enemy vehicles including Panzer and Tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles, and railway scout cars Player-driven motorized rail car, train, and mine cart Stealth-based infiltration missions Over 70 minutes of original orchestral music composed by Michael Giacchino 4-player multiplayer mode Authentic WWII content   Gameplay The third in the series (but the first on a Nintendo platform), Medal of Honor: Frontline places you in the role of Lt. Jimmy Patterson as you infiltrate the German frontline in hopes of stealing the HO-IX, an experimental German weapon with enough power to potentially change the course of the war.  Oh, and in case you're wondering, this is based on real-life events.    In the first realtime cutscene, you're placed in the first-person perspective of Jimmy Patterson. At first you can only move his head around to see the environment around you, with feet stuck in place. You're truly a captive audience, passive to the events around you. In a matter of seconds, bullets fly from German towers, the sea smashes up against your boat, and before you know it, the nearest drop-ship is blown to bits, it knocks into your boat, pushing it off course. Quickly after, a bomb explodes your vessel, sending everyone overboard, and from underwater, you watch German bullets slaughter your squad. You are finally able to move and slosh toward the captain who gives you orders and the rest follows much like the first scene from the movie Saving Private Ryan. That's just the beginning.   Although much more story and mission based than classic FPS games, Medal of Honor is a first-person shooter and does little to deviate from the path it lays forth.  You essentially go from mission to mission, being briefed either by text or by voice-over, and kill everything you see.  While certain missions require you to say, sabotage vehicles, or disarm bombs on a bridge, this amounts to little more than walking up to the object and pressing the A button, which acts as a generic context-sensitive action button.    But while the story plays a bigger role than in the good old FPS games of yore, the game is actually still very linear. There is only one way to go, and that is forward.  No branching paths or choices to make. Sometimes you have to ~figure~ out what to do, but this is never really a problem. For example, in one mission your job is to meet up with an informant. You are in a room with the informant, but cannot talk to him freely because there are German soldiers standing around. So what do you do? You can walk around the room until you reach an object that causes an action button prompt to show up, telling you what to do -- or you can press the back button which will essentially tell you what to do. Sure, this keeps things simple and the action moving, but some real decision-making would have been nice.    There are also moments where you wish you could be a little stealthier -- and the game AI would act a little more realistic. Even when you try your hardest and kill someone with a silenced pistol in an empty room, enemies that are literally rooms away will be aware of your presence. If you walk up to a room very slowly and creep around a wall, the soldiers seem to be aware of you, triggered more by your distance and less by sight and sound. This becomes incredibly obvious when you reach certain levels where there will be enemies directly in front of you with no obstructions, but not realize you are there because you are not close enough to them. Sadly, this overly simple AI behavior damages the feeling of realism that Medal of Honor tries so hard to maintain.   There are other times when the enemy AI gets in the way of realism. Shooting a soldier will cause others near him to run and hide, but all you have to do is wait and eventually they will come out of their spot, ready for you to take them down. Those Nazis are forgetful folks... Strangely, there were a couple of occasions where we took out several people in a large room without alerting anyone. One by one they went down without even so much a glance from anyone else in the room. Better AI routines could have made some of the battles a little more tense, but again, you battle so many soldiers you're almost glad they're not the sharpest pencils in the box. What this boils down to is that battles are intense and challenging because of sheer numbers rather than intelligence. Not necessarily a bad thing, just different.  Controlling your character through the game is a standard affair. Like most first-person shooters, the left analog stick move your character, while the C Stick is used for aiming. Right trigger fires, and the left trigger switches aiming modes, assuming the gun supports it. Y is used for jumping and X makes you crouch. While the game is very playable, the control could have used some more tweaking. After playing games with an optional ~floating reticule~ like TimeSplitters 2, Medal of Honor's overly twitchy control system feels archaic and entirely too digital. Add to that the slightly dodgy collision detection and you've got two of the main reasons why the gameplay doesn't quite live up to amazing presentation. Despite these limitations, the game isn't too difficult to beat. You can press start anytime during a mission to see an objectives checklist, or press back to receive a hint on where to go or what to do. As mentioned before, these hints will tell you outright what you need to do, and come in handy on a few occasions where the objective is a little vague. Not a problem solving, ~how do I do that?~ kind of vague, but more of a ~which dock is dock 2?~ kind of vague.        But then there is a whole other side of Medal of Honor. The side that makes you feel like you're one ~of the guys~, taking on a technically superior and huge enemy force. Bullets whiz past your ears, a grenade detonates right next to you -- and you feel like you're really there. In the end, Medal of Honor succeeds despite its flaws. The intense action and authentic feel almost make you forget the control and AI issues. Here's hoping the inevitable sequel will finally address these problems (which have been part of the MOH series since the first game hit PlayStation) and create a game where presentation and gameplay go hand in hand to create the ultimate WWII shooter.  Multiplayer Exclusive to the Xbox and GameCube versions of the game is a new multiplayer mode, where up to four people can go at it split-screen. You can customize weapon sets, the map you want to play, the time limit, kill counts, whether there is friendly fire, and the music you want to listen to. Unfortunately, the only mode is deathmatch and even that one is poorly done.  Why?  Well, first off, the levels are just pieces of the single-player maps and are not designed for strategic multiplayer play.  Some levels are too big, while others are too small, and sometimes they are either too cramped.    Medal of Honor Frontline on GCN  The weapons are also a problem. The guns in the game were not made for quick, multi-player gameplay, and as a result cause the action to slow down as you are fighting to constantly reload while avoiding enemy fire. Not too fun.  Some original, well-thought-out maps and new weapons would have really helped immensely. Instead, what we're left with is a tacked-on, choppy, and unbalanced multiplayer mode that feels more like running around the story levels, just without as many enemies. Too bad.    Graphics Medal of Honor: Frontline is a port of the PlayStation 2 version, and it shows. The most apparent aspect of this is the texture quality. Muddy textures run rampant throughout the levels, especially in the environments, though less in the character models. Things look pretty good when viewed from a distance, but get up close and some of the textures look plain awful. For example, the ocean seen in the very first mission is a sheet of blurry blue textures, with no effects applied to it that makes it even remotely look like water.   The character models on the other hand look much better.  While not all that detailed, the soldiers' uniforms look good with their war-torn patches and wrinkled looks, and their facial models look more or less human-like. The character animations, while not perfect, are also done well, especially the death animations. Shooting a Nazi at point-blank range with a shotgun, and watching him sprawl across the wall before slowing falling to his knees, then on his face, goes a long way in making the game seem real. There are a few bugs with the animation system, though. For example, sometimes shooting a soldier in the head will cause him to go through an animation routine used when being shot in the chest.         One area where the game has improved from its previous incarnation is the framerate. On the PS2, Medal of Honor: Frontline ran at an inconsistent 30 fps. On GameCube, it runs quite a bit smoother, though it does falter during times of intense action, or when there are a good number of characters in the immediate area. There are also a few areas where the framerate will dip consistently, even though nothing is really happening onscreen.  Nothing major, just an observation.  What really hurts the visuals are the extremely bad clipping and collision detection problems. Take down an enemy and they just may fall through the wall behind him or even the floor. There were also a couple of occasions where the character could either walk entirely through another soldier, or be blocked by an invisible wall in front of an open path.   It's too bad that Medal of Honor: Frontline couldn't have been reworked to make use of any GameCube-specific effects and more detailed textures and models.  Given the gritty setting and the authentic feel, this could have been a really visually stunning game. Even with all its graphical flaws, the game is not a terrible looking game, and still works as a whole. If you let yourself get caught up in your mission and the story, the graphics do a good job of recreating the environments and making you feel like you're reliving World War II.        Sound This is where Medal of Honor: Frontline really excels. First, the score: composed by Michael Giacchino and performed by the NorthWest Symphonia, the game's score is outstanding and sets a new benchmark for story-driven action games. Ranging from subtle and brooding to vibrant and triumphant, the score does wonders in creating the mood for each of the levels. Take the music in the ~Yard by Yard~ level for example. The staccato strings layered on top of the legato melody, along with the tight roll of the snare, almost tell a story of their own. Creating tension and excitement, you can't help but feel like you're part of an epic adventure. There are few games that can surpass the aural quality of Medal of Honor: Frontline, let alone match it.  Exceptionally well done.  The sound effects are also of a very high caliber and act as icing on the cake. The different guns all sound unique, yet all deadly. From the smooth swip of the silenced pistol to the moving boom of the Gewehr 43, the weapon sounds really make you feel each shot you take.  Equally as good are the ambient level sounds and the voice acting. Hearing your fellow soldiers give you instructions or listening as a group of drunk Nazis take part in an old German song is a treat. It sounds very authentic and only sweetens the overall soundtrack even more.  Like the PS2 version, Medal of Honor: Frontline runs in Dolby Pro-Logic Surround on GameCube. Although not quite as good as the Xbox version, the game sports great surround separation and a punchy sound that'll give your DPL receiver a nice little workout. Behind you, to the left, far, or near, everything sounds clear and crisp. The opening ~Saving Private Ryan~ beach level is an excellent showcase of the game's directional and spatial sound effects, and will leave you with sweating with a thumping heart. Truly epic.            Even with all its faults, Medal of Honor Frontline is successful at what it attempts to do: recreate a time and tell a good story along the way. Sure, it's linear (so was Halo, and even Half-life), but sometimes that is the most effective way to present a story. By forcing the player to follow a predetermined path, developers can set up pre-scripted events that can make for a much more dramatic presentation, and that is just what was done here. Like watching a good Hollywood movie, some people like to sit back and escape reality without having to do too much thinking in the process. So, make yourself comfortable, turn off the lights, turn up the speakers, and get ready to be whisked away to 1940's Germany.", "date": "Nov 12, 2002"}
