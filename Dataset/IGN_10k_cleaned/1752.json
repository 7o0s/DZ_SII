But I won't, because, honestly, some corpses have been kicked hard enough around here.  The thing of it is, though, the American version of Driving Emotion Type-S is a pretty fair job of redeeming on the part of its developers at Escape (the Square-affiliated team responsible in the past for Racing Lagoon).  The import version was arguably the worst PS2 game money could buy for a while there.  Even Surfroid, rot though it was, could actually be played for a little while, which you could not say for Type-S.  It would have racked up something between a 1 and a 2 on the usually very generous IGN review scale.  What we're playing now, in contrast, is not anywhere near perfect, and can't hold a candle in the long term to Gran Turismo 3, but this is now a very pretty racing game that some players could definitely get into.  It's still a violently quirky little creation, and I still bemusedly wonder why the developers decided to make it play this way, but I'll freely admit to acquiring at least a mild addiction to Type-S.  It's certainly worth a rental for racing fans, and who knows what might happen after that?  Gameplay The developers of Type-S have, in the American version, traded a completely bollixed handling model for one that's still pretty funky.  To explain, in case you missed the Japanese version, in its original form the game was completely unplayable.  It absolutely, positively did not work -- we argued many a time over how on earth it got through Square and Sony QA, coming to the eventual conclusion that there must have been heavy bribery and perhaps Yakuza intimidation involved.  There was almost no sensation of contact between the cars and the road (a bit like driving on ice with bald tires), and the steering did not recenter itself.  Seriously, it was the bastard child of Gran Turismo and Super Sprint -- it called out for the big whirly arcade steering wheel they used in that one, which you might also remember from Super Off-Road and Death Race 2000.      The steering now recenters itself, and it looks like they've salted the roads a little, so it is in fact possible to get around the course and even win a race.  It sounds like a simple thing, but trust me, this is a quantum leap, relatively speaking.  The handling in Type-S is still very much an acquired taste, though.  It has hints of Sega GT in it now, its very sensitive steering and brutal collision response.  As in Sega GT, you should avoid the walls in Type-S like the plague -- a few small bumps can render the race effectively over if you're up against tight competition.  The sensation of weight is very different, though. Sega GT's cars had the heavy feel you get from Gran Turismo, whereas everything in Type-S seems to weigh about 20 pounds, giving you little sensation of contact with the road and plenty of potential for oversteer.  Even a relatively low-power FF car, something like the Civic Type R or FTO GP R, is capable of absolutely insane drift.  The cars hurl themselves around the track like refugees from Daytona, which means you have to handle them with an extremely light touch.  Oversteer once and you'll face either a spinout and complete stop or a long session of whim-whamming off both walls as you repeatedly overcorrect.  Generally, that means the race is over.  Sometimes, not, though -- the difficulty level is...very, very odd.  There's a touch of the Ricky Carmichael syndrome, where one racer dominates far beyond the stated capabilities of its automobile.  Other times, the difficulty of a given race will vary for no reason depending on which car you drive in it.  In one race, I was repeatedly beaten in a Civic Type R.  I switched to a BMW 328ci, a heavier, slower car, and suddenly one easily.  The next race I set to, furthermore, was the dead opposite of the first problem -- in an Integra Type R against comparable opponents, I won by almost a quarter of a lap in a two-lap race.  I'll usually take a win however I can get it, but I dislike the feeling that a game is intentionally going easy on me, just so it can pounce and beat me stupid in the next race.  Wins are rewarded well in Type-S, though, with an abundant supply of new cars (50+, including rides from Ferrari and Porsche) and new tracks (more than 10, including circuits and autocross tracks).  The courses are a blend of reality and fictional creations, including famous real-life circuits like Tsukuba and Suzuka (complete with that brutal little dogleg that you might remember from Moto GP), and their difficulty level ramps up pretty smoothly, even if you can't say the same for the opponents you race on them.  You move gently from long straights and smooth curves to tight esses and hairpins, and if you're stuck, you can always try out the handy ~Line Training~ mode, which teaches you the all-important racing line for a given track.   Graphics Type-S is one of the earliest PlayStation 2 games, and it has a good deal of the background aliasing that you see in games from that timeframe, but it's mostly just a shimmering effect, rather than the more irritating little blinky dots you see in things like the original Tekken Tag Tournament.  For its time, the game is in fact very pretty, runs at a nonstop 60fps, and in its own way takes the occasional step ahead of Gran Turismo 3.  Its backgrounds, overlaid with a lighter version of the kind of filtering you see in The Bouncer, have some excellent spots of texture detail and special effects.  An urban course carries you under a translucent glass canopy; the nifty Provence circuit speeds past an animating waterfall surrounded by mist and fog; streetlights shine at night, while the sun illuminates a beautiful sky during the day.  The cars have the blinding bright sheen and slightly rough edges of what we used to see in the Gran Turismo 2000 demos -- the reflection effects are very flashy, although not quite so refined, and the bodies of smooth stock models are illuminated by streetlamps and opponents' headlights.  Once you make it to the race-tuned ranks, the sponsor details are textured well, and every car has a sizable selection of optional custom wheel textures, although the wheels aren't the detailed 3D models in GT3.  The game's vaunted in-car view, where you see the road through a driver's eyes surrounded by a faithful re-creation of each car's interior, is a bit of a disappointment to one who isn't a dead-serious car enthusiast.  At first, it's interesting to see the road this way, particularly due to the novelty of most everything in the game being right-hand-drive, but eventually it's more of a hindrance in a game that already requires an awful lot of concentration.  In particular, the animation of the driver's hands is ridiculously choppy, missing about half the frames it needs.  The details are certainly a graphical achievement, but they're not very easily-appreciated in a practical situation.  Sound I mentioned, when discussing Type-S' gameplay, the lack of contact with the road -- you feel like you're moving a car about, rather than actually driving, if you take my meaning.  Sound, I think, has a lot to do with that.  Gran Turismo has always surrounded you with rich engine and road sounds, which communicate a lot more than you might think about how you're driving.  Type-S, in contrast, has very muted sound effects.  You have to kill the background music almost completely if you want to hear them, and even then they don't communicate very much to you.  This exacerbates some of the handling model's less friendly elements, and it certainly gives GT a significant edge in the realism department.That, I think, is what holds Type-S back in the end -- it has the features and accoutrements of a realistic racer, and a car list that beats GT as far as big names are concerned, but it doesn't drive the way a serious sim ought to.  Rather, it drives like nothing else I've ever found, and while I'm all for plowing your own row, it helps if you grow something worthwhile there.  Type-S' handling is not bad, exactly, but it is very much an acquired taste, one which I don't doubt a lot of players will find rather unpalatable.I know folks who feel the same way about Gran Turismo, though, so I encourage racing fans to at least give Type-S a try.  You can't just reject a Ferrari 360 out of hand, after all, and that's only one car among the many the game has to offer.  It would be nice, however, if these graphics and this feature set could have been married to something a little bit more universally friendly -- the redemption job is not quite complete.(Eh, sue me.)", "date": "Jan 31, 2001"}
