Any player can win any hand with any set of cards. Even the worst starting hands can be won with either a great bluff or a great draw, meaning the game's overall strategy, and consequently enjoyment, is entirely dependant upon the players' abilities to play the game competently and off of one another.   As such, video game poker is essentially solely dependant upon its presentation and artificial intelligence. Presentation is really half the game of poker, so poor presentation can be very detrimental to the game's overall enjoyment, pacing or worse. But if the AI is poor and isn't capable of making correct calls, the game can fall apart completely and essentially turn into a lottery drawing.   World Series of Poker fails miserably in both cases. Its presentation is piss-poor and its AI is so completely unpredictable and nonsensical that the game turns into the aforementioned lottery drawing where sheer luck is a much stronger ally than even a basic understanding of the game.    This is the only screen I bothered taking.   Let's start with an example of how one of the AI opponents played a couple hands of Hold 'Em. This guy (we'll call him Joe, it doesn't matter) is dealt two low but suited cards, the 2 and 5 of spades. Checks all around lead to the flop which brings a 3, 6 and J, one of which is a spade. So post-flop, Joe is playing a high card with an outside shot at an inside low straight. He decides to call a very large raise to stay in the hand. Fair enough, maybe he likes to gamble. At this point only Joe and the lady who raised are still in the hand.   The next two cards come and don't complete his straight, but they're both spades which give him the flush. Joe's lady friend leads each round but both players check the turn and river. Joe of course wins with his flush.   So, Joe will call a very large raise on an inside straight draw, but he won't raise when he's the last person to act for the hand and very likely has the best hand at the table. Well, OK then.   The very next hand, Joe calls a reasonable pre-flop raise with middle suited connectors and everyone else at the table folds, putting the pot at about $1,000. The flop brings A, K, K. Both players check. The turn brings another ace. Again, both players check. The river is a jack, meaning the table has two pair, aces and kings, with a jack kicker and no possibility of a flush. Joe's opponent raises a meager $200 and Joe folds.   Although it's a very good chance that he and his opponent would split the pot, as she failed to do anything when the aces and kings hit the table (meaning her only likely winning card would be one of four queens, or even less likely, Q-10), Joe decides that a $200 call isn't worth picking up a likely $700. Even if she was slow-playing the hand he's calling with a 7:2 payout on his investment. There are things called pot odds and being pot-committed that Joe, nor any other AI opponent, has any knowledge of.   It's nonsensical plays like these that destroy a game of poker. Even worse are the constantly smaller plays that seem idiotic but somehow manage to pay off time and time again, like a mid-stack player calling a reasonable bet halfway through the game with a 9-5 off-suite pre-flop and then somehow hitting a straight or two pair and cracking your aces. It's essentially impossible to slow-play a hand, set up future plays or any other common tactic as the computer players don't seem to abide by any sort of logical reasoning. In other words, you can't play a real game of poker.   And though without even decent AI it doesn't really matter, the presentation is downright terrible. Players, pro and non alike, throw their hands up in the air after winning even the most mundane hands. I've never once seen Jesus clap like a giddy schoolgirl after picking up the blinds from winning a showdown with a pair of eights, yet you'll see it time and time again.   The generic player models are decent, but the pro players are seriously f'ed. Scotty Nguyen may not be the prettiest man on the face of the Earth, but it looks like someone's removed his jaw bone and stuck a couple Chiclets to his front teeth. Seriously, if you're going to use licensed talent then spend some time on their likenesses. On the somewhat bright side, the player editor is decent; at least decent enough to have borne the likes of Hot Pie (see above).There's essentially no reason to pick up World Series of Poker.
