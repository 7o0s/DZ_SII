It's been a while, but designers have finally decided to take the survival horror genre into the 90's (for a month or so at least) with Nocturne, a big, spooky nod to the Alone in the Dark series, horror films, and that wonky feeling in your stomach when you're left alone with a dark street and some chill-inducing streetlights.  You play as the stranger, a sort of Clint Eastwood of the supernatural world. Working for a group call The Spookhouse, it's your job to investigate and eradicate the darker forces of the world, circa the late 20's and 30's. The game takes place in a set of four acts, which can be played in any order, though they cover a chronological set of events. In the course of your adventure, you'll be taking on everything from Vampire nobles in a small European town to undead Gangsters in Chicago, all using a series of weapons, both supernatural and man made. Most of the time you'll be using your pistols, but you'll use everything from a stake-firing crossbow to holy relics throughout the course of the game.   The storyline is a shadow-filled mix of the X-Files and any number of horror films, with acts that work out like episodes, telling unique and sometimes surprising stories. I'm not going to ruin anything for you, only to say that this is one of the few times that the punchlines are much better than you expect. Characters that you see introduced in earlier acts will appear later in the game, and relationships will form years later from events that happen earlier in the game. Since the spookhouse is creates the illusion of a deep history, it's a nice trick to have a game that spreads itself over such a broad period of time. But being that this is an action game at heart, all of this is window dressing for a lot of gun toting action.   You can control the game using a gamepad or keyboard, but I'll tell you right now that's just asking for an early grave. I tried using the keyboard, and was screaming at the game wondering why I could never get turn fast enough to get the vampires/imps/werewolves/gargoyles before they got me. Use a mouse and the keyboard in a Quake-style setup, and you'll be much happier. The Stranger can auto aim on enemies that are close enough to him, and a set of laser-sights help you to keep your target on enemies farther away. In the darker areas, you'll be hanging on to those sights for dear life to keep you well-aimed and ready for action. Use your flashlight (paired with the cloak effect, one of the high points of the game), your guns, and now you're ready for anything.  All the hype surrounding the lighting in the game was for a really good reason -- Nocturne pushes videogame lighting to new heights, with shadows that are so inventive and interactive that you'll swear you're actually watching a film at times. There were moments when I brought out a flashlight to shed some light on a room only to gasp at the shadows that the were actually being cast against the wall from the objects in the room -- both rendered and polygonal. The game gives you specific instructions on how to set your lighting for the game, and when played in a dark room, the pre-rendered scenes and dynamic lighting truly shine. Play it in fluorescent hell like I did though, and you'll quickly be building yourself the oh so classy Vincent Lopez esq. cardboard brand light shade, and making an ass out of yourself at your workplace. It's easy: cut cardboard. Put cardboard on top of monitor. Swear when it falls off. Again. And  again. Tape entire box to top of monitor. Play in serenity while throwing things at anyone who comes by to mock.   The characters are all rendered with a nice amount of detail, particularly the faces of the characters, which don't express emotion, but give you a great impression of personality. Paired with some fun voice acting, the characters take on a life of their own. The animation of the enemies is particularly stunning, especially fast-moving creatures like imps, which flip backwards from your shots, jump back up, and continue to attack even after you've blown off their heads. The gore factor is pretty high in the game, especially when it involves extensive blood trails, and exploding limbs. Nobody ever said your missions were going to be pretty. And finally, the cloak effect -- never has cloth been this exciting. Turn the Stranger around quickly, and you'll see his coat twist around with him realistically settling itself after a moment or two. Every chance they get, the designers implements the clothing effect on characters, and it adds yet another layer to the realistic look of the game. You wanted mood, and you got mood. And that's not even mentioning the music and sound effects, which fill in all the blanks, even when you're trapped in a pitch black room full of moaning and screeching when you really didn't need those blanks filled in, thank you very much. The soundtrack tends to pop in and out at random during certain parts of the game, implying something ominous when nothing appears around that certain bloody hallway, or keeping blissfully silent when you're being attacked by nearly every ungodly creature on this earth But for the most part it gives the game added texture. So, let's recap. Great looking game, fantastic lighting, moody music, horrible camera... oh. That part. I hate to be the one to tell you, but there's some bad news regarding Nocturne. You should probably sit down.  There's no doubt that the designers of Nocturne watched a lot of horror films to inspire them, and it makes for a much better game. I just wish they hadn't watched certain section of Rosemary's Baby. Games like Alone and the Dark and Resident Evil (who started this survival horror genre and elaborated on the theme, respectively) tended to keep the camera angles either high or low in monster-ridden areas to provide you with a clear view of the action, but Nocturne attempts to add more angles and freedom to the formula. It's a noble goal, but it fails miserably. Not only is the camera inappropriately close or far at critical moments, but because the camera is more dynamic, it will often change in mid-movement within a room, or sometimes with little or no movement at all. Either you're freaking out because a troop of werewolves are in the foreground blocking your view while they kill you, or you're an inch tall trying to figure out how and where to go, and more importantly, where to point your bang stick. Add to this the fact that my sidekicks on levels would continually become caught in the scenery, sometimes fatally so (I'd have to go back to an older save game because an assisting character was trapped), and you have a frustrating experience. It's not just the battles that suffer because of the odd camera choices. Large areas of the game are made utterly confusing due to a camera that changes angles so drastically that you lose your bearings completely. Even running down a city street can turn into an elaborate experience.  I remember running through the woods wondering if I'd ever be able to find an exit, that damn shack I swear I saw hours earlier, or a path that would lead me farther in the level. When I finally moved on, I looked back, let out a sigh, and realized that I would never, ever, be able to find my way back. In Chicago, I was constantly pummeled by cars filled with gangsters because damnit, I just couldn't see them most of the time. The sound gave clues, but even then, it was like shooting ducks in a barrel -- and you can guess who I was. The mansion level had an elaborate graveyard that was even more frustrating than the woods, because on top of the confusing camera angles, you had a battalion of skeletons that were more than happy to take swipes at me every time I tried to find some sort of bearings. ~I know you're trying to kill me, but can you please guide me to that damn set of keys I'm supposed to find? Oh right, no throat. Listen, you don't need to impale me or anything, I'll be on my way.~  I really enjoyed parts of Nocturne, especially tighter sections like the castle in the first act, which almost redeems the insane amount of frustration in the first half of the act. But play through an entire mission and you'll begin seeing the same problems, and the same frustrations crop up again. Can a camera really be enough to ruin a game with so much in its favor? Yes... and no (exactly what you didn't want to hear, wasn't it). If you're one of those people that can deal with the frustrating camera and sometimes glitchy interface, than Nocturne definitely has incredible moments that are worth experiencing. For others, the experience will quickly wear them out, especially in the more maze-like areas, or when a camera continues to bring down unholy death in particularly nasty sections of the game. So basically, it's just like a real horror film. This experience isn't for everyone, but there are those of you that want your horror, and want it now. But for the rest of you looking for the next big game of the year, you might want to consider taking a run with Blair Witch and the Nocturne crew next year, when the Witch promises to fix the camera and make it all alright... for your soul. But when was the last time you used that old thing? Like you really needed to see your reflection in mirrors anyway.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Nov 23, 1999"}
