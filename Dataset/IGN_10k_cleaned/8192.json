Running in crisp HD with some nicely rendered backgrounds, this is the best looking Worms game to date. All of the flashy graphics in the world, however, can't make up for the fact that Worms fans will find this title more than a little lacking in the content department. It's not all bad though. This still is Worms we're talking about.   For the uninitiated, Worms is a turn based combat game that set itself apart from the pack in the mid '90s by injecting some lighthearted humor and giving players a range of imaginative weapons. The game cycles through turns, allotting players a short period of time to reposition their worm, select a weapon, and then fire it upon their enemies. Whichever worm team is left standing at the end is the winner. It's simple, but the presentation around the best of the Worms games is what has made all the difference. Weapon lists, level editors, online play, and exhaustive means to customize your game turned the simple combat into a classic.    Most of what made the previous Worms games great has found its way into Team 17s latest entry into the series. The funny little sound bytes are there, though their selection isn't as varied as one might hope. The nice weapons are in, but the best ones are missing. There is four player online or offline play, but the net code seems a bit buggy with dropped games a regular occurrence. We hope you're seeing the pattern being laid out here.    Thankfully, the gameplay is still as solid as ever. Planning out attacks to link explosions together that tear apart the land never stops being enjoyable, especially with the fun animations and sound samples that accompany them. The gameplay is slow and deliberate, a style that some may find a bore, but it's a formula that works in a way that is instantly endearing.    There's a single player game included that contains a tutorial, 20 challenges that get increasinglychallenging, and an option for some regular skirmishes. Going through it can provide a decent amount of fun, but playing against the CPU often feels unfair and well too slow to stay interesting for very long.     Worms has always shone the brightest in its multiplayer modes and this iteration is no exception. There are options for editing your team and member names as well as the weapon set and victory conditions giving you some options for building your identity and setting the game up the way you think it plays best. This is all ancillary to the chaos that four teams of worms can create on a single randomly selected map. Grab three friends, voice communicators, and a case of brews and you've got all the makings of a fun filled evening. The slow plodding pace becomes bearable even for the most ADD of us when you've got a few good friends to talk to in between turns. Unfortunately, our experience with Worms online was a mixed bag. Games that weren't private matches regularly dropped users as the map was initialized to the point of severe frustration. Occasionally, it would drop us out of games that we had already played a good portion of. This happened on a network connection that hasn't ever given us issues before making us question the integrity of the net code.   If you've played a Worms game before, you know what you're getting here. It's just too bad that the full weapon set wasn't included or a more robust map editor. The result is a game that is fun, but feels like you don't have the full package. Where's the holy hand grenade? Where's the homing pigeon? Where's the ming vase? If these are included later as pricy downloadable packs, all of our fears of micro-transactions causing developers to leave out content in hope of scoring a quick buck later will have come true in a most unsatisfying way. For Worms fans, this will be a mixed bag of fun and disappointment. For anyone that hasn't played a Worms game before, this is a competent enough iteration to warrant a first look.", "date": "Mar 10, 2007"}
