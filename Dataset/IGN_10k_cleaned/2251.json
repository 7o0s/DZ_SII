Back when all persons nationwide were living in that wonderful era between 70's crap and 80's crap, now unanimously scientifically referred to as the pinnacle of crapdom? You know it baby.  Here's the deal... The game was cool like 22 years ago, and despite what anyone will tell you, just as boys and girls these days look silly sporting retro dos and clothes, the Pac-Man phenom is just tired, dated, and boring. Oh yeah, you really want to read the rest of the review now, huh?  Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze is nearly identical to the grandfather of the series in that it features a yellow ball thing walking around eating floating pellets in ghost infested mazes. It's also identical to the original in that, that's all it freaking features. You control your stubby yellow ball girl and eat a whole bunch of pellets whilst avoiding ghosts hell bent on harassing you. And why are they such jerks anyway? It seems most specters these days are evil or wicked. Am I the only one who remembers Ghost Dad? Now there was a ghost you could be proud of. If Ghost Dad were in these mazes it'd be a whole different game, let me tell you. Probably one that involved obscene usage of Jell-O and the word ~dig-doobity.~  So you got these stupid ghosts chasing you around, and you're like, ~I'm gonna eat me some pellets because I really, really want to see what the next maze will be like.~ To this end, you crank those stubby legs and run your spherical butt around gobbling up pellets left and right as the only way to advance is by depleting the current maze's entire supply of them. It's a sound gameplay mechanic that works as far as score accumulation goes, but is seriously hampered by intense repetition and general ease.  I could beat this game in literally around a half an hour. The game's ~Quest~ is comprised of sets of mazes grouped by varying motifs. You got the, ~I'm in a brown maze~ maze, the ~I'm in a light brown maze~ maze, the ~I'm in a yellow maze~ maze, and of course the grand finale, the ~I'm in a gold maze~ maze. That right there is the only appreciable difference between them.   True, they all come with their own twists and turns and dead-ends, but the design changes from maze to maze will barely effect the way they play out for all but the most inept of gamers. Case in point, I spied fellow PC editor Dan Adams having particular trouble on a light brown maze. But even then, that was only because he was attempting to play with a steering wheel and bologna sandwich. After a two-hour lecture I was able to convince him that his bologna sandwich was in fact not a wireless controller at all, but just a compilation of meat and bread. Then, with one hand on keyboard (the other still stubbornly gripping the wheel) even he managed to beat the levels. Quite a feat for someone who's apparently been repeatedly and consistently kicked in the head by mules, at least I hope he's been, because that's the only non-supernatural explanation I can think of to explain his baffling inaptitude (you know a game is bad when I devote an entire paragraph to berating Dan).   I feel compelled to clarify something here, when I recommend ~Those 3D Pac-Man games~ for kids and adults alike, I don't mean this one. I'm instead assuredly referring to its superior male cousin Pac-Man Adventures in Time. See, that game had a myriad of cool, colorful, vibrant mazes of varying shapes and sizes. This one does not. Ms. Pac-Man Quest for the Golden Maze is the same thing, over and over again for the entire 30 minutes it lasts.  It's not all just walking in similar mazes gorging your fat little body on pellets and ghosts though... Okay, so maybe it is.  But, there are power-ups that liven things up a bit. In addition to the timeless power pellets that cause Shadow, Bashful, Speedy, and Pokey to halt in their ghostly tracks and suddenly become edible, eating a smaller green ghost causes a power up to appear at the point where you start the maze. These can do anything from magnetizing Ms. Pac, to granting her super speed or making her temporarily invulnerable. All of the added abilities make an already easy game a walk in the park, even at higher difficulties. Regardless, I'll still assert that 1987's Pac-Mania had more developed gameplay.   It's not all one big Richard Simmons exercise in horrific tedium. There are five highlights and one half highlight of which the game can be proud of. The graphics are solid, the color is smooth, and the characters cartoonish (however unoriginal it all may be); the menu is an awesome trip into memory lane; the game is cute and will appeal to youngsters (for a time); secret mazes are abound, found by traversing the side passageways; the sound and music are respectable; and the half highlight: it has multiplayer.  Beer and Tequila fueled LAN games at work where players could compete to damage one another and fight to accumulate the most pellets on large maps could have been spectacular. Hah! Got you! That's where the half in half highlight comes in. Oh, there's a multiplayer component alright, but it's limited to same-screen play by only two people. You can still have that party, but you and grandma huddling around your PC sipping ginger ale and sharing turns with a smattering of her Bridge club friends isn't exactly the same. The multiplayer component does tie in with the kiddie appeal. If you've got a kid sister, I can see playing a few rounds with her and having fun but even she will tire of it, and most likely quicker than you or I.  The secret mazes I mentioned are timed events that require you to, (instead of fumbling around through the maze), quickly discern the quickest path to acquiring the most pellets in the allotted time. After exiting the maze you'll find all the troublesome ghosts to be securely confined in their pen regardless of their position prior to you finding the secret maze. This is a nice thought on the developer's behalf and prevents walking into random death upon existing what's supposed to be a bonus. More sub-games like these and other slight variations on the play could have only greatly benefited the otherwise tedious game.  Another one of the highlights I touched on, the sound and music are actually pretty good. Nostalgic, technically quality tracks compliment each maze and, likewise, the assortment of various blips, bleeps and blangs are both adherent to the series but still in keeping with today's standards. Really cool stuff. I probably wouldn't listen to it in the car, but it works.  Most disappointing of all is Ms. Pac-Man's Golden Maze finale. The whole title clumsily builds up to the Golden Maze through cute little cutscenes that follow, from different perspectives, an in-game Ms. Pac-Man model making her way through various areas and following into clearly visible, very large, ~Inner Sanctum~ holes. Apparently whatever species these Pac creatures are, don't have much the way of eyesight or brain matter. Anyhoo, when you get to the Golden Maze, you find that it's pretty much like all the mazes before it, only without power pellets and with an abundance of side passages. After that (twenty five seconds later) the game ends. La-di-da.  I would honestly like to be able to recommend this game. Both because I respect its roots, and because I think it's very important that younger kids have something of their own to play, but I just can't. As cute as it may be, it's simply too monotonous, underdeveloped, and short to warrant a purchase. Sorry.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
