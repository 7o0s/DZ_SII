Bill wants to win the Benedict County Big Egg Fry-Off, but his chickens have been strewn about by Egger Rotten. For Bill to still win the big contest, he must somehow get the eggs from his prized hens to a set of frying pans and prove that he's the best farmer around and that Egger Rotten is a cluckin' jerk.   Following the rather silly set-up, Guppy Games pulls the curtain back on a pretty tough puzzle game. You must somehow direct eggs from an errant chicken fanny to a waiting frying pan elsewhere on the screen. And it's never a straight path. You must bounce the eggs around corners to avoid breaking them against stumps, mushrooms, and trees. Your tools? Cheese wedges and other hens, of course.   Cheese wedges bounce eggs around corners, depending on how you orient the cheese. Hens ~split~ eggs into two different directions (always perpendicular), which often allows you to solve puzzles with multiple frying pans. You do not have unlimited use of these items, so choose your placement carefully. There are also farmhouses on some screens that can split eggs into three, sending them careening off to the far reaches of the screen. Finally, you must also look out for bombs that can level entire areas on the map.   Once you set up your complex system of hens and cheese wedges, as well as made use of the barns, you press ~OK~ to make your starting hens fire off their eggs. As you watch the eggs bounce around the map, you can see where you might need to make adjustments, should one or more of the eggs not find their proper homes. Some screens have more than one starting hen, and you must direct eggs for each hen into colored frying pans. This can get tough, quickly.    There were more than a few puzzles that I had to make several attempts on before finally figuring out the solution. But the thing with Bill's Eggcellent Adventure is that I rarely got frustrated enough to close the phone. You always know that the solution is quite literally right before you eyes, and you want to prove yourself smarter than a digital chicken.   Bill's is a fairly simple-looking game. The farms are certainly colorful and the sprites indeed look like hens, cheese wedges, and whatnot. The audio is pretty minor, but there are some good clucking samples.  Guppy Games' Bill's Eggcellent Adventure is a very hard puzzle game -- and that is something of a compliment. At first glance, this farm-themed game looks like an easy-breezy goof. You just direct eggs into frying pans, right? However, just a few puzzles into the game, you are introduced to elements that have an affect on egg trajectory. And just a few screens later, you see the labyrinth farm scenes getting fairly complex. If you want something you can really dig your brain into -- as well as enjoy horrible egg puns -- stopping in at Bill's farm might be a good download for you.", "date": "Mar 7, 2006"}
