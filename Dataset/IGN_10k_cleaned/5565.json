Train your own Robot! Cool Heroes battle it out using Combo attacks in 3D space! Excited battle against the CPU Gamers with personality! Train your Robot and have it fight in the auto-battle! Give it all you got to win a Medal!~How can you not buy Dual Heroes after reading the exclamation-laden text on the back of the box? If that isn't warning enough for you, read the following review's virtual lips: ~Do NOT buy this game!~Even though most N64 fighting games are only average when compared to those available in arcades or on other consoles, Western N64 owners should consider themselves lucky. After all, with Mortal Kombat 4 and Fighters Destiny, you have at least two good fighting games to choose from. Imagine you lived in Japan. Although fighting is one of the most popular genres in that country, it took 18 months to bring a fighter to the N64 -- December 1997 marked the release of Dual Heroes. Time to rejoice for Japanese fighting fans? Ummm, no. Dual Heroes makes the N64 look so bad, it could easily be a system seller -- meaning N64 owners selling their systems to get a PSX or a Saturn.Now, a year later, small-time publisher Electro-Brain has decided to bring Dual Heroes to the US. According to many publications, the delay was necessary to implement changes and make the game better. For the record: 1080 Snowboarding was developed in less than a year's time. In the same time, Dual Heroes improved from crap fighting game with Japanese text to crap fighting game with English text. Seriously, there are no conceivable differences between the US release and the original.Gameplay: When Hudson first showed renders for Dual Heroes, everyone was excited. Futuristic super-heroes fighting in precarious environments, on top of a moving train, knee-deep in water, threatened by collapsing walls -- not bad... If only those things were in the final game, too.Dual Heroes enables you to select from eight Power-Ranger-like characters, two girls, five guys, and one alien with a tail. As with other fighting games, each character comes complete with unique special moves and slightly different attributes. So, how does it play? One word: ~Argh.~You control your character with the analog stick, the for fighting games more ideal D-Pad is not used. Z allows for 3D movement (sidestep), A is punch, B is block, C-Down is kick. Considering that the selection of moves is unexciting (even though the manual says: ~there are millions of moves and combos~), their implementation in 3D space is even worse. Often you're facing the wrong way and miss your opponent, or gameplay turns into a simple button mashing contest. As a matter of fact, if you want to see some brilliant AI, we suggest using your index finger to rapidly punch your opponent. We beat the first five opponents this way, never losing a fight. After that, we were beaten once. Luckily, using the rapid-finger technique on the kick button secured us another victory. Lame, lame, lame.Luckily, the game is not a complete mess from start to finish. For example, there is an innovative Robot Mode, in which you teach another character how to fight. This translates into you hitting your opponent, for example with a punch kick combination, and your ~robot~ will copy your moves and remember the combo for later use. You then pit your robot against another fighter, watching him/her do do the moves. The other cool feature is what Hudson calls the ~Virtual Gamer.~ Select one of five characters labeled as ~gamers~ (they are only represented by drawings and don't actually appear in the game), who will then randomly pick one of the eight fighters. Each gamer has his/her own speed settings and uses slightly different tactics, e.g. Reiko is fast, Alan & Milan are better in the defense department, while Zara likes to attack and not worry about defense. The virtual gamer is an awesome idea and if its execution (ie the AI) and the game itself wasn't so bad, this would definitely lengthen its replay value. Finally, there is a two-player mode and a practice mode.Graphics: Awesome! Vibrant colors, fantastic reflection-mapping and dynamic composition. But let's put aside the box art and look at the actual game. Decent, if unoriginal polygon models are texture-mapped with some of the ugliest textures yet. The N64's hardware tries to smoothen out what's there, but in the end, even filtering and anti-aliasing can't correct bad design. The battle arenas are simple squares with low-res ground textures (often made up of a vomit-inducing, dithered pattern). The backgrounds are equally shoddy, with nasty color schemes -- as flat and uninteresting as they can be. We have nothing against bitmap backgrounds (especially if they're used to make the game faster), but it looks like Hudson compressed the hell out of these and they weren't very well drawn to begin with. The motion-captured animation is definitely one of the high-points of Dual Heroes -- too bad that the framerates drop and the camera angles screw up your view when pulling off a special move.Yes, there's a lot to dislike here. Whether it's the fighters' nasty, gray shadows (what the...?), the load-time before the fights, or the fact that the display is letter-boxed at all times. Dual Heroes is definitely the Boris Karloff of fighting games.Sound: It's happy, it's Japanesey, it's nothing your NES couldn't have done. While not the worst music on the N64 yet, it's utterly forgettable. If only you could switch it off -- why do the games with the worst music always neglect to include an option to give your ears a break.Dual Heroes gets my vote for worst fighter on the N64. Despite some innovative ideas, the final project was a shoddy first attempt at 3D fighting for the Japanese market. Hudson was smart enough to base the game's characters on artwork by a renowned Japanese manga artist, which is probably Dual Heroes' only selling point in Japan. Fortunately, most US gamers couldn't care less about these Mighty Suckin' Power Rangers. If you happen to see this game on a store shelf (or at your rental store), do yourself a favor and leave it there. Only buy this game if it comes bundled with a free N64 or a trip to Hawaii.PS: Any publisher considering a guide for this game? I'll gladly do it. To beat the first fighter, press B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B... To beat the second fighter, press B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B...  To beat the...", "date": "Nov 10, 1998"}
