Those saps never even realize that the tidbits of information they learned about adorable Pandas are actually real live facts! Animals also serve as a great way to sneak education into video games. Torus Games has combined the natural appeal of animals, and the popularity of doctor games to make Zoo Hospital. Of course kids will quickly catch on when they realize the game has barely any game at all, and all that's left is a digital zoo map.   Zoo Hospital puts the player in the role of an assistant at a, you guessed it, zoo hospital. Lucy is the smoking hot doctor that runs the hospital and oh wait she's supposed to be our aunt, excuse us. Aunt Lucy is the smoking hot doctor that runs the hospital and helps teach the player how to take care of the patients, namely endangered animals.   Luckily in this zoo animals get sick one at a time. It's really very considerate of them. The game is not a zoo simulation, so there's nothing to worry about in terms of money or keeping anyone happy. The game focuses solely on taking care of the animals by diagnosing and treating their ailments.   And there are plenty of animals to take care of. There are a total of 40 different animals to treat, each one represented with a rather realistic 3D critter. Players can visit them in the enclosure and read factoids about the animal if they desire.   Cleaning gunk off a zebra's eyes... sounds better than interning at IGN. The amount of detail for each animal is pretty impressive. Not only does each one have a realistic model, but things like close-ups on skin and fur are specific to each animal. There are distinct differences for each zoo inhabitant when examining things like the animal's pelt, or mouth. When the game zooms in farther it does get more generic. The stomach and blood cells all look the same, as does the eyeball, but it doesn't seem necessary that there be distinct differences in the stomach x-rays.   In addition to realistic graphics, Zoo Hospital also boasts a wide assortment of authentic animal sounds. All 40 critters in the park make a few different noises. It's definitely a cool feature, since animal calls are extremely diverse. Plus the sound a zebra makes when it has an eye infection is pretty funny. Poor Dennis the zebra.   Zoo Hospital gives a lot of attention to the animals themselves, and there's a lot of detail that went into that. Unfortunately the game lacks something in the gameplay department. The game is controlled entirely with the touch screen, and players use the stylus to diagnose animals by checking their vital signs as well as examining their fur, skin, blood, eyes, mouth, and insides. After the player figures out what's wrong, they go to work treating it. Sometimes it's maneuvering a foreign object out of intestines; sometimes it's just giving a shot.   There are 15 minigames that are used to treat the animals. However, 15 is being generous, since sometimes the minigame is just a one step procedure from another of the minigames.   Each minigame takes, on average, a minute to complete. The diagnosis before hand takes about another minute. So in approximately we unlocked every animal in the zoo and had already played every minigame at least twice.   And it's weird that nearly every ailment applies to every animal. One procedure had us help out a stressed animal by petting it until it was calm. Sounds fine, especially when it was a Koala. But then the same procedure came up with a King Cobra. One of the deadliest vipers in the world. What genius decided the best thing to do with a stressed out venomous snake is pet it?   It's not that the procedures aren't fun; they are pretty entertaining the first couple of times. Most of them are pretty easy though. Players are ranked by how fast and efficient they performed the procedure and are encouraged to try to do better if they don't get an A grade. Of course the players just have to wait for that procedure to come up again randomly since there is no way to choose anything to play in Zoo Hospital.   And say the kid is pretty good, which isn't hard to imagine since the game is pretty rudimentary. The difficulty never increases. The procedures don't get progressively more complicated as the game continues. Lucy continues to hold our hand through the whole game, telling us exactly what to do and how.   There's no way to record how well we did in each procedure, or see how many times we've helped an animal. There are a series of awards that are earned for playing the game a lot, but they don't do anything, and there is no explanation for how or when they are achieved.Zoo Hospital is one of those games that seems perfect for an aspiring veterinarian or animal buff, and it almost is. It's got a solid presentation, a large assortment of great looking animals, and a simple but fun interface. Unfortunately the game is over in a couple of hours, and with no way to track progress, or up the difficulty it gets boring. It's the beginning of a great game, but it feels like the game went to stores before the developer could finish the procedure.", "date": "Nov 9, 2007"}
