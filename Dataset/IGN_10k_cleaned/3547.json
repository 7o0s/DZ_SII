So, while 2600 owners were enjoying a decent port of the arcade classic, Intellivision fans were stuck with either Space Armada or Astrosmash.  Somehow, falling rocks intermingled with the occasional flying saucer weren't as compelling as the original Invaders, but in a pinch--which is where Intellivision owners were--it would have to do. Features: Classic Intellivision game Blast space rocks Mulitple difficulty levels  Mattel's Intellivision was actually a more powerful machine than the Atari 2600, as evidenced by the slambang graphics here.  But I kid.  Seriously, the Intellivision was a fun machine with a pretty solid library of hits exclusive to the console, and Astrosmash is considered one of its more memorable titles. Not because it looked like a million bucks, but because it offered some pretty fast gameplay for the time--and still does.  Astrosmash puts you in the cockpit of a nondescript spaceship so cheaply designed, engineers forgot to put a thruster on it.  As a result, you can only move left or right.  But they did install a nice cannon on the front, one that can down an asteroid or a flying saucer with a single blast.  And that's all you do in Astrosmash, blow things up.  It doesn't achieve to be anything else, which is why it succeeds.  There are several levels of gameplay.  The first round is a cake walk, gravity is on your side as the progress of the rocks has been slowed.  But as you progress, things get quicker--and soon it seems like it's too quick for the limited control input on your little cellphone.  The Intellivision disc-controller could handle the swooping action with ease.  Your little touchpad does not.  Visually, it's a carbon copy of the Intellivision smash.  The rocks look like blocky pieces of chewed gum, and flying saucers are only identified as flying saucers because the manuals says so.  Fortunately, the display is able to keep up with the increasing speed, and you don't have to deal with the kind of blur that hampered early Game Boy releases.  The original Astrosmash didn't have a wowza soundtrack, so technically THQ can claim that this port is faithful there, too. The Intellivision actually hosted some pretty decent games--particularly those made by Imagic. Why this was ported instead of those classics, I have no idea. But Astrosmash is still a fun diversion if you wanna play an early shooter and see where console gaming got started. Lower your expectations, and you'll be just fine.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
