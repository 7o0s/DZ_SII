Accolade just never seemed to make any great strides with the series, and even though the game is now in the hands of publisher Infogrames, don't expect this one to suddenly change its ways. Test Drive Off-Road 3 still has floaty physics, heavy-handed car control, and muddy graphics.   Part of the problem here is that off-road racing is still largely out of the bounds of the current crop of game systems. There are just so many variables to simulate that realism is always just out of reach, and even when a game achieves that elusive lifelike feel of throttling the engine and digging hard into the dirt, it ends up being a chore rather than a game. The play is more in the customization of the vehicle than in the driving. It's that way with every one of the upcoming glut of dirt bike racing games, as it is even that way in the more advanced Dreamcast dirt devils. Look at Sega Rally, or any other off-road racer that works: they succeed by leveling out the course and concentrating on flat-out racing.  Not so in Test Drive Off-Road 3. Courses are so rocky and steep they're almost impossible to race on. True, they are quite realistic, but they are also a bear to traverse. Often a wide lead can be blown simply because find yourself having to back your puny little Jeep Cherokee down a hill to regain momentum after flipping the car just a few feet away from the summit. You'll peel out and red limit at all the wrong times.   This wouldn't be such a bad way to lose if the game was a little bit more forgiving. Unfortunately, the game has no love for stock cars, and while the game gets better once you have souped up the engine and body support, you'll have to slog through a lot of pain to get to the fun stuff.  Just getting through the course is sometimes impossible, and the more ambitious you are in your car selection, the more punishment you are in for. You'll spend all of your time fighting your car rather than the lame competition-- who are constantly getting tied up on poles and stuck on hills, and often give you a chance just by their sheer stupidity.  Even when you've gotten into the game, you may not find a lot to like. The design behind the handling is solid, as you will have to pump the gas on inclines and watch carefully what kind of terrain you are on (snow, dirt, mud puddles, granite, and other course features all feel very different). This is contrasted against the bulky feel of the cars, some of which have a turning radius several miles wide. The modifications available each make considerable changes to the car handling on the ground, but the cars still float through the air or drift uncontrollably when you don't want them to. And no matter how much you outfit your engine, you'll still be spending a lot of time off your wheels, meaning no acceleration and, ultimately, a slow racing game.  Graphics are not a saving grace either. Courses are grainy, with textures that often don't mesh well (the sky often doesn't look right set against the earth). There is a lot of variety here, and that goes well with the physics engine, but Jet Moto 3 was a hundred times faster and still looked smooth with the same kind of terrain. There are some nice wide-open areas here, some with New England cottages or Saharan oasis, but the tracks are conspicuously linear and tight  for a game boasting ~No Roads, No Rules!~ The few short cuts in the game don't look too natural, and even Mount Fuji has a wall surrounding the track. In general, you get a good feel for off-road racing in the terrain and the ground covering, but you still feel trapped inside of something rather than racing in a wide open, off-road environment.Infogrames spent more of their time producing Test Drive Off-Road 3 rather than developing it. They loaded up the trunk with real-world car licenses (27 in all) and a thrashing soundtrack (with Blink 182, GVSB, and others), but they didn't spend too much time under the hood.", "date": "Nov 18, 1999"}
