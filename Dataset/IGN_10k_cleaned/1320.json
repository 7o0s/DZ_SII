I'm not trying to make some kind of confession, I just really like gambling. Most Friday nights you can find me at our poker game - more than just Friday if the chance arises. In casinos I stick with craps. I will visit the blackjack tables, but that's about as experimental as I get. Forget roulette, Pai Gow, slots, and casino poker: I know my limits and strengths.   Being familiar with a few casino games on PC and PSX, and being an avid Dreamcast fan, I was happy to take Hoyle Casino for a spin. In the real world Hoyle codified many popular card/gambling games way back when. According to Hoyle is in constant reprint and is still the bible for many games. (Poker, however, is now Scarne's territory.) But I digress...   I have played a few of the games in Hoyle Casino in their PC forms. In fact, I have enjoyed some serious time wasting with the poker variations. So I sort of knew what to expect. And after a few days of high roller role-playing, I can confidently recommend this title to anyone from the seasoned card hound to the aspiring slot jockey.   So what's in the box? This casino has blackjack, craps, roulette, slots, video slots, Pai Gow poker, and poker (Hold 'Em, 5 Draw, 7 Stud, and Omaha). It supports a Jump Pack - god knows why - and up to 4 players. Pretty standard stuff, eh?   Thankfully, Hoyle Casino - which I will hereafter refer to as HC - is packed with options, both title and game specific, that enable you to do a rather impressive amount of customization. For the most part, you will easily be able to tailor the game to the conditions with which you are comfortable, i.e. blackjack tables dealing from anywhere from one to six decks.    A game like this needs really strong gameplay to succeed. I mean, the graphics are almost necessarily dull. They don't blow, but the action of rolling dice just isn't very conducive to exciting visuals. Anyway, HC's gameplay is strong throughout with a couple of jitters and a few genuine highpoints.    The card games work best in HC. The action is fast, the operations clear, and the opposition fairly competitive. For instance, in an eight handed game of seven stud the other players bet quickly and the cards fall fast, so nothing gets too slow. The only dip in the play happens when you fold early. If there are still four cards to come at a heavy table, then you may end up simply watching for a minute or two. This situation is never fun. On a real table you might care what hands end up going the distance, but in a videogame you don't give two turds.   The biggest beef I have with the poker games is that the game never tells you whether or not an ace can always be high or low, for the A-2-3-4-5 straight, for example. This is the real rule, but many people don't play it, so I wonder what the game plays.    The fastest and most fun game in HC is blackjack. Hands are lightning fast and blackjack has the distinction of being the only game in which you can press the A button in order to bypass most of the other players' actions. The only problem is that you must sit on first base - the person dealt cards first. It would be nice if you had a seating choice. I know that in real life first is best, but you should have the choice.   Slots, and video slots, are very much like their real-life counterparts: boring, repetitive, and depressing. I cannot imagine who would play any of the slot varieties in HC. There are a few different machines at wildly varying denominations, but each as boring as could be. Steer clear. (I know that this is harsh, but it is nothing against the developer. This is so simply because they made an accurate slot sim.)   Craps is my game in a casino. In HC it's a good sim and a great instructional tool. The mechanics of craps gameplay are very simple, but the complicated betting possibilities can make it an intimidating and confusing game. HC is a fantastic way to learn. The rules are all standardized in craps, so there are very few variations that you have to worry about. You even get to select the maximum pass line odds. You newbies will learn what that means and you regulars know what it means. This is definitely one of the highlights, especially with some of your buddies.   Roulette is fun, but takes too damn long to play. The problem is that in order to bet multiple numbers you must carefully move the cursor over each square and place the bet. If this sounds like whining, then you have obviously never played roulette. Say you want to place fifteen individual bets. Well that takes a good amount of time to set up. Plus, roulette is for suckers.   I probably got the most out of Pai Gow poker, but only because I didn't know how to play until I got HC. It ended up being a damn easy game and one that I played the hell out of. You get seven cards and must make two hands: one five-card hand and one two-card hand. Your hands must beat the dealers. (Duh.) Individual hand ties go to the dealer, but one win and one loss means a push, so you break even. This, like blackjack, is fast and fun. This is also a blast to play with a few friends.   HC is not the title if you are trying to show off the DC's power. I mean, it looks fine, but it is just cards, dice, and chips. Basically it is boring to look at, but that's not why you're playing the game. You are playing so that you can learn how to win and then apply those strategies in a casino.   The soundtrack, however, is very good. The soothing sounds of chips clicking, bones rolling, and cards being shuffled are all very realistic. Even the voice acting is good. The best part of the voice work is that the developers went for straight on slang, at times without any kind of explanation. For example, in craps they will simply yell ~yo~ when an eleven comes up. Solid stuff.   Obviously, the game is not without flaw. However, most players would never notice most of them. It just happens to be that I know a few things about these games, so I expected a lot. I have mentioned the few shortcomings: being on first base in blackjack, the undefined parameters of the ace, waiting through gameplay after you are out of the action, etc. These are all forgivable, though. The AI is, at times, predictable. But, this too, is forgivable.   I must repeat that this game is great for anyone with a DC that wants to learn how to gamble. Playing with friends makes learning even better as they are less... predictable... than the machine can sometimes be. That said, deal me in!   - M Wiley", "date": "Oct 10, 2000"}
