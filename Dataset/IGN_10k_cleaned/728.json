In fact, it's spent its near year life establishing itself as a handheld with a unique game library. Which is why it's a bit odd to be playing Shanghai Mini on the system. The game's been available on other systems...even the Game Boy Color with Shanghai Pocket. Still, this is an awesome addition to anyone's NeoGeo Pocket collection...it's just not going to sell many systems. Features Three game modes Password save Link cable support for two players For NeoGeo Pocket Color  Like Shanghai Pocket on the Game Boy Color, Shanghai Mini on the NeoGeo is a handheld rendition of the classic Activision Shanghai puzzle game. What's Shanghai? Well, in an extremely basic description, if you take Mah Jongg tiles, stack them up into different shapes, and then challenge yourself to remove pairs of tiles off the field, that's Shanghai.  The only way you can get rid of tiles is to have exposed tile pairs that can freely move left or right  in other words, if they're wedged into place by tiles on their right and left, then you can't remove them. Once you remove the tiles, you can work your way into the pile  clear out the entire pile with nothing left and you've won the round.  The NeoGeo version of the game is very similar to the Game Boy Color edition. So close, in fact, that some of the same graphic tiles have been borrowed from the Game Boy version. In some cases, the more detailed tiles look better on the Game Boy Color version  but once you know what you're looking at, you'll get used to the few pixels trying to portray an image of a bird or a season.  Unique to the series is the Tournament mode. Here, you're in a ~quest,~ being challenged by 12 different opponents, each with his or her own layout to solve. In the standard mode you have the option of reshuffling tiles when you have no move left, and you're not racing a clock. But in tournament mode, you've got to beat a certain time, and you can't take back moves once you've pulled them off the board. Run out of moves or time, and you've lost. Luckily, the game has a password that'll get you back into the Tournament when you quit. What's odd is, Shanghai Mini is one of the first NeoGeo games with a save feature, without a battery-backed cartridge. Is this indicitive of SNK cutting corners?  The other great mode is the two player challenge  you can go up against a computer or human opponent (with another system, another copy of the game, and a link cable) in a splitscreen game, where you both work on the same layout. The hitch is, there are tiles in there that will cause the other person grief if they match the two tiles together. There are tiles that will cause the other person's layout to shuffle, scramble or flip over for a few seconds, other tiles that will cause his cursor to go in the opposite direction of where he's moving it, and even one that puts three pairs back on his layout. This adds more of a ~screw the opponent~ factor into a usually calm game.  Shanghai Mini's a basic game, but a welcome one  this NeoGeo Pocket Color title isn't going to persuade gamers to jump the Game Boy Color boat onto the SNK ship, but it's definitely a title that every system  owner should pick up -- the game is just as addicting as the game has been since it hit the gaming market over a decade ago. And the NeoGeo Pocket Color version is the best portable version of Shanghai yet.", "date": "Feb 19, 2000"}
