Well, I suppose if the game was any good, I wouldn't be complaining.  But the game isn't good.  It's boring and repetitive, and aside from a cool little background story and some funny cut scenes, lacks any real merit.  To the game's credit, it certainly looks and feels like a modern day Centipede.  You pilot The Shooter as you battle the Queen Centipede and her legion of evil insects who are reigning unheard-of terror on the peaceful Wee People.  You'll find yourself flying about through six worlds, each with five or six levels, taking out bugs, destroying mushrooms, saving Wee People, and protecting homes, crystals, and various other objects.  Centipedes come flocking down in formation from certain walls, and just like in the 2D arcade game, they scoot about from side to side, turning the other way and moving one step forward when they make contact with a barrier.  Each centipede, when destroyed, turns into a mushroom.  Destroy a group of centipedes, and a new group will emerge.  Do this two or three times, and you gain access to the next area of the level.  Repeat three or four times, and you have an entire level.  Repeat this five or six times, add a boss, and you have a world.  Repeat this six times, throw in some cut scenes, and you have the Centipede experience.  In addition to the centipedes, you'll find yourself facing off against spiders, scorpions, land bugs, and flying creatures.  Everyone moves and looks as you'd expect.  The developers have also gotten the sound effects for blasting and what-not down pat - the game sounds video-gamey, just as it should.  Combine this with humorous, albeit short, cinemas between levels, and you have Centipede brought appropriately to modern times.  So what's the big problem with the game?  Well, it's not the graphics.  They're not great by any means, especially considering the choppy framerate when the screen is full of mushrooms and creatures, but they're certainly functional, and some of the effects and textures look very nice (the water in the latter levels is gorgeous).  Let's see . . . how about the controls.  Ahh, that's usually something that destroys a game.  It turns out that Centipede controls well, and gives you the option of customizing your control scheme to best suite you.  I suppose, then, that the music could be the culprit/  The techno is, afterall, totally generic, and for some reason stops at seemingly random points.  Then again, bad music was never a reason to totally avoid a game.  No, the real problem with Centipede is that it's a complete bore.  Blasting the centipedes gets old and tedious after a few minutes in the first level.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much all there is to the game, except for a few boss encounters that are made frustrating by the game's one-hit-and-you're-dead policy.  The game usually fails to establish any real sense of urgency for you, the player, to actually destroy the centipedes.  And even though some of the later levels have a bit of intensity, it turns out to be more tedium than anything.  Furthermore, the game is far too greedy in distributing power-ups - you'll find yourself, for the most part, using your default laser fire.  Beyond these problems lay an unrefined game system, where jumping accurately is difficult, only one viewpoint is of any use, and getting stuck on a section of the playfield is commonplace.  The game also makes a fatal error in the way it manages saved games.  Each time you pass a level, your progress is saved to the VMU.  But here's the catch.  The game creates a new file each time!  At sixteen blocks a file, and considering that I had some other stuff in my VMU, I ran out of space after the fourth level, and got a ~Failed to Save~ message at the end of each subsequent level.  Not a good thing when you have a couple of dozen-or-so levels left.  Okay, why not take out the VMU and erase the old files.  First off, I shouldn't have to do this.  And beyond that, it just so happened that I didn't have any battery power left in my VMU.  I was not amused.  I was lucky, though, in that I was able to start up my other Dreamcast (yes, I have two) and go into the file manager through there.  I erased a few of my non-Centipede-related files, and popped the VMU back into the controller for my American system.  Well look at that!  The game refused to recognize the VMU!  I don't know what the designers of the game were expecting of players, many of whom would probably like to avoid having to deal with the intricacies of Dreamcast memory management.  As it stands, I got through the latter part of the game, but I couldn't save the progress to my VMU.  Too bad . . . I was hoping to take a few screenshots showing some of the cool ice effects from the third world.  This inexplicable bug aside, though, the game fails due to its inability to generate excitement on any level.  Even the split screen two player mode proves to be just as boring as the one player game - never mind the horrid framerate.  The only moderately fun part of the game is the included classic mode, where you can have a go at the original Centipede - but that's hardly a reason to buy the game.  Stay far away from this one, folks.  It tries to bring some mindless fun to the Dreamcast, but it forgets the fun.   -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 23, 1999"}
