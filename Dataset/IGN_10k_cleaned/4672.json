This summer, kids will surely giggle their way through the live action ~Garfield~ movie, based on cartoonist Jim Davis' famous fat cat. But why wait? Centerscore has ported the portly feline to handsets in CS Garfield Pinball, a silver ball sim for the decidedly un-pinball wizards.   Features:   Features characters from the comic -- Garfield, Odie, John  Nine onboard sub-quests  Vertically scrolling screen   CS Garfield Pinball is actually one third of a suite of ~Garfield~-themed games, including CS Garfield Gin Rummy and Garfield Bowling. This is by no means the world's most realistic pinball simulator -- but it doesn't appear to have been tried to be that, either.   Rather, CS Garfield Pinball is an excuse to goof with the beloved characters. The two-screen table features Garfield and his arch-nemesis Odie, owner John, and even his teddy bear Pooky. These faces are actually geared after their comic strip appearances, not the upcoming movie. So, feel safe knowing your phone is not about to be infested by Breckin Meyer.   However, we certainly could have used a little Bill Murray or Lorenzo Music sass -- the two men who has provided pipes for the cat. The game itself is somewhat bland. It tries, but just not very hard. For one thing, the pinball physics are kinda screwy. Blue Lava Wireless' Pinball Dragon and Sorrent's Ren & Stimpy Pinball each at least approximated correct ball arcs and shots. In CS Garfield Pinball, the ball is certainly blasted the direction you flip it in, but its return course seems dictated less by gravity than a bizarro system of magnets under the table.   Centerscore attempts to add some strategy to the game by infusing it with a series of sub-quests, completed by nailing the correct bumpers or ramps. Garfield loves to nap, so if you can pound N-A-P, you get a major bonus.Get ready for the absolute deluge of ~Garfield~-related stuff in the next few months, but unless you're a huge fan of the furry fella, hold off on indulging in CS Garfield Pinball. In fact, save your three bucks for a plate of the kitty's much-coveted lasagna or a ticket to the movie.", "date": "Apr 28, 2004"}
