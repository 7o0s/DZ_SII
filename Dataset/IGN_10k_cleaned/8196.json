Mind you, perhaps 'leap' is the wrong word 'sideways shuffle' would probably be more apt.    Not that RE4 has lost anything in the move to PC. It's just that it hasn't gained anything either. This is a bare bones port that fails to update the graphics engine or art assets in any way, resulting in a game that looks both dated, and in many ways, inferior to its predecessors. Maybe it's the inexorable march of expectations, or maybe it's just the fact that those old textures don't hold up so well in higher resolutions - especially without the expert use of shaders and lighting that gave the original so much mood and tone. Either way, if you can look past the obvious technical shortcomings and frequent signposts that decry 'Console Port!', Resident Evil 4's gameplay is every bit as compelling as it was on both GameCube and PS2.   What's been happening in Raccoon City? Well, Umbrella Corp is no more, and one of the only survivors of the outbreak, Leon Kennedy (see: RE2), is making his way into an isolated region somewhere in Europe, on the trail of the President's kidnapped daughter. Umbrella may be gone, and the game may not be set in Raccoon City, but you can expect a tale full of plot twists, shotguns, dogs with shifty eyes, numerous characters with their own agendas, and amazing big bads.   The most important thing to know about Resident Evil 4 is that it's quite a significant lateral shift for the series. Where previous games were very much archetypal survival horror - exploring environments, solving puzzles and dealing with shuffling zombies, RE4 puts the focus firmly on action. The controls have been reworked, with an over-the-shoulder camera perspective, and a far more user-friendly manual aiming system. That said, Capcom has deliberately restricted the player's control to help maintain a sense of tension and panic. As opposed to a typical run and gun action game, Leon is rooted to the spot when he draws his firearm or knife. There's no strafing either - whether you have a weapon drawn or not. RE4 is still run-and-turn territory, so if you've got a number of enemies coming at you, your only options are to stand your ground, back up achingly slowly, or do a quick 180 and run away, then turn back when you've created some room. Thank god for the 180 turn.   Before we go any further on the subject of control, however, it's essential that you all know - categorically - that you're going to need a good dual analogue controller to play this game. Trying to play with a keyboard (minus mouse control) is next to impossible. In fact, consider the overall score a 5.0 if you don't have a quality controller. With an Xbox 360 controller, on the other hand, we had absolutely no control issues - the game felt just right.   Chunk and Sloth reunite at a Goonies convention. Looks like they've both toned up.  One of the biggest changes for Resident Evil 4 is the fact that your adversaries are no longer zombies - they're parasite-afflicted humans. Thus, they're smarter than the average zombie. They can open doors, climb ladders, come in through windows and sidestep to avoid fire (occasionally). More importantly, they move a hell of a lot faster than zombies do, often breaking into a lumbering jog as they come after you. Unlike previous games, you won't be facing them in low numbers either - there can be five or ten pursuing you at once, and their faster movement, combined with the large number of hits it often takes to kill them, means that there's still a huge amount of tension in every encounter, especially given the limits to your control. Thankfully, Leon has a few new tricks up his sleeve. He has a whole host of context sensitive actions, from diving through windows, to pushing bookshelves across doors, and even knocking down ladders as enemies climb them.   The player can certainly be more resourceful when it comes to using Leon's surroundings, but in keeping with one of the central tenets of the series, it's also important to know how best to utilise your arsenal. Simply put, if you get too trigger-happy, you're going to run out of ammunition very quickly. Instead, players have to take their time to make each shot count (although be warned - the headshot is only really viable for the first portion of the game), even if there are five enemies all quickly closing the gap.    Annoyingly, switching weapons still requires a trip to the attach case screen, taking the player out of the action for something that could easily be hot-keyed to a button. Having to enter in, then out, then in and out again to throw a grenade then switch back to your previous weapon, is poor design, plain and simple. Thankfully, the knife is available at the press of a button, and there are context sensitive melee attacks Leon can do at certain times when enemies are close. That said, close quarters manoeuvres still feel really clumsy and weighted against the player, which can be frustrating, but with practice you'll learn the best ways to conserve ammo without taking too great a risk.    One of the highlights of the combat system, on the other hand, is the great EXP system which allows you to use the in-game currency to buy new weapons and new attachments, as well as upgrading existing weapons in a host of areas. It brings an important sense of evolution to combat, not to mention an incentive to play through the game multiple times in search of the ultimate weapons.    While the minor complaints we've detailed so far could also be leveled at the console versions of RE4, the interactive action cutscenes have definitely taken a turn for the worse in the move to PC. During certain sequences players are required to hammer a button to get away from something (think Indy-esque rolling boulders), then hit a couple of buttons to dive out of the way. Fair enough, but the buttons you're required to hit are represented by numbers in the PC game, so it will often take a few attempts combined with consulting the manual to actually know which buttons the game is talking about. Adding insult to injury, the manual actually has two of the buttons (1 and 3) around the wrong way. Unless we somehow inadvertently managed to change the default. We can only imagine how annoying these sequences would be on a keyboard (again - don't play this game if you only have a keyboard).    Most vexing is that the developer hasn't even bothered to implement relevant icons based on the controller you're using. Sure, there are a lot of USB game pads out there, but wouldn't it make sense to at least support the most popular ones? We know that the game had no trouble recognising our 360 controller, so why not go the extra step and have the 'LB + RB' buttons pop up on screen instead of the somewhat enigmatic '5 + 6'?   We may have a few qualms, but at its core Resident Evil 4 is a masterfully designed game. The pacing especially is superb throughout; Capcom really understands how to build tension, how to design confrontations that leave a tight knot of panic rising in the pit of the player's stomach, and how to give a moment's reprieve, only to ratchet up the action once more. This isn't a horror game in the sense of spring loaded scares, it's much more than that. Unrelentingly bleak environments lend RE4 an oppressive mood, while the numerous set pieces and consistently compelling boss battles ensure that you're never sure just how much longer you'll be able to keep your head firmly attached to its shoulders. And sometimes it's the small touches that impress most - the sound of a chainsaw starting up outside as you barricade yourself inside a house, for instance, can be a terrifying moment. The calm before the storm, it signals an onslaught that will have you wheeling on the spot, trying to cover every entrance, and hoping you don't hear the dreaded click that signals the end of your ammo.   Sexy girls and sexy guns. The ultimate combo.  The narrative, while often featuring terrible dialogue and hoary old story mechanics (like constantly coming across 'evil guy communiqus') certainly provides a good excuse for the action, and upon finishing the game, you'll have access to a number of missions as side-character Ada Wong, allowing you to see the story from another perspective. It's a great inclusion, and takes a game that already has a lengthy play time (20+ hours) and injects even more.   When RE4 was first released on GameCube, it was hailed as one of the best-looking console titles ever. Time has not been kind to Resident Evil 4, particularly because the PC port has actually lost a lot of the visual subtlety of the original. The engine hasn't been upgraded in any way - other than to allow the game to run in much higher resolutions, and in fact has lost a lot in the move to PC, leaving a game bereft of decent lighting and shaders. The art design still shines through, but it's clear that this game could have been so much more on PC. There are even obvious discrepancies between different aspects of the presentation. There's a big disparity between the Vaseline-smeared cutscenes and the in-game visuals for instance, while the fuzzy typewriter save screens are at odds with the ~do you wish to save~ text overlay. It's a good thing the gameplay and design is so good, because RE4 looks pretty awful compared to most modern PC titles.   Yes, while the series may have left the moaning undead and their slow, shuffling movement behind in the move to RE4, there are certainly figurative traces of their presence in the quality of this port. Its not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is as if the game has simply lumbered onto PC, in search of fresh brains, instead of making full use of the systems potential. Even so, if you don't have access to a GameCube or PS2, it's well worth checking out what all the fuss is about. RE4 stands as one of the great console action games, and now it's on PC.Want to have your say about Resident Evil 4? Rock on over to the  Aussie forums.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
