It's a very relaxing genre, and sometimes there's nothing more soothing than to kick back and play a round of 18. It's not exactly the real thing, but not everyone has the knack or patience to learn the perfect backswing. So, we rely on our good friend the PlayStation to give us The Next Best Thing. With games like Tiger Woods '99 or Hot Shots Golf, you can pretend you're the next pro-to-be and imagine that the winnings you've earned are real. Or not.  Unfortunately, like every genre, there's bound to be a stinker of the bunch. And in the PlayStation's case, it comes from Psygnosis. Pro 18 World Tour Golf is one of the worst recreations of golf made on a game system, and there is nothing this package has that would entice you to boot the game up a second time. And when you've got great golf games like the PlayStation's Hot Shots Golf and Tiger Woods '99, there's absolutely no reason to pick up this game at all.  Gameplay  One thing going for Pro 18 is its options. It features three 18-hole courses: Royal County Down in Ireland, The Lost City Course in Sun City, South Africa, and Coeur d'Alene in Idaho. It also features a handful of well known pros from around the world, including Mark O'Meara and Colin Mongomerie, but you cannot play as them. You can also pick the type of weather you want to play in, from fog to rain, or simply play during a nice day.  Like most golf games, Pro 18 features a click-interface for driving the ball. The first tap of the button sends the swing meter up the powerbar. Hitting the button a second time sets the power and brings the swing meter back down. A third click at the bottom of the swing determines how accurate the connection to the ball will be. But Pro 18 features one more meter that makes hitting the ball even more difficult. As soon as you hit the button a third time, the bottom green meter zips across so fast, you really don't know what to do. The idea is to release the button when the green bar meets the middle of the meter for the most accurate shot. If you don't time it correctly, the ball will slice or hook violently  and you really don't want that to happen.  The interface is the game's major downfall. You have absolutely no idea how far a certain club will go until you use it. What's worse is that if you rotate the screen, there's no guide rule on the overhead map that shows you where you're pointing  due to the poor graphics engine, it's extremely hard to see where the pin is from a distance. And without any assistance it's a chore to play the game. Graphics  If the game uses a 3D engine, you'd never know it. The game is presented in ~slides.~ Want to turn your aiming? The game pauses for a second, then jerks to the left or right to alter the perspective. And when you drive the ball down the course, the camera changes its angle so the ball moves towards the viewer  but it's all in one step. There's barely any in-game animation to speak of.  And the contrast between player and background is a little odd, since the course graphics are still, blocky textures, and the golfers are 30 frames-per-second FMV. When you combine the two, it's a mixture that just looks completely awkward. Sound  Pro 18 does have some voice-over commentary, but it's so subtle you'd barely even notice it. There are audio clips of birds and such, but again, it's not noticeable. If you wanted to crank down the audio track for more favorable music from an outside source, go right ahead. You won't be missing much. Well, you can easily see that I hate this game. I love golf games  and I'm not afraid to admit it. The best one on the PlayStation is easily Hot Shots Golf, not just because of the great interface and smooth 3D graphics, but because of all the things you can uncover  including courses, players, and secrets. Sure, it didn't have any true-life licenses for players and courses, but so what? It was all about the gameplay.But Pro 18 barely has any at all. The interface is clunky, the graphics are muddy, and you've probably never even heard of some of the real players in the game. When you bring out a game for a specific genre, it's a good idea to at least come close to the quality of the other games you're going to join. Why buy this game when you can have two golf titles that are infinitely better?", "date": "Apr 8, 1999"}
