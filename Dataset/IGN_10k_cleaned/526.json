Like the previous four Midway classic arcade compilation packs (Williams Arcade Classics, Atari Classics 1 and 2), Arcade Party Pack is a disk filled with emulated and converted classic Midway-owned arcade games. Each of these games are spot-on replicas of its original arcade counter part in terms of graphics, sound, and animation (with the exception of Rampage, but we'll get to that shortly).   How did each of the games fare in the translations from arcade to PlayStation? Here's the list, in no particular order:   Toobin' In this 1988 Atari Games arcade title, you're pitted with the task of sailing down a variety of rivers avoiding obstacles that are out to pop your inner tube. Float through point gates and pick up power-ups like tin cans or extra patches that'll help you on your way through each of the locations, like the shore, Amazon River, Congo, even a prehistoric landscape. The game is a race to see which player can get the most points and get to the end of the river first  if a second player isn't in the game, a computer drone will take over after a couple minutes of play.  How's the translation? The PlayStation rendition of Toobin' is spot on  even in the control department, the programmers put in not only the proper button configuration (the arcade had five buttons: Left Paddle Forward and Reverse, Right Paddle Forward and Reverse, and Throw Can), but they made it even easier by mapping appropriate commands to the joypad as well. The graphics are as good as you're going to get on a standard television, since the arcade game not only utilized high-resolution modes, but it also utilized a vertical configuration for the monitor. The graphics tend to get washed out since some of the pixels are blended together  details of the character sprites are lost.  The one real problem with Toobin' is not the translation  it just wasn't a very fun game when it came out in the arcade. It was tedious and slow-paced, and while it was an original concept, it's not really considered ~a classic.~ Klax Atari needed a quickly-designed game back in 1989  in just a few months, a group of designers created a pseudo-follow up to its Tetris arcade release, Klax. In this puzzle game, you catch puzzle tiles on a paddle, and flip the colored pieces into a bin below. If these pieces form three, four, or five colors in a row in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal formation, they'll disappear and shift the pile above them back into the bin. Each level has a certain quota to match, whether it's forming a certain number of horizontal matches, or simply catching a specific number of tiles. The game also has a split-screen mode so two players can work on independent boards.  How's the translation? Perfect. The game may not have the replayability of the classic Tetris, but it's a nicely designed puzzle game that makes a great addition to this compilation pack. Every system needs a game of Klax  back in the 8 and 16-bit days, Tengen (Atari Games' home console team) released the title on every system back then. And now, you can get the game that was originally released in the arcade in perfect form on the PlayStation.  Super Sprint In 1986, Atari Games revisited the old Indy 500 classic top-down multiplayer racing game with a faster, prettier, and down-right more fun rendition called Super Sprint. The game was simple in design  you had a foot pedal and steering wheel, and you simply drove the game's many tracks trying to be first place. As long as you beat the computer drones, you could continue onto the next race. If you pick up enough wrenches on the play field, you could upgrade your vehicle attributes such as top speed or acceleration. Up to three players can enter the race at any time  but there's always a drone to beat.  How's the translation? Now, I don't know about you, but Super Sprint was always one of my favorites in the arcade. The game was all about finesse  since the game utilized a steering wheel that could freely spin without any stops, the whole idea was to ~whip~ the wheel and catch it when your car leaves the turns. The game was fun to watch, because it was like a ballet for the hands  spin, catch, spin, catch, all to a mental rhythm to follow the path set before you.   Unfortunately, this control scheme gets lost on the PlayStation  the developers did do a great job with the analog support for the Dual Shock, but it's just not the same in console form. As a game for the PlayStation, it's decent fun if you've never played the original, but do yourself a favor and find an old arcade machine to see what this game's all about.   In terms of everything else, though...spot on.  720 Back in the skate craze of the '80s, Atari Games put out a fantastic, stylized arcade game titled 720 (1986, to be exact). The game was simplistic in design, but not in imagery  you simply kicked to pick up speed so you could jump and pull off spin moves to earn points. More points means access to the four different events scattered across the skate park  and if you don't have a ticket to enter them before time runs out, you lose your game. The game also awards you points based on your performance in the events  Halfpipe, Slalom, High Jump, and Downhill. The only way you're going to be able to continue is if you pull off jumps and spins over water, avoid traffic between events, and locate some of the hidden jumps in the game. And, you'll also have the opportunity to upgrade your character with items such as a helmet or pads to make your life a little ~quicker.~  How's the translation? The arcade utilized a joystick that could rotate in a 360 degree fashion without being able to move up to down, or left to right  not an easy thing to translate to the home system. The PlayStation conversion is the first game to pretty much successfully convert the unique control scheme  that is, if you have a Dual Shock controller. The joystick doesn't prevent the action of moving from top to bottom, so you'll need to keep that in mind while playing (it could really screw you up if you went from Up to Down instantly), and keep the joystick moving in a cycloid fashion. 720 was an awesome game nearly a half a decade ago, and it's still fun today.  Smash TV When it comes right down to it, Smash TV is simply an 1990 updated version of Robotron 2084. But instead of you saving humanoids while blasting robots from all directions, you're caught in the future's most popular game show: Smash TV. Fend off wave after wave of bat-wielding bad guys, Mr. Shrapnel, and turret gunners all while picking up cash, toasters, and the home version of the game. It's a funny satire as well as one hell of an action game.  How's the translation? Smash TV is the reason to pick up this compilation pack. Less than a decade ago people were paying full price to get a decent, yet not perfect conversion of the game on the Super NES, and now you can have an arcade perfect rendition on the PlayStation in a compilation pack. The two Dual Shock joysticks do a great job simulating the two sticks (one fire, one move) of the arcade.  Rampage In 1985, Bally/Midway released a movie monster game by the name Rampage. And it was good  the whole idea was to give the gamer the opportunity to be the bad guy for a change, putting him in the role of a giant, 100 foot beast, taking out city buildings and eating pesky humans for health. Three characters could enter the fray, one a giant gorilla, one a huge lizard, and the other a mighty wolf. Other than to ultimately destroy all 100 cities in the game, there really wasn't any point to the game  but maybe that was half the fun. How's the translation? Ugh. I don't know what happened here, but Rampage on this disk is pretty darn horrible. The animation is downright choppy, and the resolution has been dropped from the arcade version that the graphics look muddy and less detailed. To today's standards you wouldn't give Rampage more than a few minutes of attention, but this PlayStation rendition is so painful to watch and play, you won't even give it that much.   The classics are always a good thing to go back to, especially when you want to see the roots of where videogames have been to understand where they're going. This arcade pack is a definite keeper for five quality games (Rampage is the true stinker), but you'll have to keep in mind that two of these games had arcade-specific control schemes that might not have translated to home as well  a hardware limitation. My other gripe is with the ~history~ for each of the games. Digital Eclipse included video interviews of the designers of each game, but they never bothered to title the clips with the actual designers' names or their positions on the game. They're just yapping away, and you're supposed to know who these guys are. If I never actually met Eugene Jarvis or Mark Turmell, I would never have known who was talking  I had the upper hand because I met half these guys, but the normal viewer might not have that knowledge. The only other complaint, and it's one that most people would never notice  when this pack was originally announced, it was supposed to have another six games, including NARC and APB. Time and technology restraints prevented most of the games from ending up on the disk, but NARC was turned down because of its drug ~usage~ (even though the message was ~Drugs are BAD~). Midway didn't want a Teen rating for its game, so NARC ended up on the cutting room floor. A shame  I was really looking forward to that one. But as a compilation pack, the majority of the games are quality product. It's not a stunning, bowl-you-over collection, but it's a good value for the buck  and another disk for collectors.", "date": "Dec 14, 1999"}
