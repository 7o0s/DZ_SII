Viewers were immediately intrigued by ABC's mysterious drama for a number of reasons, not the least of which included good acting and some plot twists that hinted at darker forces at work on the island. And now Gameloft has released a mobile game based on the first seasons of the show, recapping all of the highlights, such as the discovery of the hatch and meeting the Others.   In fact, Lost follows the plot so firmly that if you are haven't yet joined the cult that follows this show, you may want to consider whether or not you want Gameloft spoiling a lot of secrets for you. The mobile story recreates pivotal moments -- and for somebody that actually had limited exposure to the serial, save for a few episodes I caught here and there, I now wonder if I should even bother with those DVDs I have in my Blockbuster queue.   We might as well get this comparison out of the way now: Glu's Stranded, while obviously inspired by the television show Lost, is actually the better game. Each game has a linear adventure you move through, but Stranded just has so much extra stuff going on -- animal cataloging, recipe trading -- that you will get more game for your download dollar from Glu's desert island epic.   But will that even matter to fans of the ABC serial? The better question here, though, is if the strict adherence to Lost canon is detrimental to the game play at all. Because most, if not all, of the events are already etched in stone, you are more of a puppeteer than a gamer, putting hero Jack through the paces dictated by show scribes. Many licensed games deal with this situation, but some handle it better than other. I-play's 24 (developed by Big Blue Bubble), for example, is a fine example of using the source material as a springboard, not a stencil.   Gameloft says that the game fleshes out some situations thanks to a storyline written by people that work on the actual television show. Because I haven't watched enough of Lost to know when the show stops and the game's original content picks up, I can safely tell you that no matter what, I always felt limited in some way or another. Want to explore the island at all? Sorry, pal, it's time to open the hatch. The game shuffles you from point A to point B to point C without ever giving you a moment to stop and smell the Venus Fly trap.   The mechanics themselves are very basic action-adventure staples. Jack runs around the island, occasionally using a knife or gun to deal with problems as they arise. Use a pistol to blast boars as they stampede out of the jungle. There is some puzzle play, such as pushing rocks and crates to clear paths. Lost even brings out some stealth elements, as seen in a scene when you must infiltrate the Others' camp to rescue friends. You can hide in tall grass to avoid detection or sneak up on a guard when he faces away from Jack. (I'm trying to be purposefully obtuse about a few things here, as I dunno who wants what ruined for them. I mean, I think we all pretty much know about the Others and the hatch by now, yes?)   The game is divided into a series of episodes, each small enough that you can play though one or two in your stolen moments. Each sequence introduces something new, such as stealth, pushing rocks/crates, using dynamite, etc. The game certainly has flow to it, but the pacing is so fast and you're always being nudged forward that you never get a chance to really breathe in the Lost universe.   The iPod edition of Lost is boosted with greatly improved visuals over the mobile version. Tiny character portraits are replaced with highly detailed photos of the cast members delivering their dialog. Every scene bursts with bright colors, especially the lush island jungles. The sound is also well done, thanks to the increased memory of an iPod game.   Controls are typically the Achilles heel of iPod games, but Lost works better than expected. Doing an activity is assigned to the central button and is responsive enough. Running in different directions requires fluttering your fingers along the four cardinal directions of the wheel, but few segments require absolute pixel-perfect control that it becomes difficult.Lost is an extremely linear game that never allows you to step outside a very preordained path between plot points. Because you are replaying highlight scenes from the show, this design decision makes sense, but with the Lost universe apparently so rich with character development, intriguing locations, and mystery, being ~on rails~ is kind of a disappointment.The iPod edition of Lost does feature far superior visuals and sound than the original mobile version -- it really pops off your 5G screen. The excellent color and nicely framed character portraits are quite nice. The click wheel controls are decent, better than in past iPod titles. It's good to see Gameloft approach the iPod as a viable gaming platform, but hopefully future efforts offer more game for the dollar.", "date": "Jun 18, 2007"}
