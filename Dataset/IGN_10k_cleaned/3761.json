All political, diplomatic, economic and even tactical concerns are all eclipsed by the need to make bigger and better armies for the purpose of gaining more territory to make bigger armies to gain more territory.  The title is a follow-up and marginal improvement to Slitherine's first effort, Legion. We didn't think much of the game when it came out. Rather than offering a Europa Universalis-inspired style of empire management, Legion displayed a one-size-fits all approach to game design, mistaking narrow vision for focus. While Chariots of War certainly adds more to the mix -- bigger maps, more nations, more units and more resources -- the quantitative additions fail to address the fundamental weaknesses of the game.  Playing out in a turn-based empire building format set in the ancient Near East, Chariots of War places you at the head of one of a number of great powers and tasks you with taking over the territories of your neighbors. The developers have wisely decided to step back a bit from complete historical authenticity by allowing the various powers of the Near East to exist side-by-side at the same time. The Egyptians will mix it up with the Assyrians while the Hittites bring a righteous vengeance down on the Israelites.  The impetus for all this conquest (apart from your own twisted Napoleon complex) is to get more resources to produce more units to take over yet more territories.  The six campaigns included with the game don't set up particular scenarios so much as they simply focus on a specific area of the map. You can play with historical cultures or simply have the game assign civilizations randomly to each of the areas of the map. The map itself is fantastic with loads of accurate terrain details and small pockets of crucial resources for the taking. Just hope and pray you have an early source of copper.  Despite the few unique units for specific cultural groups, there's very little to choose from among the player civilizations. The most important differences arise as a result of your starting location. Since the resources are scarce, you'll almost always need to trade something you do have for something you don't. The trade interface could use a bit of work here but as I said, the game isn't about diplomacy or finance except as they relate to creating big armies to crush your opponents. There's no option for a peaceful victory here.  Though it includes new units not found in Legion (including the chariots of the title), the differences between them aren't immediately apparent. The manual takes pains to explain that auxilia are best used on rough terrain and that spearmen can be used to turn a cavalry charge, but the majority of your tactical appreciation for these units will have to come from watching the battles to see whether or not your plans are working.  But given this focus of the game, why isn't there more tactical control? In games like Medieval Total War where the whole point is (essentially) to fight battles, there's a robust tactical interface that allows you to command your troops on the field. Not so in Chariots of War. Apart from the composition of your armies and their placement on the field of battle, you'll have no control over the outcome of the fight.  The battles in Chariots of War are a frustratingly chaotic and random affair. You simply position your armies on your side of the battlefield, hit ~go,~ and watch them walk straight up to the enemy army. The judicious commitment of reserves, the opportunity to outflank and enemy and a host of other tactical options can be suggested during the setup phase but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll be implemented once the battle is joined. If the enemy army has placed more than four or five units in the front rank, the narrowness of the battlefield prevents any really interesting maneuvers. (Even if the enemy has only positioned one or two units along the border you hope to flank, you're similarly screwed.)  Another irritation is that city garrisons don't defend by themselves, preferring to open their doors to even the smallest of invading forces unless you happen to have a field army stationed at the city as well. This tends to slow the pace of the game a bit as you're not able to field an army large enough to penetrate deep in to enemy territory. Accurate though it may be, it definitely keeps the game from building a much-needed momentum.  The speed is helped a bit by the new monthly nature of the turns (in Legion things ran in seasons). Units and buildings are completed according to a monthly timetable rather than all being completed in the Spring as they were in Legion. But the constant building, tweaking and oversight of your empire still feel just like a way to make more armies. If that's the point of the game, simply give me the armies and the chance to use them the way I want.  The graphics have been improved a bit in the latest version of this engine. You can now run the game in 1024x768 but even with this higher resolution, the game still looks very dated. Unit types quickly become indistinguishable in the general melee (not that it matters given the automatic resolution of battles). Things are much better on the overall empire map and you can really pick out all sorts of interesting little features that help bring the world to life. The interface has also been polished quite a bit and offers a much more friendly experience than was found in Legion. As with Legion the sound in the game seems to be a bit of an afterthought.Though it's better than Legion, Chariots of War still suffers a severe lack of depth. Any sense of sophistication or intensity found in the game is merely superficial. There have been many fantastic military-oriented games that shed more light on other areas of empire management. The games that do it well manage to make options for diplomacy, trade and technology compelling in other non-military ways. In those games you can more easily leverage one benefit for another and there are often compelling reasons to do so. In Chariots of War, the only thing that matters are your armies and anything that doesn't relate to fielding more troops has no place in your strategy.Though it tries to straddle the fence between games like Civilization and the first Age of Empires, there's simply not enough meat here to keep gamers coming back for more.", "date": "Jul 2, 2003"}
