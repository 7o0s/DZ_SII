It's a bold move in exploring new depths of sheer worthlessness, but those depths are now well mapped out. Anyone looking to see what a complete waste of space can be... well, look no further.   There are dozens and dozens of guns in NRA Gun Club, but most of the action is identical. Aim with the right analog stick, hold L2 to zoom in a bit, and tap R1 to shoot. Holding your breath helps to steady the gun and with all of the other buttons on the controller to choose from the decision was made to make the R3 button, the one hit by pushing the right analog stick in, the one. Maybe this is to balance out the supreme aiming assistance of a paused breath, but it's also plainly idiotic. Last I checked my hands and my lungs weren't directly connected, but here it's easy to try and start holding one's breath in the game only to move the aim over slightly and botch the whole process.    Maybe some people would go past this artificial hurdle to play what would be an exciting game, but there is no exciting gameplay in NRA Gun Club. I'll take a wild guess that the fun of a gun club is the shooting of real guns rather than ripping a piece of paper with black circles on it to shreds. What's left here is more of a game of guessing where the aim really is. It's a little tough to accurately shoot off individual cans from a stack when the whole bunch of them blur together into a red and white mess.    For those obsessed with numbers and scoring, NRA Gun Club has a delightful bit of randomness going for it. Larger targets are typically easier to hit and have fewer points than the dinky targets far away, but now always. And that is where the fun begins. That bottle that is hanging from a string thirty feet away is worth five points while the bottle right in the front is 10. And of course the bottles on strings don't break while those that are standing on their own get obliterated. Life just isn't fair in NRA land.   The purpose behind the game may be to show off the different guns, but what NRA Gun Club shows is that a bigger clip and a faster reload time is all that matters. Since all of the scoring is based on hitting lots of targets within the same time limit any other difference is just cosmetic. Extensive playtime will reveal that there are different looks to the guns and different sound effects, but that's about it.So if you want to practice fighting with a fidgety controller as you try to take down bottles and other random targets, NRA Gun Club is for you. If anything else, such as fun or variety or not wanting to bang your head on the floor, should appeal to you, then avoid this like the plague. The only time that this game inspired me to want a real gun was when I took the disc out of my PS2. Seeing this digitized crap explode into a hundred silvery slivers would have been the only bit of satisfaction it could ever deliver.", "date": "Nov 27, 2006"}
