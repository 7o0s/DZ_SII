The game was originally planned on a Fall of 2001 release, rushed to make shelves for the GBA's first holiday season...with several features missing. Elements that all of the other competing first-person shooters on the system contain. But for obvious reasons, the final product was put on-hold in September 2001. The developers were able to go back to the Duke project and give it a needed once over. The extra time in development did absolute wonders for the game, because Duke Nukem Advance is without a doubt the most fun first-person shooter on the GBA to date. Features: 19 missions 10 different weapons Cartridge save (five slots) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Torus Games, the development team that handled Duke Nukem's side-scrolling GBC game released a few years back, returns to the post-apocalyptic world of Duke and the mutant aliens on the Game Boy Advance. This time, the team based its design around the game that really kick-started the series into high-gear: the PC version of Duke Nukem 3D. The Game Boy Advance game looks and sounds like the computer title, but Torus has created a brand new adventure and a new plot surrounding the familiar action and characters.  Seems Duke's been recruited by the government after he's been teleported smack dab in the middle of an alien plot to take over the world. It's never made clear why Duke, a man's man, a loner, a rebel...why this guy's taking orders from an Army general. It's just a little goofy to see this guy go solo for so many years, only to bow down to ~the man~ in his first Game Boy Advance adventure.  But goofy plot aside, it's the gameplay that matters...and Duke Nukem Advance is top-notch. Like all of the previous first-person shooters on the Game Boy Advance, Duke Nukem Advance features a raycasting engine that provides the 3D-style gameplay. The engine that Torus Games created for this title is definitely top of the line: the framerate is smooth and quick, with detailed floor and ceiling textures, shootable walls and objects, and a perfectly acceptable graphic resolution on the GBA screen. What's more, the game even has a look up/look down feature in its controls...it may be the same unnecessary, graphical cheat that 3D Realms pulled off in the PC game, but it's the first game to offer this control on the GBA.  The gameplay is very cut-and-dry, which is what makes this game so much of a rush. Sure, it has a mission structure, but honestly all Duke Nukem Advance boils down to is running around blasting bad guys into a mass of bloody goo. You'll have to track down switches and key cards to unlock portions of the level, and every so often you'll have to do a few ~platform-esque~ challenges like avoid getting stomped by pounding machinery, or leaping over bridge gaps in lava pools...but it's mostly all about getting the adrenaline rushing with firepower. Lots of firepower. Many of the guns from the PC game are here: the pistol, the shotgun, the missile launcher, the pipe bombs...even the shrink ray. Plenty of manly toys to play with here.   And even with the limited control layout of the Game Boy Advance, the developers managed to map the important moves to all the buttons without making it feel ~cluttered.~ Side-stepping is performed by the shoulder buttons, shoot and fire is controlled by the A and B buttons, and switching weapons can be done automatically (not recommended) or pulled off by holding the Select and cycling through the available guns with the shoulder buttons. Other than the weapon select controls, there's really no fumbling around with the buttons in Duke Nukem Advance.  If you're one of the lucky ones with access to buddies who have a GBA system, it'll be easy to convince them to pick up a copy of the game for a little multiplayer mayhem...once they see how well the single-player missions run, of course. Because, even though the 19 missions will last you a good few gameplay sessions, it's good to shake up the action with a little human interaction.  But if you're looking for a direct conversion of the PC game, you're going to notice a few things amiss in the translation. First of all, the game's tailored for the younger-skewing Game Boy Advance audience. The ~Teen~ rating lets through the violent nature of the Dukester, but when it comes to swearing, strippers or the occasional bathroom break, you're not going to get that here. Due to cartridge restrictions, one-liners are limited to only a handful of vocal quips...many of the familiar Duke Nukem lines will end up being read during the cutscenes than heard during the action. The graphic engine is also not quite up to what the PC version can do...while the environment can change slightly from your guns, you can't blow chunks out of the walls with your launcher, nor can you riddle the surfaces with bullets or footprints. Hey, it's the GBA...some sacrifices had to be made. But with the advancing skills of the Game Boy Advance programmers, we may see these elements show up in future FPS installments. First-person shooters on the Game Boy Advance will never get as advanced as what the console systems have been getting for years...but with skilled programmers and coding trickery, the GBA's FPS genre can certainly hold its own. There are almost a half-dozen of these games on the handheld as of this writing, and the latest, Duke Nukem Advance, is definitely the best. Oh, it's a given that the game will be one-upped by another FPS on the system as time goes on, but as of right now, you can't find a better handheld shooter than Duke Nukem's first GBA adventure.", "date": "Aug 14, 2002"}
