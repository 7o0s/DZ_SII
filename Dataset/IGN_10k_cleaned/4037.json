We had a chance to see Crimson Skies early on in its development and it was shaping up as an extremely arcadey, dumbed-down version of the cult-favorite PC game of the same name. But after a major overhaul that caused the game to miss its original Christmas 2002 arrival, Crimson Skies occupies the same space that MechAssault held this time last year as one of the most addictive multiplayer games on Xbox Live but with improved visuals and a more rewarding single player experience.  Gameplay  Crimson Skies' single player game tells the story of Nathan Zachary, a daring air-pirate of the alternate 1930's of the Crimson Skies universe where air travel is the only way to get around. You're given a story with damsels in distress, gruff but kind-hearted air jockeys and cold calculating super villains with way too much time, dialogue and money on their hands. The game's setting doesn't do much other than allow for some really cool aircraft designs and flamboyant characters like idealistic white-haired scientists. However, the different aircraft in CS are definitely cool and unique looking even if they do ignore the most basic principles of aeronautics. It could've been bi-planes, mystic warriors mounted on flying dragons or nimble deep space assault fighters because Crimson Skies is all about flying and shooting.  The solo campaigns offer a variety of racing, escorting and assault missions that are accessed by interacting with various locations around the living environment. You will have to fly to a particular part of a map, hit the X button and listen for instructions (usually with no cutscene) to embark on your next mission. The same air traffic and dangers that await you when you're simply flying around looking for something to do will be there during your mission, just like a certain game that begins with a ~GT~ and ends with an ~A.~ Likewise, if you start shooting up pedestrian vehicles when you're bored, a flight of militia craft will scramble to take you out and teach you a lesson. Thankfully you don't have to worry about extra lives or continues in CSkies. They just want you to finish the game and the developers know it'll take awhile.     You'll also be interacting with the environment --again using the X button-- when you want to repair or switch aircraft or when you want to man a gun turret either on the ground or on a zeppelin. Flying near, hitting the button will launch a super quick cutscene that shows your main character making the switch before instantly putting you back into the action. If you're switching planes, you'll see Nathan land his plane, hop out, run to the other craft and jump in that one and take off in one seamless transition scene. You can even double back and switch again, just remember you're not getting a free repair out of the deal. Your hoopty plane you dropped off will still be a POS if you don't specifically stop at a repair joint to get it fixed. The repair stations come with their own cutscene that shows you landing, going in a garage and taking off again. Same thing when you hop in a turret except when you switch from turret to turret --like on a zeppelin or heavily fortified base-- it's instant. The icons for all of these ~switchable~ areas are easy to spot on your radar and your view screen.   The living environment and ability to switch in an out of planes at will are nice enhancements to the all-out dogfighting that is the focus of Crimson Skies. The controls are very basic, and unlike other first party games, don't require prior knowledge of the Halo control system. The only tricky moves will be the use of the right analog stick to initiate rolls and the use of both analog sticks to pull off special moves like snap turns and Immelmans.      The challenges in Crimson Skies come in the form of increasingly aggressive AI and the slow ramp up in new, more powerful aircraft that you'll have at your disposal. The default Devastator is your best plane throughout most of the first half of the game. Eventually your expertise will allow to use some of the more specialized craft in the game like the speedy Desert Fox or ass-kickingly slow Brigand. One of the main drawbacks of CS is the very general way the 10 or so planes are introduced or described both in the game and in the game menus. You're given the craft's speed, armor and weapon rating but there's no way to know what specific weapons a plane carries. Machine guns, homing rockets, lightning guns and even an air-to-air shotgun are among the armaments available for use in CS, but it'll be up to you to catalog which ride has which weapons. MechAssault at least told us which guns a mech carried even if there was some variation on the number or effectiveness of those weapons.   Also, there doesn't seem to be much of a focus, at least in the solo game, on choosing the best tool for the job. You can stick with the middle of the road planes --the Devastator might be CS's answer to the Mad Cat-- pretty much the whole time. There are times where you're forced to steal a new specialized plane or take the gyrocopter for a ride as a matter of completing a mission and advance the story, but whenever you get the chance to get back to the more balanced craft you can and should. The upgrade system has you turning in tokens --found by flying into tight spaces you shouldn't-- and money --earned from winning races and completing missions-- to upgrade the overall ability of a plane of your choosing. Some planes cost more than other to upgrade since you're boosting speed, armor and weapon power all at once. You'll notice the difference, but we found this system a little dry and unimaginative, especially since the PC original allowed from some creativity and flexibility on the part of the player.  Online dogfighting in Crimson Skies will make you forget your favorite multiplayer fast-action shooter, at least temporarily. The freedom to fly --which is what this is all about right-- in any direction and unleash tons of firepower on human opponents will want to make you hug your Xbox Live subscription. The game types, even though they have fancy names, are pretty much standard fare with deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, keep away, team keep away and something called Wild Chicken. Outside of the deathmatch type games, where it's kill or be killed, all of the other multiplayer games in Crimson Skies will end up looking like some new-fangled, online game of the schoolyard fave: Kill the Carrier. If it's CTF or Team Keep Away, you'll have friends helping you out against enemies. If it's regular Keep Away, you're on your own. If it's the hilarious Wild Chicken --it latches on your wing spewing feathers-- you take all the pressure of Keep Away and add some randomness since you can score either by carrying the chicken to the goal for a touchdown or sit back and just kill chicken carriers, earning one point at a time.     The performance when you get up to 16 players playing online can get as bad as you'd expect --where is that regional optimization we were promised-- for such a graphics heavy, fast-paced game. However we definitely appreciate having the capacity for that many players, because 15 other aircraft in your game world is a recipe for fun if you luck out and get some good connection speeds for everybody. System Link can obviously provide a similar, more solid multiplayer experience but the online component of Crimson Skies will be the gift that keeps on giving over the holiday season. Downloadable content should eventually include new aircraft and possibly even new gametypes and levels, similar to what was done in MA.     Graphics  Crimson Skies is a spectacular looking game. It begins with beautifully rendered environments and carries all the way down to the rivets in the panels on the aircraft. One drawback is the omission of an in-cockpit perspective, but the silver lining here is that the framerate stays consistent even with the full-time third person view. Where many flight combat games would have all-too confining invisible walls and ceilings everywhere cramping the action, Crimson Skies does a surprisingly good job of keeping things wide open and free. In fact you can ascend so high on the opening Sea Haven level you can almost get an unobstructed view of Uranus.   The camera system stays behind the aircraft but not locked on a rigid invisible broomstick like we've seen in other games. Using the D-pad you can quickly get reverse, left and right views of your plane so you can see what's going on around you or just enjoy the splendid views. You can't see too well above and below your plane but the radar or bullets shredding your ride can help in that area.  The bump-mapped planes and impressive particle system during gameplay makes the transition to the well produced cutscenes that much smoother. This is especially important when you're talking about the swapping sequences when Nathan hops in and out of planes and turrets. As a flight combat title, it would've been easy for us to feel disconnected from the characters since we're riding in planes most of the time. The transition scenes and the gameplay look enough like one another and flow from one to the next so seamlessly that you end up feeling more connected to the story.   Lighting and shadows with the top notch bump-mapping help make Crimson Skies one of the most believable alternate realities on the Xbox. From desert to stormy tropical islands to the big metropolises, everything is crisp, clean and a joy to behold. The visuals are all in the same vein as what we saw in MechAssault last year, but upgraded in every way and enhanced by the fact that we're flying and not walking around in big tin cans.    Sound  The swashbuckling music is adventurous enough and we have no problem with the voice-acting. It can be tough to make out some of the audio cues you get over your plane's radio system, but the person on the other end will usually remind you or give you another cue within a few minutes if you miss it the first time.  All of the sound effects, explosions, gunfire and propeller sound effects are well done and serve their purposes. The different weapons sounds are unique as well. The Bulldog's shotgun shots thankfully sound like you'd expect and not like some other single shot weapon. For aircraft that carry machine guns you get unique sounds for quadruple cannons versus triple cannons. The heavily armed Brigand's automatic tailgun sounds slightly different than that ship's main guns, even though they're basically the same weapon.   The music is ripped directly from those adventurous Saturday morning serials very few of us grew up with, and really does wonders for the game's atmosphere. It's not quite interactive where you trigger changes in the music, but the strings-heavy music ratchets up a notch or two when things are pretty hectic. And things are usually hectic. Crimson Skies High Road to Revenge is a lot of game for the price thanks to the 12 plus hours of single player and huge potential for online fun. When compared to Midtown Madness 3 and MechAssault, there seems to be extra motivation to complete CS's single player game beyond just getting the best vehicle. The story is compelling and mission types varied enough to keep me playing way past bedtime. The multiplayer game as we got to experience it prior to release was enjoyable but a little sterile compared to what we know it's going to be when the public has at it. And as we saw with MM3 and MA, really that's when things get exciting. Strangers talking trash in the skyways with rubber chickens fluttering from their wings should be enough to move Crimson Skies up on your list of must have Xbox Live games. With no online component for Secret Weapons Over Normandy, Battlestar Galactica or any other flight-shooter, you're getting the best such experience on Xbox this pre-holiday season.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
