Chances are, the game will be a rush-job on a project that nobody cares about since the license is dead, or will be a hopelessly adrift production with no reason for being, or -- most likely of all -- will carry the same quality and limited appeal as the terrible axed show.FeaturesPlay as Rip, Chunk, Slab or Craig ... er, CragBased on the Spumco animated seriesMultiplayer action for up to 4 playersOnly for Game Boy AdvanceTHQ didn't heed that concept -- probably because the game was hurriedly finished months before the show rose or fell -- and went ahead with their GBA version of the latest Spumco cartoon series, Ripping Friends. That was mistake #2. Mistake #1 was hiring Software Creations to do the design -- a team that, while capable, is notoriously known for developing frustrating games for already-frustrated kids. Even after a promising quick look at E3 and even though the concept is solid (how can punching stuff with really big guys not be fun?), this wasn?t one that I was looking forward to.It's not worse than I was afraid that it'd be, but this game is still more pain than even the Ripping Friends could endure. Just the first stage alone -- with a boss that gives hardly any response when you land an attack on him and a stage set-up that's just a confusing mess (the tip at the beginning says 'Use the gun turrets,' but the cannons are absolutely useless compared to just normal punches and jump-kicks) -- was enough to make me grind my teeth out. It'snot necessarily a hard game -- it's just an aggravating one that's no fun to play and takes patience to play instead of just letting players pummel quickly through the pain.Since it's based on a show about big guys getting mad and punching stuff, you'd think the punching would be really ripping in the game. But the combat system is maddening. Enemies take one or two hits before they fall down, and get back up many times in the middle of battle, so it's a slugfest that takes forever on the simplest fights. Enemies come back up with invincibility, so you'llalways have to stick and move in every minuscule battle. There are combos to help put the damage on, but a combo is kind of stupid when there' only two punches in the game (it's not a timing thing, or a button mashing thing -- you just have one regular punch and then a different punch when you hold down the R trigger ... and even if that makes sense to you, let it go, since alternating punches with R and no R as would make sense is NOT how you do combos.) Punches also take forever to wind up, so you'll have to time your singular attacks well. Which means you'll have to pay attention to your slow attacks while you're hating this game. Punching snakes and unidentifiable weasel-like things is not usually my idea of a good time, but this game...I could take the repetition and haphazard control, sort of, if the game at least lived up to its ~Ripping~ name, but the only extreme pain in the game is what you'll have to suffer. The Ripping powers and manly strength 'overload' modes are just stupid -- they mostly leave you open to hits while you're freaking out. There aren't tests of pain minigames, which would at least have been true to the show. The guns are stupidly powerful in the game, but also make you walk slow -- you can fine one and win the level easily, but you'll have to have the patience to keep it with you. Except for the way the screen shakes when you jump off a building, there's nothing ripping or manly about the game. Meanwhile, you'll have to trudge through a slow-paced game, wandering forwards and backwards through the open stages with a navigational arrow that often doesn't tell you where to go, and beating up baddies two at a time before two more baddies pop out of nowhere to stop you from moving on and facing two more baddies. And since the 4-way fighting control isn't always spot-on enough to make your hits land and since the bosses sometimes give cheap hits when they're off the screen, take joy in knowing that you may have to do it all over again a few times no matter how careful you are. What's really the killer is that it's not at all a funny game. With characters called the Indigestible Wad, Thursday Man and the Evil Pooperman (who was spawned from one of the Ripping Friends' shorts,) there should be a few jokes to go here. But there's nothing funny in the game. Usually, Software Creations at least paints a pretty picture with their kiddie games, but this one is ugly in all the wrong ways. The same one or two enemies repeat throughout the stages, and there's not the kind of grossness or extreme characters and environments that you'd expect. And the backgrounds are also not only bland, but also a hindrance on the gameplay -- the monochromatic backdrops sometimes bleed into each other, especially in cases where bad contrast makes it tough to play without good lighting. (Purple and dark blue to set a scene? Thanks.) There are also instances where the multilayered backgrounds stand on top of each other while you're fighting, so there will be instance where a big beam in the foreground is blocking your view of the fight. At least the jazzy music and recognizable Spumco sounds are there to remind us of who's brain-power was supposed to inspire this mess.Out of all of this, however, there is one thing that should be commended on this project. THQ and Creations made what's a rare extra move for a kids' game like Ripping Friends and put in a four-player multiplayer mode. It doesn't add a ton to the game, since playing a bad game with three other people isn't much more fun, but it does make a difference in bringing out the chaos that should be there in single player mode. There's a Deathmatch mode where everybody can beat on each other and toss buds around the screen as well as a full multiplayer mission mode. The feature is only multicart (kind of lame -- the deathmatch could have been single-cart and been worth a try) and there's still the danged password to also bring down the value (at least it's not 20 characters long like some kids' games), but if there's one thing that was a pleasant surprise in this game, the multiplayer capability is it.Like the old Ren & Stimpy games, this is a game that makes the mistake of assuming that the characters are cool. The Ripping Friends arent cool. Ren and Stimpy werent cool. Its the stuff that they do thats cool. The zany, surrealistic, absolutely senseless moments that madman John Kricfalusi thunked up and animated with contorted detail was what put these shows on the air (actually, Ren was kind of cool now that I think about it.) And without nearly enough sight gags or over-the-top style to actually put that humor in the game, its kind of pointless. And thats not even considering the control and gameplay, which takes the game from pointless to pointedly hatable.", "date": "Oct 31, 2002"}
