There's nothing quite as satisfying as blowing the crap out of wave upon wave of faceless hordes, and Loaded certainly allows for that.   Basically, you wander through fifteen levels of rooms, corridors, and trenches, blowing the living beejeezus out of anything that gets in your way. Along the way you collect the obligitory colored cards to pass through doors to blow away yet more guys. And while this may seem a might pointless, believe you me it's one hell of a gory ride.  The top-down perspective gives you an excellent view of the bloody action, and there's a lot of it. Blood is liberally splattered everywhere, accompanied by the screams of the dying. The graphics are smooth and sharp, and the character design is hilarious. And while there are 15 waves, the gameplay doesn't really vary from the shooter norm. But who cares, eh? It's a blast.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
