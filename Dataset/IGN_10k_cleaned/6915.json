{"name": "X-Men 3", "name_review": "X-Men 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/25/x-men-3", "text": "This Friday, the X-Men invade your local Cineplex for the allegedly last time in ~The Last Stand.~ Prior to the movie release, though, game makers have flooded shelves with video games based on Wolverine & Friends' exploits to whet appetites for some mutant carnage. Reviews of the console editions of X-Men from Activision have been fairly harsh, and this mobile game isn't deserving of much better treatment.   Hands-On (formerly MFORMA) was on something of a winning streak with the Marvel license. Its last two comic book-inspired releases -- Ultimate Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk: Rampage -- were solid mobile games, offering smart design and interaction with their respective heroes' super-powers. None of those charms come through with X-Men 3, which suffers from paint-by-numbers (or design-by-committee) mechanics that minimize the impact of the mutants.   I have worked hard to remain blissfully ignorant of the movie plot -- and X-Men 3 does nothing to ruin any surprises. The plot serves to link the second and third movies, leading up to what appears to be a climactic showdown with the Brotherhood. Sadly, nothing in this mobile game is remotely climactic, as you slog through several uninteresting levels, fighting off garbled-looking enemies and limping through basic action-puzzles like moving crates to reach high ledges.   Yep, crate puzzles. You're in command of a team of mutants with incredible powers like teleportation, diamond-sharp claws, and ice beams, but you still have to deal with mundane tasks that are boring in even the most insipid Tomb Raider sequel. And then there's the key-collecting. And the fetching. Ugh, what a disappointment. So little emphasis is placed on the mutant abilities, and meager offerings there are, it's only in service to a basic puzzle, such as using one of Iceman's frosty beams to extinguish flames that disarm traps. Yes, I recognize that such snooze-inducing puzzles like this exist in tons of other games -- but that doesn't make it any less boring.   As you walk through isometric mazes with the mutants, you pick up bonuses that help you expand life bars and mutant power meters, which allow you to use special moves. When the situation requires it, the mutants receive additional powered-up moves, such as Wolverine's hard attacks or Nightcrawler's teleportation attacks, which allow the blue-skinned hero to warp on to an enemy and beat him senseless. These new moves are certainly good to see, and they almost give you something to work toward. Only ~almost,~ because many of the combat situations in which you would use them are pretty difficult to control with a satisfying degree of accuracy. The isometric controls, mapped to the number pad, require you to put your fat thumbs all over the phone, and it's tough to get in right close to strike without getting hit or shot first. Wolverine's first battle with Lady Deathstrike is a good indication of the woe you will endure through the rest of the game.   I played the game on an LG VX8000, which has a nice-sized screen with good resolution. X-Men 3, however, looked pretty mediocre. The mutants are small and a little muddied up. They possess little animation. Watching Nightcrawler walk is almost funny, with his minor handful of frames. The levels are fairly small, with competent lay-outs, but the color palette doesn't pop. The game just isn't fun to look at, like Spider-Man or Hulk.  X-Men 3 is a disappointment on all counts. The game looks borderline unappealing, the control is messy, and the mechanics are just dull. It's not a ~broken game,~ but X-Men 3 is not much fun at all. Color me surprised, because Hands-On's last two superhero games were really enjoyable. My recommendation is to download those, instead, as they are lively, colorful, and feature good mobile design.", "date": "May 25, 2006"}
