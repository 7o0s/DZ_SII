Kemco's had moderate success in the field of WB-licensed game production, as one of the Japanese studio's biggest claim to fame is the simplistic-yet-satisfying Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle series. The team continues its old-school game design trend for this title featuring the canary with that always-annoying speech impediment -- Tweety's High Flying Adventure doesn't bring anything new to the table, but its lengthy quest and solid design is plenty to keep the gamer going for hours. Features: 10 worlds Tutorial mode Battery save Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color  The game's not going to win any awards for its plot devices  and I honestly hope that Tweety's explanation for traveling around the world is better worded in the cartoon, because the abridged cutscenes just don't tell the tale with any detail. But the funny thing is, the game's got tons of still screens to tell the story (including the overused Lola Bunny newscaster joke supplied after every level). Let's just say that Tweety's off to save a closing orphanage by going global. How would this help the kiddies? Who the heck knows? Tweety's High Flying Adventure is as traditional a side-scrolling platform as you can get  except for the lack of head-bopping attacks. The task is to travel to ten different locations and grab pawprints from 80 cats in each of these famous foreign cities. To obtain the prints, it's all a matter of finding the puttytats and knock 'em out with the obtained power-ups scarfed throughout the levels  and there are a lot of them: plunger guns, spatulas and balls make up the throwing items, and trinkets like oil slicks and banana peels can be dropped in the cats' paths to slip 'em up. While the cats are your prime target, there are other enemies to deal with  living plants, worms, butterflies, mummies, bugs, bees...they're just out to make your life a little more difficult. You can take out these guys with your back-up of weaponry, but it's a waste to do so since they don't score you the needed pawprints.  To get through the many levels, Tweety can run, jump, and  with a practiced thumb  fly via tapping the jump button as rapidly as possible (think Joust). The controls are extremely simplistic, and makes the task of getting through the level as mindless as possible  it is for kids, after all.  The biggest problems come from the fact that, once you've done away with a cat and grabbed his pawprints, he doesn't go away like the other enemies. This makes the challenge a lot more difficult, sure, but there should have been a small indicator to tell the player that the cat in question doesn't have a pawprint anymore...especially when this feline wanders off-screen and mingles with the rest of the unseen enemies. This problem is easily remedied by never moving to the next level until you've knocked over two puttytats  the level design is very formulaic and predictable once you know what to look for.  The game doesn't change its design throughout the journey  it only varies in background graphics and enemies. But the quest is quite large, and the company plopped in a battery to save your progress wherever you may be. That Kemco  what a nice gesture. Passwords are such a drag...  An unnecessary but welcome feature is its two-player mode  one player plays as Tweety, the other as a pink bird (possibly the Tiny Toons Sweetie-Pie, but it's never made clear in the game's manual or option menu).The challenge is to grab three pawprints before the other player does  the game offers eight different locations for this challenge. It's a fun little minigame  not worth the price of admission alone, but a cool little addition nonetheless.  Kemco's never been one to blow away gamers with fabulous Game Boy Color titles, but you can count on them producing something solid  Catwoman excluded, of course. Tweety's High Flying Adventure is a decent, formulaic platformer that's not terribly difficult but will last gamers a long time.", "date": "Jan 13, 2001"}
