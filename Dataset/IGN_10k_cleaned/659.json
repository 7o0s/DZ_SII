See, his kind is being captured by Glukkons for their tears, in order to make their delicious, refreshing Soulstorm Brew. In Oddword Adventures 2,  Abe's gotta  possess enemies, talk to his friends, and pass gas to solve puzzles that will enable him to destroy the prison mines and save his fellow buddies. Oddword Adventures 2 marks Abe's second adventure on the Game Boy  and his first adventure in portable color. It might not be as pretty as the PlayStation original, but Abe's adventures are unique and fun enough to spend time running through. Features: Puzzle Adventure 24 levels Two difficulty levels For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  There's no way around this fact  the Oddworld series is, at its core, a Prince of Persia style adventure. The game takes place strictly in a 2D, non-scrolling platform-style perspective, where you take control of good ol' Abe. Oddworld Adventures 2 is a trial-and-error puzzle game  the only way you're going to know what to do is to try out different things and die along the way. Thankfully, Abe has infinite lives, so when he bites the big one (which will be manymanymany times throughout the course of a level), he winds up unharmed at the beginning of the level he failed, with everything back to the way they were. And despite dying so many times in a game, the challenge never seems to grow old or annoying.   Abe can do many things -- specifically he can run, creep, jump, and climb ledges like any good adventurer can. These abilities are required to get through the underground caverns in order to locate your good pals, as well as to find the tokens you'll need to destroy to open up the exits in each level.  When you meet up with these guys, you can put more of your capabilities to use. See, Abe can also talk to them, using limited vocabulary. Say ~hello~ to a fellow being and you've got his attention. Using the command ~Follow me~ will get your new-found friend to stay at your heels, where commanding him to ~Wait~ will make him stay put. Put him to work by telling him to, what else, ~Work~. Each of these commands are necessary to advance through the deep levels, since you'll not only need to rescue them, you'll need their help to accomplish necessary tasks. It also shows off the Game Boy's speech capabilities, since you'll hear the cute voices of Abe and his friends through the speaker.  Abe also has a few extra abilities. If there's an enemy in the general vicinity, you can possess that being and take control of it to accomplish tasks in parts of the levels that Abe can't normally access. These creatures will come in handy to trigger switches, destroy enemies, and sneak past creatures that seem to have a taste for Abe. He can also drink Soulstorm Brew to produce a nasty fart that can take out bad guys (apparently, visual flatulence has no effect on the ESRB ~E~ rating).  The graphics suffer heavily on the translation from the vibrant, rendered look of the PlayStation to the portable, pixelated rendition on the Game Boy Color  backgrounds are flat and lifeless, and lack any dimension. The lack of any perspective hurts some of the game, especially when you have to maneuver Abe when he's off into the distance, or trying to figure out what's a background and what's a solid wall. You'll get used to the bland imagery since the first few levels train your eyes to know what to look for in terms of cliff walls versus background detail  makes you wonder what the game would have looked like if it didn't have to be black-and-white compatible. And don't get me started on Abe's animations in this Game Boy game  he looks like a pixelated, jittery praying mantis.  I've always been a huge fan of the action-platform-puzzle type games  Prince of Persia, Out of this World, Flashback, Blackthorn...all great games. Oddworld is an extension of this style, and while it's not nearly as elaborate as it is on the PlayStation, the Game Boy Color rendition is still a decent design. I wish the game looked a lot better than it does  it would've made seeing the illusion of depth a lot easier. The graphics may suck, but the game itself is still good stuff.", "date": "Jan 27, 2000"}
