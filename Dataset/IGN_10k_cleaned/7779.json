You'll know it right off the bat, too, thanks to the pleasant graphics and hefty price tag. The actual game, now that's a different story. The puzzle solving adventure doesn't provide quite enough fun to live up to the powerful engine that was used to create it.    In Robolitz, the main character who goes by Blitz is tasked with fending off an invasion on his ship by solving a series of puzzles to fix broken systems. There are six areas of the ship that need attention, and each one has three stages in it with specific themes. The final stage in each area gives you a boss battle of sorts where you're required to do things similar to the previous puzzles to win. Along the way, you'll find upgradium scattered throughout each level that you can collect and then trade in for new tools, weapons and armor that will make things easier.    RoboBlitz has several takes on puzzles we've seen numerous times in the past, such as rotating mirrors to reflect lasers to the proper target or figuring out how to connect a series of conveyor belts so that a package can safely be transported. The more fun puzzles in the game make use of, or allow the use of, the nifty little things you can do in a world where everything is controlled by the physics engine. We won't spoil any of the puzzle solutions, but know that you will find several points in the game that make you remember the powerful engine the game was built with.   The puzzles themselves are decent and may end up taking you a fair amount of time to solve if you have the hints turned off. By a fair amount of time, we're talking about a couple of days. Once you know exactly what you're supposed to do, each level won't take more than 15 minutes or so to breeze through. With just under 20 stages, there isn't a whole lot of actual gameplay here. At 1200 Microsoft Points ($15 USD), you're looking at one of the more expensive Xbox Live Arcade games out there that doesn't offer a lot for the money. Towards the end of the game, you're given a grappling hook of sorts that opens up new ways to attack previous puzzles, which does add a bit of replayability.   Blitz rides atop his only ball. The graphics in RoboBlitz are impressive, especially when you remember that the entire game was crammed into less than 50 MB of disc space. There are a few problem areas, shimmering textures in particular, but the game on the whole is quite nice looking compared to the rest of the Live Arcade lineup. If all of the new Live Arcade games looked this good, we wouldn't complain at all. The sound is mostly ambient music that works well as background filler. The sound effects are fairly limited. Most of the sounds that come out of your speakers will be little bleeps or the clang of metal hitting metal as you bump your way through the halls.   The same things that make RoboBlitz exceptional end up being the cause of some of its problems. Since all of the motions are created using the robust physics engine, RoboBlitz ends up creating some fluid movement. Jumping, swinging, and watching objects blow around in the fan created wind all look cool and you can have a fair amount of fun just toying around with the engine. Unfortunately, not everything is smooth sailing. Picking up a barrel or crate can be frustrating as Blitz will often bump the object and send it tumbling out of his reach. If you do pick something up, Blitz doesn't always get a good grasp on it and you'll find the object dragging on the ground hampering your movement. It's annoying when you know exactly how to solve a puzzle, but it takes four or five tries thanks to the little frustrations the physics engine creates. Blitz also has a tendency to get caught on corners and ledges even if he isn't carrying anything, though this usually is only a minor inconvenience.   The main problem with RoboBlitz, even without the little hitches, is that the game isn't very exciting. The puzzles aren't terribly intricate or deep and the little enemies that are tossed at you feel a bit forced. Bouncing around in the stages and swinging around can be fun for a short while as you explore what you can do, but everything else is pretty bland. RoboBlitz works as a little diversion between playing other games, but not any better than some of the cheaper alternatives on the Live Arcade.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
