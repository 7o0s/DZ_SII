Caesar was intrigued, but had a different idea, ~Crushing the weak and weary is fun and all, but I prefer a challenge. Those bear skin wearing, ugly language speaking Gauls are supposed to be tough... It's time they were taught the glories of Rome through the slaughter of their people and the theft their lands. Prepare the troops, there's conquering to be done!~ While that may not be exactly what happened, Rome certainly did sweep its grand eyes across the forests of the Gallic countries and decide that the Republic would benefit from enveloping the land under its protective wings. And so began one of the biggest military campaigns in history. Conquering all of Europe without the aid of mass transportation and explosives is not an easy task, especially when you're in the middle of conflict along every other one of your borders as well. You'll soon discover this with Pyro's newest entry into the gaming world called Praetorians. It's a little bit of history with a lot a bit of strategy and a good helping of barbarian stomping fun.   Pyro as a studio is probably most famous for their work on the Commandos series of games. So I guess it wasn't that big a surprise that this crew stayed with their real-time strategy mold minus the resource management. Praetorians is certainly closer to a traditional RTS than Commandos, but remains quick paced with a focus on strategy rather than the nitpicky base building and resourcing. And it does rather well for it. The only resources you have to worry about are villages that can be captured. Each has a population you can use to create new units. Once you're out of population, you can't create more. The pop will slowly increase over time, but choosing your troops wisely is a good idea. Consequently, almost your entire focus is on commanding troops and protecting these vital plots of land. You'll certainly need to use all of your attention in this area, because in typical Pyro style, this game is not for the timid. Not quite as difficult as Commandos 2, but still a challenge. The final version isn't as hard as some of the earlier builds that I've played, but even on normal, I found myself losing and having to restart some of the missions, which really isn't typical for me in RTSs.   Praetorians, named after the elite Roman guard, focuses on a period of time when Rome was constantly at war. It was easy for them. They were rich and had an amazingly disciplined army with extremely capable commanders and good weapons and armor. During this period of Roman expansion, the legions were second to none, and were used with impunity in battles across Northern Europe and Britannia, the Near East, and North Africa. Of course, being so spread out was part of the reason the great Roman Empire finally fell, but it was a fancy ride while it lasted.     Because the game is based more on history than fiction, there is no continuous story to keep you captivated. You'll move from place to place through history, bringing victories to Rome where ever you step. Cutscenes will show basic conflict while in game cutscenes will really only serve to further progress the scenario. It's fine that there aren't more of them though because the voice acting, with the exception of the guy doing the scenario intros whose voice I really liked, is pathetic. To keep things a little more simple and focused, you'll only have the opportunity to play as the Romans through the single player campaign. At certain moments, you'll have allied forces under your command from the other two factions in the game as well, but you'll never be able to create them. This never bothered me in truth. You can always get your kicks in skirmish and multiplayer as the Egyptian or Gaul forces if you like.    The forces on each side are fairly similar in some respects, but each has its strong suit and are balanced pretty well. Each side has basic infantry that are used to create siege weapons, defense towers, and capture cities. The Romans seem to be the strongest, where the Egyptians', which are actually slaves, take very little time to create but are very weak. From there, you'll get basic infantry, cavalry, and archer cavalry to round out the normal troops in each of the arsenals. Finally, each side has specialty units such as the Egyptian chariots, Roman gladiators, and Gallic German cavalry units. These actually manage to encourage you to seek out conflict as they take honor points to recruit. Honor points are only gained through combat. Therefore you'll have to fight for the right to use these in battle.   Troops you command come in groups. These can be anywhere from 12 to 30 depending on the type. Many of these groups have special formations or abilities that will help you out in combat and will certainly influence your tactical decisions. For instance, the Roman pikemen have a stationary defense formation where they spread across a line, and the front line stick their pikes out in front of them like that great scene in Braveheart. If you can manage to keep these guys at the head of your troops and run enemies into them in that formation, you'll suddenly have a lot of dead attackers at your feet. Also, all of the archers in the game can drop down into a prepared stance that will allow them longer range. The problem with both of these stances is that they have to form and disengage these formations, making them less mobile, which can be a killer if your opponent manages a flanking maneuver with some cavalry.   Praetorians follows a good rock, paper, scissors formula where every unit in the game has weaknesses that just need to be exploited and strengths that can be take advantage of. The same goes for the terrain. Maneuvering your troops around the terrain is a huge part of the game that adds a lot to the experience. Moving infantry into tall grass will cause them to lay down and hide for ambushes (although the grass can be lit on fire so be careful). Placing your ranged infantry inside of forest cover or on ridges will also help them get the drop on unsuspecting enemies.  Though as you might expect, many units won't be able to join them inside the forest. Pikemen and most cavalry, for example, will have to travel around the forests. Likewise, heavy infantry like Legionnaires will not be able to move through shallow water like pikemen and cavalry.   Therefore, keeping your troops together and in order can be a bit tricky at times. It can be particularly annoying when some of your troops will take a shortcut when moving to a path while others will take another longer route to get where they're going. If you aren't paying attention, you could have some trouble on your hands. What I would have liked to see is an option that allows you to adopt a meta-formation for multiple units. So if you're making a slow movement forward, but would like to keep all of your troops in the same formation you set them in, you won't be able to, or at least I couldn't find a way. So you'll end up having to assign groups for each section of your larger army and move them one bit at a time, when really you need them to all move at once so part of the formation doesn't get chewed up waiting for their support when you suddenly run into enemy resistance.     For the most part, using normal groups works well enough, but sometimes, you'll have so many units on the screen that battles can get out of hand when you're fighting on two fronts trying to surround an enemy. This is especially the case when sieging forts, which happens on occasion. Actually getting your units to move when you want them to can be tough. And if you're trying to coordinate a attacks on multiple sides of these large structures, you're going to have a hell of a time doing it successfully. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure how you would improve this. I just wish there was a way to set up some sort of coordinated attacks that could all be triggered at the same time to eliminate the confusion.    Defending fortifications is also difficult, but for different reasons. The levels that call for this just tend to send tons of units at you. And I say this with a smile on my face. It's fun to see the enemy bring rams in to knock down your gate. It's fun to see them try to hoist scaling ladders onto the wall as they're being shot by your archers. And it's damn fun to sally forth from the gate to take out vulnerable units like archers in the field. One thing I wish had been added to defense is the ability to give archer units priority targeting so they try and pick off the ladder carriers and siege engines first. As it is, you have to give them direct orders to do so meaning more micromanagement of troops that can be difficult in a mass fray at your stronghold's gates. Regardless, these levels were among the most hectic but also the most fun. In some cases, you'll have to both defend a fort or city while moving your forces ahead to make an attack on enemy positions.   In fact, most of the missions in the game were pretty interesting, both from an objective standpoint, and a strategic standpoint. You aren't always going to be called upon to thrash the enemy villages. There are a few times when you'll have to run from a fight where you're totally outmanned. Others you'll have to race to save some allies and join forces. Still others you're called upon to make choices about how you finish a scenario. Although in one case I was given the choice to fight a particular enemy, set up to do so, and then found that I actually couldn't make that decision. It's a little confusing when group A says, ~Hey, if you kill group B, then we'll ally with you and tromp over the rest of the map.~ Yet when you get to group B, they say, ~Hey, if you kill group C, we'll ally with you and tromp over the rest of the map,~ and suddenly, you aren't allowed to make the decision who to help. You have to help group B kill group C which will piss off group A so you have to kill the people that originally asked for your help. Confused? Sorry.   AI in general is fairly strong tactically. It certainly tried (and succeeded) in flanking manuevers and feints on several occasions. While it still isn't going to compare to the creativity of a human opponent, I wasn't unhappy with the level of performance. Skirmish on the other hand was really not very difficult. While the tactical AI is mostly good, the strategic management side isn't. The computer seemed to have trouble with capturing new villages to create more units. In fact, after an initial surge, it almost seemed like the AI would stop functioning. I would often find little to no resistance waiting at their bases upon arrival. Who knows though, maybe that's just because I'm that good and wiped out their forces en route.     What did you think of Praetorians? Outside of the actual gameplay, Praetorians is a really nice game to watch. Seeing so many units on the screen at once is just so much fun. All of the units look different enough that you shouldn't have too much difficulty differentiating them, although a couple are pretty similar. Aside from the many units, the landscapes you fight across are really nice to look at. Forests, scrubs, tall grass, water, and weather effects all look nice on top of having the gameplay ramifications. Colors are bright and everything is animated... I don't know, everything just looks good. It isn't the most impressive thing I've ever seen, but I can't say I have any complaints aside from wanting a more animated feel when things are getting built. But that's pretty nitpicky, really. Perhaps the best thing of all is that I never once had any problems with slowdown on either of the machines that I played on. That makes me happy!Certainly, this isn't a game for everyone. The difficulty level might scare some folks away that have yet to experience a good strategy title, but the distraction of building a base and managing resources might help a little bit. Those looking for a fictional story to accompany their game will need to look elsewhere, but it really wouldn't have fit in this game so I'm glad they left it out.The gameplay and tactical strategy in this title is certainly its strong suit. Unit balance is excellent and maneuvering your units around to bamboozle your enemy can be very fun. The single player campaign is a good ride the entire way through (just remember to save from time to time or you might find yourself cussing a little bit) and multiplayer can be a really exciting ride if you find a worthy opponent.So if you're looking for a strategy game worth your while, Praetorians is a very good choice. If Caesar hadn't gone and gotten stabbed by his friends, I'm sure he would have liked this as much as I do.", "date": "Mar 13, 2003"}
