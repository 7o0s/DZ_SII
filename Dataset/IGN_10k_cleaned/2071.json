And with a new football season already upon us, the company has is ready to once again vie for the football crown with the latest in its franchise, Madden NFL 2002.  Gameplay The honest truth is that if EA Sports and Tiburon just took last year's Madden and gave us newer rosters and a few new gameplay modes, most of us sports fanatics would probably buy the game without a second thought, maybe complain some about the lack of upgrades, and still continue to play the game to death as both a single and multiplayer game.   But if you're thinking you're just getting Madden NFL 2001 with a few tweaks here and there, prepare for a big surprise as the developers have made some key improvements in every single facet of the game. For one, even though last year's game was as feature-rich as any other football game ever released on a console (well, the PlayStation version was a bit more), the feature set for Madden 2002 has been beefed up so much that other developers will be hard pressed to even come close to matching it.   In addition to the standard stuff such as exhibition, playoffs, season and franchise, you're also getting all-new play modes. These appear in the form of a fun little two-minute drill that has a unique points system, which rewards you for doing things like passing for a first down and getting out of bounds, or an in-depth training mode where Madden himself will explain each play and let you know how best to run it and when's a good time to do it. Then there's a nice little Situation mode where the user is able to set up any possible gameplay situation possible and relive some classic moments in football history (my only grief here is that there aren't any preset situations, with actual details and story setups of some classic moments).   And while these extras are all completely welcome, we all know that the meat and potatoes of the game is the franchise mode -- Even this has substantial improvements. The franchise, which lasts for up to 30 years (game time), enables up to 31 users (got 30 friends?) and gives users the ability to import a draft class from NCAA Football 2002 after the first year, so instead of the fake players normally generated, you can actually decide whether to pick up real players like Virginia Tech's Lee Suggs or Oregon State's Ken Simonton (if you don't edit the player names either in NCAA or before the draft in Madden, these guys will only be a position and number).   What's more, the franchise mode also takes into consideration the Houston Texans entering the league, enabling you to take over that franchise after the first year and taking part in the expansion draft or even import a created team into the league at that time. And if that's not enough painstaking details for you, Madden 2002 is the only football game that we know of this year that'll actually have the new division alignment that'll take place next year, so that there's an AFC North, South, East, and West and an NFL North, South, East and, West.  Career stats are kept for every player in the NFL during a franchise, including their real-life stats in every year they've played leading up to this upcoming 2001 season. Career NFL records still aren't recorded, but if you know the numbers you can really see if a player takes down the career passing marks of Dan Marino (Brett Favre actually retired in the eighth year of a simulated franchise after passing both Marino's career passing yardage and touchdown totals -- that bastard!).   Users will also find lots of new additions to other facets of the game's feature set including an improved create-a-player mode, plus new things like a create-a-team mode and a more robust fantasy draft option. There are also even more Madden cards and all-new cheerleader cards which really help increase the game's replay value exponentially as you'll find enjoyment in just playing to earn new cards. Outside of the 32-bit Maddens, this is undoubtedly the most feature-packed football game that you're going to find this year.  Best yet, the features aren't the only area where the game has seen some considerable advancement, as every single facet of the gameplay has received a varying degree of upgrades, as well. Take something simple and seemingly insignificant, such as the kicking game, EA Sports has finally changed the age-old kicking meter and added in a new C-shaped meter that works much like the ones used on golf games. At first it seems more of a pain in the ass than anything, after one gets used to it you'll find that it gives you a little more control over the kicks and has added an new degree of difficulty that makes kicking more of a skillful endeavor instead of a rudimentary undertaking that has you just go through the motions time and time again.  Astute players also will find that the passing and rushing portions of the game have progressed a lot, with the passing attack probably seeing the most significant changes. Most notably, the defense backs are no longer complete morons and will actually cover all three receivers on one side in a trips set (they always left one guy wide open in 2001) and do a much better overall job on defending the outs, crossing routes and corners.   And because of this increased defensive back AI, passing the ball effectively on offense requires much more skill and timing. You can no longer just throw outs without the fear of the pass being picked off and because the defensive backs and linebackers close on the pass much quicker (progressively quicker as the difficulty setting is increased), you'll actually have to make sure you hit the receiver at the right time because he might not stay open if you throw it too late.   These factors also make the quarterback that you're using a much larger issue than was the case in previous versions of the game. If you're using a quarterback such as Jay Fielder of my lovable and Marino-less Miami Dolphins, you're going to find that getting the ball past cornerbacks on outs or hitting the receiver precisely on crossing patterns is going to be a lot harder than if you're using someone with a higher accuracy and arm strength rating like a Petyon Manning or Kurt Warner. For this reason, you're forced to actually play the game like the real team has to play -- if you're the Dolphins you're going to want to rely on a running game and low-risk passing attack as Fiedler won't be able to consistently hit deep receivers unless they're wide open.  Even though the improvements aren't quite as drastic as the passing game, there has been some noteworthy advancement in the game's rushing attack. The most significant of the advancements can probably be best seen in the blocking by the offensive lineman. While it was already good last year, the lineman block and move in a much more realistic manner making picking running lanes to run through and blockers to follow the most important thing you must learn to do. The only downside here is that with the reliance on reading the blocks increased, it seems as if the effectiveness of your special moves have been toned down a bit. Unless you're playing against another person, using stiff arms, spin moves or jukes aren't that useful, seeing that it'll result in a fumble more than it will a broken tackle.  Things have been tightened up a bit on the defensive side of the ball thanks to some control tweaks. When you switch to a defensive back, you no longer have to worry about getting stuck in some long pass deflection or interception animation that will take you completely out of the play if you fail at hitting the ball. This makes more a greater sense of control when you're playing defense, whereas in last year's Madden you were often left in situations where whether or not you stopped the other team was reliant more on luck (we're assuming here that you're not a wanker playing on Rookie or Pro).   In addition, general player control in all facets of the game has seen an improvement. The players move a lot faster and respond quicker to your controller actions than they did last year. It's still using the classic Madden momentum based physics system where you still can't cut on a dime without losing speed, but it's a lot less sluggish while still maintaining a sim-like feel.   My one gripe about the AI and gameplay in general is that it still cheats a bit as the difficulty is upped. For example, if you're playing on either the All-Pro or All-Madden setting, a computer halfback with a break tackle rating of around 80 will be able to break most of your team's tackles, whereas if you have a back like Eddie George with a 99 break tackle rating, he'll go down much easier than the computer's lower-rated ball carrier. Similarly, the CPU defenders seem to get speed boosts when closing in on passes and will hold onto balls and make interceptions that your players will drop.   Those problems aside, Madden NFL 2002 is one of the best playing football games around. The only reason not to like it is if you just happen to prefer faster, more arcade-like player control in your football games, as the other upcoming titles will give you this better than Madden. But for what it's worth, this is the best that the franchise has yet to offer in the area of gameplay.  Graphics The first time one glances at Madden NFL 2002, most won't notice the differences between it and the 2001 version, but once you sit down and take a deeper look you'll soon find that there have been some improvements made across the board including some in key areas. Which, depending on how you look at it is a pretty good feat in and of itself as Madden NFL 2001 was and still is an amazing graphical achievement that hasn't yet been equaled by any other developer of a next-generation football game.  The improvement that stands out the most is with the player faces. While they don't quite look like the real guys just yet, except for the coaches who closely resemble the real-life men on the sidelines thanks to an exclusive licensing agreement, they now look like real people as opposed to the ~freaky bug-eyed aliens from outer space who have come to our planet disguised as NFL football players to steal our Earth women~ that were used in last year's game.   Furthermore, the textures have been improved on the player models as the mesh in the jersey is even better than it was last year and the detail on the numbers of the jerseys have also seen some substantial improvements. Likewise, numerous new player animations can be seen on both offense and defense, and the transition animation between movements has been cleaned up tenfold.  The evil one-hand catches aren't overused now that there are countless new and much more realistic two-hand grabs in the game and the impact of tackles is felt much more now since the collision detection has been tightened up a great deal allowing for more contact between the actual player models, making for better wrap-ups on tackles.   There are also a lot of new extra supplemental player animation that can be seen when players are getting ready for covering a kick off or heading back to the huddle after a completed play. The sidelines are also more lively and actual 3D polygonal and fully animated cheerleaders have been added to the players, coaches, cameras, camera men, benches and the ever popular 3D animated chain gain that already fill up the sides of the field. And for those looking for even more details, the player helmets can even be knocked off after particularly crushing blows and all passes are no longer just perfect spirals as there are all-new wobbly passes of varying degrees.  The developers have also at least partially addressed the complaint that the players in Madden 2001 were a bit too pudgy, as there are a greater variety of player sizes and most of the players here in 2002 are a bit more slender, while still being built like real men.   The only real complains that I have about the game's visuals are that the field textures could be improved and it would be nice to see the real players on the sidelines instead of the exact same ones on both sides of the field. Also, just like last year's game, you'll notice the framerate drop at some points during the game before the ball is snapped or after the whistle is blown when extreme close-ups are used or there's trouble with trying to load a voice while switching from the play call screen to the game. The framerate during action gameplay -- from snap to whistle -- is generally a rock solid 60 and this is where it really matters.  Sound The Achilles heel of the Madden series of late has been the game's namesake and his uninspiring and often pointless comments that he and his cohort Pat Summerall will make throughout the game. While Visual Concepts has began to up the ante in terms of advancing commentary in its sports games, EA Sports is still stuck in the past and this is the one area where it has the most room for improvement.   Not only is the announcing and color commentary pretty dry and lifeless but it also gets very repetitive. While credit needs to be given for individually recording hundreds of player specific comments about everyone from Falcon rookie Michael Vick and Jets rookie Santana Moss to veterans like Brett Favre (the guy in There's Something About Mary) and Paul T or Doug Flutie, it loses a lot of its luster due to the fact that you'll hear the same elaborate comments about these players dozens of times throughout each contest if you keep on getting big plays for them.   The game lacks situational commentary, Pat and John don't really seem to know what's really going on in the game as Madden will chime in with a comment like ~the quarterback would be better off taking a sack in that situation because he almost threw an interception~ when the team is trying to make a last minute drive with no timeouts left (where a sack would run precious time off the clock and the quarterback would really have been better served to throw the ball away and definitely NOT take a sack).   All that said, the commentary doesn't really hurt the game that much and is forgivable in some ways because Madden is Madden and a lot of my complaints about his performance here in the game can also be directed to what he does in real life. He's the master of pointing out the obvious and in the game, as in real life, he'll often say things that don't make any sense. Maybe instead of advancing the technology of the play calling the developers should instead fluff up the general goofiness of Madden himself and add in off topic discussions about John eating a turkey leg with a player days before the game or something else of that nature. At least then, it would be something new and more provoking.  Much like the play calling, the other aspects of the game's sound is pretty on par with past efforts in the series. The crowd noises are reactive to what's going on in the game and can be affected by pressing the L3 button to either try to liven up the crowd or get them to shut up if you're at home and on offense. Even here things could be improved a bit by having the crowd react realtime to what's actually going on during each specific play as most of the reactions occur before and after and not during. Again, it's the little things that make the difference and seeing as how EA has captured all of the important little things in every single other facet of the game, it would be nice for them to do it in here, as well.

With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. Some would argue that Madden NFL '93 is still and will always be the best game in the series, the plain and simple truth is that nostalgia aside, it's been topped by more recent efforts by EA Sports, including Madden NFL 2000 on PlayStation, 2001 on PlayStation 2 and now with the most recent addition, Madden NFL 2002.As a single-player game, with the sometimes unforgiving and uber-challenging AI, the deepest Franchise mode the world has yet seen and rock solid playability in both the passing and running attacks and improved control on defense, football fans that like to play their games solo won't see any daylight until sometime in the month of February. And for those of you who prefer to beat up on your friends or family in your sports games instead of the CPU, Madden NFL 2002 is the best in this category that EA Sports has ever produced in this genre, with the only real challenge coming from the recently released NCAA Football 2002. Though, the improved control in the secondary and better overall team balance of the NFL make Madden the better of the two by the slightest of margins.When you take these two factors together -- great single player and great multiplayer game -- what you get is a football fan's wet dream and one of the greatest sports titles that have ever graced a videogame console. And while whether or not it's the best football game ever released is debatable, we're going to go ahead and give it our vote for ~Best. Madden. Ever.~", "date": "Aug 21, 2001"}
