{"name": "Sheep", "name_review": "Sheep", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/09/sheep-3", "text": "It gets to a point in a gamer's life where he's fragged every two-bit chump to sling a BFG, grinded like a villain on every edge, annihilated every alien invader to approach our big blue ball, and Hadoken'ed even your own master teacher. There comes a time where a good butt-bounce no longer gives you satisfaction. You have reached the end of your rope. Civilization offers nothing new for you. It's time to return to nature, to follow Holden Caufield in his unsettled dreams, to leave it all behind for green pastures, watching for the children to play safely while tending to a herd of sheep out on the edge of a cliff.  Or maybe that's all too severe, in which case you may just want to unwind yourself with a sheep herding videogame.  Gameplay Another title from Take 2's wild library of untried, iffy games (some of which ended up as budget titles) that just might have something interesting to offer for the intrepid gaming explorer (but just as often lead to fool's gold as well, depending on your opinions of GTA and Thrasher), Sheep is a pleasant... something. I'm not quite sure just what it is, although it feels like an action puzzle game. It really feels like a sheep herding game, whatever that could be. In gameplay, you're a shepherd shooing a flock of dopey lambs around obstacles and dangers to try to get these ninny creatures into a truck or onto safer ground. See, a sheep herding game.  Mind's Eye Production has a fantastic, eccentric concept here with sheep, and the control over the game is sharp on the mark, too. It's difficult to get the animals on track, as they constantly wander off from the flock toward cars or machinery, but that's part of the challenge, and part of the interwoven strategy. Each level has a number of traps and trouble areas that may be best tackled with a certain herder (there are four total, each with individual strengths in keeping the flock together, in getting sheep to listen and move, in speed, etc.) There are also different types of sheep, so while some more moronic flocks of fleece will just casually move along, the techno sheep will take an interest in the humming of meat grinders, and the tougher sheep may brave traffic to stand down a truck. Usually, they lose.  For all of the conceptual enthusiasm and creativity in the design, a few things break down in the gameplay -- things that might have been fixed over the PC version of Sheep had this not been a quicker PC port release in America rather than a more enthusiastic later PlayStation launch. As baffling as a sheep herding game is, with a storyline that also somehow involves alien invaders, sinister cows, human abduction and shepherding skill transplantation, and ancient sheep from another planet, one would expect a lot more explanation of what the heck is going on than just a simple blurb in the manual. Even the game's CG is no help, since it's non-verbal and very short.  It's not just the plot that's confusing. The game's mechanics are odd and could really use some explaining, but the game's tutorial mode and helping signs offer nothing but basic controls -- they cover the obvious stuff when players are begging to be told what the heck to do and not do. Too few of the traps are explained in gameplay, and the manual only fills in some short details in the game's strategy, so until you watch a sheep get slaughtered by a machine, there's rarely a clue whether it's a helpful sheerer for the sheep's heavy coats or a menacing meat grinder. If there were time for experimentation, at least players could test the stage to figure things out, but the game's difficulty ramps up pretty sharply in and out of the easier modes, and the PlayStation's coders left a few holes that quit out of a game to the very beginning unless the game is saved to a Memory Card (there's also a bug that switches off the analog control every round -- very annoying!) One can learn all of the stages eventually, but the obstacles and missions vary significantly in every world, so by the time everything becomes clear, you've finished the game.     Graphics Sheared from the PC version of Sheep, the PS graphics are too ambitious for the smaller resolution. Sharp details in the animals and characters are softened and lost on a TV screen, and though the stylized fluffy sheep are adorable, they don't have much animation to make them leap alive on the screen. Those large eyes just constantly stare out with ~Duh~ written in their lenses, and outside of the hysterical CG, that's all the hapless herd has to say.  Even so, the visuals have their appeal. Sheep's designers are a daft bunch, and the humor of this game is occasionally flooring. Sheep wander off all over the screen, through hen houses, through farms, over hurdles, into stacks of crates... these are dumb animals, and no effort is lost to help us remember that.  The herder also has bizarre tools to lure the sheep around -- a radio will make the sheep boogie and follow like a pied piper, while attaching springs to their hooves will launch the sheep over chasms. The sheep even transform in certain situations, like when walls stop the progress and the flock must turn into wooly tanks to knock them down. The wacky characters (like the brutish bad-ass sheep that punk each other out) and the odd stages (including a race through space, a trek through a raging disco, and a voyage on the Titanic, complete with a spoof of Leo and Kate's flying lovers scene) are distinct and funny in ways you've never seen before, and though it's tough to see much of it, the jokes are pretty original.  Sound  There are some razzy sound effects in this package, with not much spice and flavor to the sounds. The game bops along to a poppy Euro-techno dance track, but it's nothing you might hum along to. There's not much to treat the ears with, and though the sound is all passable, it's unfortunate that the sound designers didn't do much with the herder's voices (or barks) to give them character. However, the sound team didn't waste all of their time -- I imagine they must have spent all their effort getting those hysterical sheep sounds, which sound like Frank Oz after an hour on a Tilt-A-Whirl. That's good stuff.How could a game about shepherding sheep not be a sleeper title? This isn't easily recommendable stuff, but it's breezy fun and a good challenge different from anything else on the market. Not as clever as Lemmings, but also more intuitive and silly on a basic level, and capped off by a great two-player sheep soccer game where the animals kick around the football as the shepherd chases them around on the field.", "date": "Dec 9, 2000"}
