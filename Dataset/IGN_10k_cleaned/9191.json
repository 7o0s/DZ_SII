{"name": "Portal", "name_review": "Portal Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/09/portal-review", "text": "When students from DigiPen showed off their project Narbacular Drop to a room full of Valve personell, they probably didn't expect that they would not only be hired, but given a budget to expand that idea into something as special as we see with Portal. It's quirky, clever, polished, and presented with a spark of a subtly evil humor that it's hard not to enjoy the quick romp through Aperture Laboratories. The problem is that it is so quick. Players wanting to get their money's worth will want to play through again and definitely check out the challenges. Portal uses a concept that's a bit hard to wrap your head around without actually seeing it in action. The only ~weapon~ you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though the entrance and find yourself at the exit. Walk through the exit and you're back at the entrance. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning sometimes you'll encounter several kinds of brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly, and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.The fun thing about many of these puzzles is that you're not the only thing that can move through these portals. The weighted companion blocks can be used to take out turrets by placing a portal over the turret's head and another under a block. Energy spheres (like those found in Half-Life 2) are used frequently where players have to negotiate their path using portals to activate a switch. There are some really fun uses of the portals here, especially in all of those strange moments where you can see yourself through a portal across the room entering the portal you're stepping through. It's pretty easy to find yourself plopping portals on the ceiling and the floor to go into a constant freefall or place two portals in the corner of the room and chase your own tail. Very bizarre. The main problem with the game is that it's so short. While what's there can certainly be satisfying, we shot through the first 15 levels of the game in about 30 minutes with the last four taking up a bit over an hour. We really wish those first 15 missions had been squished into a couple of quick missions to teach the basics and then had the following 17 missions really up the ante. We know they can do it after playing some of their sadistic advanced versions of six of the levels from the game that (in most cases) are much more difficult than the originals. We would have loved to have seen more of that throughout the game rather than the very long string of basic tutorial type levels.The story is best left unspoiled (mostly because saying anything might give what little there is away) but is built like a short story from a novelist. It's a piece of a bigger puzzle and one that while tiny is certainly entertaining as it goes. There are little clues here and there hinting at what you, an older Asian woman, are doing in Aperture Labs and even more clues on how this all relates to the Half-Life universe.Any and all information you'll receive in the experience comes from the computerized voice that you've likely heard in the trailers and previews. It's largely that voice that gives the game such personality. Some of the lines and jokes it cracks are synthetically deadpan and all the funnier for it. By the time you puzzle your way through all 19 challenges, you'll miss hearing the strange disembodied companion you've had for the last couple of hours.It's not just the one computer voice that's so fun. The sound design, while minimal, is great. Turrets say stuff like ~I don't hate you~ after you drop them on their heads while the same muzak plays any time you wander past a clock radio. There's also something uniquely and strangely satisfying about the thoomp of the portal gun. You're not shooting at anyone or necessarily shooting a gun that requires the powerful sound, but this particular gun sound is pleasant and almost comforting in its quality. While the main game is short, Portal doesn't only finish with one of the best credits songs ever created. After the story is done new challenge levels are unlocked. These extras are six levels that you've already played. The difference is that they have new challenges associated with them. You'll have to see if you can complete the puzzles in a certain amount of time, a minimum number of footsteps, or using only a certain number of portals. These challenges are really interesting because they make you consider puzzles that were somewhat simple to figure out in a different way. You'll learn that the obvious way is definitely not the shortest and you'll bust your brain and may become obsessive trying to figure out the best possible method.Finally, those same six challenges come in ~advanced~ mode which basically means they've been re-worked to be more difficult. And they are much, much more difficult. Not necessarily for being able to figure out the problems (though there are some brain benders) but for the increased need for timing and coordination that wasn't necessarily an issue without the changes to the level. There's a lot more dying and a lot more frustration, but also a sense of satisfaction when they're complete. The idea behind Portal ends up being more brilliant than Portal itself. Regardless, we definitely had a lot of fun with what is there and appreciate the level of polish and thought that went into the presentation. We're definitely interested to see where Half-Life 2: Episode Three goes now that we've seen what the portal gun is capable of and how everything in Half-Life and this new character really fit together. We definitely recommend getting this with the Orange Box package rather than on its own.For 20 dollars, it may be a little pricey for whats there, but we certainly won't tell anybody not to buy Portal. We recommend picking this one up with the full Orange Box because its hard to say no to another peek into this awesome universe and it does fit together with Episode Two.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
