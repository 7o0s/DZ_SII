Just look at the Katamari series: it reveled in the fact that it didn't make any sense, and its craziness made everyone stand up and take notice. It feels like UFO attempts the same sort of approach with Kurupoto: Cool Cool Stars, right down to the lack of trying to come up with a more American name for a title that makes absolutely no sense. But Katamari this is not: creativity and challenge sort of gets thrown out the window in favor of a basic puzzle concept that starts out pretty neat but ends up far too easy to pose any sort of challenge. It's like the Junior Trivial Pursuit of puzzle games: it'll make you feel proud that you're solving dozens of puzzles in mere minutes, but then you realize the designs couldn't have been made any easier.   So here's the deal: round stars have fallen from the sky. They've lost their rings that give them their power, and without them they can't get back to the sky where they belong. The inhabitants of this planet, conveniently harsh square forms, decide to work together to reunite the round stars with their hoop haloes.    That's the basis for the puzzle: players rotate the playfield in 90 degree increments to shift around the one star (a round ball) as well as the planet's inhabitants (harsh squares) to maneuver the star to the halo positioned somewhere in the level. The idea is to use the game's playfield squares as well as the free-shifting aliens to shift the star around and connect it with the circle. Not a bad concept for a puzzle game, and an interesting take on the classic ~sliding tile~ puzzle idea.      But that's when it becomes apparent that the level designers failed to come up with puzzles that pose any sort of challenge. Most of the dozens of different puzzles can be solved with ten or fewer moves, some completed within seconds. By default the game has an agonizingly slow pace as players rotate the playfield at an awkwardly casual rate - but clearly this speed was chosen to extend the playtime. Luckily in the options menu you can turn up the rate of rotation and burn through the levels without waiting for the animations to catch up with your moves.   The game's ~Story Mode~ ends alarmingly quick, taking barely 20 minutes to plow through the different collection of puzzles. Once it ends you're right back at the title screen - luckily, there's far more puzzles unlocked. Whew. Unfortunately, the difficulty of these puzzles never increase, and it takes very little effort and brain power to solve these challenges simply because the player has only two options per turn: clockwise, or counterclockwise.   Kurupoto at least has a huge assortment of levels, but yeahthe game poses almost no challenge from start to finish. There are a few head-scratchers, but for every one that'll stump you for a couple of minutes, there are at least a dozen where you'll go, ~That was it?~ It's nice to get a little encouragement to try to do the puzzle with the minimum amount of turns: little extras sprout up when you finish a world perfectly. But that's pretty much the only reason to return to a finished puzzle. And once you know the solution, it's not hard to figure out how to do it in the least amount of turns.  It's a good concept burned by unbelievably simple puzzle designs and a pretty stupid surrounding storyline. If you want to feel good about yourself and your ability to problem solve, Kurupoto will make you feel like a mastermind. But don't get a big head when you beat these challenges - a six year old can blaze through this one, too.", "date": "Oct 24, 2007"}
