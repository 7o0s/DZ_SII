Legends of Wrestling II on the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox might not be the top wrestling games on those systems, but they've certainly been given more attention to development time than this absolutely horrific Game Boy Advance version. Terrible graphics and animation compliment the sluggish controls and gameplay of this portable rendition of Acclaim's console wrestling series. There's no question what went wrong: this GBA game obviously didn't spend a whole lot of time in the cooker. Features 40 different wrestlers Exhibition, Career, and Tournament modes Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance   Let's start this game review by mentioning the only real plus of this game design: Powerhead Games, the development team managed to get the full roster of forty different classic professional wrestlers from the console game into the Game Boy Advance cartridge. Anything else? Nope. Obviously, to get all of the wrestlers into this game, the artists were forced to scale down all of the characters into extremely low-resolution, low-color sprites that move in such jerky animations it almost makes the eyes water. At least, I'm hoping they were forced to do this; I'd hate to think that a developer intentionally wanted to make a game that looked this bad. Character sprites have this nasty habit of clipping between each other when they overlap, and the collision detection between wrestlers within specific moves has been half-assedly implemented. Each of the forty wrestlers may have a signature move in their techniques, but the animation is so darn crappy it's tough to tell exactly what move they're trying to pull off.  This terrible attention to art and animation makes it very difficult to see just what's going on in the ring when two, three, or four different wrestlers are going at it together, which makes playing the game an absolute chore since moves are based upon timing a grapple against the other opponents. Or something. Trying to figure out the play mechanics while wrestling with the horrible control and animation is a chore in itself.  The game doesn't even offer a whole lot of options, either. You've got two, three, or four-man wrestling matches, as well as tag team, career mode, and a tournament mode, but the action just ends up being the exact same mess of crappily animated pixels and horrid collision detection. The game doesn't even support any sort of link cable options for multiplayer bouts. You couldn't squeeze any fun out of this cartridge with a vice. This Christmas, there isn't a large choice of GBA games if you're a wrestling fan, but one thing's for sure: you don't want this one. Legends of Wrestling II on the Game Boy Advance is just downright awful, having almost no redeeming qualities as a wrestling title beyond its claim of 40 different, classic professionals in its roster. The game is ugly, clunky, and a chore to play, and should be avoided at all costs.", "date": "Dec 11, 2002"}
