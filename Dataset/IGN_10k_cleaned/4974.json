The 2002 epic, based on the Dungeons & Dragons universe from Wizards of the Coast, sold handsomely. Handsomely enough that many of its ideas are still ripped-off and found in other RPGs today. JAMDAT enlisted the help of developer Floodgate to scale this bestseller down to mobile size and get the jump on the wireless RPG market. Is Neverwinter Nights  the game to launch -- and own -- this genre? Features:Official D&D rulesetMultiple towns & dungeonsStreaming contentNeverwinter Nights  begins with the player creating a character, much like they would if they were playing the classic pen-and-paper game. Races and classes are chosen, stats are ~rolled,~ portraits selected, and appropriate fantasy-sounding names are dolled out. This offers a nice bit of variety right off the bat, as you will really feel like to ~own~ this experience. Will you be a half-orc rogue? A human paladin? A gnome monk?  Fortunately, Neverwinter Nights  then segues right into a tutorial. This lengthy session teaches you the basics of movement and combat, as well as lockpicking and spellcasting. It's very complete -- perhaps even too complete. With lots of text, you may find yourself saying ~I get it already!~ as the game drones on. However, it's still a pretty good idea to complete the tutorial, as the rest of the game draws no quarter. Neverwinter Nights  is a huge experience. There is an impressive assortment of towns and dungeons to visit. Even if they end up looking remarkably similar as the hours go by, there is no way to claim JAMDAT skimped on content. There are dozens upon dozens of weapons and items to pick up, use, buy, and sell. Collect everything you can carry. The game is not particularly free with the gold, and you'll find yourself pawning goods in the shop for the scratch to take home that halberd you've had your eye on.  If you are any sort of D&D fan, you will be pleased to see that Neverwinter Nights  follows the ruleset remarkably well. It also captures the general feel of the D&D universe, with monsters you'll immediately recognize from the Monster Manual and NPC characters that have names that could only be designated and approved by Wizards.  A lot of Neverwinter Nights revolves around you performing basic RPG quests. Go to this dungeon to get this item, take it back to this person, etc. We're all familiar with these fetch quests, and while they would normally bug the heck out of you on a new PC and console RPG, there is a certain amount of forgiveness on the handset. What, you were expected to lead a legion of paladins into battle?  At least there is plenty of combat. Not quite Gauntlet-level combat, but this world is populated with plenty of things to strike down. Combat and spell casting is made very easy by Floodgate's intuitive, one-handed controls. Everything can be done without moving your entire hand around the handset, from targeting that rat to checking your inventory. Neverwinter Nights employs a pretty slick bit of tech to get all of this content on your phone. As a single download, Neverwinter Nights  would have been a monster. Instead, content is streamed to your handset as required. This results in some load times, but it's really not that bad. Besides, you could probably stand to look up for a few seconds before getting back to the adventures of Squinty the half-orc. Your progress is saved on a central server, so should you ever switch handsets, you can pick up right where you left off. This is especially helpful for people that get robbed at the airport and have their phone, iPod, and numerous other items stolen. Ahem.  Floodgate did a pretty nice job on Neverwinter Nights' look. We weren't expecting a drop-dead gorgeous experience, as the game is streamed. But there is a sufficient amount of detail in rooms and dungeons, even if the some detail elements are used over and over again. The biggest problem is that character sprites look awful similar to each other. Neverwinter Nights  sounds fine with a decent assortment of effects for combat. When you are on menu screens, an appropriately lilting fantasy track loops.Neverwinter Nights is a pretty landmark title, what with its huge scope and streaming tech. You will undoubtedly get your money's worth, as there are hours and hours of gameplay in here. However, the lingering Q is whether or not it's your kind of gameplay. If fetch quests and selling unused weapons and items doesn't blow your hair back, then Neverwinter Nights might not be your Bag of Holding. But RPG fans with cellphones will want to DL this game immediately.", "date": "Sep 11, 2004"}
