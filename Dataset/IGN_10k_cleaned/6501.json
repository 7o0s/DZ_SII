However, Disney's duo of mobile Narnia experiences are more than just casual platform games with some movie assets dropped into place and shoved out the front door in time for the box office debut. Both games show significant thought about the source material and what makes a playable mobile game were underway at Disney in the last few months, as evidenced by the 3D edition of Narnia.   Whereas the 2D game is a streamlined strategy game, the 3D edition is an admitted hack n' slash action game with some RPG trappings, like experience points and leveling up for increased stats. The game doesn't advance the ball at all, which isn't necessarily a problem -- what matters most in a game like Narnia is that the inspiration is treated with respect and the game mechanics make sense in its context. Narnia succeeds on both counts.   The game is more action-based than it's cousin Narnia title, and thusly the story isn't an intricately told. However, all of the elements are in place, such as the White Witch, the thawing Narnia, and the presence of all the children. The environments are appropriately fantasy-based -- as are the monsters -- and they look like a decent cross between book and film. Since the book itself deals in fantasy staples, the use of said staples are certainly forgivable here.   The isometric view is sometimes a tough sell in action-oriented games, thanks to the disconnect between what the player perceives as the four basic directions and what the in-game avatar sees. You may want to go up, but in the game, the character steps diagonally -- and that leads to some initial frustrations with movement. In battle, this is sometimes exacerbated due to your desire to concentrate on swinging a sword at a giant, not thinking of how directions in the real world translate to an isometrical one.   There is plenty of collecting to be done in this Narnia, with scattered chests dropping booty when smashed open. A stat-tracking feature monitors level progress and reports back on what you found between ~missions.~ Collecting is an outdated game concept in my opinion, and I didn't necessarily like seeing it used here. In the realm of Narnia, I want all of my attention focused on beating back monsters, not finding that one last chest.   Developer Fathammer has done a solid job creating this 3D rendition of Narnia for Disney. The environments have a nice amount of detail, with snow-covered trees, cracked rocks, and human-made structures. The monsters are decently detailed, too, and possess some fine animation. Some of the special effects are pretty impressive, too, such as flares when you attack. I also appreciated the un-cluttered HUD while playing, with meters neatly tucked into the sides of the screen.  Narnia is 3D is a well-paced action game with some RPG trapping -- but none of the slower pacing that normally accompany RPGs. This will make it easier for some gamers to get into than the 2D game. The isometric view certainly lends itself to better visuals, but the disconnect is sometimes not worth it. However, with more visceral battles (thanks to direct confrontation, not turn-based exchanges), this Narnia stands to garner a bigger audience than the 2D edition. A good game for fans of the source material.", "date": "Dec 10, 2005"}
