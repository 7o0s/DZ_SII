Its concept is so unbelievably absurd and yet so mischievously awesome that it's hard for me to accept the fact that somebody at Konami actually approved this. Keep in mind that this is the same legendary publisher that's brought us decades of classic gaming with such groundbreaking titles as Gradius, Contra, Castlevania and Metal Gear. That's some serious pedigree there folks, so you can see why Rumble Roses' existence is so far out of left field to me. Then again, I just remembered that Konami once released a rhythm game that simulated Tai-Bo with motion-censored wristbands called Martial Beat -- so maybe Rumble Roses isn't so surprising after all.   As for the game itself, it's really quite brilliant. Both in terms of a marketing standpoint and in understanding how to capture primal male heterosexual urges. Imagine for a moment the following scenario: A sick and twisted half-naked scientist has decided to dress up like a nurse and hold an international wrestling tournament for the world's greatest female grapplers. Once the women have entered, the evil doctor then takes samples of their DNA so that she can create a cyborg super-soldier to do her bidding for some unknown purpose. In the meantime, the mad puppeteer has also decided to brainwash all the contestants she's met by turning them into an army of trashy, leglock-giving bad girls with skirts so short they should be called Smurfs. Now tell me, how can this not have Game of the Year written all over it?   If you think I've spoiled something by revealing the storyline then you're looking to Rumble Roses for all the wrong reasons. The game isn't about captivating your emotions with deeply-realized characters, hooking your addiction with nail-biting cliffhangers, or teaching you a moral lesson through carefully orchestrated messages. No, what Rumble Roses is really about is having a good time with some seriously hot polygonal women.   Click For More Images Just how hot are they? Well they're pretty damn convincing. Made up of more than 10,000 polygons each, the 22 available wrestlers are meticulously detailed from head to toe and put the WWE SmackDown! vs RAW divas to shame (no seriously, even their toes and fingers have been individually rendered). More subtle touches such as birthmarks and tattoos are literally scattered all over each of the women's bodies, and the inclusion of realistic cellulite, natural crevices and curves, and plenty of bouncing and breathing animations all come together for embarrassingly lifelike results. If you didn't think you'd ever do a double-take when looking at a scantily-clad female computer model, think again.   Part of what makes Rumble Roses so fun to look at, though, (other than the obvious) are the utterly ridiculous getups that its characters love to flaunt. All the different adolescent fantasy fetishes have been covered here too, whether it's the cheeky blonde deputy in chaps or the nicely-tanned Brit in full Candy-Striper garb. Naughty schoolteachers, rebellious schoolgirls, and an S&M basket case make their way into the mix as well, and each of them are complete with their own list of moves, taunts, and finishing maneuvers.   Making things even more interesting is the fact that each of the girls has their own unique intro that runs the gamut from tantalizing to bizarre. Want to see a hot dancer shake her money maker? Load up Aisha's intro and do it. Would you rather watch a ninja girl stand on top of a giant frog before doing flips into the middle of falling flower petals? Then go ahead and do so with Bloody Shadow. Regardless of who you choose, though, the chance is strong that you'll laugh and be entertained. Some of the intros are even environmentally-specific too, giving you a different ring walk on the beach than what you'd see in a conventional arena.   If Rumble Roses were a bad game it would be a lot more difficult to accept its zany concept. But that's how Roses might surprise you. Because unlike Tecmo's Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball (another lighthearted skinfest that I felt was seriously under-realized), there's an obvious diversity between characters. Anesthesia plays completely different from Aigle, and Lady X and Evil Rose are about as different as you can get. Though some of the ladies do share a few similar moves here and there, it's a great feeling to be able to choose whichever character you want to get a different experience.    What's more is that the matches themselves turn out to be a good source of fun thanks to Yuke's customized SmackDown engine. So while it may feel somewhat familiar at first, there are still a few key differences that make it an entirely different experience. For starters, it's a lot harder than SmackDown is (on Normal and Hard difficulties anyway, Easy is still a pushover) and the reversed button settings will take some getting used to for THQ vets. The countering system has been somewhat changed too (only one button for both strikes and grapples), but the timing is a lot less forgiving than in the WWE product -- which makes the game a lot more offensive minded. There's also a few other subtle little changes like the inclusion of three different finishers instead of two (Humiliations, Lethals, and Killers), a modified limb damage system, and a four different weapons to choose from. It makes for an engaging two-player experience and one that will illicit as many laughs as it does naughty contemplations.   Unfortunately Rumble Roses does have its own share of problems. Despite each girl having her own unique moveset, for example, their offensive arsenal is nowhere near as elaborate or varied as in other wrestling games. So while using each girl will indeed be a different experience, you'll likely have performed all their moves by your second or third match in. The gameplay options are rather limited too, with nothing more than Story Mode and Exhibition to sink your teeth into. At least the Exhibition set has a couple of variants, though, (title challenges, mad mud matches, and regular fights) and they do incorporate a unique VOW system that changes the face or heel alignment of your character. Unfortunately for a group bigger than two, Roses doesn't go beyond one-on-one in terms of multiplayer and there aren't any cool extra options like tournaments, rule modifications, or the like. You probably won't play it for long after a week or so.   Reiko Rocks! Vocal Nazis may also take umbrage to the fact that the audio is somewhat sub-par -- so while the licensed soundtrack offers up tunes that fit each girl quite effectively, their poorly executed voice acting and occasional premature scene changes may rub you the wrong way. It does have a somewhat B-Movie charm to it, though, which means that it at least counts for something.   I would like to point out that I found the lack of online play as a positive, however. As it would have been incredibly weird to sit down in front of the television set, hook up to the Internet, and play some other buxom babe on the other side of the country only to learn that his name is Chuck and that he's a baritone. It kind of ruins the illusion. But maybe that's just me.If rolling around with 22 beautiful women sounds like something you'd like to do between Jak 3 and San Andreas then by all means pick up Rumble Roses. It's one of those rare games that manages to capitalize on the whole sex appeal thing without sacrificing the gameplay along with it. Sure it may not be as deep or realistic as SmackDown or Day of Reckoning (and it's feature set leaves a lot to be desired), but if a good laugh with mature themes is what you're looking for, it's a much more involved choice than Vivendi's Leisure Suit Larry. And despite all its audaciousness, it's a lot more subtle too.", "date": "Nov 9, 2004"}
