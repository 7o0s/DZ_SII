The shocker is that when we first played it, the game seemed to have some problems and it really appeared lackluster and kinda dumpy.   Well, after putting in several good hours with Future Cop in both single and multi-player, we have to say that EA has a winner on its hands. This game is fun and propels you to keep playing deep into the night.  The basis of Future Cop is that you're a super-powered, futuristic mech packed with multiple weapons and faced with a mean set of enemies who are taking Los Angeles county down city by city. Normally, as a cop, you would take a bunch of cop cars down, helicopters, and the lot, and a huge media scene would ensue, and you'd have a real problem on your hands. Heh. Not here. You're a one-man team fully equipped to blow the snausage out of anyone who even looks slightly evil.  The game is made up one single-player missions, but also takes into account gamers' needs for multiplayer dogfights. Players can choose to play in either cooperative mode, or head to head, in a strategic, realtime battle of territorial domination and destruction.  The camera angles are interesting, because they are set in isometric views, but they jump close or pan wide depending on the area you have opened or have walked into. Occasionally, they simply don't follow you under bridges and can be a little annoying by moving too close, but on the whole, they're quite unobtrusive.  Future Cop supports both the Analog and Shock aspects of PSX gaming, and the two-player mode is set up in split-screen. This game made a huge leap from its alpha stage to the final version, and now I am totally enamored with this it. Not only do I love the two-player mode (which I'm still not very good at), but because of EA's extra effort, the game has this whole other area to get good at. And because of its strategic nature  turning beacons to your side, sending out convoys of tanks, etc, and invading the enemy base  it's really like a completely separate game. The first-person mode actually grew on me because the control is now far more tuned, and the sound effects are all in place, and are crisp, quick, and right on target. When little bad men with guns try to shoot at you, and you turn to torch them with a stream of flame, they light on fire and run until they die. They yell, they slow down in pain, they turn into crisp little nuggets, and it's beautiful. The whole package is there. Great sound effects, good single-player action, tons of non-stop shooting, lots of great weapons, massive explosions, and a super two-player mode. My only complaints? Occasionally, the camera angles don't follow you under bridges, and walking across little, tiny winy bridges is more difficult than it should be. And maybe, you might get a little too carnage-crazy by the last level. Like you might look at your dog a little differently. I know I did. Still, I love this game.", "date": "Sep 17, 1998"}
