There's just so many of them. Within 10 minutes of starting the game, you actually feel assaulted by the shear amount of contraptions in need of starting, doors in need of opening and buttons in need of pressing. You run into dials with imprinted zodiac symbols and machines covered in alien symbols. After tinkering around with levers and switches for an hour or so, I started wondering when the puzzles would take a back seat to a little dialogue or character development. After all, this is an adventure game, right?   Back in the early 90s, the term ~adventure game~ referred to something specific. It described a graphical journey - an interactive novel in the truest sense. You controlled a central character through an adventure where brains won over brawn, and where quality of narrative seemed paramount. Back then, game developers focused their creative energies to forming memorable personas and intriguing storylines, with puzzles to supplement the overall story arc. Nowadays, it seems developers have reveresed the formula, with the ~adventure~ part of a game merely supplementing the puzzles.      This isn't to say all current adventure games suck. But I wonder if they deserve to carry the same label as Sierra classics like Space Quest 4: The Time Rippers and Quest for Glory 3: Wages of War. It seems as though the modern adventure game plays out like a string of arbitrary puzzles, loosely held together by bits of story. Such is the case with Aura: Fate of Ages.   Although advertised as an adventure game, Aura plays like a puzzle game with traces elements of adventure thrown in. It plays like a Myst clone. The story here is decent, yet relatively short and simple. You assume the role of Umang, a gifted student within a clan of ~keepers,~ a group of elders in charge of guarding four mystical rings. These rings have the power to transport people to new worlds. And, much like the ~linking books~ in the Myst series, the rings even have the power to create worlds. Not surprisingly, the ~keepers~ are very protective of their prized possessions. Should these rings fall into the wrong hands, the wearer could whoop loads of ass.   Umang finds himself trying to keeping these rings from Durad, the game's villain. He's up to no good and you need to stop him. In order to do so, you need to bounce around four worlds, or ~vaults~ as they're called, trying to collect artifacts. The rings won't activate without them. Along the way, the story dives into subplots. Some of these narrative bumps were slightly interesting, but most were inconsequential and did nothing to change the pacing of the game.       Frankly, the story sounds like it's been ripped from any number of RPGs or other ~adventure~ games of the last 20 years. Unlike many RPGs, however, the story fails to gather much momentum or sense of urgency. The game never reminds you why you're saving the world. It's not as if you're saving your family or a basket full of sleeping kittens. At least the game doesn't mention it, anyway. Most of the time, it feels like you're the only person alive in the entire universe. Umang lacks any kind of genuine attachment to other characters in the game. Plus, It doesn't help that he's a bland guy to begin with. Poor Umang has the personality of a tree stump.   I suppose it's ok, then, that Umang spends most of his time alone solving puzzles. As was stated earlier, the developers behind Aura: Fate of Ages have crammed an insane amount of puzzles in the game. Apart from a brief note found in the first world you visit, the game doesn't give much by way of direction. The note states you need to find a man named Grifit, and then it's off to the (cerebral) races. The first batch of puzzles will frighten all but the most hardcore of puzzle fans.    Initially, they made me feel like a kid sitting in the cockpit of a jet - so many buttons to press and levers to pull, but no idea where to start. The game does help by supplying a hint journal that records each hint you encounter in the game, but hints were often as confusing as the puzzles. One such hint depicted a secret passageway hidden beneath a statue. Finding the passage was simple but had nothing to do with the sketch in the hint journal. In another instance, you need to activate a machine with the help of a diagram. Only problem is, the diagram in the journal confuses you just as much as the actual machine you're trying to start.   A series of arbitrary actions - pulling a lever here, turning a knob there - solved half of the puzzles in the first area of the game. This simply shouldn't happen. People shouldn't be able to access limitless power by closing their eyes and letting blind luck take over. Thankfully, this isn't possible later in the game, unless you've got lady luck drugged and chained in your basement. Having said that, many of the puzzles actually make sense. And some of them even toe the line dividing mediocrity and brilliance. Aura features many different kinds of puzzles too.    You'll come across puzzles that require inventory items, some that call for symbol manipulation, while others require a bit of arithmetic. Unfortunately, the game also includes musical puzzles. Simply put, the musical puzzles will rip your mind apart. During these dark times, in which I tried solving the game's symphonic mysteries, I would glance longingly at the Aura walkthrough. Did I succumb to temptation? No, I actually solved the damned things. They aren't as heinous as the musical puzzle in Journey to the Center of the Earth, but there's a good chance you'll exhaust your lexicon of profanity trying to solve it.      I think Aura trys to balance the horrors of brain mutilation with sweet visuals, because this is one pretty game. While each environment in the game looks different, each draws inspiration from the marriage of nature and technology. You'll come across snow-capped mountains flecked with bridges and mechanical platforms. You'll walk through fluorescent jungles full of zany contraptions. You'll even hitch a ride on flying machines and dart around alien skies. The puzzles themselves spring to life with beautiful animation. Solving a puzzle will often ignite a pyrotechnic display of light, and each puzzle, regardless of difficulty, features seamless animation that helps immerse you in the game world. The pre-rendered backgrounds look crisp and display an immense amount of imagination and care.   While lacking the narrative drive seen in classics of the genre, Aura: Fate of Ages nonetheless stands out as a solid entry. Is it a Myst clone? Yes. Does it feature pre-rendered stills and sparse music? Yes. Do some of the puzzles warrant detonation of the mind? Definitely yes. Still, what little Aura does to advance the genre it does remarkably well. In an age when encountering logical puzzles is as rare as pooping out gold nuggets, Aura shines as a game that attempts to bring a little reason into the mix.", "date": "Jul 1, 2004"}
