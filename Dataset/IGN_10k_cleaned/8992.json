Mario and Sonic engaged in quite a bit of mudslinging way back in the day, but now co-exist as allies on many of Nintendo's systems.   Another rivalry that was arguably as influential in videogames was the one that existed between Capcom and SNK, with the former's Street Fighter series squaring off against the latter's Fatal Fury games. Street Fighter garnered the most mainstream popularity, but Fatal Fury's followers are as diehard as they come, and have recently enjoyed a resurgence of their favorite fighting series in the form of Fatal Fury: Battle Archives for the PlayStation 2, and this week, the release of Fatal Fury Special on Xbox Live Arcade.   Originally released in 1993 in arcades and subsequently on the uber-expensive Neo Geo, Fatal Fury Special comes to Xbox Live Arcade fully intact. Contrary to other classic re-releases, Special hasn't gotten much of a facelift. Backgrounds and character sprites have been smoothed out a bit, but not compared to recent titles such as Streets of Rage 2. Of course, part of the appeal of classic games is the ability to play them in their original, pixilated glory. That being said, Fatal Fury Special doesn't look too bad, especially when pitted against several of XBLA's much older titles, many of which arguably required a graphical overhaul in order to be semi-playable.   The gang's all here. More vital to the game's rebirth is the option to have a small portion of the screen dedicated to a player's move list for the character of his choice. Gone are the days of printing out FAQs detailing each character's special moves. It should be noted that IGN did not have the chance to play Fatal Fury Special on a standard, 4:3 ratio television, so whether or not the tips display on these sets is unknown. Widescreen users need not fear the move list taking up too much valuable real estate, as even though a fourth of the screen is dedicated to the vertical panel, the rest of the playing field is large enough to properly showcase the battles. However, it should be noted that no move lists are displayed during multiplayer sessions, whether locally or over Xbox Live, so players are advised to turn the ~tips~ off via the game's settings, as the vertical panel will still take up space, sans move lists.   One of Fatal Fury's strategic appeals is the ability to brawl on two planes of play. By pressing Left Bumper, characters can jump into the foreground or background, which is useful for dodging melee attacks and, even more so, projectiles. Simply pressing this key is the only positive facet of FF Special's control scheme, though. The problems do not lie within the game itself, but rather with the fact that the Xbox 360 controller's d-pad is just not suited to 2D fighters; in fact, I don't believe the d-pad to be suited to games in general.   Players who have access to Hori's new Fighting Stick EX2 will enjoy more precision in the execution of special moves, but a flaw seems to exist in the stick's architecture: The Left and Right Trigger assignments cannot be altered. The game's four primary attack buttons can be easily assigned to X, Y, B, and A, but the Left Bumper, which switches between the game's two planes, is near the top of the controller, which means quite a bit of reaching to activate this sometimes integral fighting mechanic.   Good luck efficiently executing special moves with the 360 controller. Multiplayer, the core of any good fighting game, exists in Fatal Fury Special by way of de facto standard Player and Ranked matches. I enjoyed a relatively lag-free experience in my online play sessions, but discovered something rather aggravating when I invited a fellow editor to partake in a few local matches--there is no local match option. Remember back in the glory days of arcades, when ~winner stays, loser pays~ was manifested literally by way of the winner being unable to select a new character? Yeah, that's the case here. It's not a big deal, but really, would it have been so difficult to add an actual ~Versus~ option?Fatal Fury Special still represents excellent fighting mechanics, but the Xbox 360 controller's d-pad will cramp any fighting fan's style every time, the analog stick was never meant for 2D fighters, and Hori's new stick will, for whatever reason, not allow the Left and Right Triggers to be remapped. The question should not be, ~Is Fatal Fury Special still a solid fighting game?~ because that's an easy answer: Yes. Rather, potential buyers must determine whether they're willing to spend five bucks on a game that's so darn hard to actually play. If you've survived playing Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting with the 360 controller, then you'll probably manage Fatal Fury Special just fine--meaning, as well as can be expected.", "date": "Sep 6, 2007"}
