The White Wolf property is back again on Xbox with Hunter: The Reckoning Redeemer which actually does a lot to live up to its name. The redeeming qualities of this latest action-slasher from High Voltage include improved graphics, new characters, weapons and abilities. The improved story and engaging cutscenes drew us even deeper into the game's universe where an invisible war is going on between evil forces and the few humans among us who can see (the Hunters) their dastardly deeds. Apparently the development team at High Voltage must've taken the comments about the addictive gameplay to heart, because very little in the way of gameplay has been improved for this latest edition of Hunter The Reckoning. Four-player madness is still fun but it just didn't blow us away this time, mainly because you can only be pleasantly surprised by an unheralded game once.   Gameplay In Hunter The Reckoning Redeemer you control one of five characters or Hunters --gifted humans who have the ability to see and fight supernatural threats-- from a third person perspective with an arsenal of attacks at your disposal. Each character has a basic melee attack, a ranged attack, an edge (magic) attack and the ability to pick up limited use weapons you stumble across in the environment. The more you utilize a particular kind of attack the sooner you'll upgrade and level up in that ability. Getting stronger in one particular area is good way to reward your gameplay style, but the smart player will makes sure his or her melee, ranged and edge abilities are all boosted so you they can handle any situation. Whether you're playing alone or with three other players, the game asks you to manage your abilities and enemies in the environment so you'll always have an advantage when things get hectic.

Get The Guide | See Other Guides  The combat system utilizes both analog sticks so you can be moving and attacking in different directions at any time. Also reloading and weapons switching is designed to put you at huge disadvantage where you're extremely vulnerable. Handling a flood of enemies can be handled without problems, but it's going to take more than just button mashing.     The different characters come with different abilities and default weaponry that lend themselves to one type of gameplay or another. The big biker badass Deuce is the plodding Avenger and excels at thwarting swarms of enemies with his swinging axe, 12-gauge shotty and Edge abilities that merely enhance his ass kicking abilities. Samantha Alexander wields a katana and a revolver and is known as the Defender. Father Esteban Cortez is the Judge and wields a broadsword and crossbow to smash evil. Cassandra is the quick hitting youngster known as the Martyr who wields dual pistols and knives. The new character is the Redeemer, poor little Kaylie who's teddy bear went a little loco in the original Hunter The Reckoning. She's selectable from the get-go in this new game meaning you'll have different characters to play with. You'll learn to identify each Hunter by his or her function (Judge, Martyr, etc.) since the game refers to them as such and not by his or her name.       At times, you can find yourself frustrated by Hunter's guidance system or lack thereof. Not knowing where to go or what door you're supposed to double back through will lead to more pointless wandering than you could want and that's only magnified when you've got four player who don't know where they're going. A more intuitive level design or something to help players along would've been nice.  Hunter is designed to be played by four players plain and simple. Solo gamers who pick this up as a rental or play a few minutes at kiosk will miss the point and dismiss the title as mindless hack and slash. When you get a whole crew of players utilizing the strengths of each character and managing powerups intelligently you get plenty of fun. Redeemer improves over the original by throwing a ton of enemies at you at a time and many of them aren't just fodder this time around. Leaping attacks ranged attacks and super tough armor characterize the second and third tier category of enemies in Redeemer. The corporate soldiers look like something out of ~Jin-Roh~ when they rappel down out of nowhere and line you up with their laser sights. All enemies attack from locations off screen and from behind with such frequency that you have to keep your wits about you, even when you're playing with friends, and don't hang out near the edges of your TV screen unless you're ready for a fight. This includes the mini-minibosses that'll be thrown in to the mix of foot soldiers being thrown at you.   To balance the number and more aggressive nature of the bad guys in Hunter the pickup weapons like miniguns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, flare guns and submachine guns come with plenty of ammo and there's no reason for your party of Hunters to be low on ammo. The trick is to use your default attacks as much as possible and only bust out the pickup weapons when you don't have time to pick 'em off one by one. Using edges like the healing ability the Judge gets when he's powered up becomes crucial when you're playing with friends. Otherwise the game quickly degenerates into a greedy race to see who can find --and drain-- the health and armor power-up stations the first. The Judge and Avenger have the most powerful offensive edge attacks --at least early on-- so it makes sense to keep them filled with plenty of edge energy. You definitely get some interesting group dynamics when you're playing Hunter with friends and really that's the only way you should play this game, because it's genuinely entertaining.     The presentation of Hunter The Reckoning Redeemer is an unfortunate mix of good and bad. The cutscenes are very well done and will get you drawn into both this pen-and-paper RPG universe as well as the story itself. But then there's the lack of voice during gameplay so that dialogue comes up as pop-up window when you approach a character and hit a button. There's literally a conspiracy involving the evil powers that be of big business that compares favorably to what you know from Resident Evil. It's just unfortunate that so many clues and lines of dialogue pop on generic looking windows.  Graphics Redeemer looks a lot better than its predecessor on Xbox with sharper-looking characters and environments. The camera is still automatic and slightly improved which is also a good thing. The monsters in the game look outstanding which is crucial, considering the role they play in the game. Each one is distinct and will be recognizable the instant you see them jump down into the gameplay area from wherever monsters like these happen to live. The only problem we had with the environments would be the interactive segments that can be smashed or blown up. They just don't look right.       Your crew of Hunters will carry their default weapons on their person while pickup weapons, once acquired, hang out in that same nether-dimension where cartoon characters keep mallets, anvils and firecrackers until you're ready to bust them out. When you level up in your melee or ranged attacks the weapon itself changes its look so that Deuce's axe will look different whether it's in his hand or strapped to his back.   The animations of the game are pretty good for the most part but there are still some problems. Lopping off heads and limbs of soulless zombies is good enough, but when they keep staggering around, you're really compelled to feed them some more punishment. The basic fight combo system yields some interesting fight sequences when you get a good five or six hit run going. Each slash and step is distinct. The trouble comes up when you change direction utilizing the right analog stick.  Your characters ~snap~ to the four positions (North, South, East and West) on a circle surrounding him or her, even though the aiming will be more precise than that. That is if you're pressing up and you quickly lean the right analog stick to a 4 o'clock position, the character will instantly snap to a position that has him or her aiming at 3 o'clock with no transition animation to get from 12 to 3. The capper is, when your fire a shot or unleash a melee attack, it will be aimed in the 4 o'clock direction just like you want.  This dissonance is a bit frustrating especially when everything else about the way the characters move is well done.   Sound This is one area of the game that could've made a huge difference in the way this game is received. Considering the basic nature of the gameplay a truly immersive audio experience could've added a lot of depth to the presentation. Instead, everything sounds relatively thin and the weapons sounds are nowhere near authentic. There are sound effects on most everything but we just wish they were better.    The music seems like it wants to be interactive where it kicks in with fast paced guitar whenever you're in a battle but upon further review it really seems random. Or at best there's a program running that asks whether or not it's okay to play random song X at a particular point in a game, the answer comes back yes, and next thing you know you're rocking.   The weapon and critter sounds are a tad disappointing mainly because they all sound so similar. There are different kinds of assault rifles that all sound too similar for our taste, especially considering they're popular models used in all videogames. This isn't a Tom Clancy game, but we need some better indication of the power of an M4-like assault weapon versus the power of the Steyer AUG-like rifle. They both flatten enemies, but one should at least sound different than the other. The only distinctive monster sounds come from the female zombie-vampires who screamed like banshees when you even spit at them. More haunting monsters and more distinctive weapons sounds, not to mention better Dolby Digital surround sound implementation, would've helped tremendously.  Hunter the Reckoning Redeemer is a fun game that definitely should be played with friends. Of course, every game is more fun playing with buddies whether in person or online (now there's and idea!), but really this is the way Redeemer was meant to played. It's an upgrade over the original, but I'm not sure if it's enough of a boost to justify another purchase if you're not a true diehard fan of Hunter the Reckoning. The game does what it set out to do; it just wasn't trying to do too much more than the original Hunter the Reckoning. Improved visuals and new goodies certainly count, but there's a next level for this series that Redeemer just doesn't reach. Improving on the Gauntlet multiplayer concept was one thing with the original Hunter, but now that we've seen they can do it, there needs to be more.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
