My many admirers, stalkers and relatives already know that I practically grew up in my dad's comic book store back in Greensboro. But what some of you may not know is that I was a pretty big Spider-Man fan. I had the underoos and everything. Anyway, right about the time of Marvel's Secret Wars, Venom was introduced and I lost interest in most things Spidey. Then a few years later Kraven killed Spider-Man, became Spider-Man, then killed himself and then Spider-Man came back to life and became, you guessed it, Spider-Man. That's when I started to get interested -- or at least confused enough to start noticing.  All that is to say that I'm into the whole Spider-Man thing. And, to a large extent, I'm also into the whole Spider-Man game thing. While the timing of the release (anticipating the movie by just a few weeks) might seem driven by little more than opportunistic marketing, the developers' hearts are in the right place. True unbelievers, beware; Spider-Man is a labor of love that's got style in spades. Everything about this game's style is just about perfect. (We'll get to the ~just about~ in a sec.)  This 3D action game places you in the role of Spider-Man in all his four-color glory. You'll swing between towering skyscrapers, wrap hoods up in layers of your webbing, battle super-powered baddies, explore a labyrinth of sewers and generally rescue the city from the forces of evil. And all this while trading quips (some humorous, some appalling) with the best of them. When Spidey comes up with humorous names for the Shocker (Quilt Man and The Cushion are my favorites), you'll know you're going to enjoy the ride.  The voice acting is pretty good as well. Tobey Maguire handles the Peter Parker/Spider-Man bits and Willem Dafoe provides the voice for the Green Goblin. Tobey's parts aren't as arresting as Willem's but they serve the story well enough. None of the other actors from the film are in the game but the voice talent recruited to fill out the rest of the cast is quite good.  The real show stealer has got to be Bruce Campbell's awesome performance in the tutorial (and at odd moments during the game). He talks you through the controls of the game and the scripting and delivery here is almost worth the price of admission alone. When Bruce cuts out of the tutorial to go grab a sandwich, you'll know exactly what kind of fun you're in for. There are a lot of other gems here but I won't spoil any of them.  But those are just trimmings, right? I mean, style is a fabulous asset, but it doesn't necessarily make a great game. Fear not; Spider-Man is strong in the gameplay department as well. Featuring a dazzling (and slightly overwhelming) arsenal of fighting combos, thoughtful level design and a good sense of pace, Spider-Man tempers its style with a generous dose of substance.  To be fair, this is a console-oriented game and keyboard control is poor. Poor isn't the word that appears in my notes, but it's one I can print at least. You'll definitely need a gamepad to try this one out and, while the game comes with several preset configurations for popular controllers, you'll probably want to remap your controls. I experienced a bit of glitchiness with the Sidewinder and Firestorm pads, but nothing catastrophic in intensity or frequency. The game does away with the consoles' easy control option altogether but, given the greater effectiveness of the enhanced control schemes, this is perfectly fine with us.  Spidey has access to so many moves it's almost intimidating. Fortunately the game introduces you to each move gradually as you discover new combos during the game. (This also strengthens the game's lasting appeal, as you're encouraged to go back through and discover the combos that you miss.) The range of fighting and webslinging moves is impressive. While the basics of combat are enlarged with inventive (and individually useful) combinations, the cool web powers are even handier. You can wrap up enemies in webs, shoot webs at enemies and even surround yourself in a webbed dome that explodes outwardly stunning enemies who happen to be near.  The approaches to be taken in each level are also pretty varied. Personally, I'm a bully (ask Tal) so I was glad to see that a brute force option was present in most situations. The game asks you to act stealthily in a few key sequences but it's not always necessary (or even expedient). Better still are the aerial sequences. Spidey spends a lot of time chasing bad guys, duking it out with bad guys or chasing bad guys then duking it out with them, all while soaring a hundred stories in the air. The webslinging itself is sublime and you'll find that you'll take to it just as readily as most other game interfaces.  Unfortunately for Spidey, I spent far more time fighting the camera than fighting his enemies. This is really the only downside to the game but it's a big one. If that were fixed, I'd be able to recommend the game unreservedly, despite some of its other weaknesses. The camera comes in two modes -- active and passive -- and both are equally frustrating. (Again, frustrating isn't the word I used in my notes, but the word I really used isn't printable.) Where a game like Max Payne succeeded in letting you run around cramped environments in third person mode, Spider-Man fails. It's more akin to the camera used in Legacy of Kain.      In other words, the camera doesn't reorient itself behind your character soon enough. You can change your facing and run towards the camera and it still won't slide around behind you. This same sort of problem can be encountered when Spidey moves between a wall and a ceiling. Unless you give the camera second to adjust, your movement controls will be inverted. Some of my coworkers here at IGN (I hesitate to call them ~friends~) have suggested that I cut Spidey some slack. After all, when a game runs from warehouses to sewers to air vents to Grand Central Station to swinging high above the city, the camera has to accommodate a lot of different needs. To them I say phbbt. That's no excuse for keeping me from seeing what's in front of my character.  Fortunately for you and your sanity, Spider-Man's can recover from falling off the numerous buildings and catwalks included in most of the levels so the camera problems aren't openly fatal. It becomes a bigger problem when you're chasing an enemy through a maze of corridors, buildings or other obstructions in the levels. Finding the guy with the thing that you need to get to progress to the next level is more difficult when you're constantly looking behind your character. Occasionally your Spidey Sense will alert you to a danger that the camera isn't showing you. In theory it's plenty helpful. In practice, it's just irritating.  An alternate solution to this problem is to provide cutscenes to indicate what the danger is and where it's coming from. For the most part, these are pretty helpful although they tend to slow the game down a bit when used too frequently (the entrance to the subway is a good example). The cutscenes might be better rendered using the game engine, as their conventional CG look is kind of a disconnect for me. (Much like the excessive parentheses in this review...)  And all the requisite Spidey locales are recreated here. You'll have to fight criminals in large warehouses, explore icky sewers (complete with rats!), race up burning wooden towers and save security guards in the middle of Grand Central Station. On most of these levels, you can use Spidey's freedom of vertical movement to your advantage. There's hardly a level that doesn't have some sort of catwalk, ledge, overhang, pipe or some other kind of object high overhead. You can zip up to the ceiling and use height to scan around for an enemy to jump on.  As great as those levels may be, they pale in comparison to the large, outdoor city levels. Swinging among the skyscrapers of Treyarch's ersatz Manhattan is one of the Holy Grails of gaming -- delivering an experience that's immensely enjoyable, instantly comprehensible and containing just the right ratio of fun and believability. The buildings are all drawn in an utterly convincing scale and the draw depth is simply astounding. You really believe that your swinging over a real city. The traffic below you, the traffic helicopters darting around beside you and lots of variety among the buildings keeps it feeling real. It's all so believable that, after a while, you stop wondering what the other end of Spidey's web is attached to.  What makes this even better is that the game runs quite well even on the low end of the spec. A P500 with a GeForce 2 will have some stuttering problems unless the details are taken down a bit. Strangely the game still looks awesome in 640x480 with low details. At least, it looks good compared to the console versions. This is even true in the levels with lots of extra objects -- like grenades or rain, or raining grenades.  What did you think of Spider-Man?  In terms of replayability, the game is a bit like Tony Hawk. You earn points for the completion of certain tasks within the missions but you also earn style points based on how you played. If you use a wide variety of moves and combos, your style score will be higher. These points can be used to ~purchase~ cool extras in the game's ~secret~ store. I say ~purchase~ because you don't actually spend any money and ~secret~ because they tell you about in the manual. Spider-Man is an altogether satisfying game, despite its notable flaw. It sustains excitement nearly all the way through with enough variety thrown in to keep you interested past the first few levels. Faithfulness to the spirit of the license (if not the letter) is also a big strength. Spidey achieves this success in much the same way as Jedi Knight II -- it takes everything that's cool about a license and makes it part of an otherwise enjoyable game. The two compliment each other quite well here.As good as he is inside, Spider-Man really shines in the open air. So many of the game's minor problems are reduced to near insignificance in the outdoor levels and it's a wonder that more of the sequences of the game didn't take place out of doors. I suspect that this type of action would tend to get monotonous but it's so much more satisfying than the indoor levels.It's easy to recommend the game to anyone who's already interested but the small irritations will tend to put you off if you're not already enthusiastic about the idea of playing as Spider-Man. Ultimately, if you've got the choice, it makes more sense to go with the Xbox version. (We PC pariahs weren't included in the so-called head to head feature about the different console versions.) But if you're a die-hard PC gamer who won't (or can't) bother to play the game on the Xbox, then the PC version will definitely satisfy. Just be prepared to deal with the frustrating camera.", "date": "Apr 29, 2002"}
