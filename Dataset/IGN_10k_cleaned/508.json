The boys and girls at Metropolis Software House chose the former option, creating Odium using elements from the turn-based strategy, adventure, and role-playing styles of gameplay.  Though this title can't be ranked among the truly great, it's still worth its salt in more than one area.  Players assume the role of Lieutenant Cole Sullivan, commander of a team of specialists sent in to investigate reports of mutants in an abandoned city.  An earlier team sent to look into the same reports has vanished, so it falls to you to find out what happened to them as well.  The orders at the beginning of the game are just as simple as they sound here, but you'll find yourself leaving the normal and expected behind soon after the adventure begins.  Evidence of a conspiracy abounds as you recruit new members to your team and listen to their tales of horror and deceit.   Enemies are staggering both in appearance and number, and they'll be doing anything they can to change the color of your nifty green fatigues into a particular shade of red.  Thankfully, you'll be armed to the teeth with everything from a simple bayonet and pistol to flame throwers and laser-guided missiles.  However, you must use your wits just as much as that army surplus if you hope to survive.  He who shoots first will find he doesn't get the chance to ask questions later.  Traveling through game environments is handled through a 3rd person, mostly isometric viewpoint system.  From this main screen, you can move your team from place to place, as well as investigate, manipulate, and acquire objects from the surrounding area.  Things or places of interest are usually designated by a flashing cursor, or from the item flashing itself, so identification is as simple as possible against the highly detailed background.  One thing that isn't so simple is trying to take a peek at the entire area you currently inhabit.  The mouse driven interface only allows you to scroll a couple of inches out of the visual range of your military party.  This may have been implemented to facilitate some realism regarding how much you should be able to see if you were actually in that party.   However, this would have been more apparent had the developers incorporated some sort of line of sight system into the game, since while you're viewing range is restricted, the view itself is not.  Objects behind buildings, fences, wrecked helicopters or anything else remain plainly visible.  Also just a tad annoying is the tendency of the screen to snap back to center immediately after pulling the cursor away from the edge of the monitor.  Though certainly not a terrible flaw, it makes clicking on areas you wish to explore, or items that you want to pick up, which lie outside the centered view of your characters more tedious than it should be.  All gripes aside however, the environments themselves are nicely drawn, character animations are very fluid, and the atmosphere presented is ultimately quite captivating.  Moving away from the general adventure theme of walking around, talking to people, and finding new things, it is in Odium's battle sequences that the other genre mixtures come to light.  Like many other RPGs out there, this title doesn't allow you to see your enemies on the main screen in battle mode.  Upon reaching what seems to be specifically programmed points on each game screen, the interface loads briefly and then switches into battle mode.  The environment here is a very similar, yet still noticeably modified version of the one in which your characters were just walking.  However, movement and item usage here is subject to a grid system, far apart from the previous area.   Each member of your team has a specific range of movement allowed to them for every turn, and is also permitted to perform one action.  Using an item or firing a weapon are common actions, but taking a defensive posture and putting up your guard is another option.  It should be noted that characters can trade items with one another without the loss of their opportunities to do something further, but their distance apart from one another must be at a minimum.  This takes some strategic planning and can end up forcing you to move characters to undesirable positions just to exchange items, so getting all members of your party in top form before entering a battle is much more recommended.    Attacking enemies also involves some strategic elements, since each weapon has a specified attack range.  For instance, a pistol must be fired in one of the four cardinal directions and has a range of about 4 to 5 squares (with diminishing chances to hit and damage the further you are away), while a rifle can be aimed in any of 8 directions and can hit targets about 6 to 7 squares from your position.  Some weapons can also be used to stun or tranquilize the enemy, making it easy to contain their movement and finish them off.  Furthermore, the battlefield itself can be useful at times whenever boxes or explosive barrels of gasoline are present.  Moving containers around, or luring monsters into the blast radius of the explosive you're going to shoot on the next round can be most helpful.  Though most battles revolve around simply annihilating every opposing force on the screen, there are also times where it is necessary to protect a certain being or object from harm.  These types of skirmishes warrant different tactics and can be difficult enough to demand a few repeats of the scenario.  I don't know how many times I thought I was winning a battle only to have a new enemy stroll onto the screen and, on the following turn, finish off the person I was trying to protect.  Proper positioning of your troops and wise use of weapons and ammunition can alleviate a lot of this stress, but tragically you will most often be unaware of the proper strategy to use until after you have already failed once or twice.  Throughout all types of battles, your characters gain experience.  Every time an enemy is hit, the team member responsible gains some further ability in the weapon used, and is also awarded general experience.  Killing a creature seems to grant the most reward, but a character could conceivably play through the entire game without actually dispatching a single monster, and still be comparable in levels to the others so long as he was continually damaging enemies along the way.  One thing that sets Odium apart from the general mold is the fact that you don't have to wait until the end of a battle to tally up XP.  If a character reaches a new level during combat, that member's ability screen immediately slides into view (halting the battle) and allows distribution of the newly acquired skill points into whatever categories you wish.  This allows for instant gratification as the benefits of rising in level are realized at a moment when it really counts.  More hit points can be added, percentage chance to counter-attack can be raised, or any of several other abilities can be augmented, and it all happens right then and there.  It's truly a wonderful feeling to see a character level up just as he was about to get put down by the next enemy hit, allowing for the few extra hit points necessary to send it packing on the following turn.  Ah, the subtle pleasures of gaming...  Moving on, the sounds in Odium are often just as cool as the sights.  Eerie, yet upbeat music tracks play throughout the adventure screens and are accompanied by real speech conversations between your party members.  Voice acting is actually rather well portrayed and does a pretty good job of creating personality amongst the individuals in the team.  On the battle side of things, equally good music is present and the effects are also well done.  In fact, some of the, ahem, ~gutting~ sounds seem so accurate that it's just downright painful.  Some of these just make you cringe upon hearing them, and that's definitely a good sign.  On the whole, Metropolis has taken ingredients of a few different genres here and mixed them up into a better than average omelet.  This title makes you think and then shoot...then shoot again.  Any fan of strategy or RPG games would be well served to give this one a shot, but pursuers of the true adventures such as Tomb Raider or Soul Reaver may not get as much of a kick out of it as they'd hope.    -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
