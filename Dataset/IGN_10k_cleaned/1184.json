In the past Titus has both succeeded and failed with their superhero franchises. The Saffire-developed Xena: Warrior Princess, Talisman of Fate is actually a decent game, but Superman, which was butchered in-house at Titus fell just short of being quarantined from all homes. The good news is their new title, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, falls somewhere in the middle of those two. The title was developed by an outside contractor, Player 1, and doesn't have any of the atrocities of Superman.   The Facts   Take control of the legendary heroes Hercules, Iolaus, and Serena the Golden Hind as they travel the land in search of magical artifacts to stop Ares from completing his diabolical plans Utilize the unique attributes of each character. Hercules' strength allows him to pick up various objects to hurl at his enemies; Iolaus' nimble nature allows him to reach places inaccessible to Hercules; and Serena's accuracy with a bow makes her ideal for taking out opponents at long range.  Solve puzzles and complete quests to gather the magical artifacts needed to stop Ares Twelve unique fully 3D worlds to explore in ancient Greece.  Journey from the sunny seaside town of Porticus to the snowy mountains of Alpsius.  Explore the bandit-overrun forests of Traycus or heavenly Mount Olympus Complex combat system allows your characters to sidestep and block enemy attacks Fight for your life against terrifying monsters in five different arenas such as the Minotaur's Labryinth Collect potions to unleash powerful magic upon your foes. Enlist the aid of characters found in the hit television series such as Salmoneus and Aphrodite   Gameplay The game starts out like most other by introducing the story line. Set in a mythical period at a time when the gods were unmerciful and plagued mankind with suffering, the game's plot revolves around the poisoning of Zeus, who held the throne. Hera poisons an elixer that Zeus drinks; thus, willingingly commiting herself to be a part of a plan devised by the evil Ares -- Hercules' brother and son of Zeus -- to seize the throne and rule the land. Zeus becomes ill, and the struggle for power ensues. These events transpire unnoticed by the rest of the gods who merely sense an imbalance in the godly plane of existence. At which point many gods flee to the mortal plane to investigate the reason for the disturbance, therefore causing turmoil for the mortals on Gaea. After searching to no avail, most gods give up. But Hercules, who has a strength like the world has never seen, challenges the corrupt gods, for his strength is only surpassed by the power in his heart.  Then the adventure begins. As Hercules, you awaken in your master Cheiron's training stable. This is the tutorial mode where Hercules learns all his basic skills needed to start his adventure. The tutorial mode is relatively simplistic. Cheiron teaches (via text, and not voice unfortunately) Hercules how to pick up and kick objects, climb ladders, and fight. The level is designed as a training ground only, and should be played completely or you may find yourself confused. While the control system is fairly intuitive, there's a few special moves that cannot be discerned without the help of this tutorial mode or the instruction booklet.   The developer has implemented a very Zelda-esque control scheme. ~A~ serves as an action button, and depending on if you're standing next to a rock or ladder it may have ~grab~ or ~climb~ printed on top of the blue button which is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. As well there is added control depth such as when hercules has to lift up very heavy objects by picking up the rock and then tapping ~A~ repeatedly. The ~B~ and ~C-left~ buttons are used for physical combat, and punching repeatedly will result in left-right-uppercut combo move. The rest of the buttons are as follows: the ~R~ shoulder button is jump, ~Z~ positions the camera behind Hercules, ~C-down~ activates a block stance, ~C-right~ creates a first-person camera viewpoint, and ~C-up~ activates a spell menu. Once the spell menu is activated you see four different spells available and then you can use each C-button for a different spell. You don't really earn spells, though, you buy them from someone in the town you are visiting. And, the money for those spells is earned by defeating characters and finding treasure chests  the latter method is suggested.  Navigating the ancient lands won't be easy at first, though. The camera system is very unrefined, so you must constantly tap the Z-trigger to keep the camera steady behind you. It's very first-generation, and one of the game's major flows. Player 1 should have tried to implement the entire Zelda: The Ocarina of Time control scheme as they drew much inspiration from the game. The levels are very big, though, so there's a lot of exploring to keep you busy. The downside is that the level designs are a tad repetetive, and it really becomes tedious when you have to trudge your way through thick muddy waters. Your character actually slows down a great deal, and after making your way through a few of those you'll be just about as exhausted as Hercules himself.   Later on in the game you are asked to take letters places, find certain objects and keys. It's a very RPG-like aspect of the game, but the title falls short in execution. The map system is merely a drawing with a flashing Hercules head. It tells you of your general vacinity, but the actual direction your facing or what the names of the areas are you're not clued in on. This makes it very difficult because you may find yourself searching and going back and forth throughout the rather large levels looking blindly for whatever it is you must find. For instance, in the first level you must find a key. There's about 12 character to talk to, but most are simply placed in the game for comedic relief or pure amusement. Only one character gives you a hint as to where to find the key, and then when you seek it out the character that holds the key is still cracking jokes about needing his teddy bear for battle. Whether you have to provide this character with a teddy bear to obtain the key from him is your wild guess.   The game also features other playable characters which you later need to climb vines that would snap under Hercules' weight and crawl under tiny areas that Herc' is to bulky for. The overall gameplay has a lot of potential, but it seemed as though Titus was rushing Player 1 to develop the game quickly.  Graphics The first thing you're going to notice is how much this game looks like Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. The textures on the walls are nearly identical to those used in Zelda, and there's even plants in the game that were uprooted right out of Hyrule itself. It's that eerie. Of course, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't help the game be unique in any way. However, the level design, lighting, and overall texture use falls short of the Nintendo's 1998' blockbuster hit. Hercules just doesn't have the polish that is apparent in Zelda. This is the negative aspect of the game  players are going to compare the title with Zelda and feel ultimately put out. The game engine is pretty solid for being third-party, though, and deven in the face the game's nice visuals and  large levels the title manages to keep a steady framerate most of the time.  Sound The cheery Olde English-inspired tunes of Hercules will offer some pleasure for ye' ears, and the stereo surround sound will keep you oriented so baddies don't come attacking you from behind with zero notice. The sound does change from level to level, and some are even catchy enough to whistle at, but they can't help but sound very engineered and rushed. The N64's insistance on MIDI sound certainly doesn't help, either. The clings and clangs of swords, the wooshing of waterfalls in the distance, and the occassional ~hey~ or cackle from a character helps keep it ineresting. It's always a pleasure beating a jester senseless and giving him something serious to laugh about. In the end, the sound serves its purpose, but you won't find anything here that will make you say ~wow~. This game has a lot of potential and some good ideas, but it falls short in the execution. The mythical title seemed to be another one of Titus' franchise priorities where emphasis on time-to-market is the priority, not the gameplay. There was some really good opportunities to incorporate puzzles and character interaction, but most characters end up being comedic relief instead of a major help. Although, some of the character's sayings and mannerisms will provide you with a giggle or two. The things I would have liked to see added are deeper character conversation, real voice-overs, and more complex puzzles. It's rental-only, so I definitely recommend you  pick it up and give it a try. It is heavily inspired by Zelda: The Ocarina of Time; everything from the graphics, textures, menus, and soun is very reminiscent. So you'll get a kick out of just that much, but if you're looking for an intriguing adventure game you probably wont' be satisified. Again, though, it's at least worth the $1-$5 rental. Especially considering the recent drought of N64 titles.", "date": "Aug 23, 2000"}
