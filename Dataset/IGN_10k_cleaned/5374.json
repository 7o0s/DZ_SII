The game is based on the Xbox Live title of a similar name, and includes many gameplay facets from its console cousin -- namely, drive real fast and cause lots of havoc.   Midtown Madness 3 Mobile comes in two flavors, too. The 3D version of game is nearing completion for Smartphones, but the top-down 2D edition is currently available for play on Sprint PCS. We recently received a download of the game and put it through a solid test drive. Is it a trip worth taking?   Features:   Set in Paris  Drive multiple cars such as ambulances and minis  Two career modes  Checkpoint or Blitz races   Midtown Madness 3 Mobile isn't the first top-down racing game based on a console title we've played. This summer, Sorrent released a go-go edition of DRIV3R as a companion piece to Atari's console game. It was mighty unfortunate for Sorrent that Atari's game, well, sucked. For many gamers, it will be difficult to see the DRIV3R name on their download decks and separate Sorrent's good game from the crap-tacular source material.   Midtown Madness 3 Mobile doesn't have that problem. The Xbox Live game was good, and thusly, this mobile edition isn't too shabby, either. Is it as fast and advanced as the upcoming 3D edition we've played? No, but for lower-tech handsets, Midtown Madness 3 Mobile provides a fun driving game with oodles of game play options -- all of which are entertaining.   The game offers two career modes, where you can either play a series of ambulance missions or make a series of frenzied delivery runs. These modes are the meat of the game, but might we recommend a different approach? Start out by playing the two race modes: Checkpoint and Blitz. These frantic races will give you the grand tour of the city and introduce you to useful shortcuts that make the career missions much easier.   Checkpoint races lead you on a fast race through Paris -- a pretty decent rendition of the city, too -- where you must cross a series of flagged points first. Blitz mode is roughly the same, but instead of needing to hit the checkpoints in order, you can pursue them in any order. This is when you'll really start learning optimum routes and shortcuts to use in career mode.   The two career modes are good, goofy fun. As the ambulance driver, you must head out into the city to pick up sickies and bring them back to the hospital at the edge of town. While out and about, you can pick up bonuses by running over newspaper stands and other destructible objects. The deliveries missions have you darting all over the city to make timed drops.   One thing that DRIV3R does better than Midtown Madness 3 Mobile is offer two different control options. Midtown Madness 3 Mobile does not dangle directional control in front of you. You are stuck with pressing forward to accelerate, back to brake, and left and right to turn. Because you are not always facing north, it sometimes takes an extra half-second of thought to discern which way to steer. And that's just enough time to slam into a wall and lose precious speed.   Midtown Madness 3 Mobile does offer a map of the city at the bottom of the screen which uses a series of colored dots to display your next goal. The map is, for the most part, extremely useful. However, it is as slightly inaccurate. For example, there is a north-south road on the right side of the city that does not appear on the map. When you drive down this road, it looks like your vehicle is driving through the big nothing on the little map.   Midtown Madness 3 Mobile looks pretty good. The Paris map is colorful, detailed, and features some nice canals and landmarks. The different vehicles also look reasonably different from each other, which is a nice touch considering a lot of handset racers just like to re-skin vehicles with new paintjobs. The scrolling is smooth, and even more important, accurate. At no point does the map get too far ahead or lag too far behind as you race to your next goal. Midtown Madness 3 Mobile also features a nice selection of little jingles and sounds.Midtown Madness 3 Mobile is a successful adaptation of a console game because instead of attempting (and failing) to recreating the look of advanced hardware, it settles on nailing the essence and atmosphere. This game feels like a Midtown Madness title. The missions are silly, the vehicles are varied, and little touches of driving mayhem are just like the console game.Midtown Madness 3 Mobile also offers you several game play mode, such as the racing events, which mean a better value for your download dollars. This is something I like to see just as much as good graphics because, if you're like me, your cellphone bill is big enough as it is without beefing it up with lame game downloads you burn through in 30 minutes. Midtown Madness 3 Mobile is something that will stick with you for some time, and for its smart longevity and good game play, it deserves a serious look when it comes time to buy your next game.", "date": "Dec 4, 2004"}
