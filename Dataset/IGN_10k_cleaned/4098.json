RPG kingpin Squaresoft raised eyebrows when it dabbled in the shoot-'em-up genre with Einhander, and when Blizzard announced that it would briefly abandon the Real Time Strategy breed of games to cook up StarCraft: Ghost it did the same. And while Jester Interactive may not be as notorious as the creators of Final Fantasy, fans of the MTV Music Generator series should be equally surprised to see the small development team tackling a new genre: racing.   Super Trucks Racing approaches racing from a less-than-typical direction, aiming to recreate the excitement of real super trucks racing, a genuine racing league that pits beastly big rig trucks-sans trailers, of course-against each other on Indy-style paved race courses. Forget any automatic associations with trucks and dirt; Super Trucks Racing is a fusion of semis and closed-circuit track racing.   Gameplay  Boasting six modes of play (five available immediately and one unlockable), Super Trucks Racing has enough to keep gamers busy for a while. The standard lineup of single race, championship, and time trial modes are present, and all are pretty rudimentary. Choosing the single race option gives access to all of the unlocked race courses, and sets up single event races that have no consecutive significance outside of setting lap records.   Championship mode features five different events each comprised a number of courses. Only the Rookie event is available from the onset, as the more difficult championships become available upon the completion of the previous ones. Before beginning any championship mode race, the option to immediately practice a course is available, and it's actually a really convenient option. Instead of forcing players to save championship progress, exit the mode and enter a practice run from the main menu, Super Trucks Racing gives the chance to quickly test a new course, and even gives the option of running a set of qualifying laps to earn pole position in the championship race.    The option to earn a better starting position is definitely a welcome one, compared to the plethora of racing games that automatically stick the player in last place. Though the time spent running qualifying laps can easily add up to more time than the actual championship race, the improved starting position can definitely be a bonus in the higher difficulty racing events.   The addition of an arcade mode seems almost pointless, mimicking many of the qualities of the championship mode while imposing time limits with checkpoint, ala Sega's Daytona series. There's also a two-player split-screen that runs smoothly, though it only runs single races, sadly reserving the championship mode for single player sessions.   To add a touch of replay, an unlockable survival mode is available that copies the ~knock out~ races of modern Need for Speed games, where a pack of trucks continue to race a course, with each lap eliminating the last place racer until there's just one remaining. It's a nice attempt to increase the length of the game, though it can't make up for the brevity of the championship mode and the simplicity of the multiplayer game.    Let's be honest-when it comes to racing games, the most important aspects are the controls and physics. Luckily, Super Trucks Racing handles both departments with a definitive air of competence, tackling a sim-style of racing not terribly unlike Sony's Gran Turismo series. No wacky power-slides or incredible collision antics appear in Super Trucks Racing, and for fans of the sport (there've got to be some, though I'll admit I never met 'em) the purity of the racing is a breath of fresh air. Despite the brute muscle of these trucks, racing boils down to precise turning and braking, lining up corner apexes and maximizing speed into the straights.   An interesting touch of authenticity makes its way in the form of an unfamiliar control option. Outside of the basic gas and brake buttons, Super Trucks Racing also sports a ~brake cooling~ button that weaves into gameplay more than expected. Every time the brakes strive to stop one of these behemoth racers they get heated up. If the brakes get too hot they'll quickly become less than useless, making the brake-cooling feature an essential part of any race. The brake cooling uses up a limited storage of water that slowly drains the more the brakes are cooled, forcing players to balance the temperature of their rigs' brakes while navigating the tight turns. It's a unique play mechanic that, at the very least, keeps the racing a bit more interesting, and adds a touch of realism that super trucks fans will likely enjoy.   Of course, the option to disable the brake-cooling element is available, along with a slew of other options, including vehicle tuning. Super Trucks Racing's vehicle tuning has a surprising number of options, though none of the customization will affect the visuals of the trucks. Also, the in-game effects of the tuning are limited as all of the trucks, despite boasting different speed, acceleration, and handling attributes, drive pretty much identically.    Given the general level of competence displayed by Super Trucks Racing, it's disappointing that the game is so boring and dull to play. The speed of the game is just plain slow-even at speeds of 120MPH these trucks don't look to be scooting very fast at all. The course designs keep the pace of the game even lower, with tight hairpin turns that would pose a challenge to any sports-bred super car, not to mention what havoc they wreak on these multi-ton big rigs.   And while the fifteen courses look to be modeled after real-life race tracks, the flatness of the levels only makes sure that the level of excitement stays minimal in Super Trucks Racing. At least the game supports most of today's popular steering wheels, though. Sure it's still somewhat barren, but it's made a little more forgivable when you have a turning mechanism to hang onto.   The bare-bones presentation of Super Trucks Racing also handicaps the exhilaration of racing. The minimalist menus and little cohesion between championship races drain the game of any urge to keep playing, though with unlockable courses and trucks, die-hard fans of super trucks racing (as a sport) should find plenty to keep their attention.    Graphics  Another area of the game where Jester Interactive proves their ability is in the graphics of Super Trucks Racing. The most rewarding aspect of the game's visual appeal is the rock-solid framerate that stays super smooth in both single player and split-screen races. It's obvious that a lot of time was spent in making the trucks look authentic, as the truck models are smooth and meticulous. Details right down to the specific sponsor stickers weren't forgotten and the game even sports robust visual damage. Collisions with walls and other racers often result in the dropping of body panels, and while the vehicles never get too bashed up-no broken windshields and the like-the effect definitely lends itself to the authentic feel of the game.   Considering these strengths, it's a shame the racing environments don't comparably stack up. The racecourses are generally bland and flat, with static mosaics to represent crowds, and equally repetitive texturing that covers the stages. There is a good deal in visual variety between the various courses, but the bland style of each individual course just adds to the already dull and boring feel of the game. Combined with the fact that all of the trucks look virtually the same aside from their colors and sponsor stickers-some models are indeed different, though the difference is hardly apparent during actual racing-the unflavored repetition and stagnancy of the environments hurts the game by failing to infuse it with an ounce of excitement.   Sound  Unfortunately, Jester Interactive's limited staffing (there are just three people credited with the actual development of this game) had an impact on the quality of the game's sound. Sound effects, while individually okay, miserably blend together during racing, as the soft roar of the engines melts into the cheer of the crowd, which smothers the intricate sounds the trucks create as they careen through the courses. Even with the repetitive and completely forgettable music-ironically from the creators of MTV Music Generator-turned off, few of the sound effects are crisp and bold enough to stand out from the others, creating a sort of constant ~racing noise~ that just murmurs during gameplay. There are thankfully no painful sound effects, but there's likewise nothing that stands out in a positive way.With an already huge library of PS2 racing games, theres little reason for casual fans to look to Super Trucks Racingits definitely not a thrilling racer, and this lack of excitement is what ultimately hurts the game. However, any fans of the super trucks sport should definitely give the game a spin. With a budget price, its hard to go too wrong, and itd be easy to do much worse than Super Trucks Racing. The game is definitively competent, and competence is just about all it has to offer to race fans seeking a quick thrill.", "date": "Nov 1, 2003"}
